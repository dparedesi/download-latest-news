Russian president Vladimir Putin wants to hold as much territory as possible. Photo: AP Just imagine this scenario. An aggravated burglary has taken place and your children and belongings have been taken. The leader of the pack agrees to stop assaulting you – if you let them keep what they have already taken. They may consider permitting you to install enhanced security measures in the future. Incidentally, life is hell for Ukrainians in Crimea. “Special measures” and tribunals have been set up to deal with any dissent. How did we get it so wrong? Daniel Smith, Blackrock, Co Dublin America is winning the war in Ukraine. Russia spends 7.1pc of its GDP on defence, double the US level. Russia has suffered a million casualties; the US arms industry is booming as Europe re-arms. Nato is buying US equipment to send to Ukraine. Russia has lost half its foreign income from oil and gas. The longer the war goes on, the more Russia is weakened and America is strengthened. John Doherty, Gaoth Dobhair, Co Dhún na nGall Reports of Donald Trump’s Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin, conducted not over hard diplomacy but filet mignon, halibut Olympia and green salad, ought to chill Europe more than amuse it. What is at stake is not the menu, but the spectacle of two men deciding the fate of Ukraine without Ukraine present (‘As Trump bows to Putin, Europe must prepare for the worst’, Irish Independent, August 18). The wider danger lies in the precedent. If borders and sovereignty can be redrawn in a dinner meeting, international law is reduced to table talk. The extrapolation is clear: once this becomes an acceptable mode of negotiation, other authoritarian leaders will be emboldened to test the same weakness. The prediction is bleaker still. A Ukraine carved up in Alaska may be only the first course. Moldova, the Baltics, even Taiwan, could follow as Moscow and Beijing take note of Washington’s willingness to appease under the guise of expedience. Europe, then, must prepare for the worst. To dine with Putin is one thing; to digest his terms is quite another. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Watching world politicians waffling reminds me of what the British parliamentarian Pitt the Elder said: “There is something behind the throne greater than the king himself.” John Finegan, Bailieborough, Co Cavan The recent death of actor Terence Stamp reminds me of his wonderful performance in the movie Far From The Madding Crowd. Sad indeed that fellow actors in that movie, Peter Finch and Alan Bates are also since departed. It’s nice to note that the female lead, Julie Christie, is hale and hearty at 85. Indeed by his own admission, singer Tony Christie was so impressed by her, that he adopted her surname. Is there a greater compliment? Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Fionnán Sheahan writes that should former minister Heather Humphreys decide to enter the race for the Áras, she might be called on to explain “why she stepped away from politics” recently (‘Heather Humphreys is a better candidate but Simon Harris is a liability to campaign’, Irish Independent, August 18). One thing is certain, the response from the Monaghan woman will be straight and true. The office of president is “above politics”. And rightly so. Though there are those who have lost the run of themselves while holding high office, causing no end of concern for our “ordinary” political masters, as well as for the people they represent. Another contender, it’s been widely reported, has expressed “distrust” of the UK, France and Germany ­recently. Not a great start for an aspiring head of State. The incumbent has been known to “cross the constitutional boundary” more than once during his almost 14 years in the Phoenix Park. Let’s hope the next holder of the “highest office” maintains some apolitical equilibrium, save for those times that necessitate presidential intervention. Peter Declan O’Halloran, Belturbet, Co Cavan It was worrying reading last week that a study found that for under-18s with eating disorders there was a 121pc rise in hospitalisations between 2018 and 2022 – from 170 admissions in 2018 to 375 in 2022 – with a sharp spike during the pandemic. Eating disorders are complex ­medical conditions that not only affect the young person concerned but also their loved ones, family and friends. It strikes me that wraparound care is essential, requiring an increase in investment at a national level. Not every treatment will work successfully for every person that presents at a hospital, or is diagnosed with an eating disorder. If any reader, or professional working with young people, wants an insight into this issue, I strongly recommend Evanna Lynch’s memoir: The Opposite of Butterfly Hunting. It is a harrowing, haunting, honest and unflinching account, and yet a beautifully crafted read that reflects the author’s own journey with an eating disorder that she ultimately overcomes. Let us hope these figures do not continue to rise. Stephen O’Hara, Carrowmore, Co Sligo The recent attacks on members of the Indian community are abhorrent. They are also, as noted by many commentators, puzzling, as the ­Indian community continues to ­contribute so much to Irish society. The fact that they are puzzling does not make them more abhorrent. All racist attacks are abhorrent, regardless of whether the target community contributes economically or not. Chants of “Get them Out” at anti-immigration protests may legitimise and encourage these appalling attacks. We all need to be careful with our language and not tolerate any racism, taunts, slurs or “jokes”.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs: Bitcoin Adoption Grows But Success Comes With Risks

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/18/2025 8:33:53 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Quote of the week: “Bitcoin is a remarkable cryptographic achievement, and the ability to create something that is not duplicable in the digital world has enormous value.” - Eric Schmidt, former CEO and executive chairman of Google. Back in December of last year, we mentioned how institutional adoption of Bitcoin could change the narrative. It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: vpintheak Re: "Verifying Bitcoin transactions - That's how it works" It takes roughly 10 minutes to mine and distribute each new Bitcoin. If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise. Specifically - the only winners will be the guys who convert their Bitcoins to fiat currency - BEFORE the whole thing stops. 9 posted on 08/19/2025 3:50:05 PM PDT by zeestephen (Trump Landslide?

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson It seems that the narrative is playing out. Since we wrote that piece, we now have endowments, corporations, and the U.S. government openly allocating capital to bitcoin (or at least planning to). So this week, we’re going to look at the regulatory changes, how adoption has been trending, and one of the risks with the ETFs. Bitcoin Adoption Grows Considering it’s an asset that is only 16 years old, Bitcoin is still viewed by many as speculative. However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise.

He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise.

However, it’s sitting at a $2.4 trillion market cap as of this writing, making it the 8th largest currency in the world, just behind the Hong Kong dollar and just ahead of the Taiwan dollar. In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012).

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson In the US, the more favorable regulatory climate and increasing federal budget deficits have probably encouraged investors to review its potential in their portfolio as a store of value and inflation hedge. Owning a form of money that has a pre-determined supply cap and is decentralized in nature does have its benefits. Let’s start with what’s changed in the U.S. regulatory landscape. U.S. Wants To Be Crypto Capital Of The World The regulatory shift in the U.S. this year has been swift and material. Here’s what has happened so far: 🏦 Banks can now custody digital assets The SEC rescinded SAB 121 (Staff Accounting Bulletin), which was a major deterrent for banks to custody BTC for clients. Now though, they’re allowed to custody digital assets for clients without having to classify them as liabilities on their balance sheet (i.e. no need for 1:1 cash reserves). 🌬️ Policy tailwinds Two Executive Orders, the Anti-CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) ban and the Strategic Reserve Act, signal an explicitly pro-Bitcoin posture and institutionalize government BTC holdings (at least their seized coins). Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently tweeted about how they plan to accumulate more bitcoin. 📜 Legislative momentum Crypto Week was big, with House passage of the CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC acts being the most comprehensive congressional movement to date. The GENIUS act is now law, with agency rulemaking next. ⏳ What’s pending The BITCOIN Act (The strategic reserve) and the Anti-CBDC Act still need Senate action; watch committees & markups . Research by River The thing to note here is that t he se developments are removing major compliance barriers, giving institutional allocators less cause for concern in adding small Bitcoin positions to their portfolios. One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight.

Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise.

One year ago, the regulatory tone around Bitcoin was “proceed with caution” . Today, with all the above changes, it’s “come on in, the water’s fine.”And investors are taking that invite. This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

This probably helps explain why the bitcoin ETFs have been the best-performing ETF launches in history. 📈 ETFs Surpass Every Historic Benchmark Some analysts believe that the bitcoin ETFs are going from niche product to portfolio staple . The performance of the ETFs in just 18 months would indicate as much. The publicly listed players who have issued these ETFs, like BlackRock , Fidelity , Wisdom Tree , Franklin Templeton , and Invesco , will all be happy, some more than others. According to Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, BlackRock’s IBIT reached $80 billion AUM in just 374 days (by July 11th), which is 5x faster than the next fastest ETFs to hit that threshold. IBIT AUM compared to other successful US ETFs - Eric BalchunasA month later, by the 15th of August, it hit $91b in AUM. He was also a guest on Onramp’s podcast recently, and he listed a few statistics just to emphasise how well IBIT and the other ETFs have performed: 👶 IBIT is the youngest among the biggest ETFs. While IBIT is the 20th largest ETF in the US by AUM, the next youngest ETF in that top 20 list is 12.5 years old (both IEFA and IEMG launched on Oct 18th, 2012). He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody.

Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

He said it’s like a toddler hanging out with teenagers. 💸 IBIT is BlackRock’s most profitable ETF Reports show that at $52b in AUM, charging a 0.25% management fee, it was more profitable than its flagship S&P 500 ETF (IVV), bringing in around $187m in revenue. Eric made the comment that at $90b (which it just reached), it’s BlackRock’s most profitable ETF of all 1,100 that it has globally. 🥈 Bitcoin ETFs are nearly as big as Gold ETFs Across the 11 US-listed bitcoin ETFs, their assets under management are currently sitting at $154b , which is just shy of the $179b sitting across the US-listed gold ETFs , yet gold ETFs have been around for about 20 years. Given the similar trade rhetoric of store of value and inflation hedge, gold seems to have some competition hot on its heels. 🏢 >1,600 different institutions already own these ETFs. Eric mentioned that across all the Bitcoin ETFs, there are about 1,600 institutional holders (those who manage funds >$100m have to file a 13F). Comparatively, he said other ETFs launched in January 2024 have roughly 10-20 institutional filers each. All of this is to say two things. Firstly, these Bitcoin ETFs have transformed Bitcoin’s accessibility to investors. They provide operational simplicity, deep liquidity, and audit-backed legitimacy without the friction, complexity, or risks of self-custody. Secondly, institutional investors are clearly interested. Eric mentioned that big institutions typically move more slowly because they need big volume and legitimacy before they initiate positions. The fact that there are already 1,600 institutional holders after 18 months is impressive. SOURCE: BITWISE While some institutions are completely happy owning a security that gives them exposure to the underlying, others want to own the real thing themselves for the many upsides of self-custody. We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

If it took 10 minutes of massive computer power, plus huge electricity costs, to verify every transaction at my bank, it would be bankrupt in one business day. Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week. What happens if it drops 25%, and "Pool Miners" start turning off their hugely expensive, transaction verifying, computers? To my eye, this looks like a "Last Man To The Exit Door" enterprise.

For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust.

But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight.

We will talk more about that next week! Now, while the momentum is bullish for now, we need to point out a pretty large risk present with this trend. ⚠️ The Custody Concentration Risk Is Real Most U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs trust only a handful of “qualified custodians” to guard their bitcoin. Coinbase Custody is the main player here , holding roughly 81% of ETF bitcoin assets and working with 8 of the 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, including heavyweight IBIT . The rest go their own way: Fidelity ( FBTC ) uses Fidelity Digital Assets VanEck ( HODL ) custodies with Gemini ARK 21 Shares ( ARKB ) uses BitGo ✨ The problem here is that when one custodian holds that much of the market’s bitcoin, you’ve got a massive single point of failure .If Coinbase were hit by a cyberattack, a technical outage, or a legal freeze, multiple ETFs could face delays in rebalancing, redemptions, or coin transfers. Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Plus, bitcoin custody isn’t FDIC insured. It relies on private insurance and comes with its own operational quirks. If something did happen, moving tens of billions to new custodians is no quick swap. It would involve KYC checks, fresh audits, and wallet whitelisting. Basically, it wouldn’t be an overnight project, and it would put serious doubt in investors' minds about the suitability of these products, or even the bitcoin itself. Thankfully, it isn’t these custodians' first rodeo, and they’ve taken many measures to minimise them, including: 🔒 Segregated trust accounts:Where assets are bankruptcy-remote from their main businesses. 🏦 Cold storage & audits:Custodians emphasize offline storage, mul ti‑party approval workflows, SOC‑audited controls, and even NYDFS oversight. So while custodian concentration is a non-zero tail risk , strong legal structures, controls, insurance, and an expanding roster of custodians do help to reduce the probability or severity of losses from custodian-related failures. 💡 The Insight: Many Are Treating Bitcoin Like Gold In Their Portfolio With relaxed U.S. regulations, unprecedented ETF adoption, and institutional buy-in, Bitcoin has grown in legitimacy. Many are treating it similarly to gold in their portfolios. For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Besides personal financial anonymity, I see no other advantages to a Bitcoin economy. People keep telling me I need to read this book or that book. If someone like me cannot understand a financial system without reading entire books, that is a huge barrier to general acceptance. Bitcoin has dropped 10% in value in the last week.

For example, the Harvard endowment is buying both Gold and Bitcoin .It recently disclosed a position in IBIT, but it also initiated a position in SPDR Gold Trust. The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

The bitcoin position is a 0.2% exposure of their fund, which means it’s “market neutral” (Bitcoin’s market value is 0.2% of global assets). So if you’re also concerned about inflation or currency weakness, Bitcoin’s value proposition and history make it a compelling exposure. But remember: Portfolio sizing matters!If you do decide to add any of the ETFs to your Portfolio , make sure your position sizing makes sense for your financial goals, objectives and risk profile. For those concerned about the custody risk we mentioned, you can spread your exposure across ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , and HODL because they’re held at different custodians. If the bulls are right, a small position could help protect against further currency debasement, similar to gold exposure. If they’re wrong, though, the cost of holding a very small 1–3% position is not catastrophic.

Δ UBS strategists wrote this in a Monday (Aug. 18) note in which they said private credit lenders are becoming an important source of capital for the industry, Bloomberg reported Monday. Private debt loaned to the technology sector increased by $100 billion over the past 12 months, reaching a total of $450 billion, while business development companies’ tech lending leapt from $80 billion to $150 billion, the UBS note said, per the report. The demand for this capital is driven by tech companies’ spending on AI data center construction and other AI development costs, according to the report. “This phenomenon could sustain significant growth plans for AI and other hyperscaler companies, sowing the seeds of an upside scenario and increasing overheating risk,” the UBS strategists led by Matthew Mish wrote in the note, per the report. Microsoft said in a July 30 earnings report that its capital expenditures are projected to exceed $30 billion in the first quarter to meet the rising infrastructure needs driven by strong demand for cloud and AI. During the fiscal year ended June 30, Microsoft opened new data centers across six continents and now has more than 400 facilities in 70 regions. “We continue to scale our own data center capacity faster than any other competitor,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during a July 30 earnings call. PYMNTS reported July 15 that Google, Meta, Blackstone and Coreweave are planning to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build AI data centers, as the arms race heats up to build the computing power needed by this advanced technology. A month earlier, AWS said it would spend at least $20 billion to expand its cloud computing and AI infrastructure in Pennsylvania. In March, xAI and Nvidia joined a $30 billion AI infrastructure project called the AI Infrastructure Fund, which is backed by BlackRock, Microsoft and Abu Dhabi AI investment group MGX. Microsoft and BlackRock launched the fund last year to raise money to construct data centers and find sources of power for those facilities.

August 18, 2025 16:50 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (Nasdaq: FFAI) (“FF”, “Faraday Future”, or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today announced its financial results for its second quarter 2025. The Company highlighted several key metrics that underscore both the operational execution and financial position, as well as its significant progress in its FX brand and product development. The Company also provided an update on subsequent events, FX Super One MPV reveal, “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy, and its outlook for the remainder of 2025. SUMMARY The Company made meaningful progress in operations, strengthened its business and financial fundamentals, and advanced the strategic execution of its AI-driven mobility roadmap. FF held its first FX vehicle launch event by unveiling two groundbreaking global-first products, the FX Super One EAI-MPV and the FF Super EAI F.A.C.E. System, alongside the FF EAI Embodied AI Agent 6x4 Architecture, in Los Angeles on July 17, 2025. The non-binding reservations for the FX Super One topped 4,000 units by the end of the quarter, and increased to over 10,000 units as of July 31, 2025, suggesting strong potential demand for this vehicle, underscoring the effectiveness of the B2B2C co-creation sales model, and reaffirming FF’s mass-market strategy. FF also received recognition from Mariah Carey, the best-selling female artist of all time, by including both the FF 91 2.0 and the FFZERO1 concept car in her latest music video, and who will become a new owner of the FF 91 2.0 Futurist Alliance. FF’s Hanford plant has completed production and delivery of the FF91 P20 model and continues with subsequent vehicle production. Additionally, FX Super One has officially entered the parts procurement and production preparation phase at the Hanford factory, moving into trial production. Additionally, the Company officially released version 2.00.58 of FF 91 via OTA, completed FMVSS testing for FX, and submitted a patent registration for the Super One EAI-Face product. The Company looks to supercharge its workforce by adding additional jobs in the coming years, as it plans to ramp up its new FX vehicle program, which is targeted to begin assembly in Hanford by the end of 2025. This development will enable the delivery of high-quality career opportunities. Additionally, Faraday Future plans to invest an additional approximately $100 million into its U.S. operations in the next 9-12 months, with commitments to research and development, and infrastructure, subject to securing the necessary financing. In capital and investor relations, FF was added to the Russell 3000 Index—a key milestone that enhances FF’s visibility and credibility among institutional investors, analysts, and the broader market. Top-tier international fund managers, Vanguard and BlackRock, continued to increase their holdings in FFAI, with both firms growing their positions by over 500% by June 30, 2025, compared to Q4 2024. Internally, FF launched and started executing its 10b5-1 executive stock purchase plans, reflecting FF executives’ personal commitment to the company’s future and aim to align management’s interests with stockholders. FF also secured approximately $105 million in new cash financing commitments, subject to certain closing conditions, which will support the launch of FX Super One, and accelerate development and distribution efforts for the FF and FX brands and AI-related technologies. FF also achieved a key milestone in the Middle East during the second quarter by completing the handover ceremony for FF’s new facility in Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone, further advancing FF’s presence across the Middle East and North Africa region. On the operational side, FF strengthened its execution by welcoming back its Founder, YT Jia, who rejoined the Company this past quarter as Co-CEO. His leadership will further drive both operational and capital fundamentals while reinforcing market confidence. In addition, FF implemented continuous improvement measures across the Company, which have already delivered significant results in cost reduction, efficiency gains, and streamlined operations. RESULTS FOR SECOND QUARTER 2025 In summary, the quarter reflects measured progress in advancing financial discipline and operational execution. FF continues to allocate resources to its most critical priorities, while managing capital effectively and maintaining flexibility for long-term growth. Efforts to better align expenses with current business needs have strengthened the foundation for future stability and financial stability. Additionally, the global unveiling of the FX Super One on July 17, 2025, is an important step in advancing FF’s strategic roadmap. The Company held an event in Pebble Beach on August 16, where it introduced its Dual-Flywheel and Dual-Bridge ecosystem strategy, designed to integrate traditional operations with emerging digital platforms. A central component of this strategy is the Company’s new C10 Treasury product, which establishes a direct connection between real-world business operations and on-chain assets. As one of the first U.S.-listed companies to introduce this capability, FF is creating a new growth paradigm by bridging Web2 and Web3. The C10 Treasury product is expected to strengthen the Company’s financial and technological foundation while reinforcing its ability to drive innovation across both ecosystems. Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer, spoke highly of the event by delivering the opening speech. 2025 OUTLOOK For the second half of 2025, FF will continue to focus on driving technological innovation, maintaining financial discipline, and driving long-term growth and success in the EV market. The Company expects to hit the FX year-end off-line target in the U.S. and anticipate the first FX Super One will roll off the production line in the Middle East by the end of the year as well. FF will continue to execute on the Company’s seven tier-one strategic goals and pillars, from S1 to S7, and uphold the “Shareholders First” philosophy by putting all its efforts towards building trust with investors and fully regaining their confidence. “In the second quarter, we achieved several notable capital markets milestones and also continued to strengthen our operating efficiencies and cost control measures,” said Matthias Aydt, Global Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “We are excited for many of our recent developments as well, including the recent FX Super One unveiling in LA on July 17 as well as the success of our recent Pebble Beach event on August 16, where we introduced our Dual-Flywheel and Dual-Bridge ecosystem strategy, designed to integrate traditional operations with emerging digital platforms. FX continues to build strong momentum with its innovative B2B and B2C sales model, and we are encouraged by the early pre-order numbers for the FX Super One.” EARNINGS WEBCAST Faraday Future management will host a webcast today, August 18, 2025, at 8:00 p.m. Eastern time (5:00 p.m. Pacific time).

Title: World Economic Forum Doubles Down on Climate and ESG, Lets Embattled Ex-Leader Off Hook

(Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images) Tyler O'Neil / @Tyler2ONeil Tyler O'Neil is senior editor at The Daily Signal and the author of two books: "Making Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center," and "The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government." Even before President Donald Trump’s reelection, investors were leaving the woke environmental, social, and governance agenda like rats fleeing a sinking ship. Yet, those rats appear to have a few life rafts remaining, and the World Economic Forum seems intent on shoring up the ESG agenda. The World Economic Forum is a conspiracy theorist’s wet dream. The forum hosts the annual Davos gathering of world leaders in Switzerland. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the forum’s founder and chairman, Klaus Schwab, wrote “COVID-19: The Great Reset,” a manual for using the pandemic crisis to upend all of society. The forum also promoted the prediction “You will own nothing and be happy.” This nonprofit organization, supported by 1,000 member multinational companies, represents the woke managerial elite. The World Economic Forum supports the claims that climate change poses a catastrophic threat to humanity, that institutions must be altered to root out “systemic racism,” and that society must be upended to kowtow to the demands of men who claim to identify as women and vice versa. It uses the notion of “stakeholder capitalism” to say that a company’s goal isn’t just to provide a return on investment for shareholders, but to make the world a better—read “more woke”—place. Meat will be a special treat. Read more: https://t.co/RiQP6tpkfp pic.twitter.com/7BcRHgnWTx The elites pushing these agendas brand those who disagree as “reactionary” or “hateful.” Yet, the World Economic Forum faced its own problems. Whistleblowers filed a complaint after The Wall Street Journal published an investigation claiming the Forum’s culture was hostile to female and black employees. Schwab, the founder, stepped down in April amid an investigation into claims he had misused Forum funds. This turmoil may have represented an opportunity for the World Economic Forum to chart a new course, rejecting its woke bureaucratic mentality and listening to the worldwide populist movement. It’s not just Trump: Populism is growing in France, Germany, Portugal, Poland, the Netherlands, and beyond. Businesses are also rejecting ESG. A host of companies have pulled out of the Corporate Equality Index maintained by the Human Rights Campaign, which has acted like a kind of LGBTQ+ mafia. Corporate America is outwardly rejecting the language of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” after Trump rightly issued executive orders interpreting racial quotas as a form of illegal discrimination. Yet the World Economic Forum is rejecting the anti-woke trend. Not only did the forum give its founder an outgoing commendation, but it also tapped the man who has long been the face of the ESG movement to help steer the ship. In a statement Friday, the forum said it concluded “there is no substantial evidence of material wrongdoing” from Schwab or his wife, Hilde Schwab. “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment, rather than intent of misconduct,” the World Economic Forum concluded. It also announced that Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, a former chief executive of Nestle who served as the interim chairman of the board, would be stepping down. Two men replaced him as co-chairs of the board: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Swiss billionaire André Hoffmann. Fink has long been the face of ESG. Under his leadership, BlackRock committed to the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in March 2021, pledging to offset its greenhouse gas emissions completely by 2050. His 2021 letter praised as “protests for racial justice” the Black Lives Matter protests that had devolved into riots in the summer of 2020. He said, “No organization is immune from the challenges posed by racial bias.” Fink has attempted to walk back some of this activism in recent years, as his firm faced backlash not just from conservatives, but from state treasurers who moved to withdraw state investment funds from BlackRock. As far back as 2023, Fink stopped using the term ESG, claiming it had been “weaponized.” BlackRock deleted DEI statements in its latest annual report. The company exited the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition earlier this year, while claiming that the move would not alter “the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock is not giving up on climate alarmism, however. It has shifted from ESG to “transition investing,” directing funds to companies that aim to operate using smaller amounts of carbon-based fuel. Furthermore, BlackRock still has a 100% score with the Human Rights Campaign. If Fink were truly committed to leaving ESG in the past, BlackRock would separate from the Human Rights Campaign and abandon climate alarmism. Like Fink, Hoffmann has embraced the “stakeholder capitalism” model and combined it with climate alarmism. The drug company Roche Holding, where Hoffman serves as vice chairman, published an interview with Hoffman in 2022 titled “No one can deny the existence of climate change.” In that interview, Hoffman said, “Roche employees have to know that we aren’t here just to make money; we are here to help people in a sustainable, lasting way,” such that the company grows “in harmony with nature and society.” As the world increasingly moves on from ESG, the World Economic Forum is doubling down. The woke movement may be on the outs for now, but the threat it poses isn’t going away anytime soon. Today, even with President Trump’s victory, leftist elites have their tentacles in every aspect of our government. The Daily Signal’s own Tyler O’Neil exposes this leftist cabal in his new book, The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government. In this book, O’Neil reveals how the Left’s NGO apparatus pursues its woke agenda, maneuvering like an octopus by circumventing Congress and entrenching its interests in the federal government.

Title: CK Hutchison Rules Out Ports Deal Being Completed This Year

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun (Bloomberg) — CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. ruled out the likelihood of the controversial sale of its global ports to a BlackRock Inc.-backed consortium being completed this year but stayed optimistic about the deal’s prospects after inviting a Chinese investor into the mix. A transaction wouldn’t be completed this year even if binding agreements are settled sooner, said CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt at an analysts briefing following the release of its interim earnings results on Thursday. He pointed out the complexity involved in the deal, which covers 43 of CK Hutchison’s ports including two in the strategic Panama Canal. If completed, the sale could net the conglomerate founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing more than $19 billion in cash. “We are in a new stage of our deal and that includes, as we have said, discussions with a major strategic Chinese investor,” Sixt said. “I believe that there is a reasonable chance that those discussions will lead to a deal that is good for all of the parties, ourselves included, and most importantly, that will be capable of being approved by all of the relevant authorities.” The comments came amid uncertainties over the fate of the geopolitically fraught deal, which has become a proxy for the rivalry between the US and China. While President Donald Trump hailed the sale as a win over the Panama waterway, Beijing has expressed strong displeasure over the sale, seeing it as a betrayal to the nation and kowtowing to American pressure. CK Hutchison shares swung between gains and losses in early trading on Friday, after first-half results released Thursday showed profit plunged 92% due to a one-time, non-cash loss from a merger. Through Thursday’s close, the shares had added 25% this year. The company has already missed a chance to ink a definitive agreement before a window for exclusive talks with the buying consortium expired in late July. State-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. was negotiating a powerful role for itself as a condition to join the buying consortium, which also includes Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd., people familiar with the matter have said. While the discussions have taken longer than expected, the group doesn’t see it as particularly troublesome because the port operations have been performing well this year, Sixt said. The company reported a 9% increase in revenue at its ports and related services business for the first half of the year, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 10%, mainly due to higher throughput and storage income in regions including mainland China, Asia, the Middle East, Mexico and Europe. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

US market dominance and Ethereum's impressive gains highlight the evolving crypto investment landscape. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Digital asset investment products pulled in $3.75 billion in net inflows last week, marking one of the largest weekly gains in history, according to CoinShares latest weekly report. The renewed appetite follows several weeks of tepid market sentiment and coincides with a recent crypto price rally. Notably, these inflows lifted total assets under management (AuM) to a fresh record of $244 billion. Ethereum emerged as the clear leader in the market, drawing $2.87 billion in inflows, about 77% of the weekly total. James Butterfill, CoinShares’ Head of Research, noted that most of last week’s inflows concentrated in BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum fund (ETHA), which accounted for over $2.3 billion of the fresh capital in the funds. ETHA is the largest spot Ethereum ETF and manages over $10 billion in assets, according to SoSo Value data. The BlackRock fund’s record performance has contributed significantly to ETH-focused funds’ accumulation of a record $11 billion in new capital this year. Conversely, Bitcoin-focused funds have repeatedly seen smaller flows in recent weeks, highlighting the shift in investor interest toward Ethereum. This was unchanged last week when the BTC-focused funds registered $522 million in new capital. Notably, CoinShares highlighted that Ethereum’s YTD inflows now represent 29% of its AuM, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 11.6%. Despite this, Bitcoin remains the largest asset in terms of AuM, standing at $180.7 billion compared to Ethereum’s $37.7 billion. Meanwhile, short Bitcoin products saw $4 million in inflows as prices dipped below $120,000, triggering significant losses for leveraged long traders. Outside of the top two major cryptocurrencies, XRP and Solana continue to remain the top altcoin pick for institutional investors. Last week, funds focused on these digital assets registered over $300 million in combined fresh capital. This brings their year-to-date flows to over $2 billion, and their funds also manage more than $5 billion in assets. Regionally, the United States accounted for nearly all of the inflows, contributing $3.73 billion, around 99% of the total. Other markets recorded smaller gains, including Canada with $33.7 million, Hong Kong with $20.9 million, and Australia with $12.1 million. However, these gains were partially offset by outflows from Sweden and Brazil, which saw $49.9 million and $10.6 million withdrawn, respectively. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: The TeX Factor For Traditional And Digital Asset Businesses
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuasmeltzer/2025/08/18/the-tex-factor-for-traditional-and-digital-asset-businesses/
Time Published: 2025-08-18T13:00:00Z

ByJoshua D. Smeltzer ByJoshua D. Smeltzer, Contributor. Full disclosure, I’m an adopted Texan. I wasn’t born or raised in Texas, but my family and I moved from Washington, D.C. in 2007 and I have called it home ever since. Although this fact may, reasonably, color my views, it has been a remarkable place to watch economic growth and the adoption of the digital asset economy. In general, Texas has always been a business-friendly environment. However, a series of recent moves by Texas lawmakers shows a deliberate effort to establish a business and, specifically, a digital asset business destination. Texas has embraced digital asset innovation - Bitcoin mining, financial services, and Web3, as well as blockchain and associated other companies in this new and growing industry. Most recently, Texas established the Texas Strategic Bitcoin reserve which allows the investment of public funds into digital assets. As expected, this will be managed by the Texas Comptroller. This creates a very conducive environment for digital asset and other traditional companies. Another significant step in making Texas a catalyst for economic growth is the creation of the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) that intends to open in 2026. Texas is proving that southern hospitality extends not only to the people who visit, but to businesses as well. Full disclosure, again, I’m a litigator handling corporate, tax, white-collar, and other financial disputes. Although inherently disruptive, litigation is sometimes the only way for parties to resolve disputes and be able to carry on their respective business. Even with the best. Texas has legislated a two-phase approach: creating laws that will reduce disputes and also creating specific courts. The intention is to allow for a more streamlined approach to resolving complex business disputes outside of the regular state court system. On May 14, 2025, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 29 into law that immediately became effective. The legislation codified the “business judgment rule” which created a presumption that the directors and officers of corporations acted in good faith, on an informed basis, in furtherance of the interests of the corporation, and in obedience to the law and the corporation’s governing documents when taking action on matters of the corporation’s business. In order to establish a cause of action the corporation or its shareholders must rebut these presumptions and prove a breach of their duties involving fraud, intentional misconduct, an ultra vires act (i.e. outside scope of powers), or a knowing violation of law. Senate Bill 29 also codified the right of a Texas entity to include a provision in its operating documents waiving a right to a jury for any “internal entity claims.” In a new and developing industry, especially one based on new technologies like Distributed Ledger Technology and other technology related to digital assets, directors and officer are more likely to exercise “business judgment” on how to operate and grow the company. If that judgment is subject to easy lawsuits second-guessing hard choices, or using hindsight analysis, it can hold back innovative decision-making or paralyze a growing company while it waits for lengthy litigation to conclude. The new law allows the governing documents to require that internal entity claims be brought in Texas courts, including the newly established Texas Business Courts. The Texas Business Court is a statewide, specialized trial court created to resolve certain complex business disputes. The Texas Business Courts opened on September 1, 2024 with the judges appointed by the governor for a two-year term (instead of elected). The law required that these judges must have had at least 10 years of practice in civil business litigation, business transaction law, or service as a civil judge. The new courts have limited jurisdiction (e.g. larger amounts in controversy, specific issues such as corporate governance, etc.) which means a smaller docket of cases and the presumption of faster resolution. Since the business courts are still relatively new, it will take time to determine exactly what types of business disputes benefit from this specialization. All eyes are on Texas to determine if time is saved by the smaller, more specialized, caseload. Backed by financial giants like BlackRock and Citadel Securities, the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE) has the funding to create a pro-business, innovation-friendly alternative to traditional exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. TXSE is, of course, focused on traditional financial products but has the opportunity to differentiate itself as a digital asset focused exchange. BlackRock runs popular Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) for both Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the presumption that similar products will be offered on TXSE. Also, publicly traded companies involved in Bitcoin mining are already available on other exchanges. For examples, popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global was recently added to the S&P 500. Circle Internet Group, a stablecoin market leader, recently applied to establish a national trust bank in anticipation of meeting requirements under recent stablecoin legislation to integrate digital assets into the broader financial system. Today, there is a lot of movement in traditional equity markets to incorporate digital asset financial products. This is happening just as a new national stock exchange, TXSE, is seeking to provide an alternative to traditional platforms. Thus, TXSE has the greatest opportunity to truly integrate both digital asset and traditional markets since it starts with a cleaner slate than the older established stock exchanges. Texas wasn’t the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, but its version did go a little further than similar legislation. The first such law was incorporated in New Hampshire, but did not that state’s reserve to be funded by public dollars. However, on June 20, 2025, Senate Bill 21, created the state-managed Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This legislation outlines the intent to use the digital asset reserve as a financial buffer, hedging against inflation and economic volatility. The Texas Bitcoin Reserve will be funded by airdrops, legislative appropriations, revenue dedicated by general law, cryptocurrencies acquired through forks, and investment earnings or rewards. This is a significant difference, since Texas has decided to put its own money at risk as a sign to digital asset companies that it is willing to take the same risks on this new asset and industry. At the federal level, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also indicated a willingness to potentially “acquire more Bitcoin" to increase the United States’ Bitcoin reserve. Texas is one of the largest economies in the world, and it has already committed to invest in Bitcoin as a method of protecting the finances for its citizens. That is unique among other government institutions - at least for now. When I first moved from Washington, D.C. to Texas, I was a bit concerned that my east coast personality might not mesh well with the local culture. However, the cliche’ of southern hospitality has proven true, both personally and professionally. I’ve watched the same welcoming attitude apply to many businesses that have decided to also make Texas their adopted homes. This has included many digital asset and blockchain based companies during a time when it was not as mainstream to be operating those types of ventures. In the best adopted Texan spirit I can muster - Y’all should come and check out Texas.

Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? Is water in Sweden really 25 times more valuable than water in Mauritania? By Andrew A. King, Ken Pucker & Jesse Colman Aug. 11, 2025 Impact accounting is the heir apparent to ESG (environmental, social, governance) accounting and investing. Where ESG investing emphasizes risks to the firm, impact accounting measures how corporate actions help or harm people and the planet. Its advocates predict impact accounting will engender a more transparent, responsible, and sustainable capitalism. Sir Ronald Cohen (a financier and leading advocate of impact accounting) and Professor George Serafeim (head of Harvard's Impact Weighted Accounts Initiative) claim it will "redefine success, so that its measure is not just money, but the positive impact we make during our lives." Impact accounting has attracted influential advocates. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva describes it as "a blueprint for a hope-filled future," while former SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee contends it could "ensure that those who want to make an impact will make an impact where it matters most." Leading corporations have begun adopting impact accounting frameworks: BlackRock and Eisai have pilot-tested methodologies developed at Harvard University, while Kering—the parent company of Gucci—has created its own proprietary system for dollarizing environmental impact. But impact accounting has a dark side that makes its use dangerous. In a previous SSIR article, "Heroic Accounting," we reviewed the potential for miscalculation and misuse of impact accounting measures. We also highlighted concerns about the feasibility and the perils of centralized, subjective pricing of externalities. There is another important problem we overlooked in that review: Impact accounting has an equity problem, because practical means for calculating impacts discriminate against poor people. This flaw is challenging to correct because it emanates from impact accounting's core premise: that social and environmental effects can and should be priced and compared in global monetary terms. One recent example illustrates this defect in particularly stark terms. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. Evidence of the discriminatory tendencies inherent in impact accounting appears in a recent report by the International Foundation for Valuing Impacts (IFVI)—an organization co-founded by Sir Ronald Cohen and Tracy Palandjian (Co-founder and CEO of Social Finance). The report estimates the social cost of consuming fresh water—a resource of growing global concern—for each country. Strikingly, the IFVI assigns the lowest social cost to Mauritania, a desert nation identified by the World Resources Institute (WRI) as facing an "extremely high" risk of future water scarcity. According to the IFVI, consuming a cubic meter of groundwater in Mauritania causes only $0.13 in social harm. In contrast, Sweden—rated by the WRI as having a "low" water risk—is estimated to suffer $3.23 in social harm per cubic meter of groundwater consumed, nearly 25 times the estimate for Mauritania. These counterintuitive estimates are part of a general trend. The IFVI estimates a low cost of water consumption for other water-scarce nations, including Somalia ($0.27/m³) and South Sudan ($0.53/m³), but calculates a much higher social cost in some countries with abundant water resources. Even rain-soaked Ireland is assigned a higher social cost of water consumption ($0.74 /m3) than Mauritania, Somalia, or South Sudan. Why does the IFVI assess Mauritania, Somalia, and South Sudan as places where consuming fresh water causes minimal social harm? The answer appears to lie in their poverty. In these nations, water is primarily used to produce basic goods for local consumption, which are then sold at low prices. The IFVI's methodology assumes that low prices reflect low social value, and consequently, it concludes that little harm is caused by sacrificing this production to divert water to other uses. By contrast, in wealthy countries like Sweden and Ireland, water is often used to produce higher-priced goods, including luxury items destined for global markets. The higher market prices of these goods are interpreted by the IFVI as indicators of higher social value, leading to greater estimated harm from water consumption. As shown in Figure 1, all countries assigned low social costs for water use by the IFVI are among the world's poorest, while rich countries—even those with abundant water resources, such as Sweden, Ireland, and Canada—are assigned significantly higher costs. The IFVI's discriminatory estimates are not caused by a bug or error; they are an inevitable consequence of impact accounting's reason for being—the monetization of social impacts expressed in terms of a global unit of exchange. Monetization makes risky assumptions about the relationship between social value and its monetary expression—price. As scholars Garry Jacobs and Ivo Šlaus (2010) warned, "The temptation to measure all value in terms of price plays havoc with commonsense, reason, and human values." In the case of impact accounting, this temptation results in systematic bias against poor people. In Mauritania, consuming water displaces activities such as subsistence agriculture, which the IFVI methodology interprets as causing minimal social harm, even though these activities are essential for survival. Conversely, in Sweden, water extraction displaces high-priced uses like decorative landscaping and is thus mistakenly assigned higher social value despite its lower importance. As a result, impact accounting risks reinforcing global inequalities under the guise of objectivity. Sir Ronald Cohen argues "We have to be able to measure a company's performance in delivering impacts as well as profits." But how should impact be measured? In financial accounting, price serves as a valid proxy: Managers aim to minimize the prices paid to suppliers and maximize the prices received from customers. Profit, then, reflects how effectively a firm achieves these goals. The same logic does not hold when measuring impact. Market prices do not reliably capture social and environmental outcomes and relying on price as a stand-in for value can lead to severe distortions. Consider a manager overseeing identical facilities in Sweden and Mauritania who must decide where to invest to reduce the social impact of lost work. The manager's employees require proficiency in mathematics—and thus earn wages comparable to local math teachers: approximately $57,600 per year in Sweden and $5,000 in Mauritania. Following the IFVI's approach, the social value of lost work is calculated as the product of wage and time, and by this logic, losing a Swedish worker imposes more than ten times the social harm of losing a Mauritanian one. Consequently, to reduce the firm's measured impact the manager should invest much more money to reduce lost work in Sweden than in Mauritania. But this conclusion is irrational. Higher wages in Sweden reflect the country's robust institutions and strong economy, not a greater intrinsic value of worker labor. In contrast, Mauritania's low wages result in large part from weak governance and systemic corruption, which suppresses economic opportunity and distorts labor markets. A 2023 report estimates that at least 3 percent of Mauritanians are paid nothing at all: They are enslaved. By the IFVI's method, their work provides no social value! The connection between good government and economic development is well established in the economics literature. "Inclusive political institutions that distribute power broadly in society and are accompanied by inclusive economic institutions create the incentives and opportunities that make a nation prosperous," write Nobel Laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their 2012 book, Why Nations Fail. "Institutions that lack inclusivity—where political and economic power are concentrated—tend to reproduce themselves, creating a vicious circle of deprivation and underdevelopment." Accordingly, it is not a lack of social impact that causes a Mauritanian worker to receive a salary one-tenth the size of his Swedish counterpart; it is a consequence of his working in Mauritania. Proponents of impact accounting shrug their shoulders at such concerns and respond that any accounting of social costs, even if done inaccurately, is better than no accounting at all. For example, Sir Ronald Cohen writes, "Until now, the prevailing view has been that impact cannot be measured reliably enough to be truly useful, however, in John Maynard Keynes's words, 'It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.'" Unfortunately, inaccurate information can be worse than no information at all. Impact information that directs harm to the poor and dispossessed will cause a decline in social welfare, not an increase, because income has a declining marginal influence on welfare. Depriving $1000 in income to a person in Mauritania, where the average income is $2200, may cause them to have trouble surviving. Deprive that same amount to a person in Sweden, where the average income is 22 times higher, and they may not even notice. If inaccurate information about impacts causes increased harm to poor people, social welfare will decrease. More information will not be better than no information at all. It might seem that the problem outlined above could be solved by adjusting observed prices or by using other methods to calculate impact. But such solutions are extraordinarily difficult to implement. For example, to compare the Mauritanian and Swedish teachers accurately, one would have to calculate the Mauritanian's wage if the country were well governed and the economy booming. This requires constructing an economic model of the national economy and then simulating how it would function under better governance. Such calculations remain at the frontier of economic theory. Even the most advanced models reduce complex economies to simplified, stick-figure representations of activity. They also require extensive data and research to calibrate and are often opaque in their assumptions and outputs. Ongoing debates surrounding models of the social cost of carbon illustrate just how contested and fragile these estimates can be. Accurately determining the "true" price of every resource in every country is, in practice, impossible. What about simply weighting impacts in poor countries to match those in wealthy ones? In principle, this could work—but how should the weights be determined? One alternative is to use purchasing power parity (PPP)—a method of determining the buying power in local currencies for a basket of goods. It is thought to better capture cost-of-living differences than exchange rates. However, switching to PPP does not fully solve the problem. For example, it still leaves us with the conclusion that Swedish workers provide three times the social value of their Mauritanian counterparts, even if employed in the same job. The creators of the PPP system—the International Comparison Program—caution against using it to compare prices at the unit or industry level across countries because the appropriate valuation factor should vary by product and context. But calculating such variable factors would require building and validating comprehensive models of each national economy, and as with the previous approach, it would be prohibitively difficult to implement such a system. Limiting the scope of use for impact accounting seems to be the best option. For example, impact accounting might allow for comparisons of the impacts within the same governing institution, such as the effects of extracting water in different parts of the same U.S. state. Alternatively, impact accounting could concentrate on genuinely global effects—those that transcend national boundaries—such as the environmental impact of corporate greenhouse gas emissions or global carbon sinks, such as forests and oceanic phytoplankton. We hope our arguments will lead to significant changes in how impact is measured, but that is beyond our control. We expect the proponents of impact accounting to continue to promote it as the heir apparent to ESG. If they are successful, managers and investors may soon confront impact accounting measures. Some guidance in their use is in order: 1. Beware of claims to accuracy. Impact accounting measures present as precise and interpretable dollar values, but this is an illusion. They rest on layers and layers of approximations and assumptions. Understanding those layers is crucial. 2. Avoid cross-country comparisons. Using impact accounts to compare firms across borders—especially between rich and poor nations—risks serious misrepresentation. Impact measures are likely to discount harm to poor people. 3. Check against common sense. If impact accounting tells you water consumption is less harmful where water is scarce, ask why. Check against first principles. Scarcity should increase value, not reduce it. 4. Recognize that impact accounting may be just the latest idea for an easy fix to social and environmental problems. Over the past 40 years, many solutions have been proposed for leveraging the power of business to advance sustainability. All have come and gone, all but one: strengthened institutions. 5. Strengthen institutions. As Acemoglu and Johnston have shown, social outcomes are better where institutions are stronger. We don't need Nobel Laureates to tell us, we know that from experience. Controlling institutions have made our air and water cleaner, our cars safer, our resources better protected, and our living standard higher. Such institutions are constantly under attack, yet they remain the best way to improve our planet. Impact accounting will likely come and go, but the effect of our institutions will remain. So, strengthen them, be it a social club, local government, national system, or international organization. Doing that will have a real impact.

Title: Next Crypto to Explode as BlackRock’s CEO Takes Helm at World Economic Forum

Time Published: 2025-08-18T12:37:20Z

Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, turned one of the world’s leading financial institutions into a crypto powerhouse. What Michael Saylor and (Micro)Strategy did for Bitcoin treasuries, Fink did for ETFs: And now that Fink has been appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum (WEF) – serving alongside Roche’s André Hoffmann – what’s next? Will the WEF take a more explicitly pro-crypto stance? And if so, which are the cryptos best-positioned for explosive growth? Fink’s appointment arrives just as WEF closed an internal investigation that found no material wrongdoing by founder Klaus Schwab. The WEF framed the move as part of a reset to ‘strengthen the organization.’ For their part, Fink and Hoffmann emphasized revitalizing public-private cooperation in a ‘fragmented’ world. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly. This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally. —Fink and Hoffman, Statement from Interim Co-Chairs of WEF For crypto, the headline isn’t just who chairs WEF – it’s that the leading gatekeeper of institutional crypto exposure now has a formal hand on one of the world’s most influential finance convening platforms. Because BlackRock dominates spot crypto ETFs with iShares Bitcoin Trust ($IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust ($ETHA), it controls real, regulated pipes through which pensions, RIAs, corporates and sovereigns can touch $BTC and $ETH at size. Just last week, Ether ETFs saw record single-day inflows (topping $1.02B), with BlackRock’s ETHA capturing $640M in one session. Earlier this summer, IBIT’s held coins crossed 700K BTC, further illustrating its market heft. Its $BUIDL fund – tokenized U.S. dollar liquidity issued on Ethereum – launched in March 2024, surpassed $1B AUM by March 2025, and later expanded share classes across multiple chains. $BUIDL forms a practical bridge between on-chain finance and institutional balance sheets. Crucially, WEF already runs programs that touch digital assets, like the Digital Currency Governance Consortium (DCGC), and the Crypto Sustainability Coalition. The programs launched between 2021-2022, but have fallen quiet in recent days. What’s the likely outcome? Probably not a single policy edict – Fink spoke in only general terms in his statement – but a faster convergence around best practices for custody, market data, disclosures, and interoperability. Those are all areas where BlackRock possesses both operating experience and great success, and which can translate into global templates. And with Fink at the helm of the WEF, look for these three projects to quickly become some of the best crypto to buy. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) delivers a faster-than-ever Bitcoin experience. How? By combining Bitcoin’s original Layer 1 with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The result is a lightning-fast Layer 2 that leverages the SVM’s transaction speeds and smart contract execution – but keeps final transaction settlement on Bitcoin. When it comes to Bitcoin itself, $BTC tokens are deposited into the Bitcoin Canonical Bridge and emerge on the Hyper Layer 2 as wrapped $BTC. There, your $BTC can be staked, deployed in liquidity pools, used in DeFi operations, and more as the case may be. Learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper in our guide, and don’t miss out on our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction; we think $HYPER could reach $0.32 by the end of the year, up 2,415% from its current $0.012745. The presale is already well over $10.3M raised. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale page to learn more. Web3 wallets are rapidly becoming far more than simply places to store your crypto; they’re the gateways to a whole new world of DeFi and crypto tools. And non-custodial wallets – where you control your own private keys – are critical, as a new wave of crypto users learns the truth of one of crypto’s founding principles: Best Wallet is a non-custodial wallet with some truly innovative features. In addition to swapping, sending, and storing your crypto, Best Wallet users can access and purchase promising top presales. Find whitepapers and tokenomics, browse new meme coins, and purchase tokens – all from within Best Wallet. And the $BEST token is key of this growing Best Wallet economy. Hold $BEST and gain lower trading fees and better staking rewards within Best Wallet. During the presale, you can stake $BEST for an additional 90% APY — learn how to buy $BEST here. What is $BEST, if not the best utility token for the Best Wallet? Our price prediction is also bullish, seeing a chance for the token to reach $0.072 by the end of 2025, up 182% from its current level of $0.025495. Check out the Best Wallet Token presale now. The crypto ecosystem is, as Fink pointed out, fragmented. Chainlink ($LINK) helps bind it together. Blockchain oracles feed real-world-data into the blockchain, allowing smart contracts to execute correctly based on price points, timestamps, and more. But Chainlink has grown beyond a simple oracle network. It’s a web that binds blockchains and TradFi together. It also secures data, offers cross-chain interoperability and decentralized computations to enable finance to operate on-chain, and blockchains to access financial networks. Chainlink notable partners include: On the token side, $LINK is the network’s utility token. Revenue from on-chain and off-chain operations has provided a hefty reserve: $LINK’s performance has been impressive as well, up 143% in the past year. Implementing fundamental changes to the world economic order requires far more than simply an interim head of the WEF. Real change will still flow through the SEC, ESMA, FCA, MAS, and countless other agencies. But Fink’s appointment, combined with IBIT/ETHA’s scale, record ETF flows, and BlackRock’s tokenization push, could make him nudge the global conversation toward treating crypto as core market infrastructure, instead of a side bet. If that happens, look for $LINK (oracle networks), $BEST (non-custodial wallet token), and $HYPER (cutting-edge Bitcoin Layer 2) to be among the next crypto to explode.

Title: Tokenized assets near $300 billion as Wall Street quietly floods on chain

Stablecoins dominate at $267 billion while tokenized Treasuries climb past $7 billion. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Tokenized assets recorded on public blockchains have reached approximately $293 billion, according to data from RWA.xyz. The figure, which includes stablecoins valued at about $266.7 billion, places tokenization near the $300 billion threshold, emphasizing its role as a structural layer in on-chain financial markets. Excluding stablecoins, tokenized real-world assets account for around $26.3 billion. The growth of tokenized U.S. Treasuries has emerged as a defining feature of this market. The segment surpassed $5 billion in March and now measures close to $7.3 billion in outstanding value. BlackRock’s BUIDL fund represents the largest share, with roughly $2.4 billion, followed by Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, at about $700 million, while Ondo’s OUSG and other vehicles, including USYC, JTRSY, and USTB, round out the leading issuers. This movement of short-term debt on the chain has accelerated in a high-interest-rate environment, drawing capital toward tokenized money-market funds and Treasury products. Tokenized Treasury and money-market mutual fund assets rose nearly 80% year to date, reaching $7.4 billion by mid-summer. Market participants increasingly use these products for yield capture and settlement efficiency, with institutional issuers anchoring adoption. Integrating BlackRock and Franklin into on-chain infrastructure illustrates how traditional finance firms use tokenization for capital markets operations beyond pilot programs. These tokenized funds function as yield-bearing stablecoin alternatives, attracting capital that may otherwise remain in non-interest-bearing stablecoin formats. Stablecoins continue to dominate the landscape with nearly $267 billion in value and more than 189 million holders globally, according to RWA.xyz. The sector remains the entry point to tokenized finance while indirectly supporting the Treasury market through reserve allocations. The scale of stablecoin holdings has created a structural bid in short-term U.S. government securities, reinforcing their connection to traditional financial markets. This demand channel links on-chain activity to systemic funding markets and elevates the policy considerations surrounding stablecoin regulation. The diversification of tokenized assets beyond stablecoins highlights further adoption. Data shows smaller but steady issuance across private credit, institutional funds, commodities, and corporate debt instruments. While Ethereum holds more than half of the non-stablecoin RWA share, networks such as ZKsync, Solana, Stellar, and Aptos are capturing portions of issuance, reflecting the infrastructure spread. These developments suggest tokenization is functioning as both a settlement infrastructure and a means of structuring regulated financial products on public ledgers. Institutional entry has been accompanied by exploration from banks and custodians, with settlement portability and collateral efficiency identified as primary drivers. While not all initiatives occur on public blockchains, the continued development of tokenized rails illustrates how traditional finance and crypto-native products are converging around the same operational mechanisms. The distinction between stablecoins as transactional units and tokenized funds as yield-generating products will remain central to how investors allocate across these categories. Tokenized assets approaching $300 billion marks a transition from concept to operating infrastructure. The scale now reflects not only retail payments through stablecoins but also institutionally managed capital in regulated securities, suggesting that tokenization is already a live component of global financial plumbing rather than a speculative frontier.

What happens if Strategy is forced to sell? BlackRock’s growing influence in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs and a stake in Strategy raises fears of market manipulation. What was once “the people’s money” risks becoming another Wall Street asset. BlackRock’s growing influence in the crypto sector has sparked intense speculation, with reports suggesting the firm may be orchestrating one of the largest market shake-ups yet. After acquiring a 5% stake in Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), potentially to influence Michael Saylor’s massive Bitcoin [BTC] holdings, BlackRock has propelled both Bitcoin and Ethereum [ETH] ETFs to fresh highs. Ethereum took center stage on Wall Street as spot ETH ETFs logged a record $1.019 billion net inflow on the 11th of August, with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) surpassing $10 billion. Meanwhile, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also clocked a milestone, crossing $91.06 billion in assets under management amid Bitcoin’s surge to a new all-time high of $124,500. This shows that BlackRock is no longer just holding Bitcoin; it’s moving to control it. It may look minor, but this move effectively connects the two largest Bitcoin whales, BlackRock and Michael Saylor’s Strategy. For those unaware, Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy depends on debt and stock issuance, making it vulnerable if its stock price drops, and BlackRock knows this. By pressuring MSTR shares, it could push Saylor into liquidating reserves, crashing BTC’s price, only to buy it back cheaply and tighten its grip on the market. This isn’t speculation without evidence. Additionally, in June, Strategy moved 7,382 BTC (around $850 million) to Coinbase Prime, not typical behavior for long-term holders, but a clear sign of preparation for potential liquidation. Around the same time, BlackRock sold over $500 million worth of Bitcoin in just 48 hours. For a firm of their size, that’s pocket change, but symbolically, it points toward a broader reset strategy. If BlackRock triggers this cascade, the fallout could be brutal and Bitcoin could plunge to $65K–$60K, Ethereum to $1.7K, while altcoins face losses of 80–90%. Derivatives markets would also implode, exchanges might freeze, and retail investors would capitulate at the worst possible moment. Meanwhile, institutions would be quietly accumulating the very assets retail abandoned in fear. The most dangerous part would be that BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT, already controls flows of hundreds of thousands of BTC. By adding influence over Strategy, they would dominate both direct Bitcoin supply and corporate reserves. What looks like a market strategy is actually a bid for a monopoly. If one entity can corner 70% of Bitcoin’s supply, decentralization, the very foundation of crypto, collapses. For BlackRock, it’s not about short-term profits. It’s about accumulation, dominance, and rewriting the rules of the Bitcoin market. If such a strategy unfolds, it could mark a turning point for Bitcoin’s identity. What began as a decentralized alternative to traditional finance may risk being reshaped into yet another Wall Street instrument, traded, leveraged, and collateralized like gold or oil. The recent slip in Strategy’s stock price to $366.32, down 1.78% in the past 24 hours, underscores the fragility of this balance. Therefore, as institutional giants tighten their grip, the crypto community faces a pressing question. Will Bitcoin remain “the people’s money,” or evolve into a tool of centralized financial power?

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink appointed as WEF interim co-chair

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, alongside Roche’s André Hoffmann. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The World Economic Forum (WEF), the influential global convening force for policymakers and industry leaders, has appointed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink as interim co-chair. The move comes hot on the heels of a high-profile internal review that cleared WEF founder Klaus Schwab of wrongdoing and set the stage for a temporary leadership overhaul as the organization recalibrates its governance model. With trillions in assets under management, BlackRock commands outsized influence across financial markets, ESG policy, and the investment strategies of governments and corporations. Fink’s interim appointment is a strategic move that could accelerate the institutional adoption of digital assets like Bitcoin within global policy forums and mainstream financial infrastructure. Fink’s appointment comes at a time when questions around institutional trust, sustainability, and cross-border cooperation are more acute than ever. Under Fink’s guidance, BlackRock has been a pioneer of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing, pushing for a more climate-resilient global economy; a priority that has increasingly permeated WEF dialogues in Davos and beyond. BlackRock has also been a major institutional force in crypto markets, and its landmark Bitcoin spot ETF approval in early 2024 dramatically accelerated adoption and legitimized Bitcoin as an asset class for pensions, endowments, and retail investors globally. With Fink at the helm of the WEF, the lines between traditional finance and the digital asset economy blur even further. The Forum regularly shapes global regulatory, economic, and technology discussions, and Fink now holds considerable influence over both Wall Street and Davos. Fink’s appointment could usher in a more progressive stance on crypto within elite policy circles, potentially opening doors for greater integration of Bitcoin and blockchain solutions in global finance and among world decision-makers. The internal review that prompted these shifts centered on longstanding questions about Klaus Schwab’s role and the organizational structure of the Forum. Schwab, who founded the WEF in 1971, has long been a focal point for criticism and, lately, scrutiny regarding governance. After clearing Schwab of wrongdoing, the WEF announced its intention to install interim co-chairs in a bid to increase transparency and bring new perspectives to the leadership table. Fink’s appointment thereby serves a dual purpose: to reassure stakeholders by placing a respected industry leader in stewardship, and to reinforce the Forum’s commitment to institutional accountability and renewal. Fink will serve alongside other interim co-chair, André Hoffmann, vice chairman of Roche Holding AG, forming a joint leadership that reflects the WEF’s renewed mandate for broad-based, multi-sector collaboration. With geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainties, and the accelerating pace of climate change occupying center stage, the incoming interims face a tall order: restore confidence, drive progress across key global issues, and prepare the Forum for its next chapter.

Title: The “Layer 1” Fight Is Not About Stablecoins But The Future Of Finance
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirch/2025/08/17/the-layer-1-fight-is-not-about-stablecoins-but-the-future-of-finance/
Time Published: 2025-08-17T16:46:41Z
Full Content:
ByDavid G.W. Birch ByDavid G.W. Birch, Contributor. With the GENIUS Act signed, stablecoins are on a tear. According to the management consultancy McKinsey, the total value of issued stablecoins has doubled to $250 billion today from $120 billion 18 months ago, and it is forecast to reach more than $400 billion by year-end (and $2 trillion by 2028). Wow. In addition to stablecoins tokens, a number of yield-bearing tokens are out there now. These tokens, typically an investment in short-duration government securities, such as the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund ($2.9 billion) and the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund ($0.8 billion). Big money, and hence the reasons for the “Layer 1” or “Layer 2” discussions in decentralised finance (DeFi) circles. I am sure you are all familiar with the distinction, but for those who are new to this space, when DeFi people talk about Layer 1 they mean a distributed ledger of some kind (such as the Bitcoin blockchain) whereas Layer 2 networks run on top of the Layer 1 blockchains in order to delivered improved performance or additional functionality. The Layer 2 networks execute transactions off of the ledgers but use Layer 1 to provide the underlying security and finality. So, for example: Bitcoin is a Layer 1 protocol, but on top of this people have built Lightning, which is a Layer 2 service that uses off-chain “payment channels” to make Bitcoin transactions work at point-of-sale (POS). Similarly, Ethereum is a Layer 1 blockhain and Arbitrum is a Layer 2 service that uses a “rollup” mechanism to anchor transactions. Well, so far, so technical. But there is escalating competition in this space and that has business implications. The news that major players, such as Circle and Stripe, are developing their own Layer 1 networks is rather interesting. Given their investments in the stablecoin space it seems logical for Stripe, for example, to create a new high performance Layer 1 blockchain specially designed to for payment processing. Their blockchain, known as “Tempo”, is compatible with Ethereum’s programming language so developers will be able to easily migrate “smart" “contracts” to the new blockchain. Similarly, Circle announced its new Layer-1 blockchain “Arc” (also compatible with the Ethereum programming language) which they say is optimised for stablecoin-based financial services. Arc has native support for the Circle Payments Network (CPN) and stablecoins including USDC, EURC and USYC1. It also has, rather interestingly from my point of view, an opt-in privacy schemes that offers selectively shielded transactions. Circle say that Arc is designed not only for stablecoins but for all forms of digital money and tokenized value in the future, a point I will return to later on. Now you might ask, since Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to work, why are serious players in the stablecoin space looking to build their own Layer 1 blockchains while others are already building Layer 2 rails (such as Robinhood’s chain on Arbitrum and Coinbase’s Base on the OP Stack) that also seem to work. There are, broadly speaking there are two business pressures: functionality and economics. Functionality first. A good reason to develop a Layer 1 is to ensure the development of features that are required by the ecosystem. Now that this infrastructure is no longer a technical detail but a defining factor in who leads the next phase of digital finance, business is paying attention and as stablecoins begin to be used in mainstream business applications, so operational pressures will increase and favour platforms that are secure, compliant and capable of high-throughput transactions. As the respected industry commentator Noelle Acheson noted in the case of both Circle and Stripe, these will be the priorities of most financial services players but they are not necessarily the priorities of blockchains such as the Bitcoin blockchain, which was optimised for censorship resistance. There is also the element of control: decentralisation sounds good but it would be annoying to find that your payroll payments to employees are held up because everyone is playing some sort of cryptokitties game or messing around with NFTs. Then there are the economics. The fact is that running decentralised network is expensive. If you want the censorship resistance of Bitcoin then you have to consume enormous amounts of energy and therefore charge significant fees. This is a key reason people started building Layer 2 networks in the first place. But if you don’t need the pseudonymity and censorship resistance (ie, you are running a regulated financial service) then you can redesign the infrastructure in a far more cost-effective way. You can imagine, then, that if Stripe offers stablecoin services to its global customer base, it will offer them its own stablecoins running over its own network and the transactions will never go anywhere near the world’s banking networks except for on- and off-ramps. Assuming, that is, that Stripe’s customers won’t want to hold stablecoin balances that are non-interest bearing. (Of course once the service is up and running then Stripe can offer their infrastructure to third-parties so that they can use the Stripe Layer 1 to provide stablecoin services to their own customers. Given that payments are such a huge, but vulnerable, profit pool for the TradFi incumbents they they will have to respond.) Where does this take us then? I suspect that the average consumer (eg, me) will have zero interest in Layer 1 or Layer 2 of indeed how any payments get anywhere. If I tell my accounting package to go ahead and pay a supplier in Canada, I really do not care how the money gets there: if Stripe uses open banking to take the money out of my UK account, take Canadian Dollar stablecoins from their Treasury and then send these stablecoins over to Canada where they are then paid out to the supplier using Interac e-Transfer, or whether they send the money from my bank account via SWIFT to a Canadian bank account, I do not care. Hence the winners and losers here will be determined by their cost-benefit performance for business. The battle for Layer 1, though, is not only about the battle to control payments, because it is about much more than stablecoins. As Circle indicated, it is about the future of value, a future in which the continuous exchange of “real world” digital assets replaces the traditional infrastructure (and associated overheads) of clearing and settlement vanish. In this world, the next-general financial market infrastructure of distributed ledgers, tokens and protocols (that is, “defi”) that will in essence become critical national infrastructure. Can this really be provided Circle or Stripe? Or will it ultimately need Big Tech or governments or someone else to deliver the platform for innovation?

The experts also spotted exploitable weaknesses in its infrastructure that defenders can exploit to disrupt campaigns. “Its earliest versions were built using the leaked Cerberus source code, and by late 2023, version 2.0 had incorporated large portions of the Hook botnet’s codebase. The newly uncovered version 3.0 reveals a significant evolution of the malware, expanding its form injection and data theft capabilities to target more than 700 banking, shopping, and cryptocurrency applications.” reads the report published by Hunt.io. Researchers from ThreatFabric first discovered ERMAC in July 2021, the initial version was almost fully based on the popular banking trojan Cerberus. The source code of Cerberus was released in September 2020 on underground hacking forums after its operators failed an auction. According to the experts, ERMAC is operated by DukeEugene, the threat actor behind the BlackRock mobile malware. The leak of the ERMAC 3.0 code exposed flaws like hardcoded secrets, static tokens, and weak credentials. Version 3.0 supports new injection methods, a C2 panel, Android backdoor, and AES-CBC comms, confirming ERMAC as an active MaaS platform. “ERMAC primarily leverages form injects for capturing sensitive data, which is done by serving custom form injects through the public/injects directory.” continues the post. “ERMAC targets primarily financial applications with a large focus on mobile banking and cryptocurrency applications with it, capturing sensitive data such as login credentials or credit card data.” Hunt.io discovered the full ERMAC V3.0 source code on an open directory on 141[.]164[.]62[.]236. The leak includes backend (PHP/Laravel C2), frontend (React), Golang exfiltration server, Docker configs, and builder. Analysis showed extensive operator control via form injects targeting 700+ apps, mainly banking and crypto, exfiltrating credentials via Android callbacks. Researchers uncovered multiple vulnerabilities, including a hardcoded JWT, default root credentials, and open registration. Panels and exfil servers remain active, confirming ERMAC as an evolving MaaS platform. ERMAC 3.0 relies on the Kotlin backdoor that supports 71 languages and encrypts traffic with AES-CBC. The malware does not target systems in CIS regions and avoid running in emulators. The malicious code requests elevated permissions for its execution, it can exfiltrate device data, and execute extensive commands, from stealing SMS and contacts to pushing fake overlays, call forwarding, Gmail theft, file access, and even taking photos. A web-based builder lets operators customize campaigns. Hunt.io mapped its live C2 panels, APIs, and exfil servers via HuntSQL queries, aiding defenders in tracking and disrupting ERMAC’s infrastructure. “ERMAC targets users of banking, shopping, and other financial applications primarily through web injects. It relies on Android’s WebView API to place an overlay on top of legitimate apps, capturing credentials and payment information. Implementing secure Android permissions such as FLAG_SECURE and using code to detect or block overlays can reduce exposure to this technique.” concludes the report. “Defenders can also focus on identifying and disrupting ERMAC infrastructure. Regularly scan for active C2 and exfiltration servers, and block Android applications that reference known ERMAC IPs or domains.” Follow me on Twitter: @securityaffairs and Facebook and Mastodon Pierluigi Paganini (SecurityAffairs – hacking, ERMAC 3.0) Security / August 20, 2025 Data Breach / August 19, 2025 Hacking / August 19, 2025 Security / August 18, 2025 APT / August 16, 2025 To contact me write an email to: Pierluigi Paganini : [email protected] Copyright@securityaffairs 2024

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/16/2025 12:03:12 PM PDT by DFG The World Economic Forum closed an investigation on its founder Klaus Schwab on Friday, clearing him of any wrongdoing, and appointed BlackRock (BLK.N), opens new tab CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding's (ROG.S), opens new tab vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. The Geneva-based organisation had launched an investigation in April into 87-year-old Schwab following a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. The probe was announced a day after Schwab resigned as chairman. The forum at that time did not say why he was quitting. For decades, Schwab has been the face of the WEF's annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, which has become a symbol of globalisation.

Title: Plastics Manufacturing At Crossroads: Pivot To Lead Or Lose
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/trondarneundheim/2025/08/16/plastics-manufacturing-at-crossroads-pivot-to-lead-or-lose/

ByTrond Arne Undheim ByTrond Arne Undheim, Contributor. The latest UN plastics treaty collapse underscored what markets already know: a $400 billion stranded asset risk that forward-thinking petrochemical leaders must now confront strategically. While legacy producers viewed blocking production caps as protecting industry interests, market forces don’t wait for diplomatic consensus. The transition window for plastics producers and pushers alike is narrowing, and who controls that transformation will determine market winners for the next three decades. The plastics industry faces mounting exposure across financial, regulatory, and reputational dimensions. The data reveals systemic vulnerabilities: only 9% of plastic waste is successfully recycled globally, microplastics now contaminate human blood as confirmed by groundbreaking research, and current projections show plastic production almost tripling by 2060. Meanwhile, oil majors increasingly depend on petrochemicals as their primary growth hedge against transport electrification. This isn't environmental ideology—it's risk management. Carbon Tracker has identified $400 billion in planned petrochemical expansions built on assumptions of infinite demand growth, while regulatory reality tells a different story. The EU's PPWR mandates 30% recycled content by 2030, California's SB 54 bans non-recyclable packaging, and consumer sentiment has shifted decisively toward sustainability metrics in purchasing decisions. The strategic question isn’t whether to change course, but how to optimize portfolio transition while preserving long-term revenue streams. Legacy models that expose firms to mounting financial, reputational, and regulatory risk need managed evolution, not overnight abandonment. Global investors are increasingly differentiating between high-risk commodity plastics and resilient specialty applications. BlackRock and LGIM now vote against directors of firms failing to address plastic-related risks. Project financing for petrochemical expansions faces enhanced ESG scrutiny, as demonstrated by investor concerns around major Gulf Coast projects. Lloyd's of London's exclusion of microplastic liability coverage signals broader insurance market caution. Firms that move first in rebalancing portfolios toward higher-value, lower-risk applications will secure cheaper access to capital. The market is rewarding strategic repositioning while penalizing commodity exposure—a trend that will only accelerate as ESG integration deepens across global finance. Strategic manufacturers are already rebalancing based on regulatory exposure and long-term demand fundamentals. Rather than wholesale abandonment, smart money is shifting toward value-preservation strategies that target virgin plastic cuts of 20% by 2027 under emerging regulations: High-value durables: Automotive, aerospace, medical, and renewable energy infrastructure applications offer better regulatory protection and margin stability than commodity packaging. PVC and polystyrene exposure: These face accelerating regulatory pressure. IKEA's aggressive phaseout—plastic packaging eliminated for new ranges in 2025, complete elimination by 2028—signals corporate buyer behavior. Strategic exit while assets retain value makes financial sense. Multi-layer films: Major brands are abandoning these recycling-incompatible formats. PepsiCo's 2025 backtrack reveals the credibility gap—slashing virgin plastic cut targets from 20% to 2% while claiming 97% recyclable packaging by 2030. Compare to Unilever's €1 billion investment in reusable packaging systems, already showing 12% cost savings in pilot markets, proving circular models can be profit centers rather than compliance costs. Engineering plastics: Specialty applications provide longer runway and higher barriers to substitution, making them natural portfolio anchors during transition. Petrochemical majors possess unique advantages in commercializing next-generation technologies. While startups develop promising innovations, established players have the balance sheets and engineering capacity to scale them globally. The technology landscape offers adjacency opportunities rather than existential threats: Carbon utilization: CO₂-to-chemicals technologies transform waste streams into feedstock, leveraging existing infrastructure while improving carbon footprints. LanzaTech's UK expansion in 2025 demonstrates how major players can scale these faster than venture-backed newcomers. Advanced recycling: Chemical recycling and enzyme-based depolymerization require the kind of industrial-scale deployment that suits petrochemical engineering capabilities. Carbios' enzyme facility became operational despite 2025 restructuring, while Loop Industries launched Twist resin with a 70,000-ton facility planned. Microbial manufacturing: Cemvita Factory's breakthrough in using engineered microbes to produce industrial chemicals from CO₂ and waste streams could reach commercial scale within the decade, offering petrochemical companies new bio-based production pathways. Feedstock diversification: Bio-based and captured-carbon feedstocks expand the resource base rather than threatening it, creating opportunities for companies with processing expertise and global distribution networks. UBQ Materials' 2025 masterbatch launch exemplifies how waste streams become valuable inputs. The question isn't whether these technologies will scale—it's who will control their commercialization. First-mover advantages in licensing, partnership, and deployment could define the next industrial cycle. Global policy fragmentation creates near-term arbitrage opportunities while markets converge toward sustainability standards. Petrochemical leaders are uniquely positioned to exploit these asymmetries while building transition capabilities: Europe's strict EPR rules reward recycled content expertise. California's packaging restrictions favor mono-material innovation. Emerging markets maintain growth potential for essential applications while developed markets focus on circularity. BP's own Energy Outlook acknowledges that declining oil use in road transport is being offset by increasing petrochemical demand, but smart players are preparing for the eventual policy convergence. This fragmentation won't last indefinitely, but it provides a transition window for companies that invest now in capabilities they'll need globally later. Building circular expertise in sympathetic markets creates competitive advantages when regulations harmonize. Companies that invest now in next-generation sorting systems like TOMRA's 2025 deep learning AI for aluminum recovery will be positioned to capture value as feedstock quality requirements increase globally. BP's 2025 Energy Outlook confirms oil demand peaked in 2025 at 102 million barrels per day, with petrochemical demand offsetting transport decline but plateauing by decade's end. As global awareness of environmental justice rises, companies that proactively address community siting, health impacts, and international waste flows will preserve operating licenses and avoid costly litigation. The traditional export of difficult-to-recycle materials to developing nations creates mounting reputational and legal exposure. Forward-thinking companies are investing in domestic circular systems while partnering with international communities rather than simply relocating problems. This isn't just ethical positioning—it's risk mitigation against consumer boycotts, investor flight, and regulatory backlash as environmental justice movements gain political influence. ESG reporting has become performance theater designed to deflect rather than direct real change. The metrics that matter for survival cut through the noise: annual virgin plastic reduction percentages, microplastic leakage per product unit, and community impact assessments that resist superficial disclosure games. Companies serious about transformation are adopting cradle-to-cradle design principles, where materials flow in closed loops rather than linear waste streams. They're licensing breakthrough technologies rather than developing incrementally. They're building durable license-to-operate through genuine community partnerships. Most importantly, they're setting concrete targets: 20% virgin plastic reduction by 2027, zero microplastic leakage by 2030, and measurable community health improvements in production zones. The industry faces three plausible scenarios by 2030, each offering different positioning opportunities: Regulatory Acceleration: Rapid policy convergence around EPR and production limits favors companies with advanced circular capabilities and low-risk portfolio composition. Managed Transition: Gradual policy evolution allows time for technology deployment and market development, rewarding strategic partnerships between petrochemical leaders and innovation companies. Technology Breakthrough: CO₂-to-chemicals, advanced recycling, or bio-feedstock innovations achieve cost parity faster than expected, creating opportunities for early deployment partnerships. In each scenario, petrochemical majors who position themselves as energy-to-materials champions of the 21st century rather than defensive incumbents will capture the largest share of transition value. The companies that lead circular innovation rather than simply comply with it will define the next industrial era. The winning strategy combines managed portfolio evolution with aggressive technology deployment. Rather than abandoning core capabilities, leaders will redeploy them toward sustainable feedstocks, circular business models, and high-value applications that align with rather than fight against regulatory trends. Critically, circular feedstocks expand rather than shrink petrochemical demand pools—they simply change the input sources while leveraging existing processing expertise. By 2030, expect three pivotal shifts that will reshape competitive dynamics: • Policy Convergence: The EU will implement a plastics border adjustment mechanism by the early 2030s, forcing global convergence on recycled content standards and inspiring similar measures in North America and Asia. • Petrostate Reinvention: At least one Gulf petrostate—likely Saudi Arabia or the UAE—will reposition as a global circular hub, investing heavily in CO₂-to-chemicals and advanced recycling to preserve export relevance in a carbon-constrained world. • Innovation Breakthroughs: TOMRA's 2025 deep learning AI systems, Carbios' operational enzyme facility, LanzaTech's UK scale-up, and Cemvita's microbial manufacturing platform will achieve commercial scale within five years, redrawing competitive advantage across the value chain. Additionally, Loop Industries' Twist resin launch and UBQ Materials' masterbatch deployment signal industrial breakthrough timing. The transformation won't be driven by treaties alone—capital markets, regulators, and technology innovators are reshaping the rules of industrial survival faster than diplomatic processes ever could. Expect at least one $10 billion petrochemical expansion to be mothballed or canceled under investor pressure before 2030, validating Carbon Tracker's stranded asset thesis. This isn't about corporate virtue signaling—it's about optimizing portfolios for long-term value creation under changing market conditions. The petrochemical industry's inflection point has arrived. Companies can defend obsolete positions, adapt portfolios reactively, or lead the transition and capture first-mover advantages in next-generation materials. The UN's failure created a transition window, not a reprieve. Carbon Tracker research shows the industry is betting its future on demand growth that regulatory and market forces will constrain. The smartest leaders aren't waiting for policy clarity—they're building capabilities that will thrive under any plausible regulatory scenario. The choice is strategic: adapt portfolios now to secure relevance through 2050 and beyond, or risk portfolio stranding as markets evolve. The companies that redeploy petrochemical expertise toward circular systems, sustainable feedstocks, and high-value applications won't just survive the transition—they'll define it. The question is not whether this pivot happens, but which companies seize it first—and which are left behind. The next industrial cycle will be built on resource optimization, not resource depletion. The question is not whether the plastics pivot happens, but which manufacturing companies seize it first—and which are left behind.

Women’s Interprovincial Championships: Leinster 22 Munster 33 Munster put themselves in pole position for a shot at regaining the Vodafone Women’s Interprovincial Championship title following a business-like 33-22 win over Leinster at Energia Park. Playing with a maturity beyond her years, 19-year-old outhalf Caitríona Finn turned in her second player-of-the-match performance in the space of a week as Munster handed the defending champions a rare home defeat. Chisom Ugwueru’s try just before half-time, adding to a quick-fire Chloe Pearse brace either side of the 20-minute mark, had Munster leading 19-10 as they proved clinical with ball in hand. Leinster debutant Vicky Elmes Kinlan’s dazzling opener had certainly raised the decibel level. Yellow cards for forwards Lisa Callan and Jane Neill hampered them, albeit that Kathy Baker was able to cross in the 28th minute. However, Matt Brown’s charges effectively sealed the result when Kate Flannery and Aoife Corey both touched down inside 12 minutes of the restart. Molly Boyne and Katie Whelan replied late on for Leinster, giving them their own bonus point. With back-to-back bonus point victories, and next Saturday’s trip to Ulster still to come, Munster look red-hot favourites for the final in Donnybrook in two weeks’ time. To set up a rematch with their arch rivals, Leinster will need to beat Connacht in Galway next week.

Referee: Siobhán Daly (IRFU) Connacht 12 Ulster 7 Second-half tries from replacement Faith Oviawe and Roisin Maher steered a young Connacht team to a gutsy 12-7 win over Ulster at Dexcom Stadium. With 21-year-old captain and player-of-the-match Éabha Nic Dhonnacha leading by example, Emer O’Dowd’s charges recovered from an early deficit to open their win account in this year’s Vodafone Women’s Interprovincial Championship. Ulster’s new centre Siobhán Sheerin thundered over in the ninth minute, raising her side’s hopes of a first victory at this level in two years. They still led 7-0 after half-time, emerging unscathed from Brenda Barr’s sinbinning. Nonetheless, with Connacht’s bench having the desired impact, forwards Oviawe and Maher scored within seven minutes of each other. In addition, Nic Dhonnacha clipped over the first conversion. The hosts, who wore their club socks on their State of Origin day, remained on the front foot and saw out a rousing triumph, putting last week’s disappointing display against Munster to bed. Unfortunately the hard-earned four points came at a cost for Connacht as the luckless Kayla Waldron was stretchered off in her first game since a horrific leg break in April 2024. There was a lot of concern too for Emily Foley who was taken off with an injury late on. Ulster picked up a losing bonus point for their efforts, and will have home advantage against table toppers Munster at Affidea Stadium next Saturday. Connacht remain in Galway, with a place in the final to play for against Leinster, who are two points better off. Scorers: Connacht: Tries: Faith Oviawe, Roisin Maher; Con: Éabha Nic Dhonnacha.

Title: Nothing to See Here: World Economic Forum Internal Investigation Clears Founder Klaus Schwab of Wrongdoing

An internal investigation conducted by the World Economic Forum has determined that there was no evidence that founder and former chairman Klaus Schwab committed wrongdoing during his time at the helm of the top globalist institution. Amid stepping down as chairman of the WEF in April, Great Reset architect Klaus Schwab faced accusations from whistleblowers of misconduct, including using World Economic Forum funds to pay for in-room massages in hotels, having staff withdraw WEF money from ATMs for his personal use, and using the organisation’s global competitivesness report to “curry favour” with certain governments. The 87-year-old German-born economist denied all allegations and reportedly launched a lawsuit against the whistleblowers. In response, the WEF hired the Swiss law firm Homburger as well as the American Covington & Burling firm to carry out an internal investigation into Schwab. Announcing the findings of the probe on Friday, the organisation said, according to the Financial Times: “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct.” The WEF board went on to say that it sought to “address all issues identified throughout the investigation, including strengthening the governance in general”. For his part, the former chairman said he was “pleased that today’s decision lays the foundation for the WEF to continue contributing to the positive development of our society in the future, mindful of its more than 50-year history”. Meanwhile, the WEF named U.S. billionaire BlackRock ceo Larry Fink and Hoffmann-La Roche vice-chairman André Hoffmann as interim chairmen of the board as it seeks a permanent replacement for Schwab. The pair said that they plan on “reinventing and strengthening the forum as an indispensable institution for public-private co-operation”. Originally founded as the European Management Forum in 1971 by then relatively unknown Geneva professor Schwab, with just $6,000 in startup funds, the World Economic Forum has gone on to become one of the most influential NGOs on the planet, with world leaders and heads of industry flocking every year to its annual conference in the Swiss ski town of Davos. Under Schwab’s leadership, the WEF became a leading promoter of an array of globalist projects, including carbon taxes, central bank digital currencies, global governance, tech censorship, transhumanism, and veganism, among others. Schwab also famously coined the concept of a “Great Reset” of global capitalism in which so-called “social justice” would shape decision-making about the world’s economy rather than simple market forces.

Title: XRP Takes On Live TV: Analyst Predicts Surge To $13 If This Happens

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Oliver Michael, the CEO of Tokentus, has again provided a bullish outlook for XRP. This time, he predicted that the altcoin could reach as high as $13 and outlined factors that could serve as catalysts for this significant price surge. Oliver Michael predicted in an interview that XRP could rally to $13 at some point if it sustained its current bullish momentum. He alluded to the Ripple SEC lawsuit, which just concluded and how it could spark several ripple effects, which would act as catalysts for the next leg up for the third-largest crypto by market cap. One of these ripple effects is the potential approval of the XRP ETFs. Michael noted that the SEC can now go on to approve these funds since the legal battle against Ripple is over. Furthermore, he raised the possibility of BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF and indicated that the altcoin is likely to record a parabolic rally if this happens, considering BlackRock’s position as the world’s largest asset manager. It is worth noting that BlackRock has said that it has no plans to file for an XRP ETF at the moment. However, XRP lawyer John Deaton believes that the world’s largest asset manager will still file to offer this fund within a year from now. If so, this could drive significant inflows into the XRP ecosystem, considering the success that the firm has recorded with its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Meanwhile, Oliver Michael also expects more Ripple partners to emerge now that the SEC lawsuit is over. This will help enhance XRP’s utility as more companies adopt Ripple’s payment services. Notably, the crypto firm has also made great strides to expand its presence globally by acquiring platforms like the stablecoin platform Rail and brokerage firm Hidden Road. Another reason why the Tokentus CEO believes that XRP can reach this $13 price level is based on his expectation that retail investors will develop a greater interest in the altcoin now that Bitcoin and Ethereum have already pumped significantly. Therefore, they will turn to XRP as the third-largest crypto, which may have more upside than BTC and ETH. Michael remarked that XRP’s move to the upside could happen really fast, similar to its rally of over 300% from below $1 to $3 last year. The altcoin already rallied to as high as $3.6 this year, boasting a 33% year-to-date (YTD) gain. However, based on Michael’s prediction, the XRP price could still reach new highs in the coming months. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.10, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Cybersecurity researchers have detailed the inner workings of an Android banking trojan called ERMAC 3.0, uncovering serious shortcomings in the operators' infrastructure. "The newly uncovered version 3.0 reveals a significant evolution of the malware, expanding its form injection and data theft capabilities to target more than 700 banking, shopping, and cryptocurrency applications," Hunt.io said in a report. The latest iteration of the malware can send SMS or initiate phone calls to a phone number, set up call forwarding to a specified number, display custom push notification with, fetch Gmail email subject lines, take pictures using the front camera, launch overlays on top of financial apps, capture contact lists, SMS messages, installed apps, and remove itself from the device. ERMAC was first documented by ThreatFabric in September 2021, detailing its ability to conduct overlay attacks against hundreds of banking and cryptocurrency apps across the world. Attributed to a threat actor named DukeEugene, it's assessed to be an evolution of Cerberus and BlackRock. Other commonly observed malware families – including Hook (ERMAC 2.0), Pegasus, and Loot – possess a shared lineage: An ancestor in the form of ERMAC from which source code components have been passed down and modified through generations. Hunt.io said it managed to obtain the complete source code associated with the malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offering from an open directory on 141.164.62[.]236:443, right down to its PHP and Laravel backend, React-based frontend, Golang exfiltration server, and Android builder panel. The functions of each of the components are listed below - Besides an expanded set of app targets, ERMAC 3.0 adds new form injection methods, an overhauled command-and-control (C2) panel, a new Android backdoor, and AES-CBC encrypted communications. "The leak revealed critical weaknesses, such as a hardcoded JWT secret and a static admin bearer token, default root credentials, and open account registration on the admin panel," the company said. "By correlating these flaws with live ERMAC infrastructure, we provide defenders with concrete ways to track, detect, and disrupt active operations."

Title: Follow the signs: vintage advertising brings high estimates at auction

Advertising signage has a niche market among collectors, who are often willing to pay a few thousand euro for certain pieces of pub and shop memorabilia. Fans of such items should check out the catalogue for the upcoming online-only auction at Victor Mee Auctions based in Cloverhill, Co Cavan, on Tuesday and Wednesday, August 19th and 20th, from 6pm each evening. The auction of more than 1,000 lots is a tribute to a bygone era when advertising was a physical art form in which sign writers and designers honed their skills on metal and glass. One of the most expensive estimates in the auction, at €3,000-€5,000, is for a mirror advertising Bendigo cigarettes in an art nouveau style. “These mirrors were made as luxury advertising pieces, often displayed in tobacconists, grocers and public houses in the early 1900s,” says Mee. The maker of the mirror with hand-gilded lettering was A&H Pemberton, a Liverpool glass and sign manufacturer. A smaller mirror advertising the same brand went under the hammer at Fonsie Mealy’s auctions for €1,600 in May last year. A more unusual sign advertising the chemical fertiliser, Hibernian Manure (€200-€400), might be of interest to an agricultural museum. Depicting a gentleman farmer engaging with a formally dressed saleswoman, it promises financial success to those who apply it to their land. Such was the importance attributed to promoting their products that in the 1930s, the manufacturers of the fertiliser offered a prize of £3 to anyone who could illustrate scenes that could be used in their advertising. The Victor Mee auction also includes a set of 12 framed advertising prints explaining “The Gentle Art of Making Guinness” (€500-€800). This whimsical series was originally produced by Guinness in the mid-20th century under the creative direction of John Gilroy, the artist behind Guinness’s most iconic campaigns. At an online auction set to take place on Saturday, August 30th, Lynes & Lynes auction rooms in Carrigtwohill, Co Cork, also have some old advertising signs from Musgrave Brothers depicting scenes of Cork, such as the Metropole Hotel on MacCurtain Street (€60-€100 each). “The printed sign shows the Musgrave Brothers’ head office on Cornmarket Street and at the base it shows the Metropole Hotel, with the Musgrave sweet factory behind. These are old signs and we expect good Cork interest,” says Denis Lynes. The auction also has some noteworthy historic pieces of furniture from Montenotte House in Cork city. Montenotte House is a Georgian end-terrace home with magnificent views over the river Lee from the city’s sought-after southern suburb of the same name. There is also a selection of 26 antique dolls (€100-€200 each) up for auction. Viewing of items runs from Saturday, August 23rd, to Friday, August 29th, from 10am-5pm daily. An interest in buying antiques and art often coincides with an interest in local history, so many buyers and sellers will no doubt be considering attending some events during National Heritage Week, which begins on August 16th. The free talks – in person and online – from the Crawford Art Gallery about the conservation of The Goose Girl by Edith Somerville (1858-1949) will be of interest to collectors of historic paintings. Somerville’s painting – not to be confused with the National Gallery’s Goose Girl painting, originally believed to be by Irish artist William Leech but later confirmed to have been painted by English artist Stanley Royle – depicts a young west Cork girl sitting on the floor holding a goose. Looking particularly sad, she is surrounded by vegetables and cooking utensils, which give the impression that the goose is destined for a tasty dinner. Somerville was born on the Greek island of Corfu but spent much of her life in Castletownshend in west Cork. Her painting echoed the French peasant realism style of the era. Although better known as one half of writing duo, Somerville and Ross, Somerville was also an accomplished artist, a suffragist and a progressive farmer who introduced the first herd of Friesian cattle to Ireland. The painting – which is one of the Crawford art gallery’s most popular – is now in need of crucial conservation work. Italian conservator Chiara Chillè, registrar Jean O’Donovan and curator Michael Waldron will explain the processes involved in talks being held on Tuesday, August 19thb at 1pm at the Civic Trust House in Cork City, and online on Wednesday, August 20th at 1pm. The Crawford Art Gallery closed to the public in September 2024 for major redevelopment but events such as these aim to keep the public connected to the collections therein. Meanwhile, Ann Chumbley, the collections registrar for the Butler Gallery in Kilkenny, will give a behind-the-scenes look at how to care and conserve art works at the gallery on Tuesday, 1pm-2.30pm. victormeeauctions.ie lynesandlynes.com heritageweek.ie Estimate £3,000-£4,000 Hammer price £3,900 (€4,508) Auction house Ross’s Auctioneers Estimate €400-€500 Hammer price €952 Auction house Adams Blackrock Estimate €850-€950 Hammer price €2,024 Auction house Adams Blackrock Estimate €300-€400 Hammer price €500 Auction house Adams Blackrock Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Title: BlackRock’s Fink appointed as interim co-chairman of World Economic Forum | The National

Business Economy August 16, 2025 BlackRock's Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chairman of the World Economic Forum, alongside Andre Hoffmann. The forum aims to drive international collaboration and distribute prosperity more broadly, says the newly appointed co-chairs. The WEF board cleared founder Klaus Schwab and Hilde Schwab of any misconduct following an investigation. Klaus Schwab founded the World Economic Forum, initially the European Management Forum, in 1971 as a corporate management symposium. “The world is more fragmented and complex than ever,” said the new co-chairmen in a joint statement. BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has been appointed interim co-chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), which organises the annual meeting of leaders in Davos, Switzerland. Andre Hoffmann, the vice chairman of Swiss based healthcare company Roche Holding, will also be interim co-chairman of the WEF, according to an announcement on Friday. “The world is more fragmented and complex than ever, but the need for a platform that brings together business, government, and civil society has never been greater,” Mr Fink and Mr Hoffmann said in a joint statement. “We remain optimistic. The forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly.” "This renewed vision can promote open markets and national priorities side by side, while advancing the interests of workers and stakeholders globally," they said. Both Mr Fink and Mr Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF’s board before being appointed to the current position. The latest announcement comes as global economy feels the impact of geopolitical matters and the rise in protectionism fostered by the introduction of US tariffs. US President Donald Trump shook the world economy following his April 2 "liberation day" announcement, with new tariffs. A number of leaders from the world of business and politics attend the forum every year. Mr Trump addressed the forum online this year. The board of trustees of the WEF cleared founder Klaus Schwab of any “material wrongdoing” following an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers. “Following a thorough review of all facts, the board has concluded that, while the organisation must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,” the WEF said in the statement. It also cleared Hilde Schwab, wife of Mr Schwab, of any misconduct. “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,” the WEF said. “The board has taken action to address all issues identified throughout the investigation, including strengthening the governance in general.” Mr Schwab started what became the World Economic Forum – initially called the European Management Forum – in 1971 as a symposium on corporate management. Since then, the event grew to become an annual gathering of about 2,500 corporate executives, financiers, and politicians, and other public figures from more than 100 countries, addressing matters such as inequality, migration, digital innovation and globalisation. With strong ties with leading organisations such as the UN and World Bank, the WEF has played a major role in navigating political issues and promoting a collaborative approach to global trade. Mr Schwab stepped down as head of board of trustees of the WEF in April this year.

In 2015, France and Germany helped broker a peace deal, known as the Minsk agreements, that ended large-scale hostilities but failed to bring a political settlement of the conflict. The Kremlin has repeatedly accused Kiev of sabotaging the deal, and Ukrainian officials in recent weeks said that implementing it in full would hurt Ukraine.

The World Economic Forum has cleared Klaus Schwab of “material wrongdoing” after a law firm conducted a review into potential misconduct of the institution’s founder. The body also said Blackrock Inc.’s Larry Fink and Roche Holding AG vice chairman Andre Hoffmann will take over the leadership of the WEF board of trustees on an interim basis as co-chairs, according to a statement late Friday. Interim chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe is stepping down. “Following a thorough review of all facts, the Board has concluded that, while the organization must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,” it said in the statement. The board also said there is no evidence of any misconduct by Hilde Schwab, the wife of Klaus. The announcement ends a fight between the founder of the iconic institution and its board that was triggered by reports about potential misconduct by Klaus Schwab. Schwab abruptly resigned from the WEF in April after the misconduct allegations emerged, sparking the clash. The body launched an investigation to examine a range of accusations, including claims the 87-year-old used the forum’s resources for personal purposes. The dispute escalated when Schwab accused the WEF’s board of leaking details of an investigation against him to the media, complicating a peace agreement between the two parties. “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,” the WEF said in its statement, pledging to improve its governance. Fink and Roche heir Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF’s board. The organization’s flagship event, the annual Davos meeting, has emerged into a must-attend event for bankers, business figures and politicians over the decades. The next gathering will take place in January 2026. “We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly,” Fink and Hoffmann said in a joint statement.

World World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab speaks at the WEF's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan 21, 2025. (File photo: AP/Markus Schreiber) The World Economic Forum (WEF) closed an investigation into its founder Klaus Schwab on Friday (Aug 15), clearing him of any wrongdoing, and appointed BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Roche Holding's vice-chair Andre Hoffmann as interim co-chairs of its board. The Geneva-based organisation had launched an investigation in April into 87-year-old Schwab following a whistleblower letter alleging misconduct. The probe was announced a day after Schwab resigned as chairman. The forum at that time did not say why he was quitting. For decades, Schwab has been the face of the WEF's annual gathering of business and political leaders in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, which has become a symbol of globalisation. The WEF said on Friday that its board had completed an investigation into allegations raised by anonymous whistleblowers against Schwab and found there was no evidence of material wrongdoing by him. WEF also did not find any misconduct by Schwab's wife and former assistant, Hilde Schwab. "Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct," WEF said. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the probe in April, had said an anonymous letter raised concerns about the WEF's governance and workplace culture, including allegations that the Schwab family mixed their personal affairs with the forum's resources without proper oversight. In May, a spokesperson for Schwab informed Reuters that he had filed a criminal complaint against the whistleblowers. The Schwab family denied all the allegations in the whistleblower complaint to the Journal. Following the conclusion of the probe, a spokesman for Schwab told WSJ on Friday that he intends to drop his lawsuit against WEF and a separate legal action against anonymous whistleblowers. The WEF also said Peter Brabeck-Letmathe had stepped down as interim chairman following the investigation’s conclusion. In a statement posted on the WEF website, newly appointed co-chairs Fink and Hoffman said they were honoured to take on the leadership role on an interim basis and looked forward to reinventing and strengthening the organisation. WEF's Davos gathering has in recent years drawn criticism from opponents on both left and right as an elitist talking shop detached from the lives of ordinary people.

Posted on 08/15/2025 3:48:01 PM PDT by xzins The Russiagate Releases Were Organized in Advance of this Summit August 15, 2025 | Sundance While it may be frustrating to many people to realize most of the Russiagate declassification and releases of information are not intended to generate indictments or legal accountability, on the strategic upside the view of the public toward the U.S. Intelligence Community propaganda provides major breathing room for a U.S-Russia reset. Arguably, the Russiagate releases can be looked upon as intentionally strategic, or just surreptitiously timed. The opposition to this discussion, meeting, peace effort and potential strategic realignment, includes: The CIA, NATO, the U.K, British intelligence (GCHQ), Five-Eyes, the European Union, China, BRICS, Ukraine, World Bank, Wall Street, the military industrial complex, Blackrock and global leftists. If President Trump and President Putin can overcome all those in opposition to their unity and still form a strategic alliance, the entire world changes. This cannot be overstated.

They just want to put all of the info out there to be aired in public. And that's it. 100% wrong. First, if they had no intention of bringing the conspirators to justice, it would be idiotic to make the case for indictments and arrests. Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve. If Trump doesn't take down The Deep State, this nation (and the world) is toast. I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that God put Trump back in the White House to fulfill his divine destiny. He's leading a revolution that has only just begun.

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible.

That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence!

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible.

That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey.

Why set up huge expectations only for nothing, except bitter disappointment? Why is Trump tweeting like mad about it if he knows nothing is going to be done? It makes no sense. If they had no plans to pursue justice, they would ignore it and try to move on Secondly, God didn't bring Trump through the fire he endured for a brief, temporary reprieve.

That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Sundunce is making things up again. on the strategic upside the view of the public toward the U.S. Intelligence Community propaganda provides major breathing room for a U.S-Russia reset. As if Trump gives a higher priority to US/Russia's relations over American First accountability. on the strategic upside the view of the public toward the U.S. Intelligence Community propaganda provides major breathing room for a U.S-Russia reset.

Maybe someone can give Putin a reset button. >< I guess I misunderstood what you said. Fox News host Bret Baier was given exclusive access to President Trump during the much-anticipated summit in Alaska.Baier interviewed President Trump on Airforce One going to Anchorage and during the day’s events. In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein.

Posted on 08/15/2025 3:48:01 PM PDT by xzins The Russiagate Releases Were Organized in Advance of this Summit August 15, 2025 | Sundance While it may be frustrating to many people to realize most of the Russiagate declassification and releases of information are not intended to generate indictments or legal accountability, on the strategic upside the view of the public toward the U.S. Intelligence Community propaganda provides major breathing room for a U.S-Russia reset. Arguably, the Russiagate releases can be looked upon as intentionally strategic, or just surreptitiously timed. The opposition to this discussion, meeting, peace effort and potential strategic realignment, includes: The CIA, NATO, the U.K, British intelligence (GCHQ), Five-Eyes, the European Union, China, BRICS, Ukraine, World Bank, Wall Street, the military industrial complex, Blackrock and global leftists. If President Trump and President Putin can overcome all those in opposition to their unity and still form a strategic alliance, the entire world changes. This cannot be overstated.

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey.

In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey.

It's laughable to suggest that Trump is playing along with the "con" to hype up all the crimes, knowing in the end that nothing is going to happen. Trump is the most transparent politician, ever. He doesn't play games. What he says, is what he means. No, this is a complete whiff by CT. It's startling poor judgment of who Trump is and why he is POTUS at this time. 12 posted on 08/15/2025 6:49:11 PM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: Bratch Kash Patel says, “we are building a case for the American public“… There it is.LOL.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: FreeReign; GLDNGUN President Trump Outlines a Remarkably Altruistic IntentionAugust 16, 2025 | Sundance Fox News host Bret Baier was given exclusive access to President Trump during the much-anticipated summit in Alaska.Baier interviewed President Trump on Airforce One going to Anchorage and during the day’s events. In this interview, Baier asked President Trump what his expectations were going in. Trump noted it is not his place to negotiate the terms of a ceasefire on behalf of Ukraine; however, he is willing to be an intermediary in a focused effort to stop the conflict.Stopping the killing is President Trump’s main priority and peace is the elusive prize. In the background, as previously noted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the administration accepts the conflict in Ukraine is essentially a proxy war between the former Biden administration officials, NATO warmongers, international banking interests and Russia.In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. WATCH:EXPECTATIONS GAME: Trump describes ideal negotiations timeline, relationship with PutinThis framework essentially validates what a small group of deep weeds walkers, including myself, have suspected. From the perspective of Trump and his big picture objectives, the recent Russiagate releases and declassifications are not so much to get accountability upon the perpetrators, but rather to make the backstory so well known that a strategic reset with Russia is no longer impeded by manufactured domestic issues inside the USA.The value in Russiagate declassification and information releases, is more about laying the groundwork for a reset – and stopping the political opposition therein. That’s the Big Picture value to President Trump.That is quite a big and significantly magnanimous position to take by President Trump.Hopefully, the MAGA base will eventually come around to this understanding, because right now they are intensely expecting criminal accountability. That’s not President Trump’s goal, he’s thinking much bigger and more consequential that holding the irrelevant gnats accountable.Apparently, Hillary Clinton can see that. It’s such a big altruistic position her tribe appears genuinely stunned. Hopefully, the base of MAGA will also accept this strategic purpose. 17 posted on 08/16/2025 4:01:32 AM PDT by Bratch [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 13 | View Replies] To: GLDNGUN In a moment of genuine sunlight upon the backstory, President Trump notes he told President Putin, “There’s no way we are going to make a deal” … “impossible” … “because I have wise guys who created a phony deal,” the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, “and until those things are settled up” a reset in the relationship with Russia is impossible. This only confirms my point. Thank you. You'd have to be pretty obtuse to not understand what "settled up" means. You think "settled up" in Trump's mind means the crooks get off? That's exactly the opposite of what Trump has been saying. There's a "secret" to understanding what's going on in Trump's head. It's called read and listen to what he says and take it at face value. As for Hillary "If Trump wins, we'll all hang!" Clinton, her Nobel Peace Prize comment and her radio silence on the recent Russia hoax info dump on her head (while the other co-conspirators are chirping back) is indicative of someone tryin to position herself for a deal. Guess who are at the top of the list of people she HATES the most? Those would be the people she believes denied her the opportunity to be POTUS, something she wanted more desperately than a junkie wants a fix. Specifically, who are they? Obama, Brennan, and Comey. They also happen to be her top co-conspirators in the Russia hoax. What a coincidence! She's not going down with that ship. 18 posted on 08/16/2025 9:22:50 AM PDT by GLDNGUN [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 12 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Title: World Economic Forum Clears Schwab, Names Fink as Co-Chair

(Bloomberg) -- The World Economic Forum has cleared Klaus Schwab of “material wrongdoing” after a law firm conducted a review into potential misconduct of the institution’s founder. The body also said Blackrock Inc.’s Larry Fink and Roche Holding AG vice chairman Andre Hoffmann will take over the leadership of the WEF board of trustees on an interim basis as co-chairs, according to a statement late Friday. Interim chairman Peter Brabeck-Letmathe is stepping down. “Following a thorough review of all facts, the Board has concluded that, while the organization must evolve toward a more institutional model, there is no evidence of material wrongdoing by Klaus Schwab,” it said in the statement. The board also said there is no evidence of any misconduct by Hilde Schwab, the wife of Klaus. The announcement ends a fight between the founder of the iconic institution and its board that was triggered by reports about potential misconduct by Klaus Schwab. Schwab abruptly resigned from the WEF in April after the misconduct allegations emerged, sparking the clash. The body launched an investigation to examine a range of accusations, including claims the 87-year-old used the forum’s resources for personal purposes. The dispute escalated when Schwab accused the WEF’s board of leaking details of an investigation against him to the media, complicating a peace agreement between the two parties. “Minor irregularities, stemming from blurred lines between personal contributions and Forum operations, reflect deep commitment rather than intent of misconduct,” the WEF said in its statement, pledging to improve its governance. Fink and Roche heir Hoffmann have been serving on the WEF’s board. The organization’s flagship event, the annual Davos meeting, has emerged into a must-attend event for bankers, business figures and politicians over the decades. The next gathering will take place in January 2026. “We remain optimistic. The Forum has an opportunity to help drive international collaboration in a way that not only generates prosperity but distributes it more broadly,” Fink and Hoffmann said in a joint statement.

Title: Bank of America shares an eye-popping chart showing a potential stock-market bubble: 'It better be different this time'

Stock-market bulls convinced of the power of AI to transform the economy often shrug off comparisons to the dot-com bubble a quarter century ago. The real profits are already showing up, unlike in the early days of the internet boom — so it is different this time, the thinking goes. But Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett has a message for these investors: "It better be different this time." Hartnett, who has often expressed skepticism of the market's bull run over the last few years, shared a head-turning chart that highlights just how optimistic investors have become about the impact AI will have. It shows the S&P 500's price-to-book ratio, which measures the total market cap of the index's constituents compared to their total assets minus liabilities. The valuation measure is at a record high of 5.3, topping the 5.1 level seen in March 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Other classic valuation measures show market froth relative to history. For instance, Hartnett also shared a chart showing the S&P 500's 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio. Except for August 2020, it's at the highest level since the dot-com era. And the Shiller cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, which measures current prices against a 10-year rolling average of earnings, is at similar levels to 1929, 2000, and 2021. High valuations reflect high expectations for future earnings. Sometimes those expectations turn out to be too elevated, and prices correct, but they don't necessitate a bubble scenario. So far, many AI firms have continually beat earnings expectations, suggesting the optimism could be justified. Valuations are also better predictors of average long-term returns than near-term performance, and views on Wall Street on where the market goes in the months ahead differ. Though there are calls for caution, many strategists continue to raise their year-end S&P 500 price targets. Earlier this week, Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, said the market is in the "best investing environment ever" thanks to factors like strong demand for stocks, looming rate cuts, and recent boosts in productivity and earnings growth. If the market does start to unwind, however, Hartnett said he sees bonds and non-US stocks benefiting. Examples of funds that offer exposure to these trades include the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG) and the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU). Jump to

Title: Panama Canal to Launch Tender for Construction, Operation of Two Ports

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun PANAMA CITY, Aug 14 (Reuters) – The Panama Canal will soon begin consultations with companies about launching a competitive tender in the first quarter of next year offering two new ports for construction and operation within its zone, a source involved in the preparations said on Thursday. The ports are part of a broad expansion plan being organized by the waterway’s administration. It aims to increase services related to cargo handling, including trans shipment, storage and gas transportation, and to secure fresh water for operations. “There is a large demand for facilities and terminals,” said Ricaurte Vasquez, head of the waterway, at a conference on Thursday, without elaborating on details. The Panama Canal Authority did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Its top executives have previously said the waterway plans to invest some $8.5 billion in the next five years to update and expand its infrastructure. A key project included in the planning, the construction of a large dam to contain the Indio river and create a new water reservoir, will be discussed at Panama’s Supreme Court after affected communities filed a lawsuit against it last month. Another tender to offer a project to build a liquefied petroleum gas pipeline within the canal zone also is in preparation and could be launched next year, the source added. U.S. President Donald Trump this year threatened to take over the Panama Canal amid criticism of what his government has called the increasing influence of China over the Central American country. Meanwhile, Panama’s President Jose Mulino has moved to end a 25-year concession to Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison 0001.HK for the operation of two key separate ports outside of the canal zone amid criticism of the contract’s terms. CK Hutchison said on Thursday that a $22.8 billion deal with a group led by BlackRock BLK.N and shipping firm MSC to sell most of its global port business, including the two ports in Panama, had a “reasonable chance” of going through.

Title: Bullish crypto exchange surges 90% on debut, raising $1.1 billion

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Bullish, a cryptocurrency exchange operator, saw its stock price surge on its opening day, ending at $70 with a 90% gain. This gave the company a market cap above $10 billion. The stock opened for trade near 1:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday at $90 and peaked at $118 per share shortly after, a 215% gain. However, the stock was halted for trade at least twice within the first few minutes due to volatility. Bullish, which operates a crypto exchange and owns the trade publication CoinDesk, launched its IPO on Tuesday. The company aimed higher than its anticipated price range of $32 to $33 per share. In 2021, Bullish sought a valuation of $9 billion but faced regulatory hurdles, causing them to withdraw their registration at the time. The debut of Bullish follows recent successful high-profile public offerings, including Figma and Circle. This indicates that the IPO market is robust after several challenging years. Data from IPO tracker and ETF operator Renaissance Capital shows that the market has introduced entities worth more than $50 million this year, up by more than 58% compared to last year. Major institutional investors showed substantial interest in Bullish ahead of its IPO. Firms such as BlackRock and Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest signaled their interest in the offering, according to securities filings. Bullish CEO Thomas Farley, formerly COO and president of the NYSE Group, said, “We now intend to IPO because we believe that the digital assets industry is beginning its next leg of growth. I believe that the digital assets industry is at the inflection point of institutional adoption and Bullish is uniquely positioned at the center of this market.” Bullish’s primary business operations come from its Bullish Exchange, a digital assets spot and derivative exchange targeting institutional-sized clients. The company’s prospectus shows that the exchange experienced robust activity throughout the first quarter of this year. The positive performance of digital assets this year also underscores Bullish’s strong IPO. Major cryptocurrencies have experienced substantial gains, with Bitcoin up more than 30%, Ethereum up more than 40%, and Ripple’s XRP up over 57% since the beginning of the year. The successful public offering of Bullish suggests that Wall Street’s predictions for a sluggish IPO market in 2025 may have been overly pessimistic.
