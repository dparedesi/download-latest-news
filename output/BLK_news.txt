The technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets. The bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes. It doesn’t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what’s known as scientific breakeven, and while it’s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound. Founders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion. CFS’s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls “commercially relevant” levels. Sparc’s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors. The Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output. CFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others. Founded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine. In December 2025, TAE announced that it would merge with President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group. The all-stock transaction would value the combined company at $6 billion. TAE would receive $200 million plus another $100 million upon filing paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission. TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEO of the combined company alongside Devin Nunes, who had been sole CEO of Trump Media. The fusion startup had previously raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. Before the merger, TAE had raised a total of $1.79 billion, according to PitchBook. Of all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft. Helion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma’s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor’s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine. The company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel’s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group. Pacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target. The company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion’s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn’t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that’s common in biotech. Shine Technologies is taking a cautious — and possibly pragmatic — approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it’s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn’t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it’s developing necessary skills for when that time comes. The company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Now its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital. In General Fusion’s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine. General Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors. In August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in a pay-to-play round that one investor called “the least amount of capital possible” to keep the General Fusion afloat. Then in November, securities filings in Canada revealed that the company had raised $51.1 million in SAFE notes from nearly 70 investors, the Globe and Mail reported. Altogether, General Fusion has raised $492 million, according to PitchBook. Tokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design — the doughnut shape — and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs. The Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup’s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Fabergé egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company’s magnets in “fusion power plant-relevant scenarios.” Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business. In total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook. Zap Energy isn’t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine. Like Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel. Most investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany. Proxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a €130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than €185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures. Stellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist — literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma’s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions. With all the startups pursuing fusion power, it was perhaps inevitable that another would pop up to develop components that round out a power plant. The so-called balance of plant, or the parts that sit outside the reactor, range from gyrotrons that heat plasma to heat extraction systems to harvest power from fusion reactions to turn it into electricity. Kyoto Fusioneering has made an early bet that if even one fusion startup succeeds in generating enough power to sell to the grid, that the industry will need a supplier for the balance of plant and the expertise to integrate it into whichever fusion technologies win out. Venture capitalists appear to agree, having invested $191 million in Kyoto Fusioneering. Investors include 31Ventures, In-Q-Tel, JIC Venture Growth Investments, Mitsubishi, and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Investment. Marvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry’s decades of experience. The inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $162 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, and HV Capital with Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels. Unlike many other fusion startups, First Light Fusion doesn’t use magnets to generate the conditions necessary for fusion. Instead, it follows an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite. But even then, First Light doesn’t hew to orthodoxy. Most attempts at inertial confinement use lasers to do the dirty work, following the lead of the National Ignition Facility, which produced a groundbreaking experiment in 2022. Rather, First Light fires a projectile at a target using a two-stage gun; the first stage uses gunpowder to fire a plastic piston that compresses hydrogen to 145,000 psi, which then launches the projectile. The target is designed to amplify the force of the impact so it compresses the fuel to the point of ignition. In March 2025, First Light announced that it would not pursue building its own power plant, instead offering its core technologies to other companies to build one. A spokesperson for First Light said that it is planning to build “pulsed power capability that would act as our demonstrator plant but would have other science and defense applications.” In other words, the company was dropping its plans for a power plan in a quest for revenue. Based in Oxfordshire, UK, First Light has raised $108 million from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent, according to PitchBook. Though nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that’s behind the National Ignition Facility’s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF’s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage. Founded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $100 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.

Title: Solana Wraps Up A Stellar 2025 As SOL Price Makes A Last Minute Surge
URL: https://zycrypto.com/solana-wraps-up-a-stellar-2025-as-sol-price-makes-a-last-minute-surge/

As the year comes to a close, the Solana (SOL) ecosystem has recapped the key milestones reached in 2025. Meanwhile, SOL price is staging a late recovery, gaining nearly 3% in the last 24 hours. Solana’s official X account has described “2025 as a banger” in a year that saw the network attract major institutional interest. The team shared a three-minute video on X, chronicling the high points of 2025, including key partnerships with global financial service providers and network upgrades. Right off the bat, the video highlighted Western Union’s partnership with Solana to launch a stablecoin for global payments. Amid the flurry of institutional partnerships, the team underscored CME Group’s decision to launch spot-quoted SOL futures. Back in May, enterprise blockchain firm R3 announced a collaboration with the Solana Foundation to link its permissioned Corda platform with the permissionless Solana blockchain. In one market-moving announcement, BlackRock confirmed the expansion of its tokenized money market fund BUIDL to Solana, a watershed moment for the fledgling blockchain. Continuing the streak of institutional interest, JPMorgan arranged for US commercial paper issuance on Solana to wrap up a stellar year for the network. All year long, an avalanche of corporate treasuries jostled to scoop sizable amounts of SOL with DeFi Development Corp and Upexi leading the way. On the regulatory front, the Solana Policy Institute notched impressive milestones throughout 2025. The year marked the expansion of the Solana Economic Zone to Kazakhstan, the first in Central Asia, with the team seeking out new frontiers. In line with the expansionist policy, the team hosted several Solana Apex events in 2025 to onboard new users. A wildly successful Accelerate event and the launch of Solana Spaces on Wall Street added steam to its aggressive expansionist goals. Amid the recap, SOL price has indicated flashes of brilliance over the last day. CoinMarketCap data indicates that SOL is trading at $126.17, up nearly 3% from an intra-day low of $123. SOL ETF inflows on December 30 spiked to $5.2 million after a lengthy decline. While it pales in comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum, the surge suggests that institutional investors are rotating into undervalued altcoins. Last week, an analyst described SOL as oversold, hinting at a near-term rally for the asset. Despite the uptick in SOL price, the asset has fallen by 57.13% from its all-time high of $294 that it set in early 2025.

Title: Strategy accumulates over 22,000 Bitcoin, RWAs top $19 billion: December in Charts

The Bitcoin price slump at the end of the year hasn’t discouraged Michael Saylor’s Strategy from buying over 22,000 BTC in December alone. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin’s price continued to fall as 2025 neared its end, declining 4% in December. Despite a slump in markets, Strategy capped off the year with massive Bitcoin buys. In December alone, the software company turned Bitcoin investment vehicle picked up over 22,000 Bitcoin (BTC). In the US, prediction markets are inking deals with major media outlets and scoring approvals from major federal agencies. However, in 11 states, gambling and gaming regulators are taking legal action against platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. Watchdogs state that such markets constitute a form of gambling, a claim the companies themselves dispute. As crypto grows more mainstream, hackers and scammers are increasingly targeting investors and protocols. In December, crypto exploits topped $22.5 million. Chainalysis also released its annual scam report, stating that crypto thefts hit $3.4 billion in 2025. Here’s December by the numbers: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin investment vehicle, Strategy, picked up another stack of Bitcoin in December. The publicly traded company bought 22,628 BTC this month, according to Strategy’s Bitcoin purchase disclosures. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 672,497 BTC, or roughly 3.3% of the 19.9 million Bitcoin currently in circulation. The purchases in December capped off a year of aggressive accumulation by Strategy. The company disclosed Bitcoin purchases in 41 separate weeks of 2025. That’s a marked increase from 18 weeks in 2024 and just eight in 2023. Related: Strategy’s latest 2025 Bitcoin purchase caps active year of accumulation Strategy’s success in offering debt to fund new Bitcoin purchases has inspired other companies to become “Bitcoin treasury firms” — i.e., companies that hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, 192 public companies hold almost 1.1 million BTC in their treasuries. Bitcoin’s price fell over 4% this month and is trading at $88,000 at publishing time. The asset is slated to end the year down below where it started, around $94,000, and well below its all-time high of $126,000 set in October. Some traders say that Bitcoin is set for further losses, possibly down to $40,000; that is, if the traditionally understood four-year boom-and-bust cycle is still intact. Not everyone is convinced, though. Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research, previously told Cointelegraph that institutional demand through things like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasuries has softened the blow. “While the bull market may face near-term consolidation amid macroeconomic pressures, we anticipate it will extend into 2026 with support from ongoing structural inflows and evolving market dynamics,” he said. Betting markets are making headway in the US. On Dec. 4, CNBC signed a contract with Kalshi to integrate real-time forecasting data from the betting market on CNBC’s TV, digital and subscription platforms. But state regulators are not pleased. That same week, Connecticut’s Department of Consumer Protection sent letters to Kalshi, Crypto.com and Robinhood, ordering them to cease operations in the state. There are now 11 states in which prediction markets are facing legal action from regulators. Kalshi similarly received cease-and-desist letters in Ohio, Illinois, Arizona, Montana and New York. Regulators in those states cited that the market was offering unlicensed gambling, a claim that Kalshi rejects. In Massachusetts, state prosecutors claim that Kalshi has disguised sports betting as “event contracts.” Kalshi said the state is “trying to block Kalshi’s innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas.” A spokesperson for the company previously told Cointelegraph, “It’s very different from what state-regulated sportsbooks and casinos offer their customers. We are confident in our legal arguments and have filed suit in federal court.” In December, hackers made away with $22.5 million across 10 incidents, according to data from DefiLlama, a drop in the bucket compared with other months this year. In February, hackers stole $1.4 billion in assets from the crypto exchange Bybit. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said in its annual crypto hack report that this year’s crypto thefts totaled $3.4 billion. It added that personal wallet attacks have “grown substantially, increasing from just 7.3% of total stolen value in 2022 to 44% in 2024. In 2025, the share would have been 37% if it weren’t for the outsized impact of the Bybit attack.” Sophisticated attacks from state-sponsored actors have been a particular problem for large, centralized organizations like crypto exchanges. Cybercriminals associated with the government of North Korea reportedly stole $2.02 billion in cryptocurrency this year. The total distributed asset value of real-world assets (RWAs) rose 3% in December, surpassing $19 billion. The largest section of these assets is tokenized US Treasurys at $8.7 billion, followed by commodities at $3.5 billion. This places RWAs as the fifth-largest asset category in decentralized finance by total value locked, according to DefiLlama, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs). “At the start of this year, they weren’t even in the top 10 categories,” DeFiLlama noted. A number of tokenized fund products like the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), Circle’s USYC, Franklin Templeton’s BENJI and Ondo’s OUSG are driving increased valuation with tokenized Treasurys. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer of Kronos Research, previously told Cointelegraph that for further growth in RWAs, “the constraint is no longer tokenization itself, but liquidity and integration into TradFi.” Magazine: Big questions: Would Bitcoin survive a 10-year power outage?

I joined the Prospect as a writing fellow in Spring 2025, just months before President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law. Much of my reporting out of the gate chronicled how our social safety net and constitutional democracy have been falling apart at the seams since Trump returned to the White House. While the focus of my coverage has varied over the past several months, a common thread that can be found throughout is arguably regulation. I’ve written about the implications of rolling back key guardrails designed to protect consumers, workers, and the environment. Many of those same stories highlighted the Trump administration’s attacks on federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Environmental Protection Agency, as well as the extent of regulatory capture taking hold at both the state and federal levels. Speaking of regulatory capture, a fair amount of my recent reporting has centered on the role of state-level public utility commissions in regulating investor-owned utilities. As compelling as it is to lay the blame on data centers for driving up electricity prices, utility commissions are responsible for setting rates. They also have the final say on whether regulated utilities can merge or be acquired by another company. In both instances, these commissions have largely refrained from challenging investor-owned utilities, instead opting to rubber-stamp rate increases and fold in the face of private utility takeovers. And with that, I’d like to reflect on a few stories I had the pleasure of writing for the Prospect in 2025. In April, the Department of Transportation declared open season on “burdensome” regulations to implement executive orders issued by President Trump in the early days and weeks of his second term. The freight rail industry, whose largest members are represented by the Association of American Railroads, made quick work of the opportunity to write its own rules and roll back regulations that impede extreme cost-cutting measures. At the time, I wrote about the industry’s push to reduce already threadbare crews with remotely operated or entirely autonomous trains, and replace visual safety inspections with Automated Track Inspection machines. Unions representing rail workers sounded the alarm on these safety-averse proposals. Organizers told me carriers’ efforts to automate the rail industry not only undermine labor, but endanger employees and trackside communities alike. Read the story. For this story, I teamed up with Prospect staff writer Whitney Curry Wimbish to dispel the allure of including private equity and cryptocurrency investments in personal retirement plans. Our reporting found that exposing the nation’s multitrillion-dollar defined contribution market to high-risk asset classes not only threatens to worsen the looming retirement crisis, but functionally provides a bailout to cash-strapped, underperforming private equity firms. Rather than democratizing access to a wider set of financial instruments, the Trump administration has signaled its willingness to soften existing regulatory guidance to give plan sponsors more cover for making these investments available to retail investors. Read the story. I went to the Twin Cities in October to attend the final Minnesota Public Utilities Commission hearing on BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ $6.2 billion proposal to acquire Minnesota Power and its parent company, ALLETE. The commission unanimously approved the deal, and we brought you inside the room where it all went down. My post-hearing dispatch was a follow-up to a previous story I had written about pushback against the acquisition and the Minnesota Department of Commerce’s role in drumming up support for the takeover. Read the story. Concurrently, I had been chipping away at what would become my first-ever long-form feature for the Prospect. The piece offers a comprehensive look at the root causes of soaring electricity prices, influence-peddling by investor-owned utilities, and efforts by public power advocates to trigger a paradigm shift in the fundamental design of the utility system. My reporting also took me to Milwaukee, where I shadowed organizers with Milwaukee Democratic Socialists of America’s Power to the People campaign. As one public power advocate told me, the energy system “connects all of us to one another in the country, no matter who you are or where you live, which makes it an incredible site for building back our relationships and our social fabric.” Read the story.

Full Content:
Greetings. Today we are starting the last Dark Room of 2025, with wishes for health and happiness in the salvific new year 2026, until we speak again, God willing, on Monday, January 5. Until then, and with the permission of our good farmers who are slightly relaxing the roadblocks, we will be able to go on holiday or at least move around the Greek countryside, probably with somewhat more wintry weather. Perhaps even with a little snow—don’t imagine anything dramatic. Otherwise, it seems that there must have been a lot of backlash in society against the tactics and behavior of the farmers who block the roads (something… more than what fell on the government), and that’s why they decided to step a bit aside and open the roads somewhat so people can go on their holidays or return to their homes. An era of frenzy… The truth is that in all the years I’ve been working, I don’t remember a single time, under any government, when the prime minister called a professional group—farmers or anyone else—to dialogue and they refused to go and instead sent an ultimatum. You might say, here we saw a soldier—indeed from the Special Forces—speaking at a protest rally about the budget, and the KKE and SYRIZA issuing statements because he was removed from the Special Forces and even received a prison sentence in the Army. Incredible things, right? Really, what would happen in Russia or China or Cuba if a conscript went to demonstrations—don’t the KKE or SYRIZA tell us? Of course, this is not allowed even in normal Western democracies, nor does the Greek Constitution allow it. Carols and coffees In any case, the government and parties are slowing down these days and until the beginning of next week things will be relaxed. Tasoulas, Mitsotakis, and the political leaders will listen to the customary carols today, and then each will take the road for the last gifts they need to buy and for the New Year’s Eve dinner. Mitsotakis was supposed to give an interview on SKAI radio, but it was postponed. In any case, he will stay within the city walls, and on New Year’s Day he will honor the… customs, that is, service at the Metropolis and then coffee with Tasoulas at Da Capo in Kolonaki Square, despite the biting cold that morning. And after that, off with the yoke, since after many years the rather outdated custom of New Year’s greetings at the Presidential Mansion was “cut.” ATHEX: “For reasons of transparency and legal certainty” The Capital Market Commission asked ATHEX—for reasons of clarity—to inform the investing public what happened with the previous General Meeting, the invitation to shareholders, whether anything was approved or not, etc. After the intervention, ATHEX issued an announcement that it is convening again the extraordinary General Meeting on 20/1/26, because “it was deemed necessary due to procedural issues of convening the GM of the 22nd, during which in any case no relevant decisions were taken.” The announcement concludes that the Meeting must be repeated “for reasons of transparency and legal certainty.” The first plans of Euronext: Streamlining ATHEX operations Meanwhile, the future president of ATHEX, who is now awaiting January 20 to assume his duties, Camil Beutin, is an Euronext executive specializing in energy and has worked for more than three decades at Euronext Oslo and Nord Pool (an energy platform owned by Euronext). He is coming to Athens with a specific agenda that he will immediately put into action. He will start with the introduction of new exchange products (e.g. ETFs, which are particularly popular in Amsterdam) and at the same time will try to include Greek mid-cap listed companies (from €200 to €500 million) on other Euronext platforms, in countries where they already have export activity and are known. His goal is to broaden the reach of listed companies with shareholder-investors from countries where Euronext operates. It also appears, however, that the (necessarily) president-in-waiting Camil Beutin intends to “dig into” some files with issues that fall within the logic of rationalization and streamlining of ATHEX’s operations. Bank of Epirus received signals for January On December 15, the Executive Act of the Governor (EPATh) of the Bank of Greece was issued regarding the conditions for converting cooperative banks into public limited companies. Essentially, the BoG gave the green light to the four cooperative banks (Karditsa, Chania, Epirus, Thessaly) to obtain a nationwide license provided they have minimum share capital of €18 million. The Bank of Epirus held an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders on December 29 to convert into a public limited company, in order to open the way for the entry of strategic investor Peter Nomikos, who has expressed his intention to invest €30 million. Information suggests that the management of the Bank of Epirus now has clear indications that the fit & proper approval of P. Nomikos will come from the SSM within January, and therefore it is preparing the ground for a €30 million share capital increase. It is important that the capital increase will take place without dilution, but at the book value of the Bank of Epirus—though we will see this. All cooperative banks are seeking a strategic investor Based on the EPATh of the Bank of Greece, the former Cooperative Banks must adjust their own funds no later than March 31, 2026, and of course must have completed the process of converting into public limited companies in order to attract investors. Information indicates that Cooperative Bank of Thessaly is one step closer to the entry of a strategic investor; Karditsa has already expanded into neighboring prefectures but has not yet announced a broadening of its shareholder base; while in Chania, Ioannis Michos, coming from London, has joined as Executive Member of the Board with the goal of capital strengthening. The issue of capital is extremely important, since banking is now a very expensive business. Whether a bank has 1 branch or 100 branches, the very costly IT systems must be installed, supervisory capital must be available, and auditing procedures must be complete and operational. The game has started, and the efforts to capture market shares will be of exceptional interest. Teachers, police officers, and firefighters in Intralot A significant number of domestic mutual funds have taken positions in Intralot. As shown by the company’s shareholder register at the recent General Meeting, the largest positions are held by Alpha Bank and Optima mutual funds (Optima Greek Balanced, Optima Greek Equity) with approximately 6.6 million shares each; the National Asset Management mutual funds with approximately 5.6 million shares; while a significant position continues to be held by K. Antonopoulos, former CEO of the company, with approximately 9.2 million shares. Beyond that, there are smaller positions held by pension funds such as the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, funds for police officers and firefighters of New Jersey, mutual funds of Vanguard, Aviva, BlackRock, MorningStar, etc. Swiss franc: Who will ultimately say “yes” to the restructuring Banks have already started running their models for Swiss franc loans, as the new year brings developments. In about two months, borrowers will be called upon to decide whether they will join the restructuring, making a decision that will determine the course of their loan from now on. Banks are trying to determine the acceptance mix of the restructuring, since this is what will lead them to accurately calculate their provisions. According to banks’ estimates, those who can join the restructuring are borrowers without income criteria, and they will do so if their loan is not particularly mature. If, however, it is mature, given that their interest rate increases from 0% plus a 1% spread to 2.90%, they have no reason to do so. On the other hand, banks estimate that the greatest interest in the restructuring will come from those entitled to higher haircuts, based on income criteria. For this group, joining the restructuring may prove to be more attractive and a substantial relief, since the haircut reaches 50% and the interest rate 2.30%. However, a significant issue arises here: to what extent these particular borrowers can service the restructuring. It is worth highlighting an important advantage for many borrowers with a long repayment horizon: by converting the loan into euros, they essentially start from a point of departure where from then on they will see the outstanding balance of their loan gradually decrease—something that until now did not happen, due to the continuous appreciation of the Swiss franc. 25 listed companies have closed 280 meetings in Paris On January 29, 2026, a Thursday, the Piraeus Bank roadshow with companies listed on the Athens Exchange will finally take place at the famous Espace Cléry in Paris. Participation has already been locked in for 21 listed companies, and an impressively large number of one-on-one meetings with investors—more than 280—has been recorded. There is particular activity and interest for the “newcomers” to this institution, smaller-cap companies such as Profile, Alumil, AVAX, and Alter Ego. On the banking side, participation has already been confirmed (also with many meetings) by Alpha Bank, Piraeus Bank, and Bank of Cyprus, followed by Metlen, Motor Oil, TITAN, OPAP, GEK TERNA, PPC, Athens International Airport, Cenergy, ELVALHALCOR, Aegean, HelleniQ Energy, Lamda Development, AVAX, KRI-KRI. Information indicates that the final number of participants will certainly reach 25, provided a sufficient number of one-on-one meetings is secured. Espace Cléry is an imposing, historic building in Paris’s 2nd arrondissement, in the heart of Sentier, and was once the residence of the famous painter Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun. There, the 25 listed companies will paint the future of the Athens Stock Exchange… The background behind the shipping deals of the Greeks Greek shipowners continue to work quietly and methodically, letting their moves speak for themselves. During the festive period, the “hits” were many. On the newbuilding front, Aegean Bulk Co. Inc. closed four 82,000 dwt bulkers at Hengli Shipbuilding (Dalian), with deliveries in 2027–2028—a move read as a steady investment in capacity, without haste but with a clear horizon. At the same time, Cape Shipping shows it is not moving away from crude: one firm and one optional VLCC 319,000 dwt at Qingdao Beihai Shipyard, for 2028, with scrubbers and a price around $119 million. Details matter here. In tankers, Capital Ship Management added two orders and two optional LR2/Aframax 114,000 dwt at Hengli, for delivery in 2028, discreetly strengthening its portfolio. V Group, on the other hand, opted for containers: two feeder 1,930 TEU at Guangzhou Wenchong Shipyard, LNG dual-fuel, with deliveries 2028–2029. Those who follow the trends take notes. And in LPG, Benelux Overseas proceeded with two VLACs 93,000 cbm at HD Hyundai in South Korea, also dual-fuel, with delivery in 2028—a move showing persistence in a specific strategic path. In second-hand tonnage, the Greeks were not absent. The capesize ANTONIS ANGELICOUSSIS (177,855 dwt, 2007, Shanghai Waigaoqiao) changed hands at $20.5 million to Greek interests, while Oceanstar Management Inc. acquired the Ultramax IVS WINDSOR (60,279 dwt, 2016, Oshima) with cranes, for $26 million. At the same time, Greek-controlled vessels were also on the sellers’ side: the Handysize APHRODITE M (36,000 dwt, 2011, SPP) at $12.5 million, as well as the pair of Post-Panamax PORTO KAGIO and PORTO GERMENO (5,908 / 5,570 TEU, 2002, Koyo Dockyard), linked to Costamare, at $17 million each. The background shows that these are not spasmodic moves. Over the last twelve months, Greek interests count 132 new orders, 158 second-hand purchases, and 14 sales for recycling. As 2025 reached its end, the picture is clear: fleet renewal, careful choices, and a game played without noise but with clear targeting. Navios: Premium now, but with timing risk The three-year charter of Navios Destiny of Navios, interests of Angeliki Frangou, at $34,000 per day from Cosco shows that the company is selling market strength in the present, securing premium revenues for a vessel whose age under other conditions would pressure rates. From analysts’ perspective, this is clearly accretive for upcoming results and improves the short-term cash flow picture. However, timing matters. The question is not whether the deal is good today—because it is. It is whether, in 18 or 24 months, the market will be higher or lower than these levels. Navios appears to be choosing certainty over optionality. For Wall Street, this is neither right nor wrong. It is simply a clear stance on how it currently reads the container shipping cycle. Petros Panagiotidis’ reverse split In the language of Wall Street analysts, Robin Energy’s move constitutes an act of compliance. The 1:5 reverse split was not carried out to change the narrative, but to close a technical risk: the loss of the Nasdaq’s $1 minimum price requirement. With the stock at $0.71, the management of Petros Panagiotidis chose the most direct and institutionally acceptable path. The result—a price of $3.58—restores the relationship with the market without creating expectations that cannot be supported. The $1 million buyback that preceded it is read by funds as a signal of stabilization, not as an aggressive positioning. At the same time, the data from the LPG carriers provide what managers are looking for: cash-flow visibility. Contracts with well-known counterparties, locked-in revenues of more than $5.5 million, and coverage of 59% of days for 2026 are not impressive, but they reduce risk. That is exactly what is reflected in the models. Robin, a spin-off of Toro Corp, is not attempting a high-profile repositioning. It demonstrates discipline with market rules and a focus on operational performance, with the MR tanker following the seasonal improvement in charter rates. For institutional investors, the message is clear: no promises of capital gains, predictability, and remaining on the board. The first victim of 2026 will be the yen Hedge funds are very much like sharks. Once they smell blood, they rush to devour whatever is still alive. At this time, many hedge funds have taken positions against the Japanese yen at levels that strongly resemble the crisis of July 2024. More than 85,000 contracts of net short positions were recorded on December 14, betting on further weakening of the Japanese currency. It all starts with the interest-rate differential between the dollar and the yen, which today reaches as much as 3 percentage points. The Bank of Japan, despite the recent rate hikes it deemed necessary, is moving cautiously so as not to choke growth. The problem, however, lies in Japan’s real interest rates. They remain negative, since inflation is running faster than the BoJ’s rates. Those who hold yen-denominated accounts see their purchasing power eroding and are seeking more profitable deposit options. This is a classic déjà vu. Around this time last year, the dollar–yen exchange rate had exceeded 160, forcing the Ministry of Finance to proceed with immediate intervention to support the national currency. Some believe the same will happen this year. That is why they are taking short positions, expecting intervention. The U.S. stock market is flying. But not all of it… Everyone admires the U.S. stock indices, their resilience and momentum. But indices do not tell the whole truth. The 10 largest companies on Wall Street now account for 22% of global stock market capitalization. This is the highest level of the past 50 years. The top five alone reach 15%. It is a historic record. Goldman Sachs processed a chart of funding spreads that reveals the other side of the story. Professional investors are moving with extreme caution. Funding spreads are dropping sharply despite the upward course of the S&P 500. This divergence is a classic warning: when large institutional investors reduce their leverage even as the market rises, they are usually pricing in major turbulence. Concentration in a few stocks—the famous “Magnificent Seven” and a few more technology giants—creates the illusion of diversification. All investment advisors urge diversification: don’t put all your eggs in one basket, diversify your investment choices. An investor who thinks that by holding a global index ETF they are diversified, in reality has 22% of their exposure in just 10 companies. In roughly the same sector. Obviously, these 10 companies stand out today for their size and prospects. But if there is a sudden change of scenery, if something changes in laws and regulations, what will happen? Already today, investors in Artificial Intelligence companies are no longer satisfied with potential; they want concrete results after three years of gigantic investments. But what if those investments do not deliver as expected? What if something unforeseen happens? Explore related questions

Title: My 2026 Investment Plan

I recently automated withdrawals from one conservative Traditional IRA (Core TIRA) into my short-term investment bucket for basic spending needs and emergencies. Previously, I automated withdrawals from a more aggressive Traditional IRA for longer-term discretionary spending needs. This exercise increased my focus on income. I just added Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) to my Core TIRA sub-portfolio as a lower-risk income fund rather than to pursue higher returns. The Core TIRA is conservate Traditional IRA, within the Intermediate Investment Bucket, that is intended to have long-term returns of 7% or more on average, have maximum drawdowns of -15% or less during a severe bear market, and provide steady income of at least 4%. This sub-portfolio has an allocation to stocks of 25%, but utilizes six funds classified as “flexible portfolio” or “alternative”. Now that I have completed the Core TIRA portfolio, I am preparing for a mid-2026 review when a bond matures and needs to be reinvested. In this article, I review historical distribution yields and look at the life-of-fund drawdowns and correlations. I evaluate the performance of the Core TIRA over the past five years with and without Standpoint Multi-Asset as a potential purchase, and compare the results against Vanguard Global Wellesley. I conclude with long-term views of the economy by the OECD, the Federal Reserve survey of professional forecasters, and a look at Vanguard’s time-varying portfolio. I wanted to understand the potential for the funds in my Core TIRA to produce a steady income of 4% per year. Some funds in the Core TIRA have yields, including capital gains, that fluctuate with the interest rate cycle, others that fluctuate according to the stock market cycle, and still others that provide a steady stream of income. I calculated the total distribution since 2019 by year from historical prices at the NASDAQ website and distribution history from Seeking Alpha. Yields for 2025 will change with end-of-year distributions. Table #1 shows the yields per year for each of the funds in my Core TIRA, with red shading indicating the lowest yield and blue shading the highest. All of the funds yielded at least 3.2% over the past six years, with PAIMX yielding 6.0%. Those whose inception date is after 2019 have the symbol highlighted in yellow. Three funds (FPFIX, JAAA, PVCMX) have higher yields when interest rates are high, and may have downward pressure on yields as interest rates fall. Those whose yield fluctuates more with the stock market cycle (PCBAX, AVALX, CTFAX) appear to have larger distributions when opportunities in the stock market appear to be low. PMAIX and PONAX have the most consistent distributions, with PMAIX having the potential for a higher total return. Of the two funds that I am considering adding in my mid-2026 review, EAGMX has high steady yields, while REMIX has a low correlation to the S&P 500 and bonds, and a higher potential for total return. Table #1: Historical Distribution Yield Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset, Seeking Alpha, NASDAQ. The objective of the Core TIRA portfolio, including the bond ladder, is to provide steady returns and cash flow that grow with inflation into my Investment Bucket #1 for spending even through a secular bear market. Table #2 shows how funds in my Core TIRA have performed over their lives, sorted from lowest risk to highest. All of the funds had an APR of almost 4% or higher during their lives. “APR Min 10-yr Roll” shows the return for the worst ten-year rolling period within the life of the fund. The purpose of finding uncorrelated funds is to ensure that funds are not moving down at the same time. For long-term stability, I like CTFAX and PMAIX, which had “APR Min 10-yr Roll” of 4.7% or more. Table #2: Author’s Core TIRA Portfolio – Life of Fund Metrics Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I used Portfolio Visualizer to further analyze the Core TIRA portfolio for the past five years, including adding REMIX as shown in Table #3. I compare it to Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX), which I also own elsewhere. The link to Portfolio Visualizer Portfolio Backtesting is provided here. Table #3: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer Figure #1 shows the growth of $10,000 invested in the Core TIRA with and without REMIX, and Vanguard Global Wellesley (VGYAX, VGWIX). I like how REMIX fits into the Core TIRA portfolio, and it increases income. I own Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts for its professional management and simplicity. Figure #1: Analyzing Adding REMIX to the Core TIRA Sub-Portfolio Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer The funds can be loosely divided into three groups based on the past six years: 1) those that had low drawdowns (PVCMX, FPFIX, PCBAX, EAGMX), 2) those that had their maximum drawdown during The Great Normalization with rising rates (PONAX, PZRMX, CTFAX, and IAU), and 3) those that had their maximum drawdown during the COVID bear market (PMAIX, AVALX). Table #4 is the correlation matrix for the funds. They have low correlation with each other; however, PONAX, PZRMX, PMAIX, and CTFAX are moderately correlated. Table #4: Correlation Matrix Source: Author Using Portfolio Visualizer My conservative Core TIRA sub-portfolio consists of three funds classified as “alternatives”, three mixed asset funds in the “Flexible Portfolio” Lipper Category, and two in the “Multi-Sector Income” Category. I try to capture the objective and strategy of the funds below: Alternative Global Macro: Lipper Definition: Funds that, by prospectus language, invest around the world using economic theory to justify the decision-making process. The strategy is typically based on forecasts and analysis about interest rate trends, the general flow of funds, political changes, government policies, intergovernmental relations, and other broad systemic factors. These funds generally trade a wide range of markets and geographic regions, employing a broad range of trading ideas and instruments. Morningstar classifies PCBAX as “Macro Trading”, but EAGMX as “Nontraditional Bond”. Absolute Return: Lipper Definition: Funds that aim for positive returns in all market conditions. The funds are not benchmarked against a traditional long-only market index but rather have the aim of outperforming a cash or risk-free benchmark. David Snowball wrote Standpoint Multi-Asset Fund: Forcing Me to Reconsider in the November 2021 MFO Newsletter: “The fund provides exposure to equities (which help in times of economic growth or inflation), fixed income (which buffers deflationary periods and stock market declines), and commodities (which are uncorrelated with the first two, making it possible to minimize the effects of both sustained price changes and of an equity market decline). Half of the portfolio is invested in low-cost ETFs to give exposure to the global equity market. The argument is simple: over time, equities make serious money, especially if you don’t overpay for them. The fund holds eight equity ETFs charging between 3 and 7 basis points. The other half of the portfolio is managed futures positions. The positions can be in stocks and fixed income, as well as currencies and commodities. ‘Once a year we pull down the information on all the future contracts in the world, arrayed from most liquid to least liquid. We exclude the untradeable, then select the 75 most liquid in six sectors which includes equity index futures, bond futures, currencies, metals, energy, and agricultural commodities.’ Using a market following strategy, the futures contracts allow the portfolio’s exposure to equity markets to be increased beyond its 50% base (it was at 65% in mid-summer) or decreased to near zero.” Flexible Portfolio: Lipper Definition: Funds that allocate their investments to both domestic and foreign securities across traditional asset classes with a focus on total return. The traditional asset classes utilized are common stocks, bonds, and money market instruments. Morningstar classifies PZRMX as “Global Conservative Allocation”, PMAIX as “Global Moderate Allocation”, and CTFAX as “Tactical Allocation”. In Figure #2, I compare Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) to PCBAX, PMAIX, and CTFAX. Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) has a smooth, low-risk profile and yields 5.6%. EAGMX had a maximum drawdown of -3% during the Great Financial Crisis, while PCBAX had a drawdown of -29%. I bought PCBAX because it has returned 4.9% annualized since 2010, while EAGMX returned 3.4%. I favor REMIX for its low correlation to other funds in the Core TIRA. Figure #2: Comparison of Funds in Watch List to Core Funds in Portfolio Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. During the first half of this decade, the investment environment has experienced a lot of turbulence. I expect the second half to be more turbulent and have reduced risk accordingly. I recently attended the Economy Watch webinar by The Conference Board. They estimate that global growth will moderate over the next 15 years, and long-term growth in the U.S. will slow to less than 2.0%. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released its OECD Economic Outlook, Volume 2025 Issue 2, which shows its estimates of real GDP growth in the U.S. to be below 2.0% in 2026 and 2027. The Fourth Quarter 2025 Survey of Professional Forecasters by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia estimates that real GDP will be 1.8% in 2026, 2.1% in 2027, and 1.8% in 2028. In my opinion, the U.S. economy is experiencing slowing growth in the late stage of the business cycle. Vanguard updated its time-varying portfolio in Bonds Remain In Favor In Time-Varying Model Portfolio. They describe it as, “The TVAA strategy is built on the framework of the Vanguard Asset Allocation Model (VAAM), driven by forecasts generated by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM).” Their TVAA model results in a globally diversified 40/60 portfolio tilted toward value, as shown in Figure #3. The TVAA has an expected annualized 10-year return of 5.7%. Figure #3: Vanguard TVAA Model Source: Vanguard calculations, as of October 31, 2025 I use financial advisors at Vanguard to manage a portion of my portfolio using both index and actively managed funds. The time-varying strategy is not one of the options available. Over the past year, I have lowered my overall stock-to-bond allocation from 65% to 50% with a below-average allocation to technology because I expect stocks to have below-average returns. I invest in Vanguard Global Wellesley in other accounts, which has a 40/60 allocation, but also in Vanguard Global Wellington, which has a 60/40 allocation. I can sleep at night with the Bucket Approach and my Core TIRA account to meet essential spending needs and emergencies even in a secular bear market. During my mid-2026 review, I will ensure that sufficient funds are in place to meet 2027 withdrawals and confirm if I want to: 1) extend a rung in the bond ladder with iShares iBonds Dec 2034 Term Corporate ETF (IBDZ), 2) add Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to the Core TIRA, 3) increase the allocation to Victory Pioneer Multi-Asset Income (PMAIX) because of its focus on steady and high income, and 4) reduce investments in non-core bond funds. I don’t plan to sell any of the ten core funds in the Core TIRA. I wish everyone a happy and prosperous 2026. Lynn Bolin retired in June 2022 and is immensely enjoying the more relaxed lifestyle.

Welcome to the New Year’s issue of the Mutual Fund Observer. We’re glad you’re here. Heraclitus, the famously elusive Greek philosopher, reminded his students that you cannot step into the same river twice. Both we and the river will have changed. According to legend, one of those students – snarky little barstid – replied: “I don’t think you can step into the same river once.” Even as we step, the river flows and changes. As do we. Heraclitus was speaking of a physical river. Centuries later, we have extended his insights to allow us to consider the River of Time itself: the continuous flow in which change happens, meaning accumulates, and our lives—and markets—actually unfold. January has that fluid quality. We think of ourselves standing on the bank of the River, looking backward and forward at once—convinced that the past can be measured and the future mapped, even as the present slips by almost unnoticed. The river does not pause for our resolutions. In reality, we don’t just get to watch time rush past; we are not on the bank, we are in the river. We may think we resolutely face the future, eyes upstream, scrying risk and opportunity. We may turn our back to the torrent, knowing that we can only know what has already passed and contemplating the dark sea into which it must eventually empty. We might be still and resolute, like a stone, or moving along with the flow. The young might experience a mere ankle-deep flow while some of us experience … the deeper currents pulling toward that wine-dark sea. Perspective matters. And metaphors matter because they teach us what to look for. From the riverbank, all motion feels alarming. From within the river, we begin to notice that not all movement means change, not all froth is consequential, and not all change arrives with noise. Some of what most shapes our lives—technological shifts, medical progress, environmental repair—moves steadily, almost invisibly, beneath the surface. This January issue of the Observer lingers over a stretch of the river that many hurried past. Amid the noise and anxiety of 2025, extraordinary things went quietly right: a vast expansion of green energy in China, meaningful progress against several endemic diseases, and other developments that rarely commanded headlines but may shape lives for decades to come. Uncertain times require clear thinking, and clear thinking requires … well, a functioning brain. In “New Year’s Resolution #1: Avoid lobotomies” we look at the threat that AI seductively poses to brains … yours, your alma mater’s, and your investment advisor’s. A short sidebar piece, “What Five AI Told Me About Investing in 2026, and what their answers tell you,” highlights the problematic patterns in AI’s response to an (admittedly unfair) question about what’s going to win in the year ahead. Our colleague Lynn Bolin contributes two complementary pieces exploring income-focused investing for the uncertain years ahead. In “My 2026 Investment Plan,” Lynn walks through the construction of his conservative Core TIRA portfolio – a traditional IRA designed to generate a steady income of at least 4% while limiting drawdowns to -15% during severe bear markets. He demonstrates how different funds yield differently depending on whether they’re responding to interest rate cycles or stock market cycles, and evaluates adding Standpoint Multi-Asset (REMIX) to improve diversification. Particularly valuable: Lynn’s analysis of how his portfolio performed through both the COVID bear market and the Great Normalization’s rising rates, and his discussion of why he’s moved from a 65% stock allocation to 50% as forecasts from the OECD, Federal Reserve, and Conference Board all point to slowing growth ahead. Vanguard’s own time-varying model now recommends a 40/60 stocks-to-bonds allocation – a near-revolutionary flip from the traditional 60/40. In “A Closer Look at Income Strategy,” Lynn drills deeper into the mechanics of generating steady income in an environment where short and intermediate Treasury yields are falling while long-term rates rise. Working from 30,000 feet (which Lipper categories produce income in low-yield environments) down to ground level (specific fund recommendations), he identifies funds that maintained consistent yields through multiple market cycles. His analysis reveals that some funds distribute more when stock market opportunities appear limited, while others fluctuate with interest rates – and a select few provide genuinely steady income regardless of market conditions. The payoff: an example portfolio that achieved 7.7% annual returns with a maximum drawdown of just -9.8% over the past six years while yielding 5.2%. The Shadow, as ever, surveys the month’s most consequential changes in the fund and ETF world in “Briefly Noted.” We also pause, briefly and with gratitude, to acknowledge those who have sustained the Observer—financially, intellectually, and through simple acts of encouragement. And then, before the current carries us onward, we raise a glass to what has been, to what is, and to what may yet emerge from upstream. Pessimism is easy. Way too easy, frankly. If I were to construct the Pessimism Industrial Complex, it would have three pillars: The federal government is controlled by toddlers, a bunch famous for tantrums when their irrational, I-am-the-universe demands are not met. And so we get the Trump Kennedy Center, chaired by Donald J. Trump and the Donald J. Trump US Institute for Peace. The Trump-class battleships that will populate The Golden Fleet. The Trump dollar coin. The Trump accounts for infants. The decision to make access to the national parks free on Trump’s birthday, which, I think, is somewhere in the month of Trumpruary. There are no adults left in the room. Interviews with three departing US senators made two points: (1) every member of the US Senate is appalled and (2) they’re all waiting “for the right time” to, you know, develop a spine, remember their oath of office, or something (“Why Won’t Senators Stand Up to Trump? We Asked 3 Who Called It Quits,” New York Times, 12/13/2025). Until then, the federal response to a global climate crisis is “don’t wanna and you can’t make me!” When you’re dealing with a creature named “The Doomsday Glacier,” it’s easy to foresee Bad Things Aplenty. The media loves reporting bad news. We don’t know where the newsroom adage “if it bleeds, it leads” originated – the confident online assertions about Hearst in the 1890s is unattributed and a random New York Magazine article in 1989 is laughably wrong – but it does express a well-documented truth. Bad news sells, terrible news sells more. A 20-year study of German media found a “significant, positive correlations between explicitly negative cover pages and the magazines’ sales” (Arango-Kure and Marcel Garz, “Bad News Sells,” Journal of Media Economics, 2014). Globally, every additional negative word added to a story’s title increases readership (Robertson, et al, “Negativity drives online news consumption,” Nature: Human Behavior, 2023; btw, their study of 105,000 online news stories also found that positive words in titles drove down readership) and the more negative a story is, the more frequently and widely it’s shared on social media (Watson, et al, “Negative online news articles are shared more to social media,” Scientific Reports, 2024). You love to doom-scroll. Doom‑scrolling, for the three of you who didn’t know, is the practiced art of dragging your thumb down an endless feed of bad news long after you have stopped learning anything new. It is not just “reading the news online”; it is staying locked in the loop of crisis headlines, live‑updated horrors, and algorithm-driven outrage until your mood and sense of the world are thoroughly saturated. Some psychologists speculate that it’s a hard-wired behavior; within evolutionary time-frames, our survival depends on obsessively locating and assessing all potential threats in our neighborhood (“is that a nice kitty or a creature whose nickname for me is ‘niblet’?”), and doom-scrolling is just the latest iteration of the impulse. Surveys and behavioral studies suggest that a substantial minority of adults, and a flat‑out majority of younger users, now report doom‑scrolling regularly (“Gen Z has a doomscrolling problem,” Newsweek, 5/11/2025). In those same studies, heavier doom‑scrolling is consistently associated with higher levels of stress, depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and even secondary trauma symptoms, a joy of witnessing wave after wave of misery through a four‑inch screen (Satici, et al, “Doomscrolling Scale: its Association with Personality Traits, Psychological Distress, Social Media Use, and Wellbeing,” Applied Research in the Quality of Life, 2022). And, boy howdy, is there a fair number of regrettable developments in the world. Andrew Winston’s curiously optimistic essay in Forbes (“2025: the year sustainability didn’t die,” 12/21/2025) began with a fairly bracing list of negatives: … the harsh reality is the world’s greatest challenges [are] getting worse. Inequality grew, especially at the very top, where individuals amassed unfathomable wealth (hundreds of billions of dollars) and some corporate valuations hit unreal heights ($4 trillion to $5 trillion). Meanwhile, climate impacts escalated; political winds don’t change actual winds. For example, part of Los Angeles burned to the ground (at an estimated cost of up to $250 billion) during unprecedented wildfires, historic heat baked India, Pakistan, and the EU, and devastating floods in Texas killed dozens of children. Scientists told us that climate change is “beyond scientific dispute,” at “tipping points,” and “extremely dangerous” (and that the world will blow past the 1.5C warming target). Insurer Allianz issued an eye-popping report that climate change could “destroy capitalism.” In addition, the world got less democratic and pulled to the right and generally away from the sustainability agenda, making collective action even harder. This puts more pressure on businesses. And even facing headwinds, sustainability didn’t die. That’s the top story of the year. Let’s look at that and some other big themes. Well … yeah. But if pessimism feels effortless at the end of 2025, that is not just because the news is bad; it is because you are mainlining it, in real time, on an interface designed never to run out. Much of our success as a species is driven by two factors: a good plan and resilience in executing it. The media’s business model tends to emphasize doom because, well, doom sells. But 2025 offered remarkable evidence that when we commit to sustained action—plugging ozone holes, protecting beaches, installing solar panels, developing breakthrough medicines, restoring ecosystems—we can achieve transformations that once seemed impossible. In our draft letter, what follows are eleven pages of incredibly consequential, positive developments. Chip’s anguished plea, “have mercy on their eyes!” led us to share the news in two forms: a dozen bullet points here and a dozen pages of detail in a sidebar story entitled, “The Big Box of Delights.” So here’s what happened while doom was scrolling: In November, a liquor store employee in Virginia discovered broken bottles and an apparently intoxicated raccoon sleeping on the store’s bathroom floor. An animal control officer noted that he fell through a ceiling tile, “went on a rampage, drinking everything,” with a special fondness for … umm, whisky. The animal showed no signs of injury, according to local animal protection services, though they guessed the raccoon might be grappling with “a hangover” and regret over “poor life choices.” Figure 1: Raccoon regretting its poor life choices. Source: NBC News. The story delighted readers across the political spectrum—a rare moment of shared laughter in a divided time. But it became more than a viral moment when merchandise commemorating the raccoon’s night of debauchery raised a quarter of a million dollars for the local animal shelter that housed him. The Hanover County animal protection service teamed up with apparel maker Bonfire to create shirts, sweatshirts, cups, and stickers featuring the now-infamous image of a raccoon spreadeagled next to a spilled booze bottle, along with the words “Trashed Panda.” Through 12/22, they’ve sold 19,764 against a goal of 20,000. The drunk raccoon reminds us that hope sometimes arrives in unexpected forms: in a hungover raccoon that brings people together, in merchandise that funds animal care, in our capacity to find joy and meaning in the absurd. On Christmas Day, Pope Leo made his traditional papal “Urbi et Orbi” address, Latin for “To the City and to the World,” which summarizes the bad news (see above, plus your danged doomscroll) and prescribes a response: put aside indifference, stop scrolling and start acting, stand with the oppressed rather than the oppressive. “There will be peace when our monologues are interrupted and, enriched by listening, we fall to our knees before the humanity of the other.” Stop wasting our time demonizing one another? Dreamer. Progress is rarely dramatic. It’s built day by day through the determined efforts of scientists, healthcare workers, conservationists, educators, and ordinary citizens working to solve problems both great and small. While 2025’s headlines often focused on conflict and crisis, millions of people worldwide continued humanity’s long tradition of quietly building a better world. They dreamt of better, and acted. The answer to “what’s there to be optimistic about?” is the same as it was in 2025, and will be in 2027: enormous things happened because millions of good people rejected the counsel of despair, and that you probably didn’t hear about because doom sells better than progress. The choice isn’t between naive optimism and realistic despair. It’s between staying informed about what’s actually happening—the turtle populations recovering, the emissions curves bending, the diseases being eliminated, the hungover raccoons raising money for animal shelters—and letting a curated feed of catastrophe convince you that nothing good is possible. Step away from the mediated world and step into the immediate one. Put your phones away. Hug someone today. Smile at a stranger. Do a good deed. Read a book. We recommend Always Remember (2025), a singularly beautiful little 30-minute read that reminds you of important things you already know but need to hear. Subscribe to Nautilus, a site (and magazine) that reminds you that science is cool … and important. Consider joining The Conversation, a site that has actual researchers write clear articles about important topics (“Deepfakes leveled up in 2025. Here’s what’s coming next.”) Be like Jimmy the President. Be like Leo the Pope. Be like the Drunken Raccoon. Make a difference where you are. (Want cool pictures, more detail, and a couple more stories? Open “The Big Box o’ Delights.” Or, if you’re in the long-scroll version, just keep scrolling!) The question’s not hypothetical, at least for investors. In truth, you have no idea of what’s coming. If you knew, you’d be richer than Croesus. Two things are true when we stand in the river of time: we can see neither the river’s bottom nor what’s coming at us from just around the bend. The bottom might fall out. The torrent might be nearly upon us. We cannot know, but we’ve still got to act. In general, the guides that professionals use are called “capital market assumptions” – data-driven estimates of the range of likely outcomes given current inputs. “Given a CAPE of 40 and capex spending of X, the likeliest range of US equity returns over the next 3-5 years falls between…” The recommendations that flow from those assumptions are called “strategic asset allocations,” statements that say broadly “a prudent investor with an intermediate time horizon should plan on holding X% in equities, with the possibility of some adjustments as markets evolve.” The problem is that there are a million factors weighing on markets, but not all million – birth rates in Nigeria? thawing permafrost in Siberia? financial nihilism in Gen Z? – can be incorporated into the models. Different trillion-dollar advisors reach very different trillion-dollar conclusions about what course to chart. Two of the largest firms – BlackRock and Vanguard – seem to have reached starkly different conclusions about prudent investor behavior. Given Vanguard’s intrinsic conservativeness, their new recommendation seems particularly tectonic. Vanguard’s call: For investors with a medium-term outlook (3-5 years), flip the traditional 60% stocks/40% bonds allocation to 40/60. Same expected returns as 60/40, but with substantially less risk. Why? The S&P 500’s CAPE ratio sits at 40.40 – rivaling the dot-com bubble peak. Vanguard projects US equities will return just 3.5% to 5.5% annually over the next decade, while growth stocks (including the Magnificent Seven) may deliver only 2.3% to 4.3%. Meanwhile, bonds now offer 3.8% to 4.8% with far less volatility. Roger Aliaga-Díaz, Vanguard’s global head of portfolio construction: “We see that overvaluation of equity markets more as a risk to the investor than as opportunity.” This isn’t panic or market timing. In a December podcast, Vanguard’s chief economists explained that “stay the course” never meant “never adjust your allocation.” It meant stay invested, avoid emotional decisions, but use evidence-based risk management. Their Time-Varying Asset Allocation model – driven by the Vanguard Capital Markets Model that processes decades of data on risk factors and returns – now suggests this is a moment for conservative asset allocation. They estimate a 25-30% probability that AI disappoints and fails to deliver on current expectations. Goldman Sachs concurs on muted US prospects, forecasting just 6.5% annual S&P 500 returns through 2035 – driven by earnings, not the multiple expansion that powered the last decade. They see better opportunities elsewhere: Emerging Markets (+10.9%), Asia ex-Japan (+10.3%), Japan (+8.2%). The “multiple expansion era” is over, they argue. Profit margins already jumped from 5% in 1990 to 13% today and can’t expand further. BlackRock takes the opposite view: Stay pro-risk, overweight US stocks on the AI theme. Yes, valuations are stretched, and concentration is concerning, but AI capital spending is transforming the economy at an unprecedented scale. The challenge isn’t whether to reduce equity exposure – it’s identifying which companies beyond the current winners will capture AI revenues as they spread across sectors. Their 2026 outlook emphasizes “the diversification mirage” – that traditional diversifiers like long-term Treasuries now offer diminished cushion, so seek idiosyncratic returns in private markets and active strategies instead. T. Rowe Price splits the difference: Neutral on equities overall but underweight US large-cap (-2.0%) while overweight small-cap, international, and emerging markets. They’re concerned about “the narrowness of AI trends” and prefer to position for market broadening. Like Vanguard, they’re underweight long-term bonds, worried about fiscal deficits keeping upward pressure on rates. What’s an investor to make of this? The honest answer is that nobody knows what’s upstream. Vanguard’s systematic approach says: when you can’t see around the bend, measure what you can – valuations, yields, historical risk/return relationships – and position defensively. BlackRock’s view: the AI build-out is real, the momentum is powerful, stay engaged but stay nimble. Both might be right over different time horizons. The shift isn’t just theoretical. Our colleague Lynn Bolin has reduced his overall stock allocation from 65% to 50% over the past year, positioning his conservative Core TIRA portfolio to weather what he expects will be a more turbulent second half of the decade. My own long-term allocation, which we discuss each February along with my portfolio, is 50/50. Research Affiliates, whose long-term asset allocation system has been broadly validated, offers striking support for the defensive shift. Their models project that a global 60/40 portfolio will deliver just 2.5% real returns over the next decade with a Sharpe ratio of 0.16. Their conservative model portfolio – shifting to 40% equity/60% bonds with commodities and inflation-linked assets – projects 3.5% real returns with a Sharpe ratio of 0.44. The more defensive portfolio projects higher returns with better risk-adjusted performance. Their analysis also reinforces Goldman’s geographic thesis: looking across asset classes globally, US large-cap growth shows near-zero risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio of -0.01), while developed ex-US large-cap value, emerging markets, and smaller international stocks all show meaningfully better prospects. The message is consistent: lighten on US growth, reduce overall equity exposure, look globally. The takeaway isn’t that one firm has discovered the answer. It’s that even trillion-dollar asset managers using sophisticated models reach honestly different conclusions from the same data. Vanguard says reduce equity risk because valuations are stretched and bonds are finally paying again. BlackRock says stay engaged because AI momentum is real and traditional diversifiers don’t work like they used to. Goldman says look elsewhere entirely – emerging markets and Asia offer better prospects than US equities. Research Affiliates’ models strongly favor the defensive positioning. Which suggests that broad diversification driven by your needs – not by greed or fear or the confident pronouncements of any single adviser – remains the most prudent course when standing in a river whose depths and currents we cannot fully know. The evidence from multiple independent sources supports a more conservative stance than the traditional 60/40 for those with intermediate time horizons. Whether that means 50/50, 40/60, or some other mix depends on your own circumstances, goals, and capacity to weather volatility. But the days of assuming that 60/40 will automatically deliver double-digit returns through multiple expansion and tech dominance? Those have already flowed past us.

Title: BlackRock dumps, Saylor buys: Holiday chaos erupts as crypto market ends 2025

Together, they show two very different institutional approaches to Bitcoin exposure. While many regular investors were relaxing during the holidays, the world’s biggest asset manager was making major moves. BlackRock quietly transferred $214 million worth of Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] to Coinbase Prime in a series of year-end transactions, as reported by Arkham. These transfers come at a key moment for the company’s crypto ETFs, as both IBIT and ETHA are seeing falling investor interest. The on-chain activity suggests BlackRock is no longer just holding crypto; it’s actively managing liquidity to handle a wave of investor redemptions. The $214 million shift appears to be a direct response to cooling demand for U.S. crypto ETFs. Since 18th December, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has faced steady outflows, with $7.9 million leaving the fund on the 29th of December alone. That same day, all U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs together saw $19.3 million in withdrawals. Ethereum ETFs are facing similar pressure, with BlackRock’s ETHA losing $13.3 million on the 29th of December, nearly doubling the entire day’s net outflow for Ethereum ETFs. This pattern shows that many institutional investors are pulling back, likely because of year-end tax-loss harvesting and profit-taking after a volatile final quarter. While ETF investors are stepping back, Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is doing the opposite. On the same day, BlackRock saw redemptions, Strategy bought another 1,229 BTC for $108.85 million as per Lookonchain data. The company paid an average of $88,568 per Bitcoin, raising its total holdings to an incredible 672,497 BTC. Despite recent market swings, Strategy is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of about $8.31 billion, a 16% gain overall. This creates an interesting contrast in the crypto market, wherein BlackRock is acting as a liquidity provider, moving BTC and ETH onto exchanges to help ETF investors cash out. Meanwhile, Strategy is acting as a liquidity sink, buying Bitcoin and holding it long-term, taking supply out of the market. Yet, despite all this movement, prices have barely reacted. Bitcoin at press time was changing hands at $87,900, up only 0.24% in 24 hours. On the other hand, Ethereum was trading at $2,974, with a small 0.45% gain. This price-flow divergence, with big movements of money without big moves in price, shows that the market likely expected these end-of-year withdrawals. Therefore, as we move into January, attention will shift from these withdrawals to the new year’s sentiment. Now, whether Saylor can pull retail investors back into the market is still unclear, but one thing is obvious from the on-chain data: the weak hands are exiting, and the biggest players are simply repositioning for 2026.

Title: ROOKE: The Somali Fraud Scandal Gave Trump A Kill Switch. What Happens If He Doesn’t Use It

Americans are demanding action. Anything less will lead to political chaos. “Long Live The King,” The New York Times wrote in February when President Donald Trump posted a picture of himself as Napoleon Bonaparte alongside a quote attributed to the French emperor, “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law.” It was this level of boldness to do the right thing for our country, no matter the costs, that led millions of Americans to vote for Trump’s second term. The Trump administration started strong. Americans wanted deportations, a rollback on every left-wing ideological policy implemented during the Biden years, and an all-out assault on government fraud and bloat that had become all too common in D.C. He took immediate action on the most critical issues voters mandated in the 2024 election. For a brief moment, it felt like the power we had given Trump and Republicans was paying off in Americans’ favor. Some even dared to say that we had finally gotten our country back. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!) But something happened over the summer. As left-wing judges blocked the Trump administration at every turn, refusing to let deportations continue, and Republicans in Congress failed to codify most of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cuts that were made, the momentum had shifted back to the bureaucratic blob. This is not to say that the Trump administration has stopped working on these issues, but the rapid-fire successes Americans saw in the first 100 days seemed to have come to an abrupt halt. Congressional Republicans resumed their backdoor dealing, ensuring that important voter wishes were dropped from legislation before it even reached the floor. Americans couldn’t afford to take their eye off of Congress even for a moment lest their elected representatives would secretly be selling their birthright off to BlackRock and Vanguard behind their backs. We don’t need to sell federal land and turn our wilderness into housing developments. If we need more housing, let’s round up all the illegals who don’t belong in this country and evict them. That’ll free up millions of housing units in one fell swoop. Leave the federal land… — Matt Walsh (@MattWalshBlog) June 20, 2025 Then Trump came out and called the face of government corruption – The Epstein List – a hoax. We saw that Democrats were trying to weaponize the human trafficker to own Trump. Still, there was an understanding that Trump would save this country no matter the cost. But Americans were told not to look at it. Attorney General Pam Bondi paraded influencers out with binders of useless pages that did nothing to bring any of the bad actors to justice. Still, we were told to trust the plan. The economic strains on Americans persisted as the summer months passed. Trump flew all around the world settling foreign wars for countries that wouldn’t hesitate to ignore our calls should something kick off here at home. While some of these trips were crucial to ensuring our national economic security, the optics of them, while Americans suffered back home, were less than helpful to his mission. And unless you were clued into the political world, it’s unlikely you saw these trips as anything but an administration focused more abroad than on its citizens. Unsurprisingly, Trump’s polling trended downwards. Americans wanted more relief, action, signs of life. Regardless of what it was, they expected to see more from this administration, which had promised an end to D.C. corruption. Instead, they got a government shutdown, brought on by the same slimy officials who have never hidden their contempt for their constituents. If there was ever a black pill forced down the throats of voters, watching this circus play out live was the ultimate one. Gallup poll | 11/3-11/25 President Trump approval Disapprove 60% (+6) Approve 36% (-5)https://t.co/RFvzrLjT6Z https://t.co/treMZzeKK9 pic.twitter.com/PsH6z5Im0p — Politics & Poll Tracker 📡 (@PollTracker2024) November 28, 2025 When the November elections came and Republican voters who had turned out in droves just one year before sat home, the GOP should have had a wake-up call. Instead, they complained about low-propensity voters and harped about New York City being a hotbed for socialism. However, the writing on the wall is clear: if Republicans don’t act now, there is nothing that will stop a midterm bloodbath, which will return their power to Democrats. However, hope has come in the most unlikely of places. Like Gandalf arriving at Helm’s Deep at first light on the fifth day, emerging from the east with Erkenbrand, rescuing the Rohirrim soldiers and turning the tide of the battle against Saruman’s forces, Somalis in Minnesota were caught defrauding billions in federal funds. Trump has been given the chance to turn back the last eleven months. The anger that even everyday Americans not clued into the political system feel toward the massive fraud uncovered in Minnesota provides almost unlimited leeway to get back to work. But real action has to be taken. MINNESOTA FRAUD: @NickShirleyyy’s work has helped show Americans the scale of fraud in Tim Walz’s Minnesota. @TheJusticeDept has been investigating this for months. So far, we have charged 98 individuals – 85 of Somali descent – and more than 60 have been found guilty in… — Attorney General Pamela Bondi (@AGPamBondi) December 29, 2025 It’s not enough for Bondi and other agencies and officials to post their supposed arrest and conviction stats as proof they are working when more and more fraud is being uncovered, not by them but by citizen journalists. Nothing less than massive arrests and deportations in every state will satisfy Americans looking for action. The focus shouldn’t just be on Somalis or other immigrant groups gaming the corrupt system. Elected officials and their bureaucratic allies need to be taken down with them. Trump needs to use the bully pulpit voters have given him. If Republicans are standing in the way of enacting the will of the people, call them out. Let the voters help take the obstinate D.C. swamp rats out with the trash. Americans want their country back. Kill the fraud. If the Trump administration and GOP Congressmen do not produce adequate results, why would voters ever give them power again? The Democrats will come in and ruin Trump’s legacy. Whatever work he has completed will be torn down, as if this past year never even happened. (A Reckoning In Waiting? — Countries All Around World Fed Up With Their Leaders) It’s not every day you get the chance to turn the tide in a battle for the greatest country ever created.

Title: XRP ETFs Pull In $1.3B in 50 Days—What the Data Suggests if Flows Reach $5B

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © CL STOCK / Shutterstock.com In just 50 days since launch, XRP ETFs pulled in $1.3 billion with 43 consecutive trading days of positive inflows—the first and only zero-inflow day occurred on December 26, 2025. That pace ranks XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) among the fastest institutional adoption curves outside Bitcoin. Institutional capital entered steadily even while XRP’s price fell 50% from its July 2025 peak of $3.56, and the broader crypto markets struggled through December’s volatility. With inflows averaging $27.7 million daily and 746 million XRP now locked in ETF custody, the question becomes structural: What happens to supply, liquidity, and market depth if XRP ETF flows reach $5 billion? FAMILY STOCK / Shutterstock.com In 50 days, XRP ETFs absorbed $1.3 billion while locking 746 million XRP—roughly 1.14% of the 65.5 billion circulating supply—with virtually zero redemptions through late December. The pace shows how quickly institutional capital can tighten supply before prices respond. Here’s how issuers performed. Canary Capital defined the market early. XRPC launched on November 13 and pulled in $250 million on day one. The fund now holds approximately $384 million, roughly 30% of total XRP ETF assets. That share stayed stable despite cheaper competitors entering the market, showing institutions favored liquidity and early access over low fees. Daily inflows often exceeded $100 million outside headline events, signaling durable allocation rather than event-driven trading. Canary’s book reflects committed institutional demand building positions over weeks. Grayscale’s strength came from existing relationships. Assets from its XRP Trust rolled directly into GXRP at launch, creating instant scale without requiring new capital commitments. The fund now manages more than $220 million, and that capital has proven sticky—investors didn’t rotate out after launch-week excitement faded. The conversion structure reduced friction for allocators who wanted regulated exposure without operational changes to custody arrangements. GXRP’s steady flows demonstrate how institutional familiarity still matters in ETF adoption, even when competitors offer lower fees. Franklin took a different approach. XRPZ launched with a 0.19% expense ratio—the lowest in the category—and raised over $190 million. Adoption has been measured rather than explosive, which fits its target audience. As annual portfolio reviews roll through advisory practices in Q1 2026, Franklin’s market share may rise as cost-conscious allocators shift from higher-fee competitors. These quieter flows still contribute meaningfully to tightening available XRP supply, even if they don’t generate daily headline volume. Bitwise attracts active trading desks that rebalance frequently, resulting in uneven but persistent inflows as institutions adjust crypto exposure tactically. 21Shares extends reach through international distribution channels, particularly in Europe where cross-border ETF access matters for multi-jurisdiction allocators. Joyseulay / Shutterstock.com At the current pace, XRP ETF inflows show steady institutional commitment rather than speculative bursts. With roughly $27.7 million entering daily on average over 50 days, assets continue climbing on a predictable trajectory driven by consistent allocation rather than momentum trading. Maintaining this velocity places the $5 billion milestone approximately 130 days away from current levels, pointing to mid-May 2026. Hitting that threshold would lock an estimated 2.6 billion XRP into ETF custody—representing roughly 4% of the 65.5 billion circulating supply. That’s a fourfold increase from current 1.14% lockup levels. That accumulation compounds existing supply removal happening outside ETFs. Exchange balances fell dramatically throughout 2025, dropping from approximately 4 billion XRP at year-start to just 1.6-1.7 billion by late December—a 58% decline. While ETFs absorbed 746 million of that withdrawal, the remaining 1.5+ billion XRP moved into private custody wallets, institutional cold storage, and long-term holder addresses, showing accumulation extending well beyond regulated products. XRP’s supply is fixed at 65.5 billion in circulation, so tokens placed in regulated custody don’t return to active trading unless investors redeem ETF shares. If institutional positions remain in place for quarters rather than weeks, liquidity tightens through structure rather than sentiment, fundamentally reshaping market depth and available float over time regardless of short-term price moves. TopMicrobialStock / Shutterstock.com ETF inflows rarely move in straight lines. Three forces could push XRP funds past the $5 billion mark faster than the current 130-day projection. BlackRock’s absence remains the largest variable in XRP’s ETF growth trajectory. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) attracted over $40 billion in assets within its first year, demonstrating BlackRock’s unmatched ability to mobilize institutional capital at scale through its Aladdin platform connections and relationships with thousands of wealth advisors. The firm tends to wait for regulatory clarity rather than chase first-mover advantage. Once confident in the legal framework, BlackRock moves decisively. A late XRP ETF filing from BlackRock would carry enormous weight with allocators—many institutions wait for BlackRock’s entry as implicit validation. Based on IBIT’s trajectory, a BlackRock XRP ETF could potentially bring $1-2 billion in launch-month inflows alone, compressing timelines dramatically. As Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin expands across blockchains and into lending markets—currently at approximately $1.3 billion market cap—XRP gains functional relevance beyond passive custody. RLUSD settlement on XRP Ledger creates organic demand for XRP as a bridge currency and fee-payment mechanism. Utility-backed flows tend to be stickier than speculative positioning. If RLUSD scales to $5-10 billion and begins facilitating significant cross-border settlement volume through ODL corridors, the narrative around XRP shifts from “crypto asset” to “payments infrastructure token.” XRP ETF inflows held remarkably steady despite Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs facing significant outflows during the same November-December period. If Bitcoin reclaims $100,000+ and sustains that level through Q1 2026, ETFs across all crypto assets often see second-wave institutional demand. A healthier macro backdrop could lift daily XRP ETF subscriptions well above the current $27.7 million average. XRP ETF inflows have fundamentally shifted the conversation from price speculation to structural market changes. Sustained allocations totaling $1.3 billion over 50 days, 746 million XRP locked away from trading circulation, and disciplined institutional behavior through volatile December conditions all point to a market changing quietly beneath range-bound price action. The path to $5 billion isn’t guaranteed—macro shocks, prolonged underperformance, or capital fragmentation could derail the current trajectory. But the path is measurable and predictable if current conditions hold. At $27.7 million daily, XRP ETFs reach $5 billion by mid-May 2026, locking 4% of circulating supply into regulated custody. From a technical standpoint, XRP consolidating between $1.85-$2.00 while ETF accumulation continues supports the supply squeeze thesis building over months. A decisive breakout above $2.20 with expanding volume would signal the structural changes are beginning to impact price discovery. If $5 billion hits with XRP trading above $2.50, the combination of reduced available float and improving sentiment could accelerate moves toward $3-4 as patient institutional positioning meets returning retail demand.

Title: New York City Pensions Shelve Recommendation to Rebid BlackRock Mandate, Terminate Fidelity

City Comptroller Brad Lander had proposed the moves, alleging the firms have failed to meet the funds’ net zero plans. The trustees of New York City’s five pension funds have shelved recommendations from outgoing New York City Comptroller Brad Lander to rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandate and to terminate agreements with Fidelity due to allegedly “inadequate” decarbonization plans. “While I am disappointed in the decision of NYCERS’ trustees to table my recommendation to rebid BlackRock’s mandate today, I hope the trustees will vote to adopt it in the new year, as Comptroller-Elect Mark Levine takes office,” Lander said in a statement issued on December 17. Lander noted that BlackRock CEO Larry Fink wrote in a 2020 letter to CEOs that “climate risk is investment risk” and that the firm was shifting its investment strategy to focus on climate-related investing. “Unfortunately, BlackRock in 2025 is failing to act like it,” Lander said regarding Fink’s position. “BlackRock has chosen to backtrack on their commitments and they now refuse to conduct proxy engagement with companies where they own a significant share of the stock.” Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  Lander, whose term as comptroller will end on January 1, 2026, made his recommendation—after updating the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan—for three of the five pension funds: the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. Lander said the recommendations were based on a “rigorous evaluation.” BlackRock’s mandate is set to expire at the end of 2026. When Lander made his recommendation in November, he included agreements with PanAgora Asset Management as ones to be reconsidered. According to his latest announcement, he considers those agreements appropriate to continue, after PanAgora submitted an amended net zero plan that included additional information about its engagement with portfolio companies to encourage them to adopt net zero plans. In response to Lander’s accusations, BlackRock’s Head of the Americas Institutional Business Armando Senra published a letter to Lander accusing him of politicizing the city’s pension funds and stating that altering any of the funds’ portfolios would have to undergo a review process involving the plans’ board and the New York City Bureau of Asset Management investment team. The Bureau of Asset Management, part of the comptroller’s office, is responsible for overseeing the investment portfolios of the city’s public pension systems. According to Senra’s letter, the world’s largest asset manager has had multiple conversations with the bureau’s investment team concerning investment and decarbonization plans over the past several months and met with the funds’ investment team in November to provide an update on BlackRock’s climate and decarbonization stewardship program. “During that meeting, we informed the investment team that a version of this program is now available to each of the five pension plans,” Senra wrote. Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a nonpartisan business advocacy group, said in a statement that Lander’s recommendation is “unilateral and incomprehensible.” “[BlackRock] is a key member of the Partnership for New York City and is well known for its global leadership on sustainability and environmental issue,” Wylde said in the statement. “It is our hope that the pragmatic interests of the city and our public pension funds will prevail over political theater under incoming Comptroller[-Elect] Mark Levine.” Fidelity did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Title: Galaxy Digital: 2026 Too Volatile to Call, but $250K Bitcoin by 2027 Remains Plausible

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © aleks333 / Shutterstock.com Galaxy Digital is taking an unusually candid stance on Bitcoin’s (CRYPTO: BTC) next phase. According to Alex Thorn, the firm’s head of research, Galaxy sees Bitcoin’s 2026 price too chaotic to forecast confidently, even as longer-term conviction remains intact. Galaxy’s comments reflect a market shaped by macro policy swings, political risk, and shifting institutional behavior rather than the clean four-year cycle patterns that defined previous bull runs. Here’s the problem: the Federal Reserve might cut rates 2-3 times or hold steady depending on inflation. Trump administration pro-crypto policies might execute quickly or stall in Congress. Bitcoin’s correlation with stocks means macro data—jobs reports, GDP prints, inflation readings—now drives price more than crypto-specific news. That creates genuine uncertainty where Bitcoin could reasonably land anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 by mid-2026. Yet beneath that near-term chaos, Galaxy argues that structural adoption continues building. ETFs, corporate balance sheets, and pension frameworks are permanently reshaping institutional capital engagement. That divide explains why short-term forecasts look chaotic while Galaxy’s Bitcoin $250K 2027 target remains firmly on the table. RoseLife_Family / Shutterstock.com Galaxy sees three factors making Bitcoin 2026 unpredictable: Fed rate cuts colliding with stubborn inflation, policy execution risk with midterms approaching, and Bitcoin’s equity correlation tying price to macro data rather than crypto fundamentals. Macro uncertainty sits at the center of Galaxy’s 2026 forecasting problem. The Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts—the market expects 2-3 cuts bringing rates from 4.5% toward 3.5-4%—yet inflation hovering near 3% limits flexibility. The Fed’s 2% target remains out of reach, creating tension between easing policy and controlling prices. Labor data and recession odds remain fluid, keeping policy expectations unstable. Strong jobs reports could delay cuts, while weak GDP prints could accelerate them. This makes it impossible to confidently project where Bitcoin lands because its performance has become increasingly tied to broader financial conditions. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto direction has improved sentiment—Paul Atkins at the SEC, Michael Selig at the CFTC, the GENIUS Act signed in July—but execution risk remains high. Legislation like the Clarity Act could pass the Senate in Q1 2026 or stall for months in committee debates. Trade policy, fiscal spending, and election dynamics—midterms hit in November 2026—could shift liquidity faster than markets can price in. When policy timelines are uncertain and political outcomes unclear, forecasting asset prices 12 months out becomes guesswork. Bitcoin’s correlation with equities climbed sharply over 2024-2025. Bitcoin now often moves in sync with the Nasdaq and S&P 500, tying performance to broad risk appetite rather than the original “digital gold” scarcity narrative. When stocks fall on recession fears, Bitcoin typically falls harder, and when stocks rally on Fed dovishness, Bitcoin follows—a strong jobs report can send Bitcoin up 5% in a day, while a weak GDP print can drop it by 8% as investors flee to bonds and cash. Mer_Studio / Shutterstock.com Galaxy’s long-term case separates short-term noise from structural change. While 2026 remains too chaotic to forecast, durable adoption trends still support a $250,000 scenario by the end of 2027. Spot Bitcoin ETFs created a standing institutional bid that didn’t exist in prior cycles. BlackRock’s IBIT alone gathered over $71 billion, proving regulated access unlocked deep pools of capital. Even during weeks with $497 million in outflows, the infrastructure stayed open. Vanguard’s expansion of ETF access to its 50 million clients in December 2025 reinforces these are permanent channels. Corporate adoption has moved beyond experimental allocations. Strategy’s holdings of over 670,000 BTC—worth roughly $59 billion at $88,000—reshaped how public company balance sheets treat Bitcoin. More than 160 public companies now follow similar frameworks. With projected corporate holdings potentially nearing one million BTC by late 2026, supply dynamics tighten. FASB’s fair-value accounting shift in late 2024 removed a key barrier—companies can now mark Bitcoin to market value each quarter. Pension exposure remains small—most allocations are 0.5-2% of portfolio value—but direction matters more than magnitude. Wisconsin, Michigan, and UK pension allocations signal acceptance within conservative mandates. Even 1% positions matter when portfolios are measured in trillions. A 1% allocation from a $500 billion pension fund is $5 billion—more than most retail waves. These decisions take years to reverse once governance boards approve them. Galaxy frames $250,000 as conditional, not guaranteed. Bitcoin’s role alongside gold as a hedge against currency debasement—protection against deficit spending and money printing—strengthens the case. If rates trend toward 3% by 2027 and institutions keep accumulating through ETFs and treasuries, supply-demand math shifts quickly. With 19.8 million Bitcoin in circulation and potentially 2-3 million locked in long-term institutional custody (ETFs, corporate treasuries, lost coins), the available supply for sale shrinks. That asymmetry—growing demand meeting shrinking supply—creates upside potential that compounds over time. Galaxy’s framework is straightforward: 2026 is a coin flip between conflicting forces, but 2027’s direction is clearer. Whether Bitcoin reaches $130,000 or retests $70,000 in 2026 depends entirely on variables no one controls—Fed rate decisions responding to inflation data that hasn’t printed yet, Clarity Act timing in a Senate facing midterm pressures, and whether recession fears materialize or fade. But here’s what doesn’t change regardless of 2026’s path: BlackRock’s $71 billion IBIT isn’t disappearing. Strategy’s 670,000 BTC isn’t getting sold. Pension boards in Wisconsin and Michigan that approved allocations aren’t reversing decisions. These structural shifts create a floor that wasn’t there in previous cycles. That’s why Galaxy maintains $250K by 2027 despite calling 2026 too chaotic to forecast. When demand keeps growing from permanent institutional infrastructure while available supply keeps shrinking, the direction becomes clear even if the timing stays messy. Galaxy’s betting that 18 months is enough time for macro conditions to resolve while structural forces compound. The 2026 range might be wide, but the 2027 trajectory is narrowing.

Title: Something Big Is Coming — Investor Hints At XRP ETF Breakthrough This Week

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Investor Paul Barron’s hint at “big news” has reignited attention on XRP exchange-traded funds this week, sending the community into speculation over possible upcoming announcements or launches. Traders and holders reacted fast on social channels, pushing chatter and price focus higher even as specifics remain unclear. According to data shared by Nate Geraci, President of NovaDius Wealth, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs dominated year-to-date inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT Bitcoin ETF led with $25 billion in inflows. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF followed at $1.11 billion. Fidelity and VanEck posted $477 million and $305 million respectively. On the Ethereum side, BlackRock’s offerings recorded about $9.12 billion. A Solana staking ETF from Bitwise pulled in $839 million. These numbers show where most large investors are putting money right now. Expect some big news this week $XRP ETFs https://t.co/3BY5XJosPx — PaulBarron (@paulbarron) December 29, 2025 Barron’s remark has been read by many as a hint at another XRP-related announcement. Some expect a new ETF launch; others are watching for updates from issuers already in the market. That talk has helped push attention — and inflows — to XRP products that only debuted late in the year. Based on reports from rwa.xyz, on-chain data indicates tokenized real-world assets on the XRP Ledger rose by 2,200% in 2025. The network saw about 23x growth in the value of native real-world assets, including stablecoins, and crossed the $500 million threshold. Themes around RWA tokenization were widely discussed this year by figures such as BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and former SEC Chair Paul Atkins, and the XRPL appears to be drawing benefit from that interest. Canary’s XRP ETF (XRPC) registered $384 million in year-to-date inflows after launching in November. Other XRP spot funds have built sizable holdings too: 21Shares holds about $250 million, Bitwise roughly $227 million, Grayscale around $244 million, and Franklin about $206 million. Based on reports, all of these XRP spot ETFs launched in November and December and now tally roughly $1.24 billion in total assets under management with cumulative inflows near $1.14 billion. For a new category, that level of money moving in over a short span is notable; some industry voices point out the total might have been higher if market mood had not cooled recently. Reports also say XRP ETFs pulled in over $1 billion through 21 days of steady inflows. WisdomTree’s XRP ETF is among the pending offerings that market watchers expect to arrive next. At the same time, talk about a BlackRock XRP ETF has circulated widely. There is currently no public filing tied to a BlackRock XRP product, and reports caution that such expectations are premature without official filings or approvals. Current flows note that XRP’s ETF debut has shifted part of investor focus from pure crypto bets to spot ETF allocations and tokenization themes. Whether Barron’s hinted “big news” becomes a concrete catalyst will depend on filings and formal product launches. For now, the mix of solid early inflows and rapid XRPL tokenization growth has put XRP squarely in the conversation among ETF-focused investors and network adopters.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The stock market has treated US investors well this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 up about 17%. But the Financial Times reports something of a surprise: World markets have done significantly better. The MSCI ex-US index, which excludes American companies from its basket of international stocks, is up 29%—the biggest performance gap since 2009. A number of factors appear to be at play, including sky-high US tech valuations, related fears of an AI bubble, and concerns over President Trump's tariff wars, explains Axios. "US equities are more expensive than lots of other equities, the growth trajectory is likely to be challenged, and everyone's got lots of them," Matthew Beesley of Jupiter Asset Management explains. His current diversification mantra on stocks is "anything but America." Investors have instead piled into long-neglected markets in China, Japan, Europe, and emerging economies, helped by a weaker dollar. China's main index has climbed 29% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng almost 28%. South Korea's Kospi has jumped more than 75%, driven by sharp rallies in tech firms Samsung and SK Hynix. Another factor is a fear that the Chinese start-up AI DeepSeek—which unveiled a large language model seen as a credible, cheaper rival to leading US AI systems—will challenge American dominance in the field. "The reason we lost that exuberance [about US stocks] was really … 'DeepSeek day,'" says Helen Jewell of BlackRock, referring to the day of the product's launch. "You had that sudden realization that 'too overweight the US' was not the way to build a portfolio."

Title: Standard Chartered Models XRP at $8 by 2026—Breaking Down the 315% Upside Case

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com Standard Chartered’s crypto research team, led by Geoffrey Kendrick, recently predicted XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) could hit $8 by 2026—implying a substantial 325% increase from its current $1.88 price. This high-profile Standard Chartered XRP prediction is anchored on easing regulatory uncertainty and the launch of new spot XRP ETFs, which they argue will unleash pent-up demand. Skeptics note that XRP has underperformed despite this positive forecast. The token is trading around $1.88 today, down about 13% year-to-date, even after the SEC withdrew its appeal in Ripple’s lawsuit and multiple XRP ETFs crossed $1 billion in inflows. While institutional endorsement is noteworthy, reaching XRP $8 2026 will require near-perfect execution across multiple bullish factors. Travis Wolfe / Shutterstock.com Standard Chartered’s model specifically targets XRP at $8 by late 2026. Below are the catalysts behind the Geoffrey Kendrick XRP forecast. The cornerstone of the Standard Chartered XRP prediction is institutional ETF demand. In 2025, U.S. regulators approved several spot XRP ETFs from firms such as Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Grayscale, and Canary. These products reduce the friction of buying XRP—pension funds and asset managers can now allocate through regulated wrappers. Standard Chartered predicts spot ETF launches would attract $4-8 billion into XRP throughout 2026. If such inflows materialize, the additional demand against XRP’s relatively fixed supply could drive prices sharply higher. Kendrick laid out a roadmap: $5.50 in 2025, then $8.00 in 2026, eventually reaching $12.50 by 2028. For comparison, XRP’s current circulating supply is about 57 billion coins. Even a few billion dollars of new buying would be a meaningful supply shock. If $5-10 billion flows into XRP ETFs over 12 months—similar to early Bitcoin ETF momentum—that sustained demand could push prices toward the $8 target. Another key assumption is that regulatory clouds will clear globally. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs dominated XRP’s narrative for years. In August 2025, the SEC withdrew its appeal, leaving Ripple to pay a $125 million settlement with the court affirming that XRP sales on secondary markets are not securities transactions. That resolution removes a major legal overhang. Standard Chartered cites this clarity as a catalyst for adoption. When legal uncertainty disappears, capital that was sitting on the sidelines can finally allocate. The XRP Ledger’s real-world use is also rising. Over 300 banks and financial institutions across 45+ countries now partner with RippleNet. Some partners already use XRP for liquidity through ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) corridors. Ripple has launched the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin on XRPL. In just one year, RLUSD’s market cap climbed to about $1.3 billion, making it one of the top U.S.-regulated stablecoins. If XRPL processes $10-20 billion in cross-border payments annually by 2026, the demand for XRP as a bridge currency could multiply. XRP has a capped supply of 100 billion maximum with about 57 billion circulating. Standard Chartered points out that, unlike Bitcoin where new coins are mined daily, new XRP issuance from mining is zero—the supply is fixed. When more tokens move into ETF custody and long-term holders lock up supply, the available tokens for sale on exchanges shrink dramatically. leksiv / Shutterstock.com Skeptics have given several reasons why the XRP $8 prediction might be too aggressive. In 2025, XRP’s price action doesn’t fit the rosy picture. In late December, XRP is about 13% down year-to-date at $1.88, even after the SEC cleared Ripple and XRP ETFs launched. After some XRP ETF approvals in November 2025, the token actually dipped—XRP fell 4% on the day of one ETF launch, a classic example of how it underperforms despite good news. XRP has decades of banking partnerships that have failed to reliably push its price up. Even Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s claim that Ripple could capture 14% of SWIFT’s market share has never translated into meaningful price appreciation. Banks use RippleNet’s messaging without holding XRP tokens, meaning adoption doesn’t automatically equal token demand. XRP’s role as a bridge currency faces stiff competition. Ethereum Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum and Optimism, Solana with sub-second settlement, and Stellar’s similar payment focus are also advancing. Banks exploring blockchain payments have options beyond XRP. A concrete math check is sobering. An $8-per-XRP price would imply a market capitalization of about $456 billion (57 billion tokens × $8). Today, XRP’s market cap is only about $107 billion at $1.88. So hitting XRP $8 2026 means roughly quadrupling the market cap—adding approximately $349 billion in value. By comparison, $456 billion would make XRP larger than almost every crypto except Bitcoin. For context, Ethereum currently sits around $356 billion. Achieving $456 billion would require massive capital inflows, far beyond the roughly $1.25 billion the XRP ETF complex has raised so far. Finally, broader conditions could spoil the run-up. Any global recession, stock market crash, or crypto winter would make speculative gains unlikely. During the 2022 crypto winter, Bitcoin fell 75% despite improving fundamentals, showing macro conditions matter more than narratives when capital is fleeing risk. Uuganbayar / Shutterstock.com To turn the Standard Chartered XRP prediction into reality, a perfect storm of factors must align. To turbocharge flows, a heavyweight like BlackRock needs to launch an XRP ETF. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted over $40 billion within a year. A BlackRock-backed XRP fund could legitimize XRP in a way smaller issuers can’t. When the world’s largest asset manager—managing over $10 trillion—endorses an asset, it would spark investors’ confidence, and could help XRP to reach $8 quickly. RLUSD could become a major on-ramp for institutions. RLUSD’s market cap has grown swiftly to $1.3 billion, but it remains small relative to competitors like USDC ($40+ billion). For the XRP $8 prediction to become reality, RLUSD needs to become a mainstream payment hub—perhaps reaching $10-20 billion in market cap. RippleNet needs to win real traffic. Garlinghouse’s claim of targeting 14% of SWIFT’s market share would imply over $20 trillion in annual payment flows. If Ripple can capture even 5-10% of global bank transfers using XRPL liquidity, that could create hefty XRP demand. In practice, this means many more financial institutions actively using XRP for cross-currency flows—not merely experimenting with RippleNet messaging. Concrete announcements like “Bank X now processes $500 million monthly through ODL using XRP” would validate the thesis. The Geoffrey Kendrick XRP scenario requires continued significant inflows. Kendrick’s model implied $4–8 billion in year one, but that would need to sustain or grow. So far, XRP ETFs accumulated about $1.25 billion. To reach $8, imagine annual ETF flows hit the $5–10 billion range—similar to the early Bitcoin ETF frenzy. Finally, markets must remain bullish or at least stable. To achieve XRP $8 2026, we’d likely need low interest rates, risk-on investor sentiment, and a stable global economy. If macro headwinds intensify, funds will avoid altcoins.

Title: In 2025, bitcoin showed how spectacularly wrong price forecasts can be

2025 is drawing to an end with few crypto market stories more dramatic than the Oct. 10 “flash crash," when bitcoin BTC$87,878.34 plunged $12,000, or nearly 10%, in minutes. The meltdown triggered more than $19 billion in liquidations in just 24 hours, followed by a trader-circulated “cascade warning” and a staggering $500 billion wiped from total crypto market capitalization. That set the scene for an extended slide that's seen the largest cryptocurrency drop to more than 30% below the peak $126,223 value it set just six days earlier. This painful drop is likely to leave it posting the first full-year loss since the crypto winter of 2022. The year began on a more optimistic note, with bitcoin price predictions ranging from dream-like fantasies to more conservative targets that, at times, seemed within reach. Then it all changed after the Oct. 10 crash. Many predictions, from seasoned analysts to outspoken evangelists, shared one thing in common: They didn’t age well. Let's leave aside the long-term forecasts that soared as high as $1 billion by 2038 from Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity's global head of macro, or the undated $700,000 if institutional adoption reached scale from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Even the more restrained estimates now seem somewhat overblown. Some forecasts weren’t just bullish; they were explosive. Samson Mow, CEO of bitcoin technology company Jan3, predicted in February that bitcoin would reach $1 million by the end of 2025 in a “violent” upward move fueled by the collapse of fiat currencies. He received support from Blockstream CEO and founder Adam Back, arguably one of the most respected personalities in bitcoin, who, in April, also reportedly said he believed BTC could reach $500,000 to $1 million by end-2025. His bullish thesis was driven by ETF inflows, institutional buying and limited supply. He wasn't the only one. Venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya also forecast $500,000 by October. Even some of the more conservative estimates for the year-end price target surpassed the all-time high. Among them were JPMorgan analysts, who in early October, before the crash, raised their year-end forecast to $165,000, basing it on a growing embrace of the "debasement trade," a rise in investor demand for alternative stores of value. Even after the crash, Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of bitcoin treasury company Strategy (MSTR), helped keep bulls' hopes alive with his Oct. 28 “expectation” that BTC would be “about $150,000 by the end of this year”. Strategy, the holder of the most bitcoin among publicly traded companies, bought another $1 billion of BTC on Dec. 15, increasing its total holdings to 671,268. Of course, they weren’t alone. Throughout 2025, a flood of price predictions poured in from across the crypto landscape, most of which serve only as reminders of just how hard forecasting can be. There was the forecast for a first-quarter peak of $180,000 from VanEck’s digital asset research team, more than $50,000 above the actual high. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan had said BTC would reach $200,000 in 2025, backed by what he called “the most bullish setup in years.” Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors repeated his $200,000–$250,000 forecast well into October. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, said he was “sticking with” a similar range as late as November. Only a handful adjusted their expectations downward in time. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, once a $500,000 prophet, was one of the few to publicly dial it back, saying in October that BTC would likely end the year between $120,000 and $125,000. Standard Chartered followed suit in December, slashing its target to $100,000 from $200,000. In the end, 2025 reminded the market of an old truth: Bitcoin humbles everyone. It shrugs off models, breaks charts, and ignores even the boldest calls. Some missed by inches. Others missed by miles. But nearly all missed. As the dust settles, the industry is once again left with charts to redraw, narratives to rewrite, and a single, undeniable takeaway: in crypto, predictions are easy to make. Being right is rare.

Title: AI boom to supercharge European banks' rally
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1230/1550903-ai-boom-to-supercharge-european-banks-rally/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T11:05:38Z

After a stellar 2025, investors expect shares in European banks to keep heading higher in 2026, supported by strong earnings and, crucially, cost savings stemming from artificial intelligence. As fears of a recession and interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank have subsided, investors have turned even more positive towards European banks, revising up their expectations for the sector, despite a complicated backdrop. Meanwhile, AI has emerged as a new force drawing investors to European lenders' shares, partly because a dearth of technology companies in the region has forced many to hunt for AI beneficiaries in old-economy markets. Banks have started to use AI to improve operational efficiency and fraud detection, as well as to reduce staff costs. "European banks could be a real beneficiary of AI," said Helen Jewell, chief investment officer for fundamental equities at BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, with about $12 trillion under management. "A lot of the AI story has been focused on the revenue winners, but we also know that when it comes to AI, there is a beneficiary from the cost winners," she said at a press event. UBS said in a note to investors they see AI as a key source of potential upside to banks' near-term valuations and longer- term earnings. But that comes with risks. Warnings over AI-related exuberance and the risks of a dot-com style bust have come from various sides, including the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England. And risks are not only AI-related. The ECB said euro zone banks face "unprecedentedly high" risk of shocks including geopolitical tensions, shifting trade policies, climate-related crises and even a dollar squeeze for banks exposed to the volatile US currency. Yet investors have snapped up bank stocks in earnest. Societe Generale shares have rallied 140% this year, Commerzbank 125% and those in Barclays rose almost 70%. An index of European bank stocks is up more than 60%, on top of the 25% gain in 2024 and more than four times better than the pan European index. Investors also view them as relatively cheap, particularly when compared with US banking shares. European bank stocks currently trade around 1.17 times their price-to-book value, some 40% below their 2007 peak and below the 1.7 times of their US rivals, according to LSEG data. In terms of costs, Goldman Sachs said in a note that costs would grow at a compound annual rate of only 1% between 2025 and 2027. The US bank also sees efficiency continuing well into 2026, with banks' cost/income ratios improving by 130 basis points year on year, meaning companies are expected to spend less to generate income. Consulting firm McKinsey estimated last year that AI could bring the global banking industry as much as $340 billion a year in additional value, with a drop in operational costs of 20%. Even if AI implementation savings take years to fully emerge, it will be a big enough shift to drive greater expansion in valuations, UBS said. Last month, analysts raised their net revisions for the sector by the most since May 2023, and 12-month forward earnings growth expectations jumped to the highest since 2023, according to IBES data. Growth in bank lending to euro zone firms is still running near its highest since mid-2023, according to the most recent ECB data. Credit growth to businesses was unchanged at 2.9% in October - just below August's 3%, the most since May 2023 - compared to the previous month, while loan growth to households accelerated to a two and a half year high of 2.8% from 2.6%. BlackRock's Jewell expects European banks to return 20-25% of market value to shareholders over the next three years via dividends and share buybacks. "If you put together valuation and the shareholder remuneration, you still have an asset class that is quite attractive," Equita co-head of research Domenico Ghilotti said, adding that merger activity is another driver underpinning the sector. The takeover of Mediobanca by state-backed Monte dei Paschi di Siena was one of the biggest in the sector this year, transforming Italian banking. Other deals could be on the way. "What we are seeing is economic resilience within Europe, and that means that even if we do see more rate cuts, that economic resilience will be good for European banks," BlackRock's Jewell said.

Title: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Today? BlackRock’s BTC Moves Shakes Market

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. BlackRock has transferred a significant amount of BTC to the crypto exchange Coinbase, sparking concerns about a sell-off. This comes as the Bitcoin price continues to struggle to break above $90,000 successfully. Arkham data shows that Blackrock deposited 2,201 BTC ($192.13 million) into Coinbase, putting the Bitcoin price at risk of further decline amid increasing selling pressure. The move followed the outflow recorded by BlackRock’s BTC ETF on December 26, with Bitcoin funds as a group seeing a net outflow of $275.88 million. These Bitcoin ETFs are currently on a seven-day outflow streak, which also prompted BlackRock to deposit 6,174.39 BTC last week, likely to offload these coins and redeem shares of its BTC fund. The Bitcoin price has struggled to break above $90,000 amid these outflows from the BTC funds. Notably, the Bitcoin price had broken above $90,000 on December 28 but quickly lost those gains yesterday as BlackRock moved the coins to Coinbase. Crypto pundit Martini claimed that BlackRock wasn’t the only one putting significant selling pressure on the flagship crypto. He alleged that Binance, Wintermute, Coinbase, and Fidelity also sold a significant amount of BTC, collectively dumping $3.5 billion yesterday. Crypto pundit Bull Theory claimed that there was a weekend manipulation as the Bitcoin price pumped $3,000 and broke $90,000, liquidating $103 million worth of shorts this Sunday. He then noted that on Monday morning, BTC dumped $2,700 and liquidated $40 million worth of longs, erasing its entire pump in the process. With the current price action, BTC is heading for a red yearly close, as it is currently down over 6% year-to-date (YTD). In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital stated that most of the data continues to become more favorable for the Bitcoin price, putting in a bottom against the equity markets and gold in the coming weeks. He added that the data also points to the flagship crypto outperforming these assets. The analyst stated that this was based on just factual data and not emotions. The Bitcoin price had notably outperformed these major assets at the start of the year but has since fallen behind, following the October 10 crypto crash. Gold is up 66% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is up 17% since the start of the year. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows also predicted that BTC could soon rally, noting that the long-term holders have stopped selling for the first time since July 2025. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $87,300, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The 'Outnumbered' panel discusses DEI's impact on job markets and Vice President JD Vance's criticisms at AmericaFest2025. Americans — celebrate 2025! The year we found out that Democrats have been wrong about nearly everything and that common-sense Americans were right all along. Think that’s an exaggeration? Consider: Climate alarmism is dead. It turns out we need oil and gas; LET'S TEACH OUR KIDS WHY AMERICA IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR Kids march against climate change in New York. (Photo by: Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Perhaps the most consequential change of 2025 was the long-overdue realization that climate alarmism is possibly more dangerous than climate change. When even billionaire Bill Gates, long-time climate crusader, hangs up his spikes, something profound has shifted. Gates recently wrote a memo admitting climate change "will not lead to humanity’s demise;" the welcome dose of realism from one of the world’s richest human beings comes only a year after he penned a book entitled "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster." Look how blue state officials are running pell-mell away from climate mandates that have driven electricity costs higher and infuriated voters. Exhibit one is New York Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul, who recently lifted the damaging de facto ban on natural gas pipeline construction imposed by her predecessor, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. DEFINING FAIR PLAY: WHY SWING-STATE DEMOCRATS ARE OUT OF STEP ON PROTECTING WOMEN’S SPORTS After clinging to Cuomo’s disastrous climate agenda for years and watching New York’s electricity rates soar to 40% above the national average, Hochul approved key permits for the Williams Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) natural gas pipeline in November, infuriating climate warriors. Hochul said energy needs and grid reliability dictated the change. For a woman who wants to outlaw gas stoves, it was quite an about-face. National Guard members patrol in Washington, Nov. 27, 2025. (Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Both Gates and Hochul are in step with the corporate community, which has quietly abandoned environmental goals, as the need for power to fuel AI data banks reigns supreme. The reality is that trillions of dollars of investment in renewable fuels has barely reduced demand for oil, gas and coal. Also, the cost to western nations of suffocating their economies to reduce carbon emissions has become too high, especially since China, India and other developing nations are today’s biggest emitters and abide by no such regulations. As Gates wrote, the emphasis needs to be on improving lives – both here and around the world – not blindly trying to curb fossil fuels. HIGH-RANKING DEMOCRATS ADMIT TO KNOWINGLY ABANDONING WOMEN Under President Joe Biden, Democrats spent trillions of dollars unnecessarily, boosting our deficits relative to the economy to levels never before seen except during major wars. The gusher of cash not only fed decades-high inflation, it also opened the door to mammoth fraud, with hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars going missing. More recently, the nation has discovered a still-developing scandal where the Somali community in Minnesota allegedly stole as much as $9 billion in funds meant to feed hungry children and house the homeless. CONSERVATIVE GROUPS DECLARE 2025 A TIPPING POINT ON ‘CLIMATE HYSTERIA’ AS TRUMP UNLEASHES ENERGY AGENDA Democrats (and sometimes Republicans) hope to attract voters by doling out money; they know that if citizens become dependent on lavish handouts, they will vote to keep the good times rolling. But someone has to pay for free stuff; that poor sod is the taxpayer, who eventually rebels. As blue states jack taxes higher to feed their welfare machines, they bleed businesses and residents who flee to lower-tax locales like Florida and Texas. Bottom line, Big Government does not work. Never has, never will. Early on, President Donald Trump reversed what he called the "illegal and immoral" DEI programs that Biden had required be implemented in every corner of the federal government. Biden’s executive order, "Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government" demanded nearly every federal agency — including air traffic control and the military — submit "Equity Action Plans," which led to "immense public waste and shameful discrimination." Inspired by the president’s pushback against the virtue-signaling programs, corporations, aware that such efforts divide their employees and stoke resentment, quietly let DEI fall by the wayside. Under President Joe Biden, Democrats spent trillions of dollars unnecessarily, boosting our deficits relative to the economy to levels never before seen except during major wars. In February, Accenture’s CEO wrote a memo to staff indicating the huge professional services firm was shelving its DEI program since it had "largely achieved its goals" and "we are and always have been a meritocracy." Dozens of companies, including Pepsico, Disney, Blackrock, McDonald's, Ford, Walmart and others, followed suit. In 2016, Harvard Business School published a report on "Why Diversity Programs Fail", revealing that decades of mandated diversity efforts had made little progress because, studies showed, "force-feeding can activate bias rather than stamp it out." That remains the case today. You would think it obvious that putting more cops on the beat brings down crime. But leftists in the U.S. insist, based on ideology rather than common sense or evidence, that law enforcement is the problem and not the cure. THE FAR LEFT HAVE TAKEN CONTROL OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY PLATFORM, AND IT’S TURNING VOTERS OFF Trump deployed the National Guard to the streets of D.C., and they became safer. Hochul activated the National Guard to protect New York’s subways, and, not surprisingly, they became less dangerous. This is not rocket science.

Because there remains a group in the U.S. weirdly dedicated to promoting this heinous activity, activists continue to push for its legality. They are suing to overturn the Supreme Court’s ruling in United States v. Skrmetti that a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care did not constitute sex-based discrimination and did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The left is adamant that underage kids, often without the knowledge of their parents, should be able to mutilate their own bodies and permanently destroy their reproductive capabilities.

Title: Bitwise CEO Points to Bitcoin Amid Iran’s Deepening Currency Crisis
URL: https://beincrypto.com/iran-currency-crisis-bitcoin-hedge/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T09:27:59Z
Full Content:
Written & Edited byKamina Bashir Iran’s rial hit a record low against the US dollar, sparking protests on the streets across the capital and other major cities. This economic crisis has revived the debate over Bitcoin’s potential as a safe haven. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggested that the largest cryptocurrency could serve as a form of protection against financial turmoil. According to the Financial Times, the currency has lost over 40% of its value since Iran’s conflict with Israel in June 2025. Notably, the rial’s drop from 32,000 per dollar in 2015 to over 1.4 million represents a nearly 44-fold depreciation in ten years. This swift decline has intensified Iran’s economic crisis. “The official rate in the early 1980s was 70 per dollar,” Alex Gladstein stated. Inflation reached 42.2% in December, marking an increase from the same period last year and rising 1.8% compared with November. This has put Iranian families under severe strain. Food prices surged 72% in December 2025 compared to one year prior, while medical goods rose 50%. Shops in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar shut in protest, and demonstrations spread to Isfahan, Shiraz, and Mashhad. The Associated Press reported these were the largest street protests since 2022. The Iranian rial tumbled to 1.43–1.45 million per USD, plunging 7% amid fresh U.S. sanctions, soaring inflation, and scarce foreign inflows. Footage from Tehran’s bazaars shows shopkeepers closing stores in protest, chanting “Don’t be afraid, we are all together” and “Shut it… pic.twitter.com/ky0tqGY5zW The crisis is accelerated by falling oil revenue due to US sanctions, deep-seated issues in the banking sector, political chaos, and structural corruption. Amid this, the Central Bank Governor, Mohammad Reza Farzin, has resigned. Government efforts, such as food vouchers and subsidies, have aimed to ease public frustration. Yet, they offer limited relief amid persistent inflation. Meanwhile, traditional safe havens like gold have soared. Gold coins, a classic store of wealth in Iran, reached 1.7 billion rials each on December 28, more than double their value in June. While gold has long been established as a traditional safe-haven asset, many are also pointing to Bitcoin as a potential alternative. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley echoed this view in a recent post. “Economic mismanagement – The story of the past, present, and future. Bitcoin is a new way for the people to protect themselves,” Horsley stated. The concept of Bitcoin as a hedge is being increasingly applied across multiple economies. In the US, rising inflation and recession fears have led many investors to position Bitcoin as a tool to protect purchasing power. Previously, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also advocated for Bitcoin. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, or… of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears,” Fink said. Worldwide data support the increased use of cryptocurrency to fight inflation. According to a September 2025 MEXC report, 46% of crypto users cited digital assets as a means to hedge against inflation. Argentina offers a clear example of this trend in practice. As the peso collapsed and inflation accelerated, Argentines increasingly turned to Bitcoin and stablecoins to preserve their value. While the collapse of Iran’s rial has reignited the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement, the reality is more nuanced. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and independence from domestic monetary policy make it an appealing alternative in environments marked by chronic inflation, capital controls, and political instability. In such contexts, it increasingly serves as a tool for preserving value when confidence in national currencies erodes. However, it is equally important to acknowledge that Bitcoin remains quite volatile. Furthermore, government bans and restrictions can also hinder access and usability.

Title: 4 Ways 2025 Has Changed the Crypto Markets Forever
URL: https://beincrypto.com/2025-changed-crypto-markets-forever/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T08:00:00Z
Full Content:
Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byHarsh Notariya The year 2025 has etched itself into the annals of financial history as the pivotal moment when crypto and digital assets transcended speculation and embedded themselves in the global economic fabric. From boardrooms on Wall Street to policy chambers in Washington, digital assets have evolved from fringe experiments to indispensable tools for wealth preservation and innovation. Institutional giants poured billions into Bitcoin, corporations built digital treasuries as hedges against inflation, meme coins danced on the razor’s edge of euphoria and oblivion, and a pro-crypto administration dismantled regulatory barriers with landmark legislation, such as the GENIUS Act. Drawing on extensive data and insights, this article examines how these forces converged to redefine markets. It explores how they attracted billions in new capital while exposing vulnerabilities in an ecosystem that is still finding its footing. As BeInCrypto has chronicled throughout the year, these transformations signal not just growth, but a fundamental realignment of power in the financial sector. The institutionalization of Bitcoin in 2025 marked a watershed moment for crypto, transforming the volatile asset into a cornerstone of diversified portfolios. Spot ETFs matured quickly, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF amassing nearly $68 billion in assets under management (AUM), dominating daily volumes and attracting the majority of inflows. Institutional AUM in Bitcoin surged to $235 billion, a 161% leap from 2024, fueled by pension funds overseeing $12 trillion in assets entering the fray for the first time. This AUM is achieved by measuring the sum of holdings between private companies, public companies, exchanges or custodians and ETFs, multiplied by the Bitcoin price. Projections from Bursera Capital indicated inflows exceeding $40 billion, surpassing the previous year’s record, as fair-value accounting rules mitigated balance sheet volatility. This allowed corporations to hold BTC without punitive mark-to-market losses. Regulatory clarity played a starring role, with the US establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve and lifting restrictions on retirement plans. 2025 has clearly solved the access problem for institutions to allocate into Bitcoin.These were the five major structural obstacles that came down this year:▫️ Spot ETFs securitized Bitcoin▫️ Options markets formed around ETFs▫️ Prior regulatory restrictions in retirement… By mid-December, 14 of the top 25 US banks were developing Bitcoin products. This is according to Bitcoin financial services firm River. Meanwhile, asset managers maintained net long positions even during market dips. An EY survey conducted earlier in the year revealed that 86% of institutional investors plan to increase their crypto holdings. DeFi exposure expected to triple from 24% to 75%. It emphasized yield generation through lending and derivatives on secure platforms, such as Fireblocks. Data on Newhedge shows Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility dipped 70%, from a 2025 high of 3.81% to depths as low as 1.36% in August. This rendered it calmer than some traditional equities, while prices climbed from the $76,000 range to top out $126,000. Analysts at firms like Standard Chartered anticipated pension-driven demand shocks, where each $1 billion in ETF inflows could propel prices higher. According to blockchain intelligence firm Arkham, corporate Bitcoin holdings were under 600,000 BTC at the start of ,2025 but institutional interest has ramped up this year. Now, corporations hold over 4.7% of the total BTC supply. Against this backdrop, believers like Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy say Bitcoin is no longer fringe. Rather, it is financial infrastructure. This observation echoes the sentiment at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, where the US Vice President JD Vance’s BTC ownership and Pakistan’s national reserve were highlighted. Bitcoin 2025 Conference just changed the game 🟠📈US VP owns BTC.Pakistan launched a national Bitcoin reserve.Trump Media raised $2.5B to buy BTC.NYC Mayor wants Bitcoin-backed bonds.BlackRock’s ETF hit $71B AUM.Bitcoin is no longer fringe—it’s financial infrastructure.… pic.twitter.com/XhvdDnk2BF This institutional adoption went beyond stabilizing markets and positioned Bitcoin as a modeled reserve asset, forever altering portfolio strategies. Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) experienced a surge in prominence in 2025. CoinGecko data shows they accumulated over $121 billion in assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This is while controlling substantial portions of their supplies, approximately 4% of ETH and 2.5% of SOL. Fair-value accounting catalyzed this surge, enabling corporations to allocate without balance sheet distortions; Bitwise analysts noted this could “tilt the market significantly.” MicroStrategy exemplified the trend, holding over 671,268 BTC, as corporate accumulations rose from 1.68 million to 1.98 million BTC mid-year. Data on Rwa.xyz shows that tokenized Treasuries increased by 80% to $8.84 billion, after reaching a peak of $9.3 billion in mid Q4. They outpaced stablecoins in terms of yield amid US rates of 3.50%–3.75%, leveraging blockchain technology for efficiency. Real-world assets (RWAs) excluding stablecoins grew 229% to $19 billion, with Ethereum anchoring $12.7 billion in Treasuries. Stablecoins exceeded $308 billion in market cap, according to data on DefiLlama, maturing under the GENIUS Act’s regulatory umbrella. Forecasts from Galaxy Research painted a bullish horizon, with DAO-managed bonds potentially exceeding $500 million by 2026, and crypto-backed loans reaching $90 billion. ETF inflows were projected to exceed $50 billion, with sovereign wealth funds expected to join the influx. However, headwinds emerged, with mNAV compression forcing some DATs to sell or shutter, as inflows plummeted 90-95% from July peaks amid scrutiny. BeInCrypto detailed how miners and firms navigated Bitcoin buying retreats, with DAT inflows hitting 2025 lows at $1.32 billion. A $25-$75 billion demand pivot into Treasuries via stablecoins highlighted integration with debt markets. “DATs can move beyond speculation and become lasting economic engines,” wrote analyst Ryan Watkins, highlighting their long-term implications. This rise bridged traditional finance and crypto, but with risks. Declining liquidity and fading confidence triggered sell-offs, pressuring firms like MicroStrategy and BitMine to innovate revenue models. Ultimately, DATs symbolized the fusion of resilience and ambition in 2025, reshaping corporate treasuries for the digital era. Meme coins in 2025 embodied the crypto market’s duality: a meteoric rise followed by a stark “heat death,” with trading volumes cratering 70-85% and mindshare plummeting 90%. memecoins hit their lowest mindshare in yearsfrom 20% → 2.5%0 next? pic.twitter.com/VpwaeklMhn The sector’s capitalization peaked above $100 billion in late 2024 but consolidated sharply. Yet, a late-year frenzy revived the narrative in September 2025. The total market cap approached $60 billion (2% of the crypto market). AI bots and centralized exchanges (CEXs) likely amplified the pumps, with the former known to exploit thin order books and arbitrage plays. OGs like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE retained multi-billion caps, growing into utility hybrids amid sector maturation. Pump.fun’s 90% volume drop signaled a pivot to utility alts, with a 2026 revival anticipated amid hype cycles. Memes captured 25% of investor interest, reimagined as “emotion futures.” CoinGecko dashboard highlights the market cap bottoming signals and the shift from hype to utility, with nearly 2 million tokens collapsing in Q1. This cycle’s meme coin mania, smarter and more dangerous with AI orchestration, reflects crypto’s speculative underbelly. Under President Donald Trump, dubbed the “Crypto President,” 2025 ushered in a regulatory renaissance. Among other things, it culminated in the signing of the GENIUS Act in July. This landmark law mandated 1:1 reserve, regular audits, consumer protections, and non-securities status for stablecoins, with oversight split between the OCC and states. Pre-passage odds reached 68%, with VP JD Vance pledging to implement tailored frameworks post-enactment. While the market structure bill stalled, leaving exchanges in limbo, GENIUS propelled the tokenization of assets forward. Concerns over Trump’s ventures fueled fears of rejection, but the passage signified a rules-first pivot. The FDIC geared up for implementation, authorizing banks for custody. Impacts included 20-30% growth in USDC and USDT adoption, alongside issuer consolidation. 6. One 6/18/2025 The GENIUS Act was passed by the Senate.

This regulatory thaw, from enforcement to empowerment, unlocked trillions in potential, cementing 2025 as the year crypto came of age. In retrospect, 2025 wasn’t just a banner year for crypto. It was the inflection point where digital assets claimed their stake in the future of money. With institutions leading the charge, treasuries fortifying balances, memes testing boundaries, and regulations providing guardrails, the markets emerged stronger, inclusive, and inevitable. As we gaze toward 2026, the lessons of this transformative epoch remind us: in crypto, evolution is survival.

Title: Ethereum TVL Set For Explosive Growth: Sharplink CEO Foresees Tenfold Surge In 2026
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-tvl-set-for-explosive-growth-sharplink-ceo/
Time Published: 2025-12-30T07:00:05Z
Full Content:
Joseph Chalom, the CEO of Sharplink, has outlined an optimistic forecast for Ethereum’s (ETH) future, emphasizing a significant increase in the total value locked (TVL) within the network in the coming year. According to a report from CoinMarketCap, Chalom anticipates that the stablecoin market will soar to $500 billion by December 2026. Currently, the total market capitalization for stablecoins stands at approximately $308.46 billion, suggesting a 62% growth from current figures. Given that Ethereum is responsible for processing over half of all stablecoin transactions across various blockchain networks, the projected expansion in stablecoin issuance and transaction volume is set to significantly elevate the network’s TVL. Chalom further predicts that the market for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) will also witness substantial growth, potentially reaching a total value of $300 billion next year. This is expected to move beyond tokenizing individual securities and funds to encompass complete fund complexes, thereby increasing Ethereum’s relevance in the financial ecosystem. Key to this expected growth is the increasing involvement of major financial institutions from traditional finance such as BlackRock, which has shown heightened interest in blockchain technologies over the past year. Chalom predicts that it could serve as a catalyst for moving significant assets onto Ethereum’s infrastructure. The rise in total value locked usually indicates increased network utilization, which can bolster market sentiment and may influence Ethereum price dynamics. Currently, data shows ETH’s TVL at approximately $68.20 billion. Crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen recently expressed skepticism about Ethereum reaching new price highs in 2026, particularly in light of Bitcoin’s (BTC) market conditions. However, Chalom anticipates that sovereign wealth fund holdings and tokenization efforts on Ethereum could grow five- to tenfold in the coming year. This potential increase is attributed to competitive pressures that may encourage institutional investors, who have previously been hesitant about cryptocurrency exposure, to reconsider their strategies as peer adoption accelerates. Moreover, Chalom believes that the integration of on-chain artificial intelligence (AI) agents and prediction markets will gain mainstream traction in 2026, further driving activity and adding value to the Ethereum ecosystem. Ultimately, Sharplink’s CEO stressed that the convergence of institutional interest from traditional finance firms, expanded applications, and the involvement of sovereign funds could significantly position Ethereum for impressive TVL growth in the near future. Currently, Ethereum is trading at around $2,930, marking a 13% year-to-date decline for the leading altcoin. Compared to its all-time high of $4,964 reached earlier this year, the cryptocurrency is currently trading 40% below this level.

It’s $70 a year, or $7 a month, and in return you get a weekly newsletter that’s usually anywhere from 5000 to 15,000 words, including vast, extremely detailed analyses of NVIDIA, Anthropic and OpenAI’s finances, and the AI bubble writ large.

You’re gonna love it. If you have any issues signing up for premium, please email me at ez@betteroffline.com. One time, a good friend of mine told me that the more I learned about finance, the more pissed off I’d get. He was right. There is an echoing melancholy to this era, as we watch the end of Silicon Valley’s hypergrowth era, the horrifying result of 15+ years of steering the tech industry away from solving actual problems in pursuit of eternal growth. Everything is more expensive, and every tech product has gotten worse, all so that every company can “do AI,” whatever the fuck that means. We are watching one of the greatest wastes of money in history, all as people are told that there “just isn’t the money” to build things like housing, or provide Americans with universal healthcare, or better schools, or create the means for the average person to accumulate wealth. The money does exist, it just exists for those who want to gamble — private equity firms, “business development companies” that exist to give money to other companies, venture capitalists, and banks that are getting desperate and need an overnight shot of capital from the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Repurchase Facility or Discount Window, two worrying indicators of bank stress I’ll get into later. No, the money does not exist for you or me or a person. Money is for entities that could potentially funnel more money into the economy, even if the ways that these entities use the money are reckless and foolhardy, because the system’s intent on keeping entities alive incentivizes it. We are in an era where the average person is told to pull up their bootstraps, to work harder, to struggle more, because, as Martin Luther King Jr. once said, it’s socialism for the rich and rugged free market capitalism for the poor. The “free market” is a fucking con. When you or I run out of money, our things are taken from us, we receive increasingly-panicked letters, we get phone calls and texts and emails and demands, we are told that all will be lost if we don’t “work it out,” because the financial system is not about an exchange of value but whether or not you can enter into the currently agreed-upon con. By letting neoliberalism and the scourge of the free markets rule, modern society created the conditions for what I call The Enshittifinancial Crisis — the place at which my friend Cory Doctorow’s Enshittification Theory meets my own Rot Economy Thesis in a fourth stage of Enshittification. Per The New Yorker: I’ll walk you through it. Facebook was a huge, free platform, much like Instagram, that offered fast and easy access to everybody you knew. It acquired Instagram in 2012 to kill off a likely competitor, and over time would start making both products worse — clickbait notifications, a mandatory algorithmic feed that deliberately emotionally manipulated people and stoked political division, eventually becoming full of AI slop and videos, all so that Meta could continue to sell billions of dollars of ads a quarter. Per Kyle Chayka of the New Yorker, “Facebook’s feed, now choked with A.I.-generated garbage and short-form videos, is well into the third act of enshittification.” The third stage is critical, in that it’s when the company also turns on its business customers. A Marketing Brew story from September of last year told the tale of multiple advertisers who found their campaigns switching to different audiences, wasting their money and getting questionable results. A New York Times story from 2021 described companies losing upwards of 70% of their revenue during a Facebook ads outage, another from 2018 described how Meta (then Facebook) deliberately hid issues with its measurement of engagement on videos from advertisers for over a year, and more recently, Meta’s ads tools started switching out top-performing ads with AI-generated ones, in one case targeting men aged 30 to 45 with an AI-generated grandma, all without warning the advertiser. Meta doesn’t give a shit, because investors and analysts don’t give a shit. I could say “sell-side analysts” here — the ones that are trying to get you to buy a stock — but based on every analyst report I’ve read from a major bank or hedge fund, I truly think everybody is complicit. In November 2025, Reuters revealed that Meta projected in late 2024 that 10% of its annual revenue ($16 billion) would come from advertisements for scams or banned goods, mere weeks after Meta announced a ridiculous $27 billion data center debt package, one that used deep accountancy magic to keep it off of its balance sheet despite Meta guaranteeing the entirety of the loan. One would think this would horrify investors for two reasons: One would be wrong. Morgan Stanley said a few weeks ago that it is “one of the handful of companies that can leverage its leading data, distribution and investments in AI,” and raised its target to $750, with a $1000-a-share bull case. Wedbush raised Meta’s price to $920, and Bank of America staunchly held firm at…$810. I can find no analyst commentary on Meta making sixteen billion dollars on fraud, because it doesn’t matter to them, because this is the Rot Economy, and all that matters is number go up. Reality — such as whether there’s any revenue in AI, or whether it’s a good idea that Meta is spending over $70 billion this year on capital expenditures on a product that has generated no revenue (and please, fucking spare me the bullshit around “Meta’s AI ads play,” that whole story is nonsense) — doesn’t matter to analysts, because stocks are thoroughly, inextricably enshittified, and analysts don’t even realize it’s happening. The stages of enshittification usually involve some sort of devil’s deal. We have now entered Enshittification Stage 4, where businesses turn on shareholders. Analysts and investors have become trapped in the same kind of loathsome platform play as consumers and businesses, and face exactly the same kinds of punishment through the devaluation of the stock itself. Where platforms have prioritized profits over the health and happiness of users or business customers, they are now prioritizing stock value over literally anything, and have — through the remarkable growth of tech stocks in particular — created a placated and thoroughly whipped investor and analyst sect that never asks questions and always celebrates whatever the next big thing is meant to be. The value of a “stock” is not based on whether the business is healthy, or its future certain, but on its potential price to grow, and analysts have, thanks to an incredible bull run of tech stocks going on over a decade, been able to say “I bet software will be big” for most of the time, going on CNBC or Bloomberg and blandly repeating whatever it is that a tech CEO just said, all without any worries about “responsibility” or “the truth.” This is because big tech stocks — and many other big stocks, if I’m honest — have made their lives easy as long as they don’t ask questions. Number always seems to be going up for software companies, and all you need to do is provide a vociferous defense of the “next big thing,” and come up with a smart-sounding model that justifies eternal growth. This is entirely disconnected from the products themselves, which don’t matter as long as Number Go Up. If net income is high and the company estimates it will continue to grow, then the company can do whatever the fuck it want with the product it sells or the things that it buys. Software Has Eaten The World in the sense that Andreesen got his wish, with investors now caring more about the “intrinsic value” of software companies rather than the businesses or products themselves. And because that’s happening, investors aren’t bothering to think too hard about the tech itself, or the deteriorating products underlying tech companies, because “these guys have always worked it out” and “these companies have always managed to keep growing.” As a result, nobody really looks too deep. Minute changes to accounting in earnings filings are ignored, egregious amounts of debt are waved off, and hundreds of billions of dollars of capital expenditures are seen as “the new AI revolution” versus “a huge waste of money.” By incentivizing the Rot Economy — making stocks disconnected from the value of the company beyond net income and future earnings guidance — companies have found ways to enshittify their own stocks, and shareholders will be the ones who suffer, all thanks to the very downstream pressure that they’ve chosen to ignore for decades. You see, while one might (correctly) see that the deterioration of products like Facebook and Google Search was a sign of desperation, it’s important to also see it as the companies themselves orienting around what they believe analysts and investors want to see. You can also interpret this as weakness, but I see it another way: stock manipulation, and a deliberate attempt to reshape what “value” means in the eyes of customers and investors. If the true value of a stock is meant to be based on the value of its business, cash flow, earnings and future growth, a company deliberately changing its products is an intentional interference with value itself, as are any and all deceptive accounting practices used to boost valuations. But the real problem is that analysts do not…well…analyze, not, at least, if it goes against the market consensus. That’s why Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and Futurum and Gartner and Forrester and McKinsey and Morgan Stanley all said that the metaverse was inevitable — because they do not actually care about the underlying business itself, just its ability to grow on paper. Need proof that none of these people give a fuck about actual value? Mark Zuckerberg burned $77 billion on the metaverse, creating little revenue or shareholder value and also burning all that money without any real explanation as to where it went. The street didn’t give a shit because meta’s existent ads business continued to grow, same as it didn’t give a shit that Mark Zuckerberg burned $70 billion on capex, even though we also really don’t know where that went either. In fact, we really have no idea where all this AI spending is going. These companies don’t tell us anything. They don’t tell us how many GPUs they have, or where those GPUs are, or how many of them are installed, or what their capacity is, or how much money they cost to run, or how much money they make. Why would we? Analysts don’t even look at earnings beyond making sure they beat on estimates. They’ve been trained for 20 years to take a puddle-deep look at the numbers to make sure things look okay, look around their peers and make sure nobody else is saying something bad, and go on and collect fees. The same goes for hedge funds and banks propping up these stocks rather than asking meaningful questions or demanding meaningful answers. In the last two years, every major hyperscaler has extended the “useful life” of its servers from 3 years to either 5.5 or 6 years — and in simple terms, this allowed them to incur a smaller depreciation expense each quarter as a result, boosting net income. Those who are meant to be critical — analysts and investors sinking money into these stocks — had effectively no reaction, despite the fact that Meta used (per the Wall Street Journal) this adjustment to reduce its expenses by $2.3 billion in the first three quarters of this year. This is quite literally disconnected from reality, and done based on internal accounting that we are not party to. Every single tech firm buying GPUs did this and benefited to the tune of billions of dollars in decreased revenues, and analysts thought it was fine and dandy because number went up. Shareholders are now subordinate to the shares themselves, reacting in the way that the shares demand they do, being happy for what the companies behind the shares give them, and analysts, investors and even the media spend far more energy fighting the doubters than they do showing these companies scrutiny. Much like a user of an enshittified platform, investors and analysts are frogs in a pot, the experience of owning a stock deteriorating since Jack Welch and GE taught corporations that the markets are run with the kind of simplistic mindset built for grifter exploitation. And much like those platforms, corporations have found as many ways as possible to abuse shareholders, seeing what they can get away with, seeing how far they can push things as long as the numbers look right, because analysts are no longer looking for sensible ideas. Let me give you an example I’ve used before. Back in November 1998, Winstar Communications signed a “$2 billion equipment and finance agreement with Lucent Technologies” where Winstar would borrow money from Lucent to buy stuff from Lucent, all to create $100 million in revenue over 5 years. In December 1999, Barron’s wrote a piece called “In 1999 Tech Ruled”: Airnet? Bankrupt. WinStar? Horribly bankrupt. While Ciena survived, it had spent over a billion dollars to acquire other companies (all stock, of course), only to see its revenue dwindle basically overnight from $1.6bn to $300 million as the optical cable industry collapsed. One would have been able to work out that Winstar was a dog, or that all of these companies were dogs, if you were to look at the numbers, such as “how much they made versus how much they were spending.” Instead, analysts, the media and banks chose to pump up these stocks because the numbers kept getting bigger, and when the collapse happened, rationalizations were immediately created — there were a few bad apples (Enron, Winstar, WorldCom), “the fiber was useful” and thus laying it was worthwhile, and otherwise everything was fine. The problem, in everybody else’s mind, was that everybody had got a bit distracted and some companies that weren’t good would die. All of that lost money was only a problem because it didn’t pay off. This was a misplaced gamble, and it taught tech executives one powerful lesson: earnings must be good, without fail, by any means necessary, and otherwise nothing else matters to Wall Street. It’s all about incentives. A sell-side analyst that tells you not to buy something is a problem. A journalist that is skeptical or critical of an industry in the midst of a growth or hype cycle is considered a “hater” — don’t I fucking know it. Analysts that do not sing the same tune as everybody else are marginalized, mocked and aggressively policed. And I don’t fucking care. Stop being fucking cowards. By not being skeptical or critical you are going to lead regular people into the jaws of another collapse. The dot com bubble was actually a great time to start reevaluating how and why we value stocks — to say “hey, wait, that $2 billion deal will only make $100 million in revenue?” or “this company spends $5 for every $1 it makes!” — but nobody, it appears, remained particularly suspicious of the tech industry, or a stock market that was increasingly orienting itself around conning shareholders. And because shareholders, analysts and the media alike refused to retain a single shred of suspicion leaving the dot com era, the mania never actually subsided. Financial publications still found themselves dedicated to explaining why the latest hype cycle was real. Journalists still found themselves told by editors that they had to cover the latest fad, even if it was nonsensical or clearly rotten. Analysts still grabbed their swords and rushed to protect the very companies that have spent decades misleading them. Much like we spent years saying that Facebook was a “good deal” because it was free, analysts and investors say tech stocks are “great to hold” because they kept growing, even if the reason they “kept growing” was a series of interlocking monopolies, difficult-to-leave platforms and impossible-to-fight traction and pricing, all of which have an eventual sell-by date. I realize I’m pearl-clutching over the amoral status of capitalism and the stock market, but hear me out: what if we’re actually in a 15-to-20-year-long knife-catching competition? What if all anybody has done is look at cashflow, net income, future growth guidance, and called it a day? A lack of scrutiny has allowed these companies to do effectively anything they want, bereft of worrisome questions like "will this ever make a profit?" What if we basically don’t know what the fuck is going on? What if all of this was utterly senseless? As I wrote last year, the tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, facing something I call “the Rot Com bubble.” In simple terms, they’re only “doing AI” because there do not appear to be any other viable ideas to continue the Rot Economy’s eternal growth-at-all-costs dance. Yet because growth hasn’t slowed yet, analysts, the media and other investors are quick to claim that AI is “paying off,” even if nobody has ever said how much AI revenue is being generated or, in the case of Salesforce, they can say “nearly $1.4 billion ARR,” which sounds really big until you realize a company with $10.9 billion in revenue is boasting about making less than $116 million in revenue in a month. Nevertheless, because Salesforce set a new revenue target of $60 billion by 2030, the stock jumped 4%. It doesn’t matter that most Agentforce customers don’t pay for the service, or that AI isn’t really making much money, or really anything, other than Number Go Up. The era we live in is one of abject desperation, to the point that analysts and investors — and shareholders by extension — will take any abuse from management. They will allow companies to spend as much money as they want in whatever ways they want, as long as it continues the charade of “number go up.” Let me spell it out a little more, using the latest earnings of various hyperscalers as an example. We have no idea, because analysts and investors are in an abusive relationship with tech stocks. It is fundamentally insane that Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have spent $776 billion in capital expenditures in the space of three years, and even more so that analysts and investors, when faced with such egregious numbers, simply sit back and say “they’re building the infrastructure of the future, baby!” Analysts and traders and investors and reporters do not think too hard about the underlying numbers, because doing so immediately makes you run head-first into a number of worrying questions such as “where did all that money go?” and “will any of this pay off?” and “how many GPUs do they actually own?” Analysts have, on some level, become the fractional marketing team for the stocks they’re investing in. When Oracle announced its $300 billion deal with OpenAI in September — one that Oracle does not have the capacity to fill and OpenAI does not have the money to pay for – analysts heaved and stammered like horny teenagers seeing their first boob: These are the same people that retail and institutional investors rely upon for advice on what stocks to buy, all acting with the disregard for the truth that comes from years of never facing a consequence. Three months later, and Oracle has lost basically all of the stock bump it saw from the OpenAI deal, meaning that any retail investor that YOLO’d into the trade because, say, analysts from major institutions said it was a good idea and news outlets acted like this deal was real, already got their ass kicked. And please, spare me the “oh they shouldn’t trade off of analysts” bullshit. That’s the kind of victim-blaming that allows these revered fuckwits to continue farting out these meaningless calls. In reality, we’re in an era of naked, blatant, shameless stock manipulation, both privately and publicly, because a “stock” no longer refers to a unit of ownership in a company so much as it is a chip at a casino where the house constantly changes the rules. Perhaps you’re able to occasionally catch the house showing its hand, and perhaps the house meant for you to see it. Either way, you are always behind, because the people responsible for buying and selling stocks at scale under the auspices of “knowing what’s going on” don’t seem to know what they’re talking about, or don’t care to find out. Let’s walk through the latest surge of blatant stock manipulation, and how the media and analysts helped it happen. Oracle announces its unfillable, unpayable $300 billion deal with OpenAI, leading to 30%+ bump in stock price. Analysts, who should ostensibly be able to count, call it “momentous” and say they’re “in shock.” On September 22 2025, CEO Safra Catz steps down, and nobody seems to think that’s weird or suspicious. Two months later, Oracle’s stock is down 40%, with investors worried about Oracle’s growing capex, which is surprising I suppose if you didn’t think about how Oracle would build the fucking data centers. Basically anyone who traded into this got burned. NVIDIA announced a “strategic partnership” to invest “up to $100 billion” and build 10GW of data centers with OpenAI, with the first gigawatt to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Where would the data centers go? How would OpenAI afford to build them? How would OpenAI build a gigawatt in less than a year? Don’t ask questions, pig! NVIDIA’s stock bumped from from $175.30 to $181 in the space of a day. The media wrote about the story as if the deal was done, with CNBC claiming that “the initial $10 billion tranche [was] expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized.” I read at least ten stories that said that “NVIDIA had invested $100 billion.” Analysts would say that NVIDIA was “locking in OpenAI” to “remain the backbone of the next-gen AI infrastructure,” that “demand for NVIDIA GPUs is effectively baked into the development of frontier AI models,” that the deal “[strengthened] the partnership between the two companies…[and] validates NVIDIA’s long-term growth numbers with so much volume and compute capacity.” Others would say that NVIDIA was “enabling OpenAI to meet surging demand.” Three analysts — Rasgon at Bernstein, Luria at D.A. Davidson and Wagner at Aptus Capital — all raised circular deal concerns, but they were the minority, and those concerns were still often buried under buoyant optimism about the prospects of the company. One eensy weensy problem though, everyone! This was a “letter of intent” — it said so in the announcement! — and on NVIDIA’s November earnings, it said that it “entered into a letter of intent with an opportunity to invest in OpenAI.” It turns out the deal didn’t exist and everybody fell for it! NVIDIA hasn’t sent a dime and likely won’t. A letter of intent is a “concept of a plan.” Back in October, Reuters reported that Samsung and SK Hynix had "signed letters of intent to supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers," with South Korea's presidential office saying that said chip demand was expected to reach "900,000 wafers a month," with "much of that from Samsung and SK Hynix," which was quickly extrapolated to mean around 40% of global DRAM output. Stocks in both companies, to quote Reuters, “soared,” with Samsung climbing 4% and SK Hynix more than 12% to an all-time high. Analyst Jeff Kim of KB Securities said that “there have been worries about high bandwidth memory prices falling next year on intensifying competition, but such worries will be easily resolved by the strategic partnership,” adding that “Since Stargate is a key project led by President Trump, there also is a possibility the partnership will have a positive impact on South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S.” Donald Trump is not “leading Stargate.” Stargate is a name used to refer to data centers built by OpenAI. KB Securities has around $43 billion of assets under management. This is the level of analysis you get from these analysts! This is how much they know! On SK Hynix's October 29 2025 earnings call, weeks after the announcement, its CEO, Kim Woo-Hyun, was asked a question about High Bandwidth Memory growth by SK Kim from Daiwa Securities: This is the only mention of OpenAI. Otherwise, SK Hynix has not added any guidance that would suggest that its DRAM sales will spike beyond overall growth, other than mentioning it had "completed year 2026 supply discussions with key customers." There is no mention of OpenAI in any earnings presentation. On Samsung's October 30 2025 earnings call, Samsung mentioned the term "DRAM" 18 times, and neither mentioned OpenAI nor any letters of intent. In its Q3 2025 earnings presentation, Samsung mentions it will "prioritize the expansion of the HBM4 [high bandwidth memory 4] business with differentiated performance to address increasing AI demand." Analysts do not appear to have noticed a lack of revenue from an apparent deal for 40% of the world’s RAM! Oh well! Pobody’s nerfect! Both Samsung and SK Hynix’s stocks have continued to rise since, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this deal was something to do with it, even though it wasn’t. AMD announced that it had entered a “multi-year, multi-generation agreement” with OpenAI to build 6 GW of data centers, with “the first 1GW deployment set to begin in the second half of 2026,” calling the agreement “definitive” with terms that allowed OpenAI to buy up to 10% of AMD’s stock, vesting over “specific milestones” that started with the first gigawatt of data center development. Said data centers would also use AMD’s yet-to-be-released MI450 GPUs. The deal would, per Reuters, bring in “tens of billions of dollars of revenue.” Where would those data centers go? How would OpenAI pay for them? Would the chips be ready in time? Silence, worm! How dare you ask questions? How dare you? Why are you asking questions? NUMBER GO UP! AMD’s shares surged by 34%, with analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush saying that this was a “major valuation moment” for AMD. As an aside, Ives said that NVIDIA would benefit from the metaverse in 2021, and told CBS News in November 22 2021 that “the metaverse [was] real and Wall Street [was] looking for winners.” One would think that AMD’s November earnings — a month after the announcement — might be a barn-burner full of remaining performance obligations from OpenAI. In fact, CEO Lisa Su said that “[AMD expected] this partnership will significantly accelerate [its] data center AI business, with the potential to generate well over $100 billion in revenue over the next few years.” Here’s how AMD’s 10-Q filing referred to it: …so, no revenue from OpenAI at all, I guess? AMD raised guidance by 35% over the next five years AMD's trailing 12-month revenue is $32 billion. "Tens of billions of dollars" would surely lead to more than a 35% boost (an increase of $11.2 billion or so) in the next five years? Guess all of that was for nothing. No follow-up from the media, no questions from analysts, just a shrug and we all move on. Anyway, AMD’s stock is now down from a high of $259 at the end of October to around $214 as of writing this sentence. Everybody who traded in based on analyst and media comments got fucked. So, back on September 5, Broadcom said on its earnings call that it had a $10 billion order from a mystery customer, which analysts quickly assumed was OpenAI, leading to the stock popping 9%, and gradually increasing to a high of $369 or so on September 10, before declining a little until October 13, when Broadcom announced its ridiculous 10 gigawatt deal with OpenAI, claiming that it would deploy 10GW of OpenAI-designed chips, with the first racks to deploy the second half of 2026 and the entire deployment completed by end of 2029. The same day, its president of semiconductor solutions Charlie Kawwas added that said mystery customer was actually somebody else: Nevertheless, Broadcom's stock popped by 9% on the news about the 10GW deal, with CNBC adding that "the companies have been working together for 18 months." Because it's OpenAI, nobody sat and thought about whether somebody at Broadcom saying "well, OpenAI has yet to order these chips yet" was a problem. In fact, the answer to “how does OpenAI afford this?” appeared to be “they’d afford it” when it came to analysts: Not to worry, OpenAI’s solution was far simpler: it didn’t order any chips. During Broadcom's November earnings call, where Broadcom revealed that the $10 billion order was actually from Anthropic, another LLM startup that burns billions of dollars, which was buying Google's TPUs, and also booked another $11 billion in orders. Analysts somehow believed that Anthropic is “positioned to spend heavily” despite being another venture-backed welfare recipient in the same flavor as OpenAI. Oh, right, that 10GW OpenAI deal. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said that he did “not expect much in 2026” from the deal, and guidance did not change to reflect it. Broadcom climbed to a high of $412 leading up to its earnings, and I imagine it did so based on people trading on the belief that OpenAI and Broadcom were doing a deal together, which does not appear to be happening. While there’s an alleged $73 billion backlog, every dollar from Anthropic is questionable. Actually, yes we can. Whenever a company says “letter of intent” — as NVIDIA and SK Hynix/Samsung did — it’s important to immediately stop taking the deal seriously until you get the word “contract” involved. Not “agreement” or “deal” or “announcement,” but “contract,” because contracts are the only thing that actually matters. Similarly, it’s time for everybody — analysts, the media, members of congress, the fucking pope, I don’t care — to start treating these companies with suspicion, and to start demanding timelines. NVIDIA and Microsoft announced their $15 billion investment in Anthropic over a month ago. Where’s the money? Why does the agreement say “up to $10 billion” for NVIDIA and “up to $5 billion” from Microsoft? These subtle details suggest that the deal is not going to be for $15 billion, and the lack of activity suggests it might not happen at all. These deals are announced with the intention of suggesting there is more revenue and money in generative AI than actually exists. Furthermore, it is irresponsible and actively harmful for analysts and the media to continually act as if these deals will actually get paid when you consider the financial conditions of these companies. As part of its alleged funding announcement with NVIDIA and Microsoft, Anthropic agreed to purchase $30 billion of Azure compute. It also agreed to spend "tens of billions of dollars" with Google Cloud. It ordered $10 billion in chips from Broadcom earlier in the year, and apparently placed another $11 billion order in its latest fiscal quarter. How does it pay for those? It allegedly will burn $2.8 billion this year (I believe it burned much, much more) and raised $16.5 billion in funding (before Microsoft and NVIDIA’s involvement, which we cannot confirm has actually happened). How are investors tolerating Broadcom not directly stating “the future financial condition of this company is questionable”? Has Broadcom created a reserve for this deal? If not, why not? Anthropic will make no more than $5 billion this year, and has raised $17.5bn (with a further $2.5bn coming in the form of debt). How can it foreseeably afford to pay $10 billion, or $11 billion, or $21 billion, considering its already massive losses and all those other obligations mentioned? Will Jensen Huang hand over $10 billion so that Anthropic can hand it to Broadcom? I realize the counter-argument is that companies aren’t responsible for their counterparties’ financial health, but my argument is that it’s the responsibility of any public company to give a realistic view of its financial health, which includes noting if a chunk of its revenue is from a startup that can’t afford to pay for its orders. There is no counter to that! Anthropic cannot afford to pay Broadcom $10 billion right now! Nevertheless, the problem is that in any bubble, being really stupid and ignorant works right up until it doesn’t, and however harsh the dot com bubble might have been, it wasn’t harsh enough and those who were responsible were left unpunished and unashamed, guaranteeing that this cycle would happen again. I want to be really, abundantly clear about what’s happening: every single stock you see “growing because of AI” outside of those selling RAM and GPUs is actually growing because of something else. Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta all have other products that are making them money. AI is not doing it, and because analysts and investors do not think about things for two seconds, they have allowed themselves to be beaten down and turned into supplicants for public stocks. Investors have allowed themselves to be played, and the results will be worse than the dot com bubble bursting by several echelons. I’m gonna be really simplistic for a second. I am skeptical of AI because everybody loses money. I believe every AI company is unprofitable with margins that are getting increasingly worse as they scale, and as a result that none of them will be able to either get acquired or go public. This means that venture capitalists that have sunk money into AI stocks are going to be sitting on a bunch of assets under management (AUM) — the same assets they collect fees on — that will eventually crater or go to zero, because there will be no way for any liquidity event to occur. This is at a time of historically-low liquidity for venture capitalists, with Pitchbook estimating there will only be $100.8 billion in venture capital funds available at the end of 2025. Venture capitalists raise money from limited partners, who invest in venture capital with the hope of returns that outpace investing in the public markets. Venture capital vastly overinvested during 2021 and 2022, This was also a problem in private equity. In simple terms, this means these funds are sitting on tons of stock that they cannot shift, and the longer it takes for a company to either go public or acquired, the more likely it is the VC or PE firm will have to mark down its value. This is so bad that according to Carta, as of August 2024, less than 10% of VC funds raised in 2021 have made any distributions to their investors. In a piece from September, Carta revealed that “about 15% of funds” from 2023 have generated any disbursements as of Q2 2025, and the median net internal rate of return was a median 0.1%, meaning that, at best, most investors got their money back and absolutely nothing else. In fact, investing in venture capital has kinda fucking sucked. According to Carta, “As of the end of Q2, most VC funds across all recent vintages had a TVPI somewhere between 0.8x and 2x. But there are some areas where standout TVPIs are surfacing.” TVPI means Total Value To Paid-in Capital, or the amount of money you made for each dollar invested. This chart may seem confusing, it tells you that for the most part, VCs have struggled to provide even money returns since 2017. A “decent” TVPI is 2.5x, and as you’ll see, things have effectively collapsed since 2021. Companies are not going public or being acquired at the same rate, meaning that investor capital is increasingly locked up, meaning that limited partners are still waiting for a payoff from the last bubble, let alone this one. Carta would update the piece in December 2025, and things would somehow get worse. TVPI soured further, suggesting a further lack of exits across the board. The only slight improvement was the median IRR rose to 0.5% for funds from 2021 and 0.1% for funds from 2022. In simple terms, we are looking at years of locked-up capital leaving venture capital cash-starved and a little desperate. The worst part? All of this is happening during a generational increase in the amounts that startups need to raise thanks to the ruinous costs of generative AI, and the negative margins of AI-powered services. To quote myself: None of these companies are profitable, nor do they have any path to an acquisition or IPO. Why? Because even the most advanced AI software company is ultimately prompting Anthropic or OpenAI’s models, meaning that their only real intellectual property is those prompts and their staff, and whatever they can build around the models they don’t control, which has been obvious from the meager “acquisitions” we’ve seen so far. Windsurf, which was allegedly being sold to OpenAI, ended up selling its assets to Cognition in July, with Google paying $2.4 billion for its co-founders and a “licensing agreement,” similar to its acquisition of Character.Ai, where it paid $2.7 billion to rehire Noam Shazeer, license its tech, and pay off the stock of its remaining staff. This is also exactly what Microsoft did with Inflection AI and its co-founder Mustafa Suleyman. OpenAI’s acquisitions of Statsig ($1.1bn), Io Products ($6.5bn) and Neptune ($400m) were all-stock. Every other acquisition — Wiz, Confluent, Informatica, and so on (CRN has a great list here) — is either somebody trying to pretend that (for example) Wiz is related to AI, or trying to say that a data streaming platform is AI-related because AI needs that, which may be true, but doesn’t mean that any AI startups are actually selling. And they’re not, which is a problem, as 41% of US venture dollars in 2025 have gone into AI as of August, and according to Axios, the global number was around 51%. A crisis is brewing. Nerdlawyer, back in October, wrote about the explosive growth of secondary markets: In simpler terms, there are now Hot Potato Funds, where either another limited partner buys another one’s allocation, the companies themselves buy back their stock, or the stock is resold to other private investors. While this piece frames this as a positive, the reality is far grimmer. Venture capitalists are sitting on piles of immovable equity in companies worth far less than they invested at, and the answer, it appears, is to find somebody else to buy the dead weight. According to Newcomer, only 1117 venture funds closed in 2025 (down from 2100 in 2024), and 43% of dollars raised went to the largest venture funds, per The New York Times and PitchBook, suggesting limited partners are becoming less-interested in pumping cash into the system at a time when AI startups are demanding more capital than has ever been raised. How long can the venture capital industry keep handing out $100 million to $500 million to multiple startups a year? Because all signs suggest that the current pace of funding must continue in perpetuity, as nobody appears to have worked out that generative AI is inherently unprofitable, and thus every single company is on the Silicon Valley Welfare System until everybody gives up, or the system itself cannot sustain the pressure. I’ve read too many people make off-handed comments about this “being like the dot com boom” and saying that “lots of startups might die but what’s left over will be good,” and I hate them for both their flippancy and ignorance. None of the current stack of AI companies can survive on their own, meaning that the venture capital industry is holding them up. If even one of these companies falters and dies, the entire narrative will die. If that happens, it will be harder for AI companies to raise, and even harder to sell an AI company to someone else. This is a punishment for a decade-plus of hubris, where companies were invested in without ever considering a path to profitability. Venture capital has made the same mistake again and again, believing that because Uber, or Facebook, or Airbnb, or any number of companies founded nearly twenty years ago were unprofitable (with paths to profitability in all three cases, mind), it was totally okay to keep pumping up companies that had no path to profitability, which eventually became “had no apparent business model” (see: the metaverse, web3), which eventually became “have negative margins so severe and valuations so high that we will need an IPO at a market cap higher than Netflix.” This is Silicon Valley’s Rot Economy — the desperate, growth-at-all-costs attachment to startups where you “really like the founder,” where “the market could be huge” (who knows if it is!), where you just don’t need to worry about profitability because IPOs and exits were easy. Venture capital also used to be easy, because we were still in the era of hypergrowth. You could be a stupid asshole that doesn’t know anything, but there were so many good deals, and the more well-known you were, the more likely you’d be brought them first, guaranteeing a bigger payout, guaranteeing more LP capital, guaranteeing more opportunities that were of a higher quality because you were a big name. It was easier to make a valuable company, easier to get funded, and easier to sell, because the goal was always “get funded, grow as large an audience as possible, or go public/get acquired.” As a result, venture capital encouraged growth-at-all-costs thinking. In 2010, Ben Horwitz said that “the only thing worse for an entrepreneur than start-up hell (bankruptcy) is start-up purgatory”: This poisonous theory paid off, in that startups got used to building high-growth, low-margin companies that would easily sell to other companies or the markets themselves. Until it didn’t, of course. Per Nerdlawyer, IPOs have collapsed as an exit route, along with easy-to-raise capital. Per PitchBook, since 2022, 70% of VC-backed exits were valued at less than the capital put in, with more than a third of them being startups buying other startups in 2024. The money is drying up as the value of VCs’ assets is decreasing, at a time when VCs need more money than ever, because everybody is heavily leveraged in the single-most-expensive funding climate in history. And as we hit this historic liquidity crisis, the two largest companies — OpenAI and Anthropic — are becoming drains on the system that, in a very real sense, are participating in a massive redistribution of capital reserved for startups to one of a few public companies. No, really! OpenAI is trying to raise as much as $100 billion in funding so it can continue to pass money to one of a few public companies — $38 billion to Amazon Web Services over seven years, $22.4 billion to CoreWeave over five years, and $250 billion over an indeterminate period on Microsoft Azure. If successful, OpenAI’s venture telethon will raise more money than has ever been raised in a single round, draining funds that actual startups need. Anthropic has agreed to $70 billion in compute and chip deals across Google, Amazon and Broadcom, and that’s not including the Hut8 compute deal that Google is backing. This money will come from what remains of venture capital, private equity and hyperscaler generosity. Yet elsewhere, even the money that goes to regular startups is ultimately being sent to hyperscalers. That AI startup that needs to keep raising $100 million in a single round isn’t sending that cash to other startups — it’s mostly going to OpenAI (Microsoft, Amazon, CoreWeave, Google), Anthropic (Google, Microsoft, Amazon), or one of the large hyperscalers for Azure, AWS or Google Cloud. Silicon Valley didn’t birth the next big tech firm. It incubated yet another hyperscaler-level parasite, except instead of just spending money on hyperscaler services (and raising money to do so), both Anthropic and OpenAI actively drain the venture capital system as well, as they both burn billions of dollars. By creating something that’s incredibly expensive to run, they naturally create startups more-dependent on the venture capital system, and the venture capital system has no idea what to do other than say “just grow, baby!” Both OpenAI and Anthropic’s models might be getting cheaper on a per-million-token basis, but use more tokens, increasing the cost of inference, which in turn increases the costs of startups doing business, which in turn means OpenAI, Anthropic, and all connected startups lose more money, which increases the burn on venture capital. This is a doom-spiral, one that can only be reversed through the most magical and aggressive turnaround we will have seen in history, and it will have to happen next year, without fail. It won’t. So why did venture do this? Folks, we haven’t seen values this big in a long time. These are the biggest numbers we’ve ever seen. They’re simply tremendous. OpenAI is maybe worth $830 billion dollars, can you believe that? They lose so much money but folks we don’t worry about that, because they’re growing so fast. We love that Clammy Sam Altman — they call him “Clamuel” — tells everybody he’s giving them one billion dollars. Data centers are going to have the biggest deals we’ve ever seen, even [tchhh sound through teeth] if we have to work with Dario. You see, right now AI startups are big, exciting news for the limited partners funding LLM firms. Things feel exciting because the value of the assets under management (AUM) are going up, which is nothing dodgy, but just how VCs value things and if they are valuing AI stocks, that is how their fees are paid. Investing early in OpenAI allows a VC — or even an asset manager like Blackstone, which invested in 2024 — to say it has a big holding and a big increase in its AUM. We are currently in the sowing stage. Nevertheless, AI stocks make VCs who bet on them two years ago look like geniuses on paper. You got in early on OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, Cognition, Perplexity or any other company that loves to burn several dollars per dollar of revenue, you have a big, beautiful number, the biggest you’ve ever seen, and your limited partners need to pay you a fee just to manage it. Venture capital hasn’t seen valuations like this in a long time, and on paper, it feels like a lot of VCs got in on companies worth billions of dollars. On paper, Cognition is worth $10.2 billion, Perplexity $18 billion, Cursor $29.3 billion, Lovable $6.6 billion, Cohere $6.8 billion, Replit $3 billion, and Glean $7.2 billion — massive valuations for companies that all basically do products that OpenAI or Anthropic or Amazon or Google or any number of Chinese companies are already working to clone. They are all losing tons of money and have no path to profitability. But right now the numbers are simply tremendous. I’ve heard venture capitalists tell me that there are times when they have to agree to invest with little to no information or know that they’ll lose the opportunity to another sucker investor. I’ve heard venture capitalists say they don’t have any insight into finances. Venture capitalists would, of course, claim I’m insane, saying that the “growth is obviously there” while pointing to whatever startup has made $100 million ARR ($8.3 million in a month), all while not discussing the underlying operating expenses. The idea, I believe, is that the current spate of AI spending is only set to increase next year, and that will…somehow lead to fixing margins? Venture capitalists staunchly refuse to learn anything other than “invest in growth and then profit from growth,” even if “profiting from growth” doesn’t seem to be happening anymore. In reality, venture capital shouldn’t have touched LLMs with a fifteen foot pole, because the margins were obviously, blatantly bad from the very beginning. We knew OpenAI would lose $5 billion in the middle of 2024. A sane venture capital climate would have fucking panicked, but instead chose to double, triple and quadruple down. I believe that massive valuation drawdowns are a certainty. There are losses coming. Venture capitalists, I have to ask you: what happens if OpenAI dies? Do you think that this will make investors interested in funding or acquiring other AI startups? How much longer are we going to do this? When will venture capital realize it’s setting itself up for disaster? And what, exactly, is the plan? OpenAI and Anthropic will suck the lakes dry like an NVIDIA GPU named after Nancy Reagan. How is this meant to continue, and what will be left when it does? The answer is simple: there won’t be money for venture capital for a while. Those AI holdings are going to be worth, at best, 50%, if they retain any value at all. Once one of these startups die, a panic will ensue, sending venture capitalists scrambling to get their holdings acquired, until there’s little or no investor interest left. Why would LPs ever trust venture capital after this? Why would anybody? Because based on the past four years, it doesn’t appear that venture capital is actually good at investing money — it just got lucky, year after year, until there were few ideas that could sell for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. Venture capital believed it knew better as it turned its back on basic business fundamentals, starting with Clubhouse, crypto, the metaverse, and now generative AI. Yet they’re far from the only fuckwits on the dickhead express. Per Bloomberg, there were at least $178.5 billion in data-center credit deals in the US in 2025, rivaling the $215.4 billion invested in US venture capital in 2024 and the $197.2 billion invested in US VC through August 7 2025, and over $100 billion more than the $60.69 billion of data center credit deals done in 2024. I’m very worried, and I’m going to tell you why, using a company called CoreWeave that I’ve been actively warning people about since March. CoreWeave is something called a “neocloud.” It’s a company that sells AI compute, and does so by renting out NVIDIA GPUs, and as I explained a few months ago, it does so by building data centers backed by endless debt: CoreWeave is one of the largest providers of AI compute in the world, and its business model is indicative of how most data center companies make money, and to explain my concerns, I’m going to explain why using this chart from CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 earnings presentation. First, CoreWeave signs contracts — such as its $14 billion deal with Meta and $22.4 billion deal with OpenAI — before it has the physical infrastructure to service them. It then raises debt using this contract as collateral, orders the GPUs from NVIDIA, which arrive after three months, and then take another three months to install, at which point monthly client payments begin. To really simplify this: data center developers are raising money months up to a year before they ever expect to make a penny. In fact, I can find no consistent answer to “how long a data center takes to build,” and the answer here is pretty important, because that’s how the money is gonna get made from these things. You may notice that “monthly payments” begin at 6 to 30 months, a curious and broad blob of time. You see, data centers are extremely difficult to build, and the concept of an “AI data center” is barely a few years old, with the concept of hundreds of megawatts in one data center campus entirely made up of AI GPUs barely two years old, which means basically everybody building one is doing so for the first time, and even experienced developers are running into problems. For example, Core Scientific, CoreWeave’s weird partner organization it tried and failed to buy, has been trying to convert its Denton Texas cryptocurrency mining data center into an AI data center since November 2024, specifically so that CoreWeave can rent it to Microsoft for OpenAI. This hasn’t gone well, with the Wall Street Journal reporting a few weeks ago that Denton has been wracked with “several months” of delays thanks to rainstorms preventing contractors from pouring concrete. The cluster is apparently going to have 260MW of capacity. What this means for CoreWeave is that it can’t start getting paid by OpenAI, because, per its contract, customers don’t have to start paying until the compute is actually available. This is a very important detail to know for literally any data center development you’ve ever seen. As of its latest Q3 2025 earnings filing, CoreWeave is sitting on $1.1 billion in deferred revenue (income for services not yet rendered), up from $951 million in Q2 2025 and $436 million in Q1 2025. This means deposits have been made, but the contract has yet to be serviced. Now, I’m a curious little critter, so I went and found the 921-page $2.6 billion DDTL 3.0 loan agreement between CoreWeave and banks including Morgan Stanley, MUFG Bank and Goldman Sachs, and in doing so learned the following: I apologize, that suggests that CoreWeave isn’t already in trouble. Buried inside NVIDIA’s latest earnings (page 17) there was a little clue: Credit where credit is due — eagle-eyed analyst JustDario caught this in November — but in CoreWeave’s condensed consolidated balance sheets, there sits a $477.5 million line-item under “restricted cash and cash equivalents, non-current.” Though this might not be the NVIDIA escrow — this number shifted from $617m in Q1 to $340m in Q2 — it lines up all-too-precisely…and who else would NVIDIA be guaranteeing? In any case, CoreWeave is likely getting the best deals in data center debt outside of Oracle. It has top-tier financiers (who I will get to shortly), the full backing of NVIDIA (which is both an investor, customer and apparent financial backstop), and the ability to raise debt quickly. CoreWeave’s deals are likely indicative of how data center financing takes place, and those top-tier financiers? It’s been in basically every deal. In fact… So, I went and dug through a pile of 26 prominent data center loan deals, including the proposed $38 billion debt package that Oracle and Vantage Data Center Partners are raising for Stargate Shackelford and Wisconsin, Stargate Abilene, New Mexico, SoftBank’s $15 billion bridge loan (which I included for a reason that will become obvious shortly) and multiple CoreWeave loans, and found a few commonalities: I realize there are far more data center deals than these, but I wanted to show you exactly how centralized these deals are. The largest deals — the $38 billion Stargate TX/WI deal and $18 billion Stargate New Mexico deal — both involved Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, SMBC and MUFG, and all four of those companies have, at some point, funded CoreWeave. In fact, everybody appears to have funded CoreWeave at some point — CitiBank, Credit Agricole, Societe Generale, Wells Fargo, Carlyle, Blackstone, BlackRock, Barclays, Magentar, and Jefferies to name a few. Of the 40 banks and financial institutions I researched, 24 have, at some point, loaned to or organized debt for CoreWeave. Of those institutions, Blackstone, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Wells Fargo have done so multiple times. CoreWeave is a deeply unprofitable company saddled with incredible debt and deteriorating margins, with one of its largest clients paying net 360, and, as I’ve said, is arguably the best-financed data center company in the world. What I’m getting at is that most data center deals are likely much worse than the terms that CoreWeave faces, and are likely financed in a similar way, where a client is signed for data center capacity that doesn’t exist, such as when Nebius raised $4.3 billion through a share sale and convertible notes (read: loans) to handle its $17.4 billion data center contract with Microsoft, and guess what? Goldman Sachs acted as lead underwriter on the deal, with assistance from Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Morgan Stanley, all three of which have invested in CoreWeave. AI data centers are expensive, require debt due to the massive cost of construction and GPUs, and all take at least a year, if not two to start generating revenue, at which point they also begin losing money because it seems that renting out AI GPUs is really unprofitable. Every single major bank and financial institution has piled hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars into building data centers that take forever to even start generating money, at which point they only seem to lose it. Worse still, NVIDIA sells GPUs on a one-year upgrade cycle, meaning that all of those data centers being built right now are being filled with Blackwell chips, and by the time they turn on, NVIDIA will be selling its next-generation Vera Rubin chips. Now, you’ve probably heard that Vera Rubin will use the same racks (Oberon) as Blackwell, which is true to an extent, but won’t be true for long, as NVIDIA intends to shift to Kyber racks in 2027, hoping to build 1MW IT racks (which will involve entire racks-full of power supplies!), meaning that all of those data centers you see today — whenever they get built! — will be full of racks incompatible with the next generation of GPUs. This will also decrease the value of the assets inside the data centers, which will in turn decrease the value of the assets held by the firms investing. Stargate Abilene? The one invested in by JP Morgan, Blue Owl, Primary Digital Infrastructure and Societe Generale? The one that’s heavily delayed and won’t be ready until the end of 2026 at earliest? Full to the brim with two-year-old GB200 racks! By the beginning of 2027, Stargate Abilene will be obsolete, as will any and all data centers filled with Blackwell GPUs, as will any and all data centers being built today. Every single one takes 1-3 years and hundreds of millions (or billions) in debt, every single one faces the same kinds of construction delays, and better yet, almost all of them will turn on in roughly the same time frame. Now, I ain’t no economist, but I do know that “supply and demand” has an effect on pricing. What do you believe happens to the price of renting a Blackwell GPU when all of these data centers come on? Do you think it becomes more valuable? Or less? And while we’re on the subject, what do you think happens if there isn’t sufficient demand? Right now, OpenAI makes up a large chunk of the global sale of compute — at least $8.67 billion of Azure revenue through September 2025, $22.4 billion of CoreWeave’s backlog, $38 billion of Amazon’s backlog, and so on and so forth — and made, based on my reporting, just over $4.5 billion in that period. It cannot afford to pay anybody, and nowhere is that more obvious than when it negotiated year-long payment terms for CoreWeave. Otherwise, when you remove the contracts signed by hyperscalers and OpenAI (which I do not believe has paid anybody other than Microsoft yet), based on my analysis, there was less than a billion dollars of AI compute revenue in 2025, or 0.5831% of the money spent on data centers. Hyperscaler revenue is also immediately questionable, with Microsoft’s deal with Nebius (per its 6k filing) set to default in the event that Nebius cannot provide the capacity it sold out of its unfinished Vineland, New Jersey data center, which is being built by DataOne, a company which has never built an AI data center with a CEO that has his LinkedIn location set to “United Arab Emirates” with funding from a concrete firm that is also a vendor on the construction project. I also believe Microsoft is setting Nebius up to fail. Based on discussions with sources with direct knowledge of plans for the Vineland, New Jersey data center, Nebius has agreed to timelines that involve having 18,000 NVIDIA B200 and B300 GPUs by the end of January for a total of 50MW, with another 18,000 B300s due by the end of May. On speaking with experts in the field about how viable these plans are, two laughed, and one told me to fuck off. If Nebius fails to build the capacity, Microsoft can walk away, much like OpenAI can walk away from Stargate in the event that Oracle fails to build it on time (as reported by The Information in April), and I believe that this is the case for literally any data center provider that’s building a data center for any signed-up tenant. This is another layer of risk to data center development that nobody bothers to discuss, because everybody loves seeing these big, beautiful numbers. Except the numbers might have become a little too beautiful for some. A few weeks ago, the Financial Times reported that Blue Owl Capital had pulled out of the $10 billion Michigan Stargate Data Center project, citing “concerns about its rising debt and artificial intelligence spending.” To quote the FT, “Blue Owl had been in discussions with lenders and Oracle about investing in the planned 1 gigawatt data centre being built to serve OpenAI in Saline Township, Michigan.” What debt, you ask? Well, Blue Owl — formerly the loosest legs in data center financing — was in CoreWeave’s $600 million and $750 million debt deals for its planned Virginia data center with Chirisa Technology Parks, as well as a $4 billion CoreWeave data center project in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Stargate Abilene and Stargate Mexico, Meta’s $30 billion Hyperion data center, and a $1.3 billion data center deal in Australia through Stack Infrastructure, a company it owns through its acquisition of IPI Partners. To be clear, Blue Owl “pulling out” is not the same as a regular deal. It’s a BDC — Business Development Corporation — that invests both its own money and rallies together various banks, in this case SMBC, BNP Paribas, MUFG and Goldman Sachs (all part of Stargate New Mexico). Blue Owl is incredibly well-connected and experienced in putting together these kinds of deals, and very likely went to the many banks it’s worked with over the years, who apparently had “concerns about its rising debt,” much of it issued by them! While rumours suggest that Blackstone may “step in,” the banks that will actually back a $10 billion deal are fairly narrow, and “stepping in” would require billions of dollars and legal logistics. So, why are things looking shaky? Well, remember that thing about how this data center would be leased to Oracle? Well, it had a free cash flow of negative thirteen billion on revenues of $16 billion, with its most-recent earnings only "beat" on estimates only thanks to the sale of its $2.68 billion stake in Ampere. Its debt is exploding (with over a billion dollars in interest payments in its last quarter), its GPU gross margins are 14% (which does not mean profitable), its latest NVIDIA GB200 GPUs have a negative 100% gross margin, and it has $248 billion in upcoming data center leases yet to begin. All, for the most part, to handle compute for one customer: OpenAI, which needs to raise $100 billion, I guess. We’ve already got some signs of concern within the banking world around data center exposure. In November, the FT reported that Deutsche Bank — which backed CoreWeave multiple times and several data centers — was “exploring ways to hedge its exposure to data centers after extending billions of dollars in debt,” including shorting a “basket of AI-related stocks” or buying default protection on some of its debt using synthetic risk transfers, which are when a bank sells the full or partial credit risk of a loan (or loans) to another bank while keeping the loans on their book, paying a monthly fee to investors (this is a simplification). In December, Fortune reported that Morgan Stanley (CoreWeave three times, IPI Partners, Hyperion, SoftBank Bridge Loan) was also considering synthetic risk transfers on “loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure.” Back in April, SMBC sold synthetic risk transfers tied to “private debt BDCs” — and while this predates the large data center deals done by Blue Owl, SMBC has overseen multiple Blue Owl deals in the past. In December, SMBC closed another SRT, selling off risk from “Australian and Asian project finance loans,” though I can’t confirm if any of them were data center related. In December, Goldman Sachs paused a planned mortgage-bond sale for data center operator CyrusOne, with the intent to revive it in the first quarter of 2026. Oracle’s credit risk reached a 16-year high in the middle of December, with credit default swaps (basically, betting that Oracle will default on its debts, an unlikely yet no-longer-impossible event) climbing to their highest price since the great financial crisis. While Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank’s SRTs are yet to close, it’s still notable that two of the largest players in data center financing feel the need to hedge their bets. So, what exactly are they hedging against? Simple! That tenants won’t arrive and debts won’t get paid. I also believe they’re going to need bigger hedges, because I don’t think there is enough actual demand for AI to meet the data centers being built, and I think most data center loans end up being underwater within the next two years. I realize we’ve taken a great deal of words to get here, but every single part was necessary to explain what I think happens next. Let’s start by quoting my premium newsletter from a few weeks ago: You see, every little link in the chain of pain is necessary to understand things. In really simple terms, I believe that almost every investment in a data center or AI startup may go to zero. Let me explain. If we assume that 50% of $171.5 (so $85.75) billion in data center debt is in GPUs, that’s around 3.2GW of data center capacity, based on my model of NVIDIA’s approximate split of sales between different AI GPUs from my premium piece last week. The likelihood of the majority of these projects being A) completed within the next year and B) completed on budget is very, very small. Every delay increases the likelihood of default, as each of these projects is heavily debt-based. The customers of these projects are either hyperscalers (who are only “doing AI” because they have no other hypergrowth ideas and because Wall Street currently approves) or AI startups, all of whom are unprofitable. While there are potentially hedge funds or other companies looking for “private AI” integrations, I think this is a very, very small market. On top of that, AI compute itself may not be profitable, and because, by my estimate, everybody has spent about $85 billion on filling data centers with the same GPUs, the aggregate price of renting out GPUs will decline. Already the average price of Blackwell GPUs has declined to an average of $4.41 an hour according to Silicon Data, and that’s before the majority of Blackwell-powered GPUs come online. Yet the customer base shrinks from there, because the majority of AI startups aren’t actually renting GPUs — they build products on top of models built by OpenAI or Anthropic, who have made it clear they’re buying capacity from either hyperscalers or, in OpenAI’s case, getting Oracle or CoreWeave to build it for them. Why? Because building your own model is incredibly capital-intensive, and it’s hard to tell if the results will be worth it. Now, let’s assume — I don’t actually believe it will, but let’s try anyway — that all of that 3.2GW of capacity comes online. How much compute does an AI company use? OpenAI claims it has 2GW of capacity as of the end of 2025, and is allegedly approaching 900 million weekly active users. I don’t think there are any AI companies with even 10% of that userbase, but even if there were, OpenAI spent $8.67 billion on inference through the end of September. Who can afford to pay even 10% of that a year? Or 5%? Yet in reality, OpenAI is likely more indicative of the overall compute spend of the entire AI industry. As I’ve said, most companies are powered not by their own GPU-driven models, but by renting them from other providers. OpenAI and Anthropic spent a combined $11.33 billion in compute on Azure and AWS respectively through the first 9 months of this year, and as the two largest consumers of AI compute, which suggests two things: In fact, it would take sinking every single dollar of venture capital — over $200 billion — every single year and then some funneled into AI compute just to provide the revenue to justify these deals. In the space of a year, Microsoft Azure made $75 billion, Google Cloud $43 billion and Amazon Web Services $100 billion. Need more proof? Still don’t believe me? Then skip to page 18 of NVIDIA’s most-recent earnings: If there’s such incredible, surging demand, why exactly is NVIDIA spending six fucking billion dollars a year in 2026 and 2027 on cloud compute? NVIDIA doesn’t need the compute — it just shut down its AWS rival DGX Cloud! It looks far more like NVIDIA is propping up an industry with non-existent demand. I’m afraid there is no secret AWS-sized spend waiting in the wings for the right moment to pounce. There is no secret demand wave, nor is there any capacity crunch that is holding back incredible swaths of revenue. Oracle’s $523 billion in remaining performance obligations are made up of OpenAI, Meta, and fucking NVIDIA. For AI data centers to make sense, most startups would have to start becoming direct users of AI compute, while also spending more on cloud compute services than they’ve ever spent. The largest consumers of AI compute are both unprofitable, unsustainable monstrosities. Eventually, reality will dawn on one or more of these banks. Projects will get delayed thanks to weather, or budgetary issues, or when customers walk away (as just happened to data center REIT Fermi). Loan payments will start going unpaid. Elsewhere, AI startups will keep asking for money, again and again, and for a while they’ll keep raising, until the valuations get too high, or VC coffers get too low. You’re probably gonna say at this point that Anthropic or OpenAI might go public, which will infuse capital into the system, and I want to give you a preview of what to look forward to, courtesy of AI labs MiniMax and Zhipu (as reported by The Information), which just filed to go public in Hong Kong. Anyway, I’m sure these numbers are great-oh my GOD! In the first half of this year, Zhipu had a net loss of $334 million on $27 million in revenue, and guess what, 85% of that revenue came from enterprise customers. Meanwhile, MiniMax made $53.4 million in revenue in the first nine months of the year, and burned $211 million to earn it. It is time to wake up. These are the real-life costs of running an AI company. OpenAI and Anthropic are going to be even worse. This is why nobody wants to take AI companies public. This is why nobody wants to talk about the actual costs of AI. This is why nobody wants you to know the hourly cost of running a GPU, and this is why OpenAI and Anthropic both burn billions of dollars — the margins fucking stink, every product is unprofitable, and none of these companies can afford their bills based on their actual cashflow. Generative AI is not a functional industry, and once the money works that out, everything burns. Though many AI data centers boast of having tenancy agreements, remember that these agreements are either with AI startups that will run out of money or hyperscalers with legal teams numbering in the thousands. Every single deal that Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google or NVIDIA signs is riddled with outs specifically hedging against this scenario, and there won’t be a damn thing that anybody can do if hyperscalers decide to walk away. Before then, NVIDIA’s bubble is likely to burst. As I discussed a few weeks ago, NVIDIA claims to have shipped six million Blackwell GPUs, and while it may be employing very dodgy maths (claiming each Blackwell GPU is actually two GPUs because each one has two chips), my modeling of its last three quarters suggests that NVIDIA shipped around 5.33GW’s worth of GPUs — and based on reading about every single data center I can find, it doesn’t appear that many have been built and powered on. Worse still, NVIDIA’s diversified revenue is collapsing. In Q1FY26, two customers represented 16% and 14% of revenue, in Q2FY26 two customers represented 23% and 16% of revenue, and in Q3FY26 four customers represented 22%, 15%, 13% and 11% of total revenue, with all that money going toward either GPUs or networking gear. I go into detail here, but I put it in a chart to show you why this is bad: In simpler terms, NVIDIA’s revenue is no longer coming from a diverse swath of customers. In Q1FY26, NVIDIA had $30.84 billion of diversified revenue, Q2 $28.51 billion, and Q3 $22.23 billion. NVIDIA GPUs are astronomically expensive — $4.5 million for a GB300 rack of 72 B300 GPUs, for example — and filling data centers full of them requires debt unless you’re a hyperscaler. While I can’t say for sure, I believe NVIDIA’s diversified revenue collapse is a sign that smaller data center projects are starting to have issues getting funded, and/or hyperscalers are pulling back on their GPU purchases. To look through the eyes of an AI booster — all I’m seeing is blue and yellow, as usual! — one might say that these big customers are covering the loss of revenue, but the reality is that these big projects are run on debt issued by banks that are becoming increasingly-worried about nobody paying them back. The mistake that every investor, commentator, analyst and member of the media makes about NVIDIA is believing that its sales are an expression of demand for AI compute, when it’s really more of a statement about the availability of debt from banks and private credit. Similarly, the continued existence of AI startups is an expression of the desperation of venture capital, and the continuing flow of massive funding rounds is a sign that they see no other avenues for growth. Eventually, data centers are going to go unbuilt, and data center debt packages will begin to fall apart. Remember, Oracle’s $38 billion data center deal is actually yet to close, much like Stargate New Mexico is yet to close. These deals, while seeming like they’re trending positively, are both incredibly important to the future of the AI bubble, and any failure will spook an already-nervous market. Only one link in the chain needs to break. Every part of the AI bubble — this fucking charade — is unprofitable, save for NVIDIA and the construction firms erecting future laser tag arenas full of negative-margin GPUs. What happens if the debt stops flowing to data centers? How will NVIDIA sell those 20 million Blackwell and Vera Rubin GPUs? What happens if venture capitalists start running low on funds, and can’t keep feeding hundreds of millions of dollars to AI startups so that they can feed them to Anthropic or OpenAI? What happens to OpenAI and Anthropic if their already negative-margin businesses when their customers run out of money? What happens to Oracle or CoreWeave’s work-in-progress data centers if OpenAI can’t pay its bills? What happens to Anthropic’s $21 billion of Broadcom orders, or tens of billions of Google Cloud spend? In the last year, I estimate I’ve been asked the question “what if you’re wrong?” over 25 times. Every single time the question comes with an undercurrent of venom — the suggestion that I’m being an asshole for daring to question the wondrous AI bubble. Every single person who has asked this has been poorly-read — both in terms of my work and the surrounding economics and technological possibilities of Large Language Models — and believes they’re defending technology, when in reality they’re defending growth, and the Rot Economy’s growth-at-all-costs mindset. In many cases they are not excited about technology, but the prospects of being first in line to lick an already-sparkling boot. This has never been about progress or productivity. If it was, we’d actually see progress, or productivity boosts, or anything other than the frothiest debt and venture markets of all time. Large Language Models do not create novel concepts, they are inconsistent and unreliable, and even the “good” things they do vary wildly thanks to the dramatic variance of a giant probability machine. LLMs are not good enough for people to pay regular software prices at any scale, and the consequences of this will be that every single dollar spent on GPUs has been for exactly one point: manipulating the value of their stocks. AI does not have the business returns and may have negative gross margins. It is inconsistent, ugly, unreliable, expensive and environmentally ruinous, pissing off a large chunk of consumers and underwhelming most of the rest, other than those convinced they’re smart for using it or those who have resigned to giving up at the sight of a confidence game sold by a tech industry that stopped making products primarily focused on solving the problems of consumers or businesses some time ago. You may say that I’m wrong because Google, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon continue to have healthy net revenues and revenue growth, and as I previously said, these companies are not sharing AI revenues and their existing businesses are still growing due to the massive monopolies they’ve built. And I want to plea to AI boosters and bullish analysts alike: you are being had. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, Jensen Huang, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Ellison, Safra Catz, Elon Musk, Clay Magouyrk, Mark Sicilia, Michael Truell, Aravind Srivinas — all of them are laughing at you behind your back, because they know that you are never going to ask the obvious questions that would defeat my arguments, and know that you will never, ever push back on them. The enshittification of the shareholder has the downstream effect of an enshittification of the media and Wall Street analysts writ large. These companies own you. They treat you with disdain and condescension, because they know you’ll let them. They know that no sell-side analyst will ever ask them “when will you be profitable?” or “how much are you spending?” or if you do ask, they know you will experience temporary amnesia and forget whatever answer they give, because these are the incentives of an enshittified stock market, where stocks are not extrapolations of shareholder value but chips in a fucking casino where the house always wins and changes the rules every three months. They have changed the meaning of “stock” to mean “what the market will reward,” and when you allow companies to start dictating the terms of what will be rewarded — as neoliberalism, Friedman, Reagan, Nixon, NAFTA, Thatcher, and every other policy has, orienting everything exclusively around growth — companies eventually cut off any powers that may curtail any reevaluation of the fundamental terms of capitalism, and the incentives within. Focusing on growth-at-all-costs thinking naturally encourages, enables, and empowers grifters, because all they ever have to promise is “more” — more users, more debt, more venture, more features, more everything. The very institutions that are meant to hold companies accountable — analysts and the media — are far more desperate to trade scoops for interviews, to pull punches, to find ways to explain why a company is right rather than understand what the company is doing, and this is something pushed not by writers, but by editors that want to make sure they stay on the right side of the largest companies. And if I’m right, OpenAI’s death will kill off most if not all other AI startups, Anthropic included. Every investor that invested in AI will take massive losses. Every startup that builds on the back of their models will see their company fold, if it hasn’t already due to the massive costs and upcoming price increases. The majority of GPU-based data centers — which really have no other revenue stream — will be left inert, likely powered down, waiting for the day that somebody works it all out, which they won’t, because literally everybody has these things now and I truly believe they’ve tried everything. I don’t “hate on AI” because I am a hater, I hate on it because it fucking sucks and what I’m worried about happening seems to be happening. The tech industry has run out of hypergrowth ideas, and in its desperation hitched itself to the least-profitable hardware and software in history, then spent three straight years lying about what was possible to the media, analysts and shareholders. And they were allowed to lie, because everybody lapped it the fuck up. They didn’t need to worry about convincing anybody. Financiers, editors, analysts and investors were already drafting reasons why they were excited about something they didn’t really understand or believe in, other than the fact it promised more. This is what happens when you make everything about growth: everybody becomes stupid, ready to be conned, ready to hear what the next big growth thing is because asking nasty questions gets you fucking fired. And what’s left is a tech industry that doesn’t build technology, but growth-focused startups. Look at Silicon Valley. Do you see these fucking people ever building a new kind of computer? Do you believe these men fit to even imagine a future? These men care about the status quo, they want to always have more software to sell or ways to increase advertising revenue so that the stock number goes up so they receive more money in the form of stock compensation. They are concerned with neither actual business value, honest exchange of value, or societal value. Their existence is only in shareholder value, which is how they are incentivized by their board of directors. And really, if you’re still defending AI -- does it matter to any of you that this software fucking sucks, does it? If you think it’s good you don’t know much about software! It does not respond precisely at any point to a user or programmer’s intent. That’s bad software. I don’t care that you have heard developers really like it, because that doesn’t fix the underlying economic and social poison in AI. I don’t care that it sort of replaced search for you. I don’t care if you “know a team of engineers that use it.” Every single AI app is subsidized, its price is fake, you are being lied to, and none of this is real. When the collapse happens, do not let a single person that waved off the economics have a moment’s peace. Do not let anybody who sat in front of Dario Amodei or Sam Altman and squealed with delight at whatever vacuous talking points they burped out forget that they didn’t push them, they didn’t ask hard questions, they didn’t worry or wonder or feel any concern for investors or the general public. Do not let a single analyst that called AI skeptics “luddites” or equated them to flat Earthers hear the end of it. Do not let anybody who claimed that we “lost control of AI” or “blackmailed developers” go without their complementary “Fell For It Again” badge. When it happens, I promise I won’t be too insufferable, but I will be calling for accountability for anybody who boosted AI 2027, who sat in front of Sam Altman or Dario Amodei and refused to ask real questions, and for anyone who collected anything resembling “detailed notes” about me or any other AI skeptic. If you think I’m talking about you, I probably am, and I have a question: why didn’t you approach the AI companies with as much skepticism as you did the skeptics? I also promise you, if I’m wrong, I’ll happily explain how and why, and I’ll do so at length, too. I will have links and citations, I’ll do podcast episodes. I will make a good faith effort to explain every single failing, because my concern is the truth, and I would love everybody else to follow suit. Do you think any booster will have the same courtesy? Do you think they care about the truth? Or do they just want to get a fish biscuit from Sam Altman or Jensen Huang? Pathetic. It’s times like this where it’s necessary to make the point that there is absolutely “enough money” to end hunger or build enough affordable housing or have universal healthcare, but they would be “too expensive” or “not profitable enough,” despite having a blatant and obvious economic benefit in that more people would have happier, better lives and — if you must see the world in purely reptilian senses — enable many more people to have disposable income and the means of entering the economy on even terms. By contrast, investments in AI do not appear to be driving much economic growth at all, other than in the revenue driven to NVIDIA from selling these GPUs, and the construction of data centers themselves. Had Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon sunk $776 billion into building housing and renting it out, the world would be uneven, we would have horrible new landlords, and it would still be a great deal better than one where nearly a trillion dollars is being wasted propping up a broken, doomed industry, all because the people in charge are fucking idiots obsessed with growth. The future, I believe, spells chaos, and I am trying to rise to the occasion. My work has transformed from being critical of the tech industry to a larger critique of the global financial system. I’ve had to learn accountancy, the mechanics of venture and private equity, and all sorts of annoying debt-related language, all so that I sufficiently explain what’s going on. I see several worrying signs I have yet to fully understand. The Discount Window — where banks go when they need quick liquidity as a last resort — has seen a steady increase of loans on its books since September 2024, suggesting that financial institutions are facing liquidity issues, and the last few times that this has happened, financial crises followed. There is also a brewing bullshit crisis in Private Equity, which is heavily invested in data centers. In September, Auto parts maker First Brands collapsed in a puff of fraud with billions of dollars “vanishing” after it double-pledged the same collateral to multiple loans, off-balance sheet liabilities, falsified invoices, and even leased some of the parts it sold. This wasn’t a case where smaller lenders were swindled, either — global investment banks UBS and Jefferies both lost hundreds of millions of dollars, along with asset manager BlackRock through associated funds. Subprime auto lender Tricolor collapsed in similar circumstances, burning JPMorgan, Jefferies, and Zions Bancorporation, who also loaned money to First Brands. A similar situation is currently brewing with Solar company PosiGen, which recently filed for bankruptcy after, you guessed it, double-pledging collateral for loans. One of its equity financing backers is Magnetar Capital, who invested in CoreWeave. What appears to be happening is simple: large financial institutions are issuing debt without doing the necessary due diligence or considering the future financial health of the companies involved. Private Equity firms are also heavily-leveraged, sidling acquisitions with debt, and playing silly games where they “volatility launder” — deliberately choosing not to regularly revalue assets held to make returns (or the value of assets) look better to their investors. I don’t really know what this means right now, but I am worried that these data center loans have been entered into under similarly-questionable circumstances. Every single data center deal is based on the phony logic that AI will somehow become profitable one day, and if there’s even one First Brands situation, the entire thing collapses. I realize this is the longest thing I’ve ever written (or should I say written so far?), and I want to end it on a positive note, because hundreds of thousands of people now read and listen to my work, and it’s important to note how much support I’ve received and how awesome it is seeing people pick up my work and run with. I want to be clear that there is very little that separates you from the people running these companies, or many analysts. I have taught myself everything I know from scratch, and I believe you can too, and I hope I have been able to and will be able to teach you everything I know, which is why everything I write is so long. Well, that and I’m working out what I’m going to say as I write it. The AI bubble is an inflation of capital and egos, of people emboldened and outright horny over the prospect of millions of people’s livelihoods being automated away. It is a global event where we’ve realized how the global elite are just as stupid and ignorant as anybody you’d meet on the street — Business Idiots that couldn’t think their way out of a paper bag, empowered by other Business Idiots that desperately need to believe that everything will grow forever. I have had a tremendous amount of help in the last year — from my editor Matt Hughes, Robert and Sophie at Cool Zone Media, Better Offline producer Matt Osowski, Kakashii and JustDario (two pseudonymous analysts that know more about LLMs and finance than most people I read), Kasey Kagawa, Ed Ongweso Jr., Rob Smith, Bryce Elder and Tabby Kinder of the Financial Times, all of whom have been generous with their time, energy and support. A special shoutout to Caleb Wilson (Kill The Computer) and Arif Hasan (Wide Left), my cohosts on our NFL podcast 60 Minute Drill. And I’ve heard from thousands of you about how frustrated you are, and how none of this makes sense, and how crazy you feel seeing AI get shoved into every product, how insane it marks you feel when somebody tells you that LLMs are amazing when their actual outputs fucking suck. We are all being lied to, we all feel gaslit and manipulated and punished for not pledging ourselves to Sam Altman’s graveyard smash, but I believe we are right. In the last year, my work has gone from being relatively popular to being cited by multiple major international news organizations, hedge funds, and internal investor analyses. I was profiled by the Financial Times, went on the BBC twice, and watched as my Subreddit, r/BetterOffline, grew to around 80,000 visitors a week and became one of the 20th largest podcast Subreddits, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I believe there are millions of people that are tired of the state of the tech industry, and disgusted at what these people have done to the computer. I believe that they outnumber the boosters, the analysts and the hype-fiends that have propped up this era. I believe that a better world is possible by creating a meaningful consensus around making the powerful prove themselves to us rather than proving it for them.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Basius77 / Shutterstock.com In 2025, silver surged to record highs, topping $80 per ounce and briefly reaching $84 before retreating. Starting the year around $29 per ounce, the metal has delivered gains of over 160%, outperforming gold, stocks, and most asset classes. This rally has drawn parallels to Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC), which earlier surged past $126,000 amid predictions of $200,000 or more, fueling a buying frenzy. However, Bitcoin suffered a flash crash on Oct. 10, triggered by leverage deleveraging and broader market stress, leading to over $19 billion in liquidations and a more than 30% drop from highs. Silver followed a similar path, with traders eyeing momentum to carry it past $100 per ounce. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSEARCA:SLV), the largest silver ETF, closed at a high of $71.12 per share on Dec 26 while silver peaked at $83.62 — just before profit-taking and margin hikes sent it down over 11% to around $73 per ounce this morning. Investors now question if silver will mirror Bitcoin’s plunge. Bitcoin’s flash crash stemmed from high leverage in a thin market, amplified by political shocks like tariff threats that created a risk-off environment. Over $19 billion in positions were liquidated in hours, driven by overleveraged traders and whale panic-selling near highs. Unlike prior cycles with retail dominance, 2025 saw institutional participation, yet its correlation with equities strengthened, exposing crypto to broader risk-off moves. Bitcoin could face further downside if macroeconomic pressures persist, such as delayed rate cuts or trade tensions rising again. Its value relies heavily on sentiment and adoption expectations, lacking the tangible utility backing other assets and even other cryptocurrencies. While long-term potential exists from institutional and potential government interest, short-term volatility remains high without any physical demand to anchor it. Silver’s recent 11% drop echoes Bitcoin’s volatility, raising fears of a deeper correction. Profit-taking after record highs, margin hikes on the Comex Metals Exchange (CME), and year-end positioning contributed to the pullback. However, silver’s fundamentals differ markedly from Bitcoin’s speculative base. Silver’s primary driver is industrial use, which accounts for over half of demand. Applications in solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, and AI infrastructure continue growing. Solar alone consumes a significant share, with global installations pushing consumption higher despite efficiency improvements. U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 enhanced silver’s appeal, as they made buying less risky in a rate-easing environment. That offered support for the rally alongside ETF inflows and central bank buying. Most critical is silver’s structural deficit. The market has faced consecutive annual shortfalls, with 2025 estimates around 115 million to 120 million ounces unmet by mine production. Supply remains inelastic — silver is largely a byproduct of other mining — and recycling covers only a portion. Inventories in major vaults have shrunk, tightening physical availability. Unlike Bitcoin, whose supply is algorithmic and based on perceptions of its value, silver has intrinsic industrial utility. This physical backing provides support that is absent in crypto, limiting downside risk even during dips. Further pullbacks are possible — even likely — en route to higher levels, as volatility persists and the speculative froth surrounding the white metal unwinds. Yet the supply-demand imbalance favors sustained upside beyond current records. The iShares Silver Trust offers investors the most efficient way to gain silver exposure. Backed by physical bullion held in vaults, it avoids the storage, insurance, and assay costs of owning coins or bars. As the largest silver ETF managed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), it provides liquidity and direct price tracking. Surface parallels to Bitcoin’s crash may spark caution, but silver’s structural support — rooted in irreplaceable industrial demand and ongoing deficits — sets it apart. The 2025 run-up included more than a dash of irrational exuberance, yet silver’s underlying fundamentals point to further gains and higher highs ahead.

Title: BlackRock's BUIDL hits $100M in payouts, showing tokenized finance at scale

BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund has distributed $100 million from Treasury yields, offering a real-world test of blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Cointelegraph in your social feed BlackRock’s first tokenized money market fund has paid out $100 million in cumulative dividends since its launch, highlighting the growing real-world use of tokenized securities amid rising institutional adoption. The milestone for the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) was announced Monday by Securitize, which serves as the fund’s issuer and tokenization partner, overseeing onchain issuance and investor onboarding. Launched in March 2024, BUIDL was initially issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The fund invests in short-term, US dollar–denominated assets, including US Treasury bills, repurchase agreements and cash equivalents, offering institutional investors a blockchain-based vehicle to earn yield while maintaining liquidity. Investors purchase BUIDL tokens pegged to the US dollar and receive dividend distributions directly onchain, reflecting income generated from the underlying assets. Since its debut on Ethereum, BUIDL has expanded to additional blockchains, including Solana, Aptos, Avalanche and Optimism. The $100 million milestone is notable because it represents lifetime payouts derived from actual Treasury yields distributed to holders of onchain fund tokens. It demonstrates that tokenized securities can operate at scale while mirroring the core functions of traditional financial products. The development also underscores the operational efficiencies enabled by blockchain technology, including faster settlement, transparent ownership records and programmable distributions, features that are increasingly drawing interest from large asset managers and institutional investors exploring tokenized real-world assets. BUIDL, in particular, has seen strong adoption, with the value of the tokenized fund surpassing $2 billion earlier this year. Related: Fragmentation drains up to $1.3B a year from tokenized assets: Report Tokenized money market funds have quickly emerged as one of the fastest-growing segments of the onchain RWA market, and for good reason. Their appeal lies in their ability to deliver money market–style returns with greater operational efficiency, a dynamic that has begun to draw attention from traditional financial institutions. Some market participants view these products as a potential counterweight to the anticipated growth of stablecoins. In July, JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho said tokenized money market funds preserve the longstanding appeal of “cash as an asset,” even as regulatory developments such as the approval of the GENIUS Act were expected to accelerate stablecoin adoption and potentially erode the role of cash-like instruments. Despite their rapid growth, tokenized money market funds have also attracted industry scrutiny. The Bank for International Settlements recently warned that such products could introduce operational and liquidity risks, particularly as they become an increasingly important source of collateral within the digital asset ecosystem.

Title: The dollar has been the weakest major currency in 2025. Here's what that means for everyday Americans.

The US dollar has declined against all of its main global peers in 2025, and the Dollar Index — which measures the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies — is down 10% this year. There have been multiple catalysts for the decrease, none more prevalent than the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates multiple times. Generally speaking, when a central bank lowers rates, holding a currency becomes less attractive. There's also the matter of President Trump's proposed tariff policies, which particularly roiled markets in the first half of 2025. Investors viewed his potential levies as negative for growth and a source of uncertainty, both of which were dollar-negative. But let's not get too doom-and-gloom about a weak dollar. There are positives too. Every time Jennifer publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Stay connected to Jennifer and get more of their work as it publishes.

Detailed below are the two pros and two cons of a depreciating currency: A weaker US currency offers other countries more purchasing power, which can boost exports and economic growth. It can also support US industries that depend heavily on exports, like manufacturing and agriculture. The US exported $125 billion more goods and services in the nine months leading up to September than it did the same period last year, the Census Bureau said this month, an increase of 5%. President Donald Trump pointed out the benefits of a weaker dollar when speaking to the press in July, suggesting that the US could "make a hell of a lot more money" when the greenback was weak. "When we have a strong dollar, one thing happens: It sounds good. But you don't do any tourism. You can't sell tractors, you can't sell trucks, you can't sell anything," he said at the White House. "Pushing down the dollar's value has been a policy priority for the administration as it sought in part to make exports more attractive," Joseph Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM, wrote in a note on Monday. There are also positive implications for the labor market. If export-heavy industries like manufacturing and agriculture are thriving, that can create more jobs. A boost to international sales is inherently good news for US firms that sell goods abroad. That applies to most of the S&P 500, where foreign sales are significant for at least half of the index's companies, Hogan said. "I would say the pros and cons for corporate America are more tailwinds than headwinds," he added. After the US dollar recorded its worst first half of the year in nearly half a century, Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief US equity strategist, said the bank believed a weaker greenback was an underappreciated "tailwind" from an earnings perspective. "There's no doubt that a weaker dollar is part of the story for why revision factors have continued to move — even faster recovery than we had expected," he said, speaking to CNBC earlier in the year. A cheaper dollar could also be a boon for unhedged international equities, or shares of international stocks in local currencies, BlackRock said in a recent client note. That's partly because foreign firms are gaining purchasing power as their local currencies strengthen against the greenback. On the other hand, a weaker currency in the US can translate to higher prices for US consumers of imported goods, or goods with imported parts. That adds to inflationary pressures that already hang in the background with Trump's tariffs. Consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November — below what economists expected, but still above the Fed's long-run 2% inflation target. "For everyday Americans, the story is a bit opposite," Hogan said. "The buying power of your dollar goes down as the value of the dollar goes down against the basket of other currencies. So it does make it harder to keep up with higher cost of goods." Americans on vacation could also facing higher costs, as a weaker dollar has less purchasing power abroad, Hogan added. On the flip side, it also makes the US more attractive as a tourist destination for foreigners, who have gained purchasing power. "There's puts and takes," he said. "If you're planning that European vacation, it's going to cost you a bit more in that currency translation." Jump to

Title: Mirae Asset announces plans to acquire Korean crypto exchange Korbit

Time Published: 2025-12-29T16:05:14Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 11:05 EST / DECEMBER 29 2025 by Kyt Dotson Seoul-based financial firm Mirae Asset Financial Group is considering buying Korean cryptocurrency exchange Korbit Inc., the Korea Times reported today. The Korean cryptocurrency market is dominated by Upbit and Bithumb, which represent over 95% of the exchange volume in the country. As the fourth-largest cryptocurrency exchange, Korbit serves as an entry point for Mirae into the cryptocurrency industry, which has traditionally focused on traditional finance since its founding in the late 1990s. Founded in 2013, Korbit, also known as 코빗 (Ko-bit) in Korean, began as Korea’s first cryptocurrency exchange, pioneering bitcoin trading in Korean won. Although it opened the market to the local population and paved the way for early trading infrastructure, it was quickly surpassed by the larger exchanges. Today, it still remains a key player in the market. Officials at Mirae said the company is in talks to acquire a 60.5% stake in Kobit from its parent company, NXC Corp., the exchange’s largest shareholder, and a 31.5% from SK Planet. NXC is the family holding group that owns a controlling stake in major South Korea-based global video game giant Nexon Co. Ltd., a developer and publisher known for games like MapleStory and Dungeon Fighter Online. The deal is estimated at up to 140 billion won, around $97.5 million total. The purchase would be led by Mirae Asset Consulting, the group’s real estate and consulting affiliate controlled by founder Park Hyeon-joo and his wife. Mirae offers asset management, wealth management, investment banking and insurance. Since its founding, it established itself as a prominent leader in traditional finance. An unnamed industry official quoted by the Korea Times noted that Park, now global strategy officer, previously emphasized exploring business opportunities that interconnect traditional finance to digital assets. “Korbit has historically had a limited presence, but Mirae Asset Financial Group’s decades of expertise could allow it to pursue a differentiated strategy,” he added. The purchase could shift the current nature of Korea’s cryptocurrency and digital asset landscape. Kobit maintains a large number of regulatory licenses in the country. The acquisition news follows increasing outreach throughout the global market by major financial firms, including MasterCard Inc., multinational investment management firm BlackRock Inc. and the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc.

Share this article BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, deposited over 2,200 Bitcoin worth around $192 million and $22 million in Ethereum to Coinbase Prime today, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. The latest transfers come after IBIT, the company’s flagship Bitcoin ETF, recorded $435 million in net outflows last week. Recent weeks have brought choppy flows overall, but outflows have generally outweighed inflows. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has also seen extended investor withdrawals in recent weeks, including $69 million last week. Bitcoin has seen sharp price swings, climbing above $90,000 over the weekend before easing to $87,703, per CoinGecko. Ethereum likewise pulled back below $3,000 after earlier gains.

Title: Crypto Predictions for 2026: Top Analysts’ View

Time Published: 2025-12-29T13:43:53Z

© 2026 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Top crypto firms reveal their 2026 forecasts: BTC ATHs, stablecoin dominance, and tokenized assets take center stage as speculation gives way to real-world infrastructure. 2025 has been a wild ride for everyone who expected BTC $87 881 24h volatility: 0.0% Market cap: $1.75 T Vol. 24h: $27.93 B and major altcoins to hit new highs. We’re 3 days away from the New Year, volatility is still insane, the Fear and Greed index has been extreme for dozens of days, and most significant cryptocurrencies are trading well below their ATHs. However, prominent crypto moguls are slightly optimistic about 2026. We gathered the most significant predictions in one post, and yes, we want to come back here next December and find out if this time they were true. BlackRock’s 2026 outlook frames digital assets, especially stablecoins, as financial infrastructure for payments, settlement, and liquidity, rather than a pure speculative trade. The firm highlights the maturing role of dollar-pegged tokens in cross-border transfers and treasury flows. It argues that crypto’s most durable growth now sits beneath the surface in rails that interoperate with traditional finance. “Stablecoins are no longer niche — they’re becoming the bridge between traditional finance and digital liquidity,” says Samara Cohen, Global Head of Market Development at BlackRock. Grayscale’s annual outlook calls for Bitcoin to set a new all-time high in the first half of 2026. A DCG-owned investment group believes the Bitcoin price will be driven by clearer U.S. policy, rising institutional demand, and the fading dominance of the simple four-year halving cycle as macro liquidity and regulation take the wheel. The firm expects “rising valuations in 2026,” with institutions increasingly treating BTC as an allocatable portfolio asset. Grayscale’s 2026 Digital Asset Outlook is here with 10 themes marking the "Dawn of the Institutional Era." Our last 3 themes dive into what’s shaping crypto’s next phase in 2026. From Grayscale — the world’s largest digital asset-focused investment platform¹. Click below ⬇️ — Grayscale (@Grayscale) December 22, 2025 In its report, Coinbase Institutional says market structure, not narratives, will define 2026. The major crypto exchange expects the activity to concentrate on: Perpetual futures will anchor price discovery and command most trading volume. Leverage reset in late-2025 is seen as structural, not a retreat. Prediction markets will become a credible venue for information and risk transfer. It is worth noting that Coinbase plans its own push into the category. Stablecoins and payments will become crypto’s most persistent real-world use case. Coinbase models the stablecoin market cap at approximately $1.2 trillion by 2028. In its paper titled “26 Crypto, Bitcoin, DeFi, and AI Predictions for 2026“, Galaxy, same as BlackRock, focused on the real-world use cases. Stablecoins are forecast to process more volume than U.S. ACH and become core payment plumbing. Tokenized assets are expected to enter mainstream collateral and capital markets. Public chains will rethink value capture, with at least one L1 likely enshrining a revenue-generating app to feed its native token. In the meantime, the company thinks it’s too hard to predict the Bitcoin price, but it still sticks to its $250,000 forecast by the end of 2027. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest maintains a multi-year, institution-led BTC adoption thesis. They’ve maintained their 2030 scenario up to $2.4 million in the bull case and stepped up buying of crypto-exposed equities into year-end 2025. In a recent video for investors, Wood even says 2026 will be a Goldilocks year due to 0% inflation. Cathie Wood predicts 0% inflation by 2026 She says 2026 could be a Goldilocks year. After tariffs, shutdown risk, and hawkish Fed rhetoric, the market may be underestimating how close inflation could get to zero if oil and rents keep falling. pic.twitter.com/YeNlrsrlIr — Ark Invest Tracker (@ArkkDaily) December 21, 2025 Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: Could Bitcoin Replay Silver’s Rally… Backward? CEO Issues Warning

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Peter Schiff has warned that Bitcoin could suffer the opposite fate of silver after the metal posted a sudden, sharp rise. Based on reports, traders and analysts are debating whether the move in silver marks a broad shift back to real assets or a brief, crowded trade that may unwind quickly. According to trading data, silver jumped more than 10% in a single session and rose from about $78 to $79 in roughly ninety minutes. Spot silver climbed 18% last week to close at a record $79.31 on thin post-Christmas volume and its new status as a strategic metal. Reports have disclosed that this rally is being driven by a supply deficit and Washington’s decision to classify silver as a critical mineral, not by geopolitics or hopes for US rate cuts. A TradingView chart showed a near-vertical breakout, and a monthly RSI reading reached its highest level in 45 years, a sign of extreme momentum. What is happening with silver may soon be happening with Bitcoin, only in reverse. But since markets tend to melt down faster than they melt up, the time frame for the move should be condensed. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 27, 2025 Tokenized versions of metal assets have also gained ground. Based on reports, these crypto-linked commodity tokens are approaching a $4 billion overall valuation, reflecting growing investor curiosity. CompaniesMarketCap data showed silver’s market value closing the gap with NVIDIA, a comparison that highlights heavy institutional demand for metal exposure. Still, tokenized assets remain small compared with spot markets and big ETFs, which means the shift is visible but not yet broad-based. Bitcoin traded near $87,000 with little movement over the same period, according to CoinMarketCap snapshots, and some market charts show Bitcoin losing relative ground to silver since 2017. A silver-to-Bitcoin valuation model places Bitcoin’s trend value near $394,000, a figure that prompts debate among traders about where each market could go next. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF’s strong inflows in 2025 point to steady institutional accumulation in crypto, while other indicators suggest Bitcoin’s gains can stall without fresh catalysts. Spot silver’s strong weekly gain has left technicians and strategists split. Some say the move reflects a true supply-demand mismatch reinforced by the US critical mineral designation, which has encouraged long-term buying. Others point to the thin volume after the holidays as a factor that magnified price moves. A closing price reversal top pattern at record highs has been flagged by chart watchers, signaling that a correction could follow after such rapid ascent. These signs, combined with extreme RSI readings, raise questions about the sustainability of the current breakout. Market veterans emphasize that fast rallies can reverse quickly when liquidity dries up. Peter Schiff argued that declines often accelerate under pressure, and that idea matters because crowded positions can be unwound in a short span. At the same time, long-term flows into Bitcoin-related ETFs and institutional products should not be ignored; they can support higher prices over time. What traders watch next will be trade volumes, whether silver holds above current levels, and whether Bitcoin regains momentum in the face of metal strength.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: XRP ETFs blow past $1bn in inflows. Where will token price go in 2026?

About us Copy link XRP exchange-traded funds are charging head-on into 2026. ETFs backed by the fifth largest crypto have attracted over $1 billion in investment since launching in November, according to SoSoValue data. There has not been a single day of net outflow since their debut. That far outpaces comparable Solana ETFs, which have pulled in $387 million over the same period. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs have seen $3.6 billion in selloffs in the same timeframe. Ethereum ETFs have also bled $1.2 billion, DefiLlama data shows. But the flood of capital into ETFs backed by XRP has not helped the token’s price after the crypto market’s October downturn that wiped out $1 trillion in value. XRP is trading at $1.88 at time of reporting, 49% below its all-time high of $3.65 set in July. “We expect the price pattern to broadly resemble what we saw with Bitcoin and Ethereum, though on a much smaller scale,” Jonathan Yark, quantitative trader at Acheron Trading, told DL News. “XRP has specific use cases around payments and treasury flows,” Yark said. “We’re in a genuine adoption phase for crypto ETFs, which means periods of rapid inflows followed by consolidation.” The relentless capital inflow into XRP ETFs comes as more and more institutions embrace crypto. Vanguard, the $11 trillion asset management heavyweight long associated with institutional restraint, reversed course and launched spot crypto ETF trading earlier in December. “Vanguard’s distribution reach is enormous, and opening access signals a shift from opposition to adoption. That alone will help pull more traditional investors into the asset class,” Yark said. Wall Street stalwarts including BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton, all have rolled out crypto ETF offerings over the past two years. “Institutions, like Bank of America and Vanguard, are steadily opening access and that shift supports a sustained, long-term market rather than a short-lived boom,” Yark said. Other firms expected to launch their own XRP ETFs include 21Shares, ProShares, and CoinShares, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s website shows. “Flows will remain highly dependent on settlement, but the broader trajectory is clearly positive.” Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent.
