Posted on 08/25/2025 6:33:00 PM PDT by SeekAndFind Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow expressed concern on Friday over the Trump administration’s move to take a 10 percent stake in mega chipmaker Intel. “I am very, very uncomfortable with that idea. I’m very uncomfortable with that one, but that’s a conversation for another meal on another day,” Kudlow told economist Stephen Moore, in an interview highlighted by Mediate. Moore himself, a Trump economic adviser, earlier in the appearance, also criticized the administration’s decision, calling it “terrible.” “I hate corporate welfare. That’s privatization in reverse. We want the government to divest of assets, not buy assets. So terrible, one of the bad ideas that’s come out of this White House,” Moore told Kudlow, who served under President Trump as the director of the National Economic Council during his first term. Trump on Friday announced that the U.S. government now owns 10 percent of Intel shares. “The United States paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars. This is a great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” he wrote on social media. (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

Title: 11 Investment Must Reads for This Week (Aug. 26, 2025)

Time Published: 2025-08-25T19:13:53Z
Full Content:
Growth in the use of ETFs and SMAs is changing how muni portfolios are constructed, reports Bond Buyer. Morningstar gives investors a closer look at potential pitfalls of using funds of funds. These are among the investment must-reads we found this week for financial advisors. August 25, 2025 ETF and SMA Growth Is Reshaping How Muni Portfolios Are Built and Managed “At The Bond Buyer's Buy-Side Summit, panelists from BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Invesco, and BAM Mutual explore how demand for customization, transparency, and active strategies is transforming the muni fund landscape.” (Bond Buyer) Funds of Private Funds for the Masses? What Investors Need to Know About the SEC’s Latest Guidance “Secondary managers have a habit of buying these funds at discounts to their net asset values and then immediately marking them back up to their NAVs once they own them. This can create illusory returns, as the apparent gains are just on paper and the result of an accounting trick. Secondary managers who do this are essentially pulling future returns into the present by assuming they can at least get the private fund’s NAV if they have to sell it today, even though they may have bought it yesterday at a discount.” (Morningstar) What Barron Capital’s Newest ETFs Say About Interest in Active Investing “Dave Nadig, Nadig.com independent ETF expert, joins CNBC’s Frank Holland on ‘Halftime Report’ to discuss Baron Capital’s entrance into the ETF market and why going active could work for the firm.” (CNBC) Stanger: Private Non-Traded REITs Outraise Publicly Traded Counterparts by 45% “Private non-traded real estate investment trusts outraised their publicly registered non-traded counterparts by over 45% to start the year, attracting over $4.2 billion of investor capital compared to $2.9 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2025. This is according to the latest analysis by Robert A. Stanger & Company Inc., an investment banking firm and leader in alternative investment industry research. In Q2 2025, private non-traded REITs grew their aggregate net asset value to $24 billion, a 10.5% quarter-over-quarter increase, further cementing their expanding share of the non-traded REIT market.” (AltsWire) It’s Not Too Early to Look at Tax-Exempt Bond ETFs “Fall is just around the corner, and with it comes the start of portfolio preparation for the end of the year. For many investors and advisors, that means adding investments that can help reduce the tax bill from portfolios. Tax exempt bond ETFs in particular can provide a powerful tool in meeting that goal. Leaning on the ETF wrapper, those funds may be worth adding now amid continued interest rate uncertainty.” (VettaFi) Fintech Upstarts Are Powering a Boom—and Ecosystem—for Private Markets “Sophisticated platforms—typically catering to private-wealth advisers—aim to ease their clients’ ownership and management of assets in private credit, real estate, private equity and other alternative investments that, until recently, were reserved for institutional investors and the super-wealthy. New software tools, digital tokenization and AI are being put to work to remove longstanding pain points in everything from making products discoverable to executing transactions, managing ownership stakes and educating advisers and their clients.” (PitchBook) Beleaguered Private Investment B-D Draws More Regulatory Scrutiny “Linqto Capital, a private stock investment platform that last month filed for bankruptcy protection after drawing scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.” (Financial Advisor IQ) The Democratization of Private Equity Could Create a “Systemic Risk Machine” “Private equity’s success depends on patient, locked-up capital insulated from the mood swings of public markets. Retail flows bring the opposite: liquidity demands, shorter investment horizons, and a political reflex for heavier oversight. Regulatory tripwires abound: Once retirement-plan investments exceed 25 percent of a fund’s assets, Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) rules apply, dragging in the kind of compliance costs and fiduciary constraints that sap agility.” (Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research) Yieldstreet’s Real Estate Struggles Could Shake Fractional Ownership Market “Yieldstreet, a once-heralded platform promising to democratize access to private real estate, recently disclosed steep losses and defaults in a large swath of its real estate deals. The ripple effects of these bad investments extended beyond its investor base. A recent review of 30 real-estate offerings revealed that four deals ended in total loss and another 23 are on watchlists and have triggered approximately $78 million in defaults in just the past year.” (Propmodo) This Classic Investment Strategy Is Still Alive in 2025 “The merit of a classic portfolio of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has been a matter of debate in recent years. A diversified 60/40 strategy failed to protect investors in 2022’s broad market crash—in fact, an all-stock portfolio would have held up better. However, a historical deep dive from Morningstar concluded that the tried-and-true approach lessened the pain in almost all of the worst market crashes in 150 years better than an all-stock portfolio. Morningstar Inc Portfolio Strategist Amy Arnott discusses the 60/40 portfolio’s ups and downs and its performance in 2025.” (Morningstar) Thoma Bravo Secures Leeway from Backers to Hand Slice of PE Deals to Other Investors “US software-focused private equity group negotiated broad carve-out in recent funds’ terms.” (Financial Times) Related:Nicholas Wealth Management: Playing It Safe, with a Twist Elaine Misonzhnik Senior Editor, Investments, WealthManagement.com Elaine Misonzhnik is Senior Editor, Investments at WealthManagement.com, focusing on alternative investments.

Data shows advisors now hold $17.4 billion in Bitcoin ETF positions, nearly doubling hedge fund managers' $9 billion exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Investment advisors drove institutional Bitcoin (BTC) exposure via exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to $33.6 billion during the second quarter of 2025. Data shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on Aug. 25 revealed that institutions added 57,375 BTC across all tracked categories. Bloomberg Intelligence data shows advisors now hold $17.4 billion in Bitcoin ETF positions, nearly doubling hedge fund managers’ $9 billion exposure. Brevan Howard Capital Management emerged as the largest institutional Bitcoin ETF shareholder among the new investors. The fund manager increased its BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holdings by 71% to 37.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion as of June 30. Harvard Management Company entered the Bitcoin ETF space with a $117 million position in IBIT. Harvard’s Bitcoin allocation ranks alongside its largest US-listed holdings, including Microsoft at $310 million and Amazon near $235 million, representing approximately 8% of its reported portfolio. The university endowment now holds more Bitcoin than gold in dollars, with its SPDR Gold Trust position valued at roughly $102 million at quarter-end. Seyffart also highlighted that advisors have become “by far the biggest holders” of spot Bitcoin ETFs. They added 37,156 BTC during the second quarter and reached 161,909 BTC. He said that “pretty much every category” out of the 15 listed had increasing exposure during the second quarter, except pension funds, which maintained $10.7 million positions. Brokerage firms’ allocation via Bitcoin ETFs reached $4.3 billion, after the second-largest addition among institutions of 13,911 BTC. Banks registered the third-largest allocation of 2,476 BTC, and now have roughly $655 million in Bitcoin through ETF shares. Investment advisors’ $17.4 billion allocation exceeds the combined holdings of hedge funds, brokerages, and holding companies, signaling a shift toward professional wealth management integration. Seyffart noted that the $33.6 billion allocated by institutional investors relates to 13F form filings, representing only 25% of the total Bitcoin ETF shares. He added: “The other 75% are owned by non-filers which is largely going to be retail.” Despite the increasing institutional appetite, retail appears to drive most of the Bitcoin ETF still flows.

Wells Fargo's wealth management unit partnered with InvestCloud to add private market investments to its UMA program. August 25, 2025 Wells Fargo has become the latest wealth management firm to add alternative investment options to its UMA platform. Wells Fargo’s Wealth & Investment Management division formed a partnership with fintech firm InvestCloud to make alternative assets available through the wirehouse's personalized UMA program. The UMA program now includes a full range of alternative investment options, from private equity and private debt to hedge funds and real assets. The program uses both perpetual and drawdown fund structures. Wells joins a spate of firms that have recently added private market options to UMA platforms, including Fidelity and Goldman Sachs. “We are committed to providing new technologies that deliver personalized, scalable and data-driven client experiences,” Greg Maddox, product management executive at Wells Fargo Investment Management, said in a statement. “We are proud to offer industry-leading investment capabilities and find new and innovative ways to make the company an easier place for advisors and clients to do business.” Earlier this year, InvestCloud struck a partnership with alternative asset manager Apollo Global Management to become part of its Private Markets Account (PMA) Network, which combines public and public assets in a single platform. As a result, InvestCloud’s clients get access to Apollo’s private market model portfolios and multi-manager models in their managed account programs.

Title: Bitcoin Flash Crash Roils Crypto Market
URL: https://gizmodo.com/bitcoin-price-flash-crash-ether-thiel-2000647613
Time Published: 2025-08-25T17:50:49Z

Crypto prices dipped Monday following a so-called flash crash of Bitcoin on Sunday. And while Ethereum dipped as well, the second most popular cryptocurrency is still up significantly on the month. Bitcoin’s weekend crash is being blamed on a single whale who sold 24,000 Bitcoin, according to crypto watchers on X. Bitcoin’s most recent peak hit $117,370 on Friday, not too far from the all-time high of $124,500. But Bitcoin is currently sitting at $112,660, well below recent highs. “Bitcoin flash crash today, which wiped out $310M in long positions, has been traced to a SINGLE Bitcoin whale dumping BTC for ETH. The whale sold 24,000+ BTC, including coins that hadnât moved in 5+ years, sending 12,000+ BTC today alone to the Hyperunite trading platform,” crypto analyst Jacob King tweeted on Sunday. “Theyâve sold 18,000+ BTC ($2B) so far and are in the process of dumping the remaining 6,000+ BTC ($670M). Most of the money is being moved into Ethereum, $2B bought and $1.3B staked,” King continued. That sale seemed to set off a chain reaction and a flurry of selling with $100 billion wiped out in just 24 hours, according to Forbes, as traders seemed to worry about whether the optimism from Jerome Powell’s statements Friday might be a mirage. Powell signaled he may lower interest rates at the next meeting of the Federal Reserve in September. But others are more skeptical that the price really swung due to a whale, suggesting that it could be due to “multiple whales,” rather than a single entity, according to The Block. Whatever the reason for bitcoin’s pullback, there’s no doubt that Ethereum has been faring better in recent days. Ethereum is down almost 4% over the past 24 hours to $4,637, but is still up 24% on the month, according to CoinMarketCap. Why is Ethereum doing so well lately? There are a lot of different theories, including the popularity of spot ETFs, which now account for about $30.5 billion or 5.2% of Ethereum’s market cap, according to The Street. But there’s also just been a lot of hype in mainstream news outlets about Ethereum, with a recent story in the Wall Street Journal touting all the big money that’s “piling into” the cryptocurrency. One of those investors is apparently Peter Thiel, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal. The Journal reports that people close to Thiel believe his “recent bets stem from a belief that the Ethereum network will keep growing.” But that kind of hype should probably be taken with a grain of salt. Founders Fund, Thiel’s venture capital firm, quietly sold about $1.8 billion in crypto by the end of March 2022, not long before the crypto crash of 2022. Thiel had cashed out at a time when he was hyping crypto like crazy, telling a crypto conference in Miami around the same time that “weâre at the end of the fiat money regime.” Thiel made no mention at the conference that he was selling at what would be near the top just before a crash, according to the Financial Times, which only revealed his sales in January 2023. Thiel really has a knack for buying low and selling high, which is the smart play for any investor with discipline. But that’s obviously not how markets actually work in practice, crypto or otherwise. People buy at the top because they fear missing out, and then get left holding the bag by guys like Thiel. The question, of course, is whether crypto’s most recent highs are sustainable. The Trump regime’s embrace of crypto has been great news for the industry, but nobody knows whether the number can continue to just go up, given the uncertainty of America’s economic outlook. There’s also the small problem that crypto is little more than a speculative asset with no inherent value. Despite countless promises from crypto boosters over the past 15 years, the average person isn’t using crypto to actually buy goods on a regular basis. The Block reports that big players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity have seen $1.4 billion in net outflows for crypto last week, the highest since March, as investors get skittish. Other cryptocurrencies were also struggling Monday, including Ripple which is down 2%, Solana down over 4%, TRON down over 3%, and Dogecoin down 5%.

Title: Bitcoin’s Volatility Drops as It Matures, Setting the Stage for Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Presale to Explode
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-matures-volatility-drops-bitcoin-hyper-presale-explodes/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T12:01:41Z

Believe it or not, Bitcoin’s volatility has hit a five-year low, even as its price rockets to new highs and then takes a breather. The world’s first crypto is starting to act a lot more grown-up. The crazy price swings that it was famous for are now a thing of the past. For years, Bitcoin’s wild price fluctuations scared potential investors. But it now seems less jumpy than a big tech stock. According to recent data, Bitcoin’s volatility has been lower than even Wall Street giants like Nvidia since 2022. This shift shows a big change in how the market sees Bitcoin. Popular crypto analyst Lyn Alden even thinks this current bull run will be ‘less extreme’ and last longer. We might see more steady climbs and periods of instability instead of the usual ‘to the moon and then crash’ pattern, she explains in a recent interview for CryptoSlate. Bitcoin is finally settling down and acting like a legitimate financial asset. So, why is Bitcoin suddenly so chill? A big reason is the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. back in early 2024. These new, regulated products, offered by major players like BlackRock and Fidelity, made it super easy for everyday people and big institutions to get into Bitcoin. With more people and more money flowing in, the market became a lot more stable, smoothing out those wild price swings. Another factor is that you can now put Bitcoin in your 401(k) retirement account. As big-money players like pension funds and insurance companies start adding Bitcoin to their portfolios, the asset becomes less vulnerable to short-term speculators. This means less drama and more stability. Bitcoin is also starting to move in sync with the broader stock market, which is another huge sign that it’s officially part of the mainstream. For both casual investors and institutions, this lower volatility means less risk and a smoother ride. It proves Bitcoin is officially leaving its rebellious teenage phase behind and settling into its role as a key player in the financial world. Its promising blockchain upscaling soltuion and an explosive presale nearing $12M are the main reasons why we think it’s one of the best crypto presales in 2025. The team behind Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) saw the many challenges faced by $BTC and decided to build a powerful new layer to upgrade the OG. Bitcoin is a legend, but it’s got some major hang-ups. While it was a revolutionary idea, it was never built for the lightning-fast, high-tech world we live in now. Its transactions are painfully slow, it’s not programmable for modern protocols like you see on Ethereum and Solana, and the fees can get pretty high when the network’s busy. Enter Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer-2: fully programable for DeFi thanks to integrating the Solana Virtual Machine; maintaining trustless cross-chain transfers and secure settlement on Bitcoin’s network. Their goal? To transform Bitcoin from a simple digital asset into a full-blown platform for innovation, all while keeping that rock-solid security that Bitcoin is famous for. Right now, the token sells for $0.012795. However, our $HYPER price prediction sees a potential $0.32 high by the end of 2025. Check $HYPER to lock 2,400% potential ROI. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to solve Bitcoin’s bottlenecks, but it’s not the first L2 project to attempt this. So, what makes it unique? It’s the Solana Virtual Machine integration. This add-on basically brings the insane speed and low latency of Solana to the Bitcoin world. It’s a simple but powerful change that brings Bitcoin up to modern standards. This means developers can finally create super-fast, scalable dApps on a network that’s still backed by Bitcoin’s security. That’s how Bitcoin Hyper acts as a high-performance Layer 2 chain, handling transactions at warp speed and then settling them on the main Bitcoin network later. This setup keeps costs low and speed high without clogging up the original chain. Another staple is the Canonical Bridge. It’s a decentralized bridge that lets you move your Bitcoin from the main chain to the Layer 2 easily and securely. Once your $BTC is on the new layer, you can use it for virtually everything, from quick payments to DeFi protocols and NFT platforms. Thanks to this new system, Bitcoin is becoming a dynamic platform ready for the future. Our full guide to What is Bitcoin Hyper covers its roadmap and features in even more detail. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale for 93% APY. Bitcoin’s story is about growing up. It’s moving on from being that wild, rebellious teenager to a more stable and serious adult in the financial world. A major part of it is thanks to big-time players getting involved with things like ETFs and retirement accounts. With Hyper’s help, Bitcoin isn’t just ‘digital gold’ you stick in a vault anymore. It’s becoming a versatile platform ready to power a whole new wave of apps. Remember to do your own research and invest wisely. This article isn’t financial advice.

Title: Five Ways To Avoid The Five Hottest Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2025/08/25/five-ways-to-avoid-nvidia-microsoft-apple-amazon-and-meta/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Indexitis: The nagging fear that too much of your net worth is invested in the S&P 500, and too much of that is invested in five exuberantly priced stocks. The affliction is becoming more common. The popular index has 28% of its value in Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms (i.e., Facebook). This is twice the top-five concentration level the index has had historically. Herewith are five cures for indexitis, ranging from a modest tweak to your choice of stock index fund to a dramatic move into one very interesting bond. Index investing is not necessarily a bad idea, and the market is not necessarily acting irrationally in putting high price tags on fast-growing tech firms. It is a tribute to the success of passive investing, to the investment company founded by the late John Bogle and to the popularity of artificial intelligence chips that we have a fund with a $107 billion holding in one stock. That’s the Vanguard S&P 500 fund’s position in Nvidia. But history tells us that mighty fortresses crumble. Forty years ago, the top three U.S. companies in market value were IBM, Exxon and General Electric. Their locations in today’s 500 are at positions 34, 14 and 26. Here are five ways to take a step back from the S&P 500. Important assumption: You’re rebalancing inside a tax-deferred account. In a taxable account with unrealized gains, the smart thing to do is nothing. Replace your S&P 500 index fund with a fund that owns the whole U.S. stock market. Customers of Fidelity Investments have access to the best deal, its Zero Total Stock Market fund, with a 0% expense ratio. Ticker: FZROX. Without a Fidelity account you’re better off in an exchange-traded fund; these can be held at any brokerage. Vanguard, Schwab and BlackRock (iShares) all have total market ETFs priced at 0.03% per year, meaning you pay $3 a year per $10,000 invested. Tickers, respectively: VTI, SCHB and ITOT. The total market funds have roughly 80% of their assets in the S&P 500. All you are accomplishing with this switch is adding a small allocation to smaller companies. The Fidelity fund has 2,100 of these small stocks, the Vanguard fund 3,000. You can find these alternative index funds in the domestic stock chapter of the Forbes Fund Finder. In lieu of a U.S.-only stock portfolio, you could have one that blends U.S. and foreign stocks. Obvious choice: the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT, expense 0.06%). This fund has two-thirds of its money in North America, the rest abroad. VT’s portfolio of 9,980 stocks starts out looking like the S&P 500, with Nvidia at the top, but as you scroll down you’ll see names like Taiwan Semiconductor and Tencent Holdings. Instead of accepting Vanguard’s 34% allocation to stocks on other continents, you could set your own percentage by moving some money to a purely foreign portfolio. There are several good ETFs to pick from. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-U.S. (SPDW, 0.03%). It has 2,350 stocks, starting with ASML, which makes the machines that Taiwan Semiconductor uses to make chips for Nvidia. There are several low-cost ETFs that hold only small-capitalization stocks, or only small- and mid-cap. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap (SPSM, 0.03%). Its largest position is in Mr. Cooper Group, a fast-moving mortgage lender. Over the past five years, as the S&P 500 has almost doubled, one thing has gotten cheaper: a long-term inflation-protected bond. With a bond, “cheap” is synonymous with “high-yielding.” In August 2020, a 20-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) was yielding -0.6%, which is to say, the government was charging you money for letting you lend to it. Now the yield is 2.5%, a huge 3.1-point swing in your favor. That’s a real yield, not to be compared with the nominal yield you see on a bank account or corporate bond. There are very good TIPS ETFs on the market but they tend to have short-term bonds. For a concentrated bet (and for a better real yield), go long. If you have at least $100,000 to invest, buy a TIPS in the secondary market. One that I like (because the bid/ask spread was narrow) is the 0.875% due in February 2047. At Fidelity it was recently quoted at 71.968 bid, 72.093 ask. These market prices must be multiplied by an inflation factor, and the bottom line on a ticket for 100 bonds (that is, $100,000 of par value when issued) would have been $96,470. These numbers are bit confusing, so here’s what counts. The real yield to maturity came to 2.57% for a buyer. The yield spread was 1 basis point (one-hundredth of a percentage point). If we presume that the true value is midway between bid and ask, you are in effect coughing up half a basis point of annual return to the middleman. That’s a better deal than the 3 basis points you pay to own an ETF, at least if you hold the bond to maturity. Long Treasury bonds are risky, because real rates could go still higher (making the bond’s value go down), and because the Treasury might default. But bonds are a lot less risky than today’s tippy toppy S&P 500.

Title: Irish beaches at cleanest in eight years, litter survey finds
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/environment/2025/08/25/irish-beaches-at-cleanest-in-eight-years-litter-survey-finds/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T07:25:33Z

Irish beaches are at their cleanest in eight years, according to Irish Business Against Litter (IBAL). The group’s latest survey of Ireland’s coasts and inland waterways, conducted by An Taisce for the business group, awarded 17 of 33 the beaches, harbours and rivers monitored clean status. The result marks a 50 per cent improvement on the last survey despite the warm weather this summer bringing large numbers to the coast. The number of areas classified as littered dropped from 11 to three, with cigarette butts, sweet papers and fast food wrappers the most commonly found discarded items. Sites falling into this category are Dingle Harbour in Co Kerry; Dog’s Bay beach in Co Galway; and White Bay Beach in Co Cork. Among the popular sites to be awarded clean status were Brittas Bay in Co Wicklow; Curracloe in Co Wexford; Bundoran in Co Donegal; Killiney in Co Dublin; Strandhill in Co Sligo; and Tramore in Co Waterford. None of the sites surveyed were placed in the lowest category: heavily littered. Portmarnock in Co Dublin registered a dramatic improvement on its previous ‘littered’ rating, while similar improvement was noted at Blackrock Castle and Castletownbere in Co Cork. However, Dingle experienced a demotion to littered, as did Dog’s Bay beach and White Bay. “This is by far the most favourable result we have seen in eight years of coastal surveys,” said Conor Horgan of IBAL. “The Trojan and ever-expanding work of clean coasts groups and other volunteers is instrumental in this, as is the investment by councils in facilities around our beaches.” Legislative measures such as the tethering of caps to plastic bottles and the deposit return scheme have contributed to the improvement, IBAL said. The first coastal survey conducted since the introduction of the deposit return scheme shows a 30 per cent drop in the volume of these items being discarded. Under the scheme customers pay a refundable deposit on plastic bottles and cans and claim a credit when they return the bottle or can to a reverse-vending machine. Vapes were less prevalent than in previous studies, but coffee cup litter remained high, with cups found in 42 per cent of surveyed sites. “The coffee cup levy seems to have died with the last government, but these findings show that the case for it has not died,” said Mr Horgan, adding that coastal areas would benefit from a coffee cup-free policy similar to Killarney’s model. In 2022, the Co Kerry town became the first town in Ireland to phase out single-use coffee cups. An Taisce’s annual call to action – the Big Beach Clean Up – is expected to attract more than 600 groups and 15,000 volunteers nationwide to Irish beaches from September 19th to 21st.

Title: How spending two minutes picking up plastic on the beach can make a big difference

Headed to the beach this month? Chances are you’ll make a visit. A bracing swim, some fish and chips and a 99 are just the traditions to round out an Irish summer. But there’s something else you could make part of your beach routine and that’s a two-minute beach clean. This practice can go a long way towards making our beaches better. You’ll see all kinds of litter on a day at the beach. From food packaging and broken toys to discarded vapes and fishing and boating paraphernalia, marine litter comes from all sorts of land- and sea-based activities. What we see on the beach is only part of the problem, according to Beaches.ie, an initiative of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is estimated that 15 per cent of marine litter ends up on the sand, 15 per cent floats in the water and 70 per cent rests on the seabed. This stuff doesn’t just spoil the beauty of our beaches, it can harm marine life and their habitats too. Plastic litter kills an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and turtles worldwide every year. This includes 30,000 seals and up to a million seabirds, who either get entangled in it or eat it, according to Beaches.ie. In some areas, plastic accounts for 80 per cent of the litter and can remain in the marine environment for hundreds of years. That’s a day at the beach that isn’t getting forgotten any time soon. Marine experts fear there could be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050, measured by weight, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a UK-based charity working to end waste in the economy. Initiatives such as the #2MinuteBeachClean, operated as part of An Taisce’s Clean Coasts programme and supported by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Heritage is one way we can help stop the tide of litter. Spending just two minutes picking up the things we see at the beach can make a big difference. Not only will it make the beach a nicer place to be, but every piece of litter removed is a piece of litter that won’t pollute our oceans or be ingested by marine life. Taking just two minutes, each #2MinuteBeachClean is estimated to collect about 1-2kg of litter. If everybody in Ireland did a #2MinuteBeachClean per month, that would be more than 100,000 tonnes of litter removed from our ocean this year. Blue Flag beaches have #2minutebeachclean stations with bags and litter pickers you can borrow to make it easier to help keep our beaches litter free. You could do as some others are doing and take a photo of the litter and post it on social media (X or Instagram using the #2minutebeachclean) before putting the litter in the bin. [ Plastic colonialism: ‘A stream of plastic debris, stretching miles, is heading towards us’Opens in new window ] Search the #2minutebeachclean hashtag and you’ll find groups such as the Tomhaggard Clean Coasts group in Wexford, which removed 25 bags of waste at Carnsore in July. Their finds included a tyre and a lobster pot. Some 10 volunteers from the Blackrock Clean Up in Cork group gathered 11 bags of litter on one of the hottest days of the year. Clean Coasts Ballynamona, also in Cork, brought pupils from four primary schools to Garrylucas Beach in June. They gathered litter and learned about the importance of keeping their local beaches clean. Finds from two-minute beach cleaners include everything from a Die Hard DVD in Donabate to a Child of Prague statue, buried in the sand. So next time you visit the beach, whether you are going for a swim or walking the dog, think about joining the growing movement of people who are reducing marine litter, two minutes at a time. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File photo LONDON/TOKYO :Japanese banks Mizuho and MUFG are targeting buying or partnering with overseas money managers, they told Reuters, joining other Japanese financial companies aiming for a larger share of the global investing market. Mizuho is prioritising a tie-up with a private asset specialist in Europe or the United States to give it a foothold in areas such as the booming credit market or infrastructure financing, an executive told Reuters. MUFG, meanwhile, has identified overseas asset management - particularly in the United States and Europe - as a priority area for potential deals, the company said. The banks, two of the largest in Japan, collectively manage about $1.3 trillion through their asset management arms, largely for local clients. They declined to comment on whether discussions with target companies had already taken place and there is no certainty transactions will happen.

Title: Bitcoin volatility keeps falling, and that means it’s maturing as an asset class

Bitcoin volatility has dropped to a five-year low as the number-one crypto matures, showing more price predictability than blue-chip tech stocks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The world’s number-one crypto is looking more like a mature asset class every day as Bitcoin volatility continues to drop (yes, even as it blasts past all-time highs and promptly retraces its steps). Bitcoin has long been regarded as one of the most volatile financial assets; its turbulent price fluctuations over the years have deterred many investors. But what if I told you that Bitcoin is now less volatile than a blue-chip tech stock? According to ecoinometrics, Bitcoin’s 30-day realized volatility is now at its lowest point in nearly five years, and it’s a trend that has persisted even through Bitcoin’s headline-making rallies and corrections over the last five years: “Exactly what you expect from a maturing asset.” Since 2022, Bitcoin has often been less volatile than some of Wall Street’s biggest names, including mega-cap stocks like Nvidia. During the sharp tech sector swings of 2023 and 2024, Nvidia’s price was more unpredictable than Bitcoin, an asset infamous for its hair-raising moves. Even during this current Bitcoin bull run, the price swings have remained notably tamer than previous cycles. Macro analyst Lyn Alden recently told CryptoSlate she believes that Bitcoin’s cycles are changing. We should expect this one to be longer and “less extreme” than previous runs, with strong moves upward followed by periods of consolidation, “rather than going to the moon and collapsing.” Bitcoin volatility declining is just one marker of its growing maturity. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in early 2024 was a landmark event, opening up the asset to the mainstream audience. Major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity offer direct Bitcoin exposure to retail and institutional investors through regulated exchange-traded products. This has introduced broader ownership and liquidity, dampening large price swings and integrating Bitcoin more deeply into traditional markets. Moreover, recent regulatory changes now allow Americans to include Bitcoin in their 401k retirement accounts. As diversified portfolios absorb BTC allocations, Bitcoin volatility further subsides. Pension funds, endowments, and insurance companies have begun allocating to Bitcoin as part of their alternative asset strategies. This increases trading by sophisticated investors and reduces the impact of short-term speculative flows. Increasingly, Bitcoin’s price shows a higher correlation with broader equity markets during risk-on and risk-off periods, another sign of integration and maturity. While you can argue whether this is what we intended for Bitcoin, it does reflect mainstream market adoption. And hey, strong-willed kids become adults who change the world, as Bitcoin is undoubtedly doing. For everyday investors and institutions alike, lower Bitcoin volatility translates to less risk and a smoother investment profile. It’s also a sign that Bitcoin is outgrowing its adolescent phase of wild speculative swings and turbulence, and settling into its role as a legitimate member of society and staple of diversified portfolios.

Title: Wall Street Can’t Stand This 12%-Yielding Bear Portfolio

ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Let’s talk about three dividends averaging 12%. I bring them up because everyone on Wall Street hates them. This is notable because the suits are paid to be bullish. Sell calls are rare, especially among S&P 500 stocks. In fact, analysts shun just one index component today! Buy calls? They are numerous—405 out of 500. Eighty-one percent! Are 81% of the companies in the S&P 500 really buys? Normally, no, but now—especially not. AI is disrupting business models and many of these Buy-rated names are doomed companies. Here’s another problem with Buy ratings—there is no room for improvement. Sells are better. They set the stage for upgrades! And it doesn’t take much for analysts to flip a stock from a Sell to a Buy. Which is why savvy contrarians dig through the Sell bin. Today we’ll discuss three hated names yielding from 6.1% to 15.7%. Before getting to those, let’s use Prospect Capital (PSEC, 18.7% yield), as a cautionary tale and highlight the difference between being contrarian and being foolish. PSEC is a business development company (BDC) that provides capital to middle-market companies, primarily through first lien and other secured debt. It has a diverse portfolio of 114 companies across 33 industries. And it’s one of the largest BDCs at well more than $1 billion in market cap. But despite being a monthly dividend payer with a yield that could be confused for a credit card APR, and despite being the cheapest BDC on the market, Wall Street can’t find a reason to like it. It has just two covering analysts, and only one of them has a rating on the stock (Sell, unsurprisingly). While that smacks of too small a sample size, the lack of coverage itself is telling. Research firms would prefer not to bite the hands that provide them with access, to the point where many would choose to temporarily stop covering a company over calling a spade a spade. Why the lack of love? Among other reasons, how about three dividend cuts in the past decade, including a 25% reduction less than a year ago. All right. What about a BDC with a slightly less bearish camp? BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (TCPC, 15.7% yield) is technically a consensus Sell call, but the majority of analysts covering it say it’s a Hold. So at least as far as pro ratings go, it’s not a disaster. TCPC is a middle-market lender that prefers companies with enterprise values of between $100 million and $1.5 billion. It currently boasts more than 150 portfolio companies across 20 different industries, and its deal mix is heaviest (82%) in first-lien debt, and the vast majority (94%) of its lending is floating-rate in nature. The case for BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. is BlackRock. The BDC is externally managed by a BlackRock subsidiary, which gives it access to BlackRock resources. In theory, that should make TCPC competitive. Again, the pros likely have a legitimate case here. TCPC is in the process of restructuring deals amid credit issues in the portfolio, and management fees have been waived to make up for some of the financial slack. The dividend—which BlackRock TPC cut earlier this year, just a few months after I flagged the potentially brewing trouble in its distribution—isn’t necessarily at risk yet, but it bears watching if portfolio losses continue. Hated BDCs might be asking for it. Let’s look at other high-yield acronyms instead. Cheniere Energy Partners LP (CQP, 6.1% yield) is a midstream subsidiary of Cheniere Energy (LNG). It owns the Sabine Pass LNG (liquefied natural gas) terminal in Louisiana, which includes natural gas liquefaction facilities and regasification facilities. It also owns the Creole Trail Pipelines, which connects the Sabine Pass terminal with inter- and intrastate pipelines. Cheniere Partners owns the Sabine Pass LNG terminal located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, which has natural gas liquefaction facilities with a total production capacity of over 30 mtpa of LNG. The Sabine Pass LNG terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include five LNG storage tanks, vaporizers, and three marine berths. Cheniere Partners also owns a Corpus Christi liquefaction facility and a connected pipeline, as well as Creole Trail Pipeline, which interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG terminal with a number of large interstate and intrastate pipelines. CQP is pouring itself into expansions at its Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi facilities—big capital outlays that required Cheniere to reduce its variable distribution in 2024. That payout came up a smidge earlier this year, however, and the company’s underperformance last year has turned into more respectable performance this year. There’s no telling what the master limited partnership (MLP) will do in the short term as its various project details are fleshed out. But if these projects do bear fruit, CQP could be looking at a potential explosion of distributable cash flow (DCF) generation a few years down the road. How about a real estate investment trust (REIT)? Innovative Industrial Properties (IIPR, 14.4% yield), a REIT tied to the marijuana industry, is what I call a “bearish Hold.” Most of the pros say it’s a Hold or a Sell, but a lone Buy call raises its consensus average. Still, Wall Street really doesn’t like this stock—a massive change of fortune to a stock that over the past decade has been among both the sector’s biggest success stories and its biggest flops. IIPR provides capital for the regulated cannabis industry through a sale-leaseback program. It buys freestanding industrial and retail properties (most of which are marijuana growth facilities) from cannabis operators, then leases them right back to the sellers. This provides cannabis operators with much-needed influxes of cash that they can use to expand their operations, and provides the REIT with ongoing cash flow. Currently, IIPR owns 108 properties in 19 states, representing nearly 9 million square feet, which it leases out to 36 tenants. It’s not like Innovative Industrial Properties has operationally reverted to where it was 10 years ago—not even close. The company went public in 2016 and generated negative $7.5 million in funds from operations (FFO). It has cleared $210 million in FFO in each of the past three years, including $231 million in 2023 and $230 million in 2024. However, the stock exploded even more than the business did, and the past few years have seen shares come back to earth. And everything’s not exactly rosy in the core business, which still is dealing with a cracked, state-by-state regulatory environment. That’s a big reason why IIPR recently invested $270 million into IQHQ, a life science real estate platform with more than $2 billion in assets—a move that could provide much-needed stability and growth. It’s worth noting, however, that FFO has been declining significantly over the past few quarters, driving its adjusted FFO payout ratio to nearly 95%; that’s uncomfortably higher than the 85% ratio IIPR averaged between 2017 and 2024.

Title: Ripple’s XRP Breaks Into Top 100 Global Assets With $180 Billion Market Cap

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ripple’s XRP has officially broken into the top 100 global assets by market capitalization, a milestone that places it alongside some of the world’s most valuable companies like Shopify, Intuit, and Deutsche Telekom. According to the latest data, XRP holds a market cap of around $181.2 billion at a price of $3.02 per token, ranking it above 100th on the global leaderboard. More notably, XRP has managed to join this exclusive list without the backing of a regulated spot ETF in the United States, unlike its crypto counterparts Bitcoin and Ethereum, which are also on the list of the largest global assets. At the time of writing, XRP is the 97th largest asset by market cap, the third cryptocurrency in the list behind Bitcoin at 7th and Ethereum at 22nd. XRP’s climb to this milestone can be traced to a wave of inflows that have been pouring into the asset in recent months. The scale of these inflows has been enough to push XRP’s market cap above BNB and stablecoin Tether USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Institutional and retail investors have been drawn to XRP following the conclusion of its legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This confidence, combined with the larger crypto market bullishness, has seen the XRP price establish a new support base at $3. Crossing into the ranks of the world’s top 100 assets shows how XRP is faring compared to companies outside the cryptocurrency market. At its current valuation, XRP is now on the tails of some of the most recognized global corporations, like Verizon, Texas Instruments, Shopify, and Intuit. Top assets by market cap: CompaniesMarketCap Bitcoin and Ethereum have gained tremendous institutional traction in the past 18 months or so through the launch of regulated spot ETFs in the United States. XRP, on the other hand, has reached its current standing without such an instrument. Therefore, XRP’s present milestone may be just the start of a much larger climb. The absence of ETF-driven inflows means that XRP has significant untapped potential waiting to be unlocked through financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale once regulatory approval for a Spot XRP ETF arrives in the US. Such a trading instrument would open the door for large-scale institutional investors who have so far been restricted in accessing XRP exposure. If the same inflow patterns seen in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are seen again with XRP, its market capitalization could easily push past its current peers in the top 100 global asset rankings alongside its price. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.04. Expectations tied to the eventual approval of Spot XRP ETFs stretch from moderate projections of $4 to ambitious forecasts of as high as $1,000.

Title: ETFs and 401(k)s Don’t Play. Could Dual Share Classes Change That?

Time Published: 2025-08-24T12:00:00Z

Intraday trading and other ETF features aren’t designed for 401(k)s, but mutual fund share classes could give ETF issuers an in. At least one shop has hopes for that. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com If ETFs were a square peg, 401(k)s might be round holes — round holes with perimeters guarded by motion-sensing lasers, trapdoors and werewolves. They simply aren’t getting in. At least, not as standalone investment options on plan menus. It’s a roughly $12 trillion market that is off limits, with a couple of exceptions: Some defined-contribution plans have brokerage windows that few investors use; and some plans include asset-allocation products that have exposure to ETFs. For a lot of asset managers, it’s not really a problem, as they provide strategies in a range of vehicles, including mutual funds, ETFs and collective investment trusts. But for companies whose focus is on ETFs, it’s a missed opportunity. “ETFs are really made for the retail market,” said Greg Ungerman, head of defined contribution research and consulting at Callan. “There are a lot of tax advantages vis-à-vis a mutual fund.” ETFs’ tax benefits don’t matter within tax-deferred plans like 401(k)s. And while ETFs offer low costs, the institutional-level pricing of mutual fund shares and CITs in defined-contribution plans is extremely hard to compete with. For example, Ungerman said, the bargain-price 9 basis-point fee for the $650 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) has nothing on the comparable index funds available to defined-contribution plans for 1 basis point or less. Some of the other hindrances include: It wasn’t always this way. There was some excitement about the potential for ETFs in 401(k)s as much as 20 years ago, just before the Pension Protection Act of 2006 changed everything. Unlike many mutual funds at the time, ETFs, still far less common than they are today, had “clean” fee structures, meaning that they didn’t include revenue sharing or 12b-1 fees. ETF providers pushed 401(k) recordkeepers to make their systems compatible, to no avail, said Fred Barstein, founder of The Retirement Advisor University. “There was no demand. There was very little difference [plan fiduciaries] could tell at the time between an index fund and an ETF,” he said. A major issue comes from the 2006 Pension Protection Act, which allowed for automatic enrollment and helped buoy target-date funds as the default investment options in defined-contribution plans. Thanks to automatic enrollment (and the fact that workers interact little with their accounts), about 70% of the new money contributed to 401(k) accounts goes into target-date funds, Barstein noted. While ETFs are included in some target-date products, there’s otherwise “zero talk of ETFs in 401(k)s,” he said. And while some target-date fund providers use outside managers’ ETFs within their products, most of the big ones invest with in-house ETFs — meaning that opportunity in that avenue is limited. Of 156 target-date series that Sway Research tracks, 10 include allocations to ETFs and mutual funds, while seven hold ETFs exclusively, said Chris Brown, principal of that firm. Less than 3% of target-date CITs hold ETFs, while mutual fund series are much more likely to include ETFs, he said. All of the seven series that hold ETFs exclusively use asset managers’ own funds, and only a few of those that use a mix of mutual funds and ETFs use outside products. ETFs “really haven’t penetrated the target-date market much at all,” Brown said. “It’s kind of surprising.” Where they have found a niche, though, is in active-passive hybrid series, where managers add third-party index-based ETFs to diversify and lower costs, he noted. Some of the series that significantly use ETFs, per Sway: One ETF shop is trying something different. F/m Investments is among dozens of asset managers waiting for permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission to add dual share classes, something the regulator is expected to grant this year. Most companies are seeking to add ETF share classes of existing mutual fund strategies, but F/m is doing the opposite, with the intention of landing spots for some of its products on defined-contribution plan menus. “Loads of DC buyers have said, ‘Why can’t we buy your products?’” F/m’s CEO Alex Morris said. But the company has refused to launch separate mutual fund versions of its ETFs because the performances of the two vehicles might diverge significantly due to the differences in trading, he said. The company is planning to start with mutual fund share classes of two of its ETFs and one ETF share class of an existing mutual fund. “Everyone is thinking it’s going to be this deluge, day one,” Morris said. “It’s actually kind of hard” to add a share class that’s a different investment vehicle, and “there’s a lot behind it that most issuers haven’t thought about.” At F/m, that has meant working with fund administration and accounting to keep track of capital gains, update baskets in real time and figure out what to put on the firm’s website, he said. Footing T-Bill. The first mutual fund shares the firm plans to roll out are for its F/m US Treasury 3-Month Bill ETF (TBIL) and Ultrashort Treasury Inflation-Protected Security ETF (RBIL). “ETFs have this super power,” Morris said. “In a mutual fund executing a T-Bill strategy, I need to put all the dealers I know in competition with each other … Here, every market maker is bidding on that ETF everyday,” he added. “You’re going to get a better price experience from that. You get to choose the price you pay.” Independent RIAs allocate as much as 80% — or as little as 2% — to ETFs, a new AdvizorPro report found. After several funds from the startup Yieldstreet resulted in total losses, experts questioned the role of private investments in client portfolios. With costs of living surging, some states fare better than others when it comes to retirement. The development illustrates Vanguard’s ongoing dominance in ETFs as well as client demand for low-cost, passive strategies. The tech analyst said his taste in fashion mirrors his team’s out-of-the-box stock picking philosophy. There have been reports of advisors leaving, as well as a race among competitors for the industry talent that went up for grabs. The investor protection organization wants its advertising rules to align more closely with federal standards. The industry is far from parity, but progress has been made over the past decade. Experts said the GENIUS Act, signed into law this month, will make advisors more confident about getting into digital currencies. Finalized last summer, the proposal intends to address issues like terrorist financing and foreign corruption in America’s advisory industry. Golfing and camping topped the list, according to a recent AdvizorPro survey. The complaint alleges Vanguard acted in bad faith by thwarting certain business deals post-acquisition. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Rising Meme Star, 2025 DePIN Powerhouse and RWA Protocols – Major Narratives for This Bull Market Announced

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. New trends are shaking up the market, setting the stage for a shift in focus. Popular online tokens, new tech for digital infrastructure, and real-world asset platforms are now leading stories. Every project fights for attention as the next big thing. Find out which narratives are poised to grab the spotlight during this booming season. TAO powers Bittensor, a public network where many small brains work as one big brain. Each model shares its best ideas, learns from others, and earns TAO when its answers help the group. People outside the network can ask questions, guide tasks, and pay in the same coin. Because the code is open and the rules live on a blockchain, anyone, anywhere, can join, build, and own a piece of the growing mind. AI coins are hot this cycle, yet many just chase buzzwords. TAO stands apart because it already links real work to real pay. Bitcoin secures money, Ethereum runs apps, but TAO rewards thought. Its fixed supply and steady demand for learning may support price even in storms. Big firms now spend fortunes on data and chips; Bittensor taps global hobby rigs for the same goal and shares the gains. If the market continues to favor useful networks over hype, TAO could transition from a niche idea to a core holding. Hedera Hashgraph does not use a classic blockchain. It runs on a “hashgraph,” where computers share tiny pieces of data instead of bulky blocks. This design requires no mining, which saves energy and lowers fees. Each HBAR pays for actions on the network and helps guard it through Proof of Stake. The result is quick, cheap moves for payments, games, and even stock trades. Big names—like Google and IBM—sit on its council, adding trust and money to the project. Today’s market rewards coins that cut costs and waste. Bitcoin is strong but slow. Ethereum becomes busy and expensive during traffic spikes. New rivals such as Solana promise speed but battle outages. HBAR handles a high volume of deals per second effortlessly and keeps fees under a penny. Its code is patented, which may slow open-source fans, yet it also sets Hedera apart in a crowded field. With eco talk rising and firms seeking stable rails, HBAR looks well placed for the next upswing. XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first-ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of Web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional players. In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Ondo Finance mixes the trust of old fintech with the speed of blockchain. It converts safe assets, such as US Treasury bills, into digital tokens that anyone can hold. Two teams drive this plan. One builds the products, the other codes the tech that lets them move with ease. Strong names back the project. BlackRock handles the bonds, and Coinbase keeps the crypto keys safe. Clear reports and strict rules add another layer of calm. The flagship token, USDY, acts like a stablecoin but also pays yield from the bonds behind it. In the current market, many coins chase hype yet swing wildly. ONDO offers a different story. Its value leans on real income from government bonds, not just code promises. As rates stay high, those bonds pay solid interest, and holders see that flow in tokens. Few other crypto projects can say the same. Rival stablecoins often sit idle, and pure DeFi coins still face hacks and heavy swings. TAO, HBAR, and ONDO look strong in the 2025 surge; however, pioneering all-sport memecoin XYZVerse (XYZ) blends sports passion with meme culture, targets 20,000% upside, and invites early, community-led entry.

Title: Cracker Barrel’s marketing fiasco shows investors are making woke a massive risk factor

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 7:00:15 PM PDT by MinorityRepublican If the Cracker Barrel market puke has anything to teach Wall Street, it’s that investors who are deciding where to put their money must add corporate “wokeness” to their menu of risks to ­digest. In fact, making “woke” an investing risk factor — in some cases as important as the direction of interest rates and inflation — seems so obvious that I hesitated to write this column. Recall Bud Light’s ­Dylan Mulvaney fiasco, or Target CEO Brian Cornell’s recent exit following his ill-fated ­obsession with DEI. Wokeness is generally defined as subjecting the culture and business to left-wing dogma involving race, sex and viewing all things Americana as anathema. It simply doesn’t sell to mass audiences. And yet companies keep going there. Corporate managers, it turns out, are a politically and socially tone-deaf bunch. They are lousy at reading the current mood of the country and its hatred of progressive indoctrination — whether in the classroom or when they simply want to enjoy a beer. Their advisers may be even worse. That’s why shareholders must demand — whether it’s at annual meetings, on earnings calls or with testy phone calls to Investor Relations — that the C-suite extricate wokeness from corporate decision-making. While it’s not mainstream, there are some savvy Wall Street types adding “woke risk” to their models, just not using that exact terminology. (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Recall Bud Light’s ­Dylan Mulvaney fiasco, or Target CEO Brian Cornell’s recent exit following his ill-fated ­obsession with DEI. Wokeness is generally defined as subjecting the culture and business to left-wing dogma involving race, sex and viewing all things Americana as anathema. It simply doesn’t sell to mass audiences. And yet companies keep going there. Corporate managers, it turns out, are a politically and socially tone-deaf bunch. They are lousy at reading the current mood of the country and its hatred of progressive indoctrination — whether in the classroom or when they simply want to enjoy a beer. Their advisers may be even worse. That’s why shareholders must demand — whether it’s at annual meetings, on earnings calls or with testy phone calls to Investor Relations — that the C-suite extricate wokeness from corporate decision-making.

Either way the leftist ghouls win, by turning turning your favorite wholesome company into a leftist perversion factory, or by pushing you to destroy it yourself in anger. I’m convinced that was the conscious plan with Disney. Plan A was to twist and pervert everything it previously stood for, actually turning it into a vehicle for perverting young children, but if enough people rose up and pushed back Plan B was to ignore them and keep pushing the garbage they hated so they they themselves would eventually destroy the company. Their highest priority was to pervert good, wholesome companies, thereby denying normal Americans what they had previously enjoyed, but they are equally happy to just tick off those people to the point that THEY destroy the company, similarly denying themselves access to what that company was before.

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 4:20:09 PM PDT by CFW Wyoming and 10 other states’ claims that giant investment companies conspired to drive coal production down and drive prices up — increasing people’s energy costs — are at least plausible enough to keep a lawsuit alive, a judge has ruled. Wyoming filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas in late November against Blackrock Inc., State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton led the litigation. Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, West Virginia and Wyoming also signed the complaint. The states allege the three massive investment companies acquired substantial stockholdings in every significant publicly held coal producer in the U.S., then agreed to use their holdings to influence those companies and artificially depress the output of coal. “Defendants allegedly did so in the name of ‘environmental stewardship’ and ‘concern for the climate,’” recounted U.S. District Court Judge Jeremy D. Kernodle in an Aug. 1 order. “The result, Plaintiffs assert, is that ‘Defendants have reaped the rewards of higher returns, higher fees, and higher profits, while American consumers have paid the price in higher utility bills and higher costs.’” (Excerpt) Read more at cowboystatedaily.com ...

Title: BlackRock ETH $254M move and the Pepeto versus Little Pepe choice for the best crypto token

Disclaimer: The below article is sponsored, and the views in it do not represent those of ZyCrypto. Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. Will Bitcoin and Ethereum lead the next wave, or make room for new names? Bitcoin is quiet as large holders buy and keep, so it acts like a safe asset today. On August 21, 2025, BlackRock’s Ethereum ETFs recorded $254M exit, yet many experts still see strength in ETH. Arthur Hayes says ETH could reach $10K to $20K, and charts point to a level near $5,500. Even so, many traders now see only about two times left in BTC and ETH, so focus shifts to presale memecoins with tiny prices and larger upside. Is that where the big money will go next? One new token stays on the Ethereum mainnet and aims to solve real problems. It has already raised millions and includes live tools, a zero-fee DEX, a cross-chain bridge, and staking at a rate of nearly 240 percent. Another new meme coin takes the Layer 2 route that many teams choose. It offers speed, but it adds steps and bridge risk that can drain trust and flow. Whales who once backed Pepe and Shiba now choose between these two as the best memecoin. So, what do they offer, and which one is the smarter choice in 2025? Pepeto, PEPETO, is an Ethereum memecoin in presale at $0.000000148, with over $6M raised and more than 100,000 community members. A demo exchange is live, and audits by SolidProof and Coinsult are complete. Built on the Ethereum mainnet, it blends meme culture with working tools, a zero-fee DEX, a native cross-chain bridge, and staking at a near 240% APY. This mix of trust and utility makes Pepeto one of the best crypto presales of 2025. Little Pepe, in contrast, sits on a Layer 2 network, which adds friction, thinner liquidity, and higher bridge risk. Its presale spreads many tokens, but without strong audits or live tools, it remains basic, and its Layer 2 base looks weak next to Pepeto’s mainnet build. Pepeto, PEPETO, is built on the Ethereum mainnet, a tougher route but the one with better upside. It tackles two major issues: high fees and thin liquidity. PepetoSwap offers zero-fee trading, allowing users to keep more of their funds, and every swap utilizes Pepeto tokens. That creates steady demand, similar to how BNB supports Binance’s long-term growth. The Pepeto Bridge moves tokens across chains inside one app. For early buyers, this mix can turn first entries into millionaire results as use expands toward one hundred times or more. Little Pepe uses a Layer 2. It is not much faster, and it adds steps, more bridge risk, and less trust. Beyond a presale, it brings little, and it looks weak next to Pepeto’s tools and mainnet build; it cannot deliver beyond five times. Pepeto is set for life-changing gains. After launch, achieving fifty times is feasible, and with a Tier 1 listing like Binance, one hundred times becomes realistic. As more tokens join PepetoSwap, demand can climb again, making $200,000 a clear target. Also, thirty percent of the supply is allocated for staking, offering rewards of nearly 244 percent APY, which supports the price as more buyers arrive. Little Pepe may jump five times after launch from presale buzz, but coins like this often fall quickly. Without tools, mainnet strength, or deep liquidity, its Layer 2 base can see price drops in days. That is where Pepeto stands apart; staking and real products keep it alive, while weak, hype-only coins like Little Pepe fade. Bitcoin and Ethereum may be steady now, but many analysts say the most they can deliver from here is about two times, and even that could be hard. Side by side, Pepeto versus Little Pepe makes the choice clear. Pepeto operates on the Ethereum mainnet, utilizing real tools, a demo exchange, zero-fee swaps on PepetoSwap, a native bridge, and robust staking. In contrast, Little Pepe relies on a thin Layer 2 with minimal real value. This is why smart whales are moving into Pepeto. They were early to Shiba and Pepe before the big runs, and they know when a true opportunity appears. For them, Pepeto is the name that can change the life of every early buyer, so the time to step in is now.

Title: Exposed: Cracker Barrel workers' bombshell claims about $1M-a-year CEO as she faces calls to quit over 'delusional' woke rebrand

Skip to comments. Posted on 08/23/2025 1:41:28 PM PDT by libh8er The embattled CEO of Cracker Barrel has been accused by workers of slashing working hours and reducing food quality, Daily Mail can exclusively reveal, as she faces calls for her resignation over a disastrous rebrand. The chain debuted a new logo for the first time in 48 years earlier this week, sparking outrage among customers and wiping millions off the company stock price, which shed almost $100 million in market value on Thursday. President and CEO Julie Masino, who earns $1 million a year, has become a target for those outraged over the change. Staff have vented over what they describe as poor management at the highest level of the company by airing their grievances on the employment review site Glass Door. A crew member in Minnesota posted: 'To the CEO Julie Masino, stop cutting our hours. 'We are making less pay for more work when we are understaffed because you suck at bringing this dead company from its grave. 'Stop lowering your food quality. No it is NOT a good idea to force your cooks to serve bacon that is over a day old. Bacon shouldn't be saved overnight, believe it or not.' One worker, who claims they are an Associate Manager at a branch in South Carolina, posted: 'New leadership is driving the company down. 'There is now nothing that makes Cracker Barrel any different from every other below-average restaurant chain.' A general manager at a restaurant in Maumee, Ohio, added: 'Poor management and untraditional employee relations all the way up to the corporate level.' Daily Mail has approached the company for comment on the allegations made by the employees. The new, simplified logo features just the text of the brand name in a rounded-off yellow hexagon after the firm ditched its legendary mascot Uncle Herschel.

Title: Spot XRP ETFs Likely Coming Soon? Seven Asset Managers File Amended S-1 Applications
URL: https://zycrypto.com/spot-xrp-etfs-likely-coming-soon-seven-asset-managers-file-amended-s-1-applications/
Time Published: 2025-08-23T19:51:05Z
Full Content:
Seven asset managers, including Grayscale, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, Bitwise, and WisdomTree, all filed revised statements for their proposed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Friday. The simultaneous filings represent a coordinated wave of activity as would-be issuers are eager to secure approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the SEC has already approved futures-based ETFs, the agency has yet to greenlight a spot XRP fund. According to experts, Friday’s round of filings could signal that asset managers are responding to feedback from the regulatory agency. “[The filings were] almost certainly due to feedback from SEC,” Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart observed in a post on X. “Good sign, but also mostly expected.” In the amended filings, issuers seek to alter the structure of some of the funds to allow for XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions, rather than simply cash creations and redemptions. Similarly, NovaDius Wealth president Nate Geraci shared a similar sentiment, noting that it is remarkable to see the various asset managers roll out their amended S-1 filings on the same day. “Very good sign IMO.” Geraci opined. While the filings do not guarantee imminent approval, they indicate active dialogue between issuers and the Securities and Exchange Commission during the review process. Meanwhile, BlackRock, the asset manager managing the world’s largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, has yet to submit paperwork for an XRP ETF. BlackRock clarified earlier this month that it does not have any current plans to introduce an XRP-based ETF despite the long-standing lawsuit between Ripple and the SEC wrapping up. Nevertheless, Bloomberg’s exchange-traded fund specialists Eric Balchunas and Seyffart project a 95% possibility of XRP, Solana, and Litecoin ETFs being approved by the US SEC before the end of 2025. At the time of writing this, XRP was trading at $3.02. The cross-border payments token could skyrocket significantly higher as positive fundamentals like the resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple case and rising odds of an XRP ETF approval could potentially embolden the bulls.

Title: Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund makes bold $200 million investment in Bitcoin and Ethereum

FREE MEETING: KEY TRENDS AND RISKS IN TECH GAMES– REGISTER Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has invested $200 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum. The investment was split evenly between the two cryptocurrencies. This marks a significant move by institutional players re-entering the digital assets market. https://twitter.com/binance/status/1957985943966892063 Founders Fund began purchasing Bitcoin in 2014 but had liquidated its holdings before the market crash in 2022. The firm initially bought Bitcoin when it was valued below $30,000. With the current price at $50,000, this investment has yielded an unrealized profit of about 66%. https://twitter.com/NateGeraci/status/1958745372978827422 Joey Krug, former co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, joined Founders Fund as a partner in April 2023. The firm has previously invested in Paxos, the NFT platform Royal, and the decentralized autonomous organization BitDAO. Thiel, a long-time proponent of digital assets, stated back in 2017 that people underestimate Bitcoin’s potential. https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1958187196609163377 In October 2020, the billionaire expressed regret over insufficient investments in the leading cryptocurrency. Venture capitalists are benefiting from an ether rally this year. Proponents see Ethereum becoming the platform of choice for the financial world. https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1957840067474416095 Ether, the cryptocurrency long overshadowed by bitcoin, has surged about 13.5% this month. Investment firms own 7.5% of ETHZilla, which recently transformed itself from a biotech company to focus on selling shares to buy ether. Its stock tripled in value in one day last week after investment disclosures, though it has since fallen some. Investment firms also control 9.1% of Bitmine Immersion Technologies, which has seen its value surge more than 1,000% since late June. The company now has a market value of $8.3 billion. Recent bets stem from a belief that the Ethereum network will keep growing. Bulls also hope Ethereum will become a popular platform for launching new financial products. Tokenized money-market funds from BlackRock and Franklin Templeton already operate on the Ethereum network, as does the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund. Activity on Ethereum amounted to more than $1.2 trillion this year, compared with $960 billion during the same time frame last year, according to data from The Block. Betting on ether remains risky. It isn’t clear that Ethereum will become widely used in finance. Some activity on the network appears to be spam-related, including nefarious phishing attacks. Nonetheless, the Trump administration’s embrace of cryptocurrencies adds momentum. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that stablecoins, many of which are traded on Ethereum, could play a role in reining in the national debt by driving demand for U.S. Treasurys. In August 2025, billionaire investor Peter Thiel made a seismic move in the crypto landscape by acquiring a 7.5% stake in ETHZilla, a company aggressively accumulating Ethereum. Through his venture capital firm, Founders Fund, Thiel now holds 11.6 million shares of ETHZilla, which has committed to an aggressive accumulation strategy. Thiel’s investment in ETHZilla is part of a calculated strategy to position Ethereum as a “productive asset” rather than a purely speculative one. ETHZilla has raised $425 million through private placements and $156 million via convertible notes, using the funds to acquire 82,186 ETH (worth $349 million at the time of purchase). The institutional adoption of Ethereum is accelerating as companies treat ETH as a strategic balance sheet asset. Over 1.74 million ETH—valued at $6.5 billion—is now held by publicly traded firms like Coinbase and Bit Digital. These entities are not merely accumulating ETH but are deploying it on-chain to generate returns. Ethereum’s yield advantage is significant when compared to traditional fixed-income instruments. While U.S. Treasury bonds offer 4.5% and corporate bonds 5–7%, Ethereum’s staking yield is bolstered by its potential for price appreciation. While Ethereum’s institutional adoption is robust, risks remain. Validator slashing (up to 10% loss of staked ETH) and liquidity constraints due to Ethereum’s withdrawal queue are operational challenges. However, these are mitigated by Ethereum’s energy-efficient PoS model and regulatory clarity. For investors, Ethereum’s institutional adoption presents a clear opportunity. The ETH/BTC price ratio has broken above its 365-day moving average, signaling institutional preference for Ethereum. Analysts project ETH to reach $7,709 by 2026, driven by corporate treasury accumulation and ETF inflows. As companies like ETHZilla, BitMine, and SharpLink Gaming demonstrate, Ethereum’s yield-generating capabilities and programmable infrastructure make it a superior treasury asset. For investors, this signals the dawn of a new bull market—one driven by institutional confidence in Ethereum’s utility and long-term value.

Title: NSE, Tata Capital, SBI AMC, Lenskart, Pine Labs, HDFC Securities: Are unlisted shares a trap or opportunity for investors?

Prices circulate like hot tips. “NSE trades near ₹2,000 in the unlisted market, up 80 per cent in a year,” says one post. Another forwards a pitch on Tata Capital, citing Tata Technologies’ 2023 debut, where the shares priced ₹500 in the IPO closed at ₹1,313 on debut. Such chatter highlights the new obsession: unlisted shares, or pre-IPO stocks. Sellers include employees monetising ESOPs, VC (venture capital)/PE (private equity) funds and AIF (alternative investment funds)/PMS (portfolio management services) strategies trimming stakes, promoters seeking liquidity, and brokers sourcing blocks. Buyers once limited to wealthy individuals, HNIs and insiders now include semi-mainstream investors, where unlisted stocks are pushing to become an integral part of the portfolio. The IPO euphoria adds fuel. In FY25, 78 main-board public issues raised a record ₹1.62 lakh crore, 2.5x the previous year, according to primedatabase. Yet, allotments remain elusive: 56 issues drew bids over 10x, with 33 of them above 50x. With such odds, many investors are turning to the invisible — unlisted market. The pitch is simple: buy early, ride the buzz and cash out at listing. And this is no small pool. As Motilal Oswal Financial Services Chairman Raamdeo Agarawal noted in the latest annual report, 1,300 unlisted firms earned ₹100 crore-plus profits in FY24, together raking in ₹7.5 lakh crore. At 20x multiple, this equals about ₹150 lakh crore of potential IPO market-cap. Still, for all the promise, the unlisted space is a grey zone. Markets are loosely regulated, prices swing wildly, liquidity can be shallow, information patchy and exits tricky. Yet the excitement around names such as SBI AMC, Lenskart, Acko, BOAT, Pine Labs, Rapido, HDFC Securities and Hero FinCorp shows why the buzz is growing louder every week. In other words, the market may be niche compared with India’s ₹450 lakh crore listed universe, but it is alive with promise, speculation and no shortage of risk. In 2022, a purportedly leaked audio of a furious founder berating a banker over missed IPO shares showed how emotions run high when allocations slip away. A quick scan of IPO forums, X posts or comments in Instagram reels shows retail investors echoing the same anger. Some blame IPO registrars, others mock the lottery system. With huge IPO oversubscriptions, the odds are stacked against small investors hoping to make a quick buck on listing pop. This frustration is pushing many to the unlisted space. The logic is simple: If the public issue is inaccessible, try to buy earlier in the private market, even at a premium. What was once a closed, opaque dealer-driven activity has broadened in recent years. Digital platforms and wealth managers now act as intermediaries, matching buyers and sellers. Firms such as WWIPL, Unlistedzone, InCredMoney, Stockify, Sharescart and Planify publish price quotes and updates that were earlier unavailable. Entry thresholds have also been lowered. Another driver is employee stock sales. Start-up staff often monetise ESOPs in unlisted markets, creating steady supply. On the demand side, investors view this as early access to future giants. India has over 110 unicorns worth over $350 billion as per studies. Some, like Flipkart and Physicswallah, already trade in the private market. But risks are evident: Several celebrated start-ups have faced valuation markdowns of 50-70 per cent in recent rounds. In 2024, BlackRock marked down its BYJU’s stake, once worth $22 billion, to zero! PharmEasy’s parent, API Holdings, has also seen valuations collapse from nearly $4 billion in 2021 to a fraction today. There is also the pull of exclusivity. Investors like owning what others cannot. Screenshots of holdings in buzzy companies circulate on WhatsApp groups as a badge of early access. With prices shooting up, early investors in unlisted firms become advertisers, boasting of paper gains. For instance, unlisted SBI AMC in the past two years delivered about 64 per cent CAGR, according to data from unlisted trading platform WWIPL. This compares to 52 per cent CAGR by listed peer HDFC AMC in the same period. Stories of celebrities making 50-100x on pre-IPO bets also catch eyeballs. Since such shares are scarce, artificial scarcity itself adds to premiums. It is true that the private market generates more return. For instance, Primex 40 is up 20 per cent in the last one year, 94 per cent in the last two years and 215 per cent in the last five years. These returns are much higher than Sensex across periods. The Primex 40 index tracks India’s top private firms, weighted by market cap; current top constituents include NSE, SBI AMC, Tata Capital, Capgemini Technology Services India, Nayara Energy, CIAL, GFCL EV, Hero Fincorp, HDFC Securities and Incred Holdings. But this early opportunity space carries risks just as significant. Unlike listed equities, no centralised exchange exists for price discovery. Quotes vary across dealers and platforms, with opaque spreads as intermediaries price differently. Some merely arrange transfers between large sellers and small buyers, leaving loyalties unclear. Prices of buzzy counters can swing within days, with spikes often fuelled purely by demand-supply dynamics than fundamentals. And when unlisted stocks go out of favour, liquidity drops to nil within days. Listed shares can be exited in seconds; unlisted ones can stay stuck for weeks. Even big names can face long dry spells after negative news; for smaller firms, illiquidity can be total. Exits can become even harder if a company delays its IPO (for example, OYO trying to go public since 2019) or faces valuation markdowns (Mobikwik’s IPO valuation was over 50 per cent lower than last funding valuation pre-IPO in 2021). Lately, IPOs such as HDB Financial, Vikram Solar and NSDL priced 15-40 per cent below unlisted market expectations, according to reports. The risk-return record of pre-IPO bets underscores the challenge. According to a Client Associates white paper, only nine out of 21 new-age companies that went public between May 2020 and June 2025 generated positive alpha over their pre-IPO price. For every Zomato, Policybazaar, Ixigo or Ather Energy that rewarded early buyers, there were disappointments such as Paytm, Ola Electric, FirstCry and Mobikwik. The distribution is highly polarised, some delivered exceptional gains, but many destroyed capital. Beyond pricing, liquidity, delays in listing, corporate governance and founder behaviour can also impact investors. Instances have been reported where some start-up founders create new entities, leaving old investors stuck and their value eroded. For investors in young companies, the risk is amplified. Even larger, older firms are not immune to shocks if management changes course or policy/regulations become unfavourable. Take Dream11, for instance. Its unlisted shares were available on some platforms, and earlier this year the Burgundy Private Hurun India 500 report ranked it the eighth most valuable unlisted company in India. But fortunes can turn fast. On August 21, 2025, the Parliament passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill within 72 hours of Cabinet clearance, banning real money games. The law will prohibit firms like Dream11 from accepting user deposits for games where players risk losing money. Information asymmetry is a major challenge. Listed firms provide quarterly disclosures, analyst calls and continuous updates. Unlisted companies, governed by the Companies Act, file audited accounts just once a year, often delayed. Public documents are few, and MCA21 access is cumbersome. MCA21 is the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ online portal for company information. It provides public access to filings, records and financials of even unlisted firms. But there’s no dependable way to gauge unlisted firms’ business momentum or financial health regularly. Ordinary investors may unknowingly fund exits for insiders with superior knowledge. With such limited disclosures, this asymmetry puts retail investors at a clear disadvantage.Rating agency actions are published at wide intervals, only if the firm is rated. There is also hardly any reliable analyst coverage in unlisted stocks, who can provide neutral opinion on valuation. Together, these factors i.e. uncertain pricing and listing timelines, poor liquidity,, governance risks, and patchy disclosures make unlisted shares a very high-risk space. Investors attracted by the potential upside must weigh these challenges carefully. SEBI Chairman Tuhin Kanta last week said that SEBI may pilot a regulated pre-IPO platform with required disclosures before listing. This may help address many of the pain-points. Till then, investors must take cognisance of the challenges. Yet while unlisted stocks are risky, for some the charm may be worth it as there are success stories also. Time and again, SEBI has cautioned investors against using unauthorised online platforms for trading unlisted public company securities. Hence those with skills to assess the risk-reward clearly, must stick to regulated brokers and platforms only. Earlier dealer-driven, trades now happen via brokers, digital platforms and wealth desks that publish quotes and basic data. In a typical flow (off-market DP to DP (depository participant) transfer), buyer receives an indicative two-way quote and confirms quantity and price. Note, quotes are non-binding and can change quickly. Buyer shares PAN, Aadhaar, Client Master List (CML) from their DP, a cancelled cheque and sometimes a DIS/e-DIS (electronic delivery instruction slip) consent. Address proof and selfie/video-KYC are common. Intermediary verifies ISIN (International Securities Identification Number), free holdings, pledge/lien status and whether the company’s Articles require ROFR (right of first refusal)/board consent. Some issuers may insist on pre-approval before transfer. Payment is usually NEFT/RTGS/IMPS to an escrow or mapped account (no cash). Many follow Delivery-vs-Payment (DVP) so that funds are released after demat credit. Others use T+1/T+3 settlement. Seller raises an off-market instruction with their DP (NSDL/CDSL). Buyer receives credit in the demat. In terms of timelines, same-day to T+3 is common. Delays could arise from KYC mismatches, bank cut-offs, DP holidays, or issuer approvals. Large counters need high minimums, though some intermediaries allow smaller tickets (₹50,000-1 lakh). In terms of capital gain taxes, short-term capital gains or STCG (≤24 months) is taxed at slab for unlisted shares and long-term capital gains or LTCG (>24 months) at 12.5 per cent without indexation. If sold post-listing, Securities Transaction Tax (STT) applies; >one year qualifies for equity LTCG. Pre-IPO shares carry a six-month lock-in. One of the major operational risks to watch is the lack of exchange arbitration. So, dispute redressal is weaker than in listed markets. Also, watch out for fraudsters and scamsters. Practical safeguards include using DVP/escrow system, if possible. Try to avoid pay-first arrangements unless you trust the intermediary. Insist on invoice/contract note and transfer proof. Verify ISIN, share class and any transfer restrictions before wiring funds. Keep all KYC and DP details exact; even minor mismatches can stall transfers. NSDL’s June 3 circular reportedly mandates prior written consent from unlisted companies for off-market share transfers. Consent must be signed by an authorised official and include transferor/transferee details, PANs, share class and compliance with Articles of Association and Companies Act. In this case, timelines could be much longer than T+3. Published on August 23, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies. All rights reserved.

Title: Spot XRP ETF Coming Soon? Asset Managers Submit Amended S-1 Filings

Time Published: 2025-08-23T15:30:10Z

According to the latest report, a group of asset management firms submitted S-1 amendments for a spot XRP ETF (exchange-traded fund) in the United States. These movements reflect the ramped-up interest of these institutions to get the approval of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer this crypto-linked investment product. On Friday, August 22, a slew of asset managers, including Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and WisdomTree, filed amended S-1 statements for their proposed spot XRP ETFs. According to experts, this round of filings might be in response to the US SEC’s feedback on their original applications. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X: Bunch of XRP ETF filings being updated by issuers today. Almost certainly due to feedback from [the] SEC. Good sign, but also mostly expected. Similarly, the ETF Store President, Nate Geraci, shared a similar sentiment, saying that it is very significant to see the various asset managers roll out their amended S-1 filings at once and on the same day. “Very good sign IMO [in my opinion],” Geraci wrote on X. For a security or ETF to be listed on an exchange, it needs an S-1 filing, which provides a brief prospectus of the proposed security. Meanwhile, the S-1 form is amended as material information changes regarding the structure of the exchange-traded fund. Hence, it is no surprise to see some changes in the structure of proposed spot XRP ETFs. For instance, the amended S-1 filing appears to switch the exchange-traded products from simply cash creations and redemptions to allow for XRP or cash creations and cash or in-kind redemptions. It is worth mentioning that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm and manager of the largest spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund, has still not made a move to join the race for the spot XRP ETFs. As reported by Bitcoinist, the trillion-dollar asset manager revealed earlier in August that it has no intentions to launch an XRP fund. Following a torrid start to the week, the XRP token fell beneath the $3 mark to as low as $2.8 on Friday. However, the altcoin jumped back above $3 on the back of the news of the complete dismissal of Ripple’s lawsuit and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech. As of this writing, the XRP token is valued at around $3.01, reflecting an over 5% price jump in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

But just because it's happened before doesn't mean it will happen again. One of the hottest debates raging right now across the crypto industry is whether or not Bitcoin will stick to its usual four-year cycle. Experts have been chiming in from both sides of the spectrum, and Crypto X is rife with hot takes (as ever). Last year, Bitcoin did something it hadn't done before when it hit a new high ahead of the halving, following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This has led some analysts and observers to believe that Bitcoin's typical cycle—when the coin hits a high the year after its halving, only to plunge by 70-80% the following year—is finished. This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 "It's just common sense," Bloomberg Intelligence Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt. "More stable owners, more stable price," he added, referring to the ETF investors. The approval of ETFs in January 2024 allowed millions of dollars in capital previously locked out of the markets to flood into the space. Months after they started trading, the leading cryptocurrency hit a new all-time high. The coin has since broken new highs off the back of crypto-friendly President Donald Trump's victory, rising yet again to a fresh peak last week. Investors in the space are now more sophisticated, too: Institutions from Harvard University and Goldman Sachs have bought Bitcoin—and via the ETFs, no less. Such investors are less likely to panic-sell, and are buying to hold for the long term, Balchunas said. "I think the ETF kicked off this new phase, and I don't know if the four year cycle would apply. I don't want to say never, but again, you have to use common sense," he said. "Volatility is based on the people who hold it." Bitcoin was recently trading for $115,492 per coin, up more than 2% over the past day and by 22% year-to-date, according to CoinGecko. It broke a new record of $124,128 on August 14. In the previous bull run, Bitcoin peaked at a high of $69,044 in November 2021. But the hype didn’t last and a brutal correction occurred, leading Bitcoin to crash below $16,000 in November 2022 after a long list of crypto companies went bankrupt following the collapse of Terra—most notably the prominent digital asset exchange, FTX. Bitcoin is now much more mature, however, and further integrated into traditional markets, noted André Dragosch, Bitwise's Europe head of research. "Our thesis is that macro- and demand-related factors are definitely becoming increasingly more important due to Bitcoin's increasing integration into the global financial system," he said. Dragosch added that the performance effect from the halving—which occurs approximately every four years and slashes the BTC rewards earned by network-supporting miners—has been declining, while demand-related factors are becoming increasingly important. But not all experts agree. A report by CoinGlass this week used data to point out that this year is looking increasingly like previous cycles—especially in terms of price action. The report said that the flagship coin's price movements are echoing what was seen in the cycles of 2015-2018 and 2018–2022, and that capital inflows into the asset are "showing signs of fatigue." "Alongside this, long-term holders have realized profit levels comparable to past euphoric phases, reinforcing the impression of a market late in its cycle," the report read. But it's worth noting that every cycle, there are quirks—and HODLers will ultimately have to wait to see how things play out. "Every time that we think, 'This time it's different,' it seems that the market corrects us and shows us: 'Nope, this time it's exactly the same,'" Nick Hansen, CEO of Bitcoin mining firm Luxor, told Decrypt.

Title: BlackRock Triggers Bitcoin Sell-Offs With Half A Billion Dollars Dumped

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has notably been on a Bitcoin selling spree throughout this week, triggering a wave of sell-offs in the process. These sales have occurred due to the outflows that the asset manager has witnessed from its BTC ETF. Arkham data shows that BlackRock has offloaded around $500 million in Bitcoin this week, with transfers to Coinbase, a move that indicates a move to sell these coins. The asset manager has sold these coins following outflows from its iShares Bitcoin ETF, which was the norm throughout this week. SoSo Value data shows that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF first recorded a daily net outflow of $68.72 million on August 18. The fund then further saw net outflows of $220 million, $127.49 million, and $198.81 million on August 20, 21, and 22, respectively. Notably, the iShares Bitcoin ETF has accounted for most of the outflows, with the BTC ETFs as a group currently on a six-day streak of consecutive net outflows. These Bitcoin ETFs have seen total net outflows of almost $1.2 billion since August 15. Meanwhile, in just this week alone, over $1.1 billion has left these funds, sparking a bearish sentiment for the BTC price. Given BlackRock’s position as a major player in the Bitcoin ecosystem, outflows from its fund had sparked a wave of sell-offs. This led to a massive decline for the flagship crypto earlier in the week. The Bitcoin price had dropped to as low as $112,000 this week as BlackRock and other BTC investors took profit on their investments. This followed the flagship crypto’s rally to a new all-time high (ATH) of $124,000 last week. However, BTC has now sharply rebounded on the back of Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole speech, in which he indicated that a rate cut might happen in September. Notably, Powell’s speech was enough to spark fresh inflows into the Bitcoin ETFs on August 22, with BlackRock the only fund manager that recorded a net outflow on the day. Further data from SoSo Value shows that Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest recorded a daily inflow of $65.47 million, the most among the issuers on the day. Meanwhile, Fidelity, Van Eck, Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale recorded inflows of $50.88 million, $26.41 million, $13.51 million, $12.70 million, and $6.42 million, respectively. However, BlackRock recorded an outflow of $198.81 million, which led to a daily net outflow of $23.15 million for the funds as a group. With the Bitcoin price rebounding, these funds, including BlackRock’s IBIT, could return to witnessing significant daily inflows from next week. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $115,900, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Market momentum remains strong as ETH approaches its 2021 peak. Ethereum is nearing its all-time high despite mixed signals from institutions. Market momentum and bullish sentiment suggests potential for further gains. Ethereum [ETH] hits fresh highs even as institutional money appeared to be heading for the exit. Outflows from spot ETH ETFs have been heavy, yet big names like keep buying. There’s a striking divergence in sentiment: while some institutions are cashing out, other heavyweight players seem intent on staying. Ethereum traded at $4,737 at press time, just shy of its all-time high of $4,891 set back in November 2021 according to CoinMarketCap. The hourly chart highlighted an upward move (with Jerome Powell Jackson Hole speech being a key catalyst) followed by consolidation, so bulls were defending the higher levels. The RSI was at 62.8, indicating strong momentum but leaving some room before hitting overbought territory. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the MACD showed waning bullish momentum as the histogram turned red. If buying pressure persists, ETH could attempt another run at its historic peak, though short-term corrections remain likely given the recent volatility. ETH is chasing new highs, but there’s more to it than what meets the eye. Source: Glassnode On one hand, U.S. spot ETFs have been under pressure, with Ethereum ETFs recording a staggering 111k ETH in outflows. Yet, not all major players are retreating. BlackRock recently purchased $233 million worth of ETH, showing long-term conviction in the asset. Source: Arkham Intelligence Adding to the bullish narrative, Trump’s World Liberty fund also made a notable acquisition, spending $5.025 million USDC for 1,076 ETH at $4,670. Source: X Amid the mixed institutional flows, one of crypto’s most influential voices remains firmly bullish on Ethereum. Since first declaring “$ETH = $5,000” back in December 2023, Arthur Hayes has actively swing-traded ETH through his public wallet, often selling only to buy back at higher prices as the token continued its ascent. Source: X Now, the Maelstrom CIO has reaffirmed his conviction, forecasting a monumental rally. In a recent Crypto Banter interview, Hayes argued that, “the chart says it’s going higher, you can’t fight the market.” He predicted that Ethereum could surge to $10,000-$20,000 before the end of this cycle.

Title: 18 months after becoming the first human implanted with Elon Musk’s brain chip, Neuralink ‘Participant 1’ Noland Arbaugh says his whole life has changed
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/23/neuralink-participant-1-noland-arbaugh-18-months-post-surgery-life-changed-elon-musk/
Time Published: 2025-08-23T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jessica Mathews is a senior writer for Fortune covering startups and the venture capital industry. It was February 2024 when Noland Arbaugh, the first person to get Elon Musk’s experimental brain chip, rolled across the stage in a wheelchair during a Neuralink “all hands” meeting, revealing his identity for the first time. The room, filled with Neuralink employees, erupted in applause as Arbaugh—who dislocated two of his vertebrae in a swimming accident in 2016 and has since lost sensation and movement below his shoulders—smiled ear to ear in his chair, a red Texas A&M hat planted on his head. He grinned as he began to speak: “Hello, humans.” About a month before that town hall, Arbaugh, who’s 31, had undergone surgery at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, about 2.5 hours from his home in Yuma, to get an experimental chip embedded into his brain that Neuralink had been working on and testing on animals for the past nine years. Arbaugh was anesthetized and, in a surgery that lasted just under two hours, a Neuralink-made robotic surgery device implanted the chip and connected tiny threads with more than 1,000 electrodes to the neurons in his brain. Now the device can measure electrical activity, process signals, then translate those signals into commands to a digital device. In layman’s speak, the BCI, or brain-computer interface, allows Arbaugh to control a computer with his mind. As a result, Arbaugh can do things like play Mario Kart, control his television, and turn his Dyson air purifier on and off without physically moving his fingers or any other part of his body. The first day that Arbaugh used his device, he beat the 2017 world record for speed and precision in BCI cursor control. “It was very, very easy to learn how to use,” he tells me in an interview. When Arbaugh became Participant 1—or “P1” as he is often referred to by Neuralink employees and subsequent study participants—he joined a list of about 80 people to ever receive such a device. Brain chip interfaces have been a focus of neurological study for more than 50 years, and a dozen companies in the U.S. and China have been conducting limited human trials since 1998. But becoming the first patient to get a Neuralink implant, in particular, is its own right of passage. For one, Neuralink’s device has threads with more than 1,000 electrodes, giving the device a much higher connectivity rate than most of the BCIs currently being studied in humans in the market. But Neuralink also places its electrodes in the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls movement—a more invasive approach than competitors like Synchron or Precision Neuroscience, which also have ongoing studies of multiple patients. Neuralink’s device is also wireless, versus competitors like Blackrock Neurotech that require a wired connection from the implant through the skull to an external receiver for signal capture and decoding (Blackrock Neurotech sells a wireless processor that has been used for research). That means Neuralink participants can go cordless, but the device is battery powered because of it and does need to be charged around every five hours or so, Arbaugh says. Neuralink heat-treats the charger, a coil, into some of Arbaugh’s hats, so that he can recharge it while wearing a hat. In the beginning, Arbaugh couldn’t use the device while it charged, though that’s since been updated. Of course, there is also the fact that Neuralink is Elon Musk’s brain chip company, which draws an entirely different level of scrutiny and attention to any study participant. Since Arbaugh revealed himself as P1, he has become a public figure, frequently invited on podcasts and having journalists show up at his home. His X account has been hacked, and he told me that a SWAT team showed up with AR-15s after someone gave a false tip to the local sheriff’s office that Arbaugh was in danger. When I first reached out to Arbaugh in early June to see how the BCI had changed his day-to-day 1.5 years in, it took a couple of months for us to pin down a time. When we finally did hop on the phone, he laughed. “I’m just so busy all the time,” he says. “That is so different than what life was like before…I feel like I’m playing catch-up for eight years of not doing anything—kind of lying around, staring at walls.” Since Arbaugh became the first Neuralink patient in January 2024, there have been eight more individuals, including one woman, to enroll in the company’s ongoing clinical trials, which are now open in the U.S., Canada, Great Britain, and the United Arab Emirates. So far, all of the surgeries have taken place at hospitals in the U.S., with two of the participants receiving the implant on the same day at the end of July. All of the study participants suffer from either paralysis or ALS, a nervous system disease that causes loss of muscle control. “Our goal is to really build a whole brain interface,” Neuralink cofounder and president DJ Seo said during Neuralink’s summer update meeting. For Arbaugh, the Neuralink device has been entirely transformative, he says. He uses it about 10 hours a day to control his computer so he can study, read, and game—and to handle things like scheduling an interview with me. Arbaugh enrolled in classes at his community college in Arizona, where he has started taking prerequisites he needs for a degree in neuroscience, and, as he tells Fortune, he’s working on starting his own business—paid professional speaking engagements and live talks. As he talks about all of it with me, his excitement—and a newfound sense of purpose—is palpable. Before his surgery, “I would stay up all night and sleep all day, and I didn’t really [want to] bother anyone or ruin any plans or get in the way of anything,” he says. “I just had no purpose…I was just kind of going through the motions, waiting for something to happen.” Arbaugh never lost the ability to think or speak due to his accident. But in the past year and a half, he has regained more of the autonomy he lost with his disability, and is able to do more things for himself. “I feel like I have potential again. I guess I always have had potential, but now I’m finding a way to fulfill that potential in meaningful ways. It’s a lot different.” When you talk to Arbaugh, he makes all of it seem rather simple. He had never heard of a BCI, or Neuralink for that matter, until his friend from military school, an Elon Musk buff, learned of the first Neuralink clinical trial while researching SpaceX at the end of 2023, Arbaugh recalls. The friend, Greg Bain, reached out to Arbaugh, who signed up to join the very same day (though Bain spelled his name wrong on the application). “I never doubted for a second that it would work,” Arbaugh, who personally didn’t have strong opinions of Elon Musk one way or another, says. Arbaugh says he received an email from the Barrow Neurological Institute the day after he applied and started going through the process. There was a screening call and an interview, and then about a month later he was going into the nearby hospital for a full day of scans and testing. About three months after he applied, Arbaugh found out that he was going to be the first participant, and his surgery was scheduled a few weeks later. While Arbaugh is not paid, Neuralink covers the cost of the surgery and the implant, and the company reimburses him for travel to and from his checkups or for expenses directly related to the study. (Arbaugh says that with FDA approval, Neuralink did pay him for two talks he gave at Neuralink, including the February 2024 talk where he revealed his identity.) Despite the risks of being the first participant of an experimental clinical trial, Arbaugh says it was an easy decision for him. “I decided that, even if it didn’t work—even if something went terribly wrong—I knew that it would help someone down the road,” Arbaugh says. “And I knew that good or bad, they would learn something and push this technology forward.” Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’ but I still see myself as a regular guy. As you may imagine, it was a little harder for his parents. Arbaugh says he remembers sending his mother the consent forms he had to sign for her to read over, which contained a laundry list of potential risks associated with the surgery—and every imaginable thing that could go wrong with the experimental device. He said she read one or two items and then put them away, unable to read any further. But ultimately, both his parents supported his decision, he says, and never showed that the decision was hard on them. “I hadn’t really been excited about many things before that point, so they were just happy to help in any way they could,” he says. Arbaugh was also extremely decisive in his choice to go public with his identity. He says he wanted to show people that he believed this device was safe, and what could be possible for those who used it. “I wanted to share it with people, because I thought it was huge, and I still do,” Arbaugh says. “I think it’s one of the biggest leaps in technology that we’ve had in a really long time, and I think that it’s going to keep growing.” Arbaugh insists that Neuralink has never tried to dictate what he can or can’t say publicly, and he says he has never been asked to sign any kind of nondisclosure agreement. It’s been the opposite, he says: Neuralink staffers have encouraged him to disclose whatever he’d like to. But he has voluntarily chosen not to talk about some things on occasion. For example, shortly after his surgery, some of the threads retracted, causing him to lose much of the control he had over the device. The incident was later published in the Wall Street Journal, and Neuralink published a blog post about it. It was a big deal, Arbaugh says, but he decided to wait for the team to figure out what had happened and how to repair it, which they did. Revealing something like that at the time would have been “extremely rash of me, and it would have absolutely made people lose faith in the product,” he says. “That’s not what I want. I love this thing. I love what Neuralink is doing. I love all of it, and I’m really proud of it.” In the summer update meeting Neuralink published publicly, Seo laid out what the company is focused on next. Neuralink is starting a trial in the United Arab Emirates, called Blindsight, that would help restore sight to the blind. Neuralink is already developing robotic arms for participants, and, during the presentation, Musk said that the company wants to give them sensory control to where they could essentially “inhabit an Optimus robot” and control it with their minds, or attach an Optimus arm or leg to a person to give them full control again of that part of their body. “The future is going to be weird, but pretty cool,” he said. As of right now, Neuralink is still adding patients to its various trials. At the end of July, Neuralink announced it had received approval to introduce a trial in Great Britain via University College London Hospitals and Newcastle Hospitals. Neuralink still has plenty of critics for its more invasive BCI approach and—true to form for all of Elon Musk’s companies—the high employee expectations and long work hours that have led to high turnover. Neuralink has also been accused of poor treatment of the monkeys it has used to test its Link devices. (Regarding treatment of its animals, Neuralink says it works with animals in “the most humane and ethical way possible.” Several of the Neuralink study participants that I spoke to also contested the claim of animal mistreatment.) While some of Musk’s other companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, have been accused of being lax when it comes to safety precautions, Musk is adamant that Neuralink is moving slowly and carefully as Neuralink tests its brain chips. “We’re very cautious with the Neuralinks in humans,” Musk said during the summer update. “That’s the reason we’re not moving faster than we are is because we are taking great care with each individual to make sure we never miss.” As more Neuralink patients become vocal about the Neuralink BCI and the company, Neuralink is garnering more global recognition, and investors are pouring in hundreds of millions of capital. Indeed, there is something uniquely compelling about the vision at Neuralink and its mission to help those with disabilities. And there’s something uniquely compelling about Arbaugh, too. Perhaps it’s his sense of humor, his earnestness, or his humility—but it’s hard not to like him at once. He speaks about his three conversations with Musk—once via FaceTime the day of his surgery, in person post-surgery, then later at the Austin gigafactory—nonchalantly, saying Musk is a “cool dude” who “has done a lot in his life and is super impressive, but at the end of the day is just another guy.” After our interview, I asked Arbaugh if he considers himself a cyborg—the sci-fi term coined in the ’60s to describe a human being who has been enhanced by a technological body part or device. “Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’” he says. “But I still see myself as a regular guy…But it’s fun to play around with.” A year-and-a-half after his surgery, Arbaugh still has so much to say about all of it: about neuroscience, about his faith, and about what technology is making possible for paralysis. This whole ordeal has given him a new appreciation for what’s possible, he says: “I always thought that [paralysis was] going to be fixed through drugs, or some sort of new surgery, or something they discovered in science—stem cells or something of that nature.” But now that he has been thrust into the tech world, Arbaugh says he’s thinking about it differently. “I see how the advancements in tech at this point are going to solve so many things. They are, I think, the future of medicine. I think a lot of disabilities, cures, and answers that we’ve been searching for a long time will come through tech—and that kind of surprised me.” In the meantime, there is a lot for him to soak up in this new way of life—where he can play Mario Kart with his dad, go back to college, and build a business: “I definitely didn’t expect for this to ever happen,” he says. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

For Arbaugh, the Neuralink device has been entirely transformative, he says. He uses it about 10 hours a day to control his computer so he can study, read, and game—and to handle things like scheduling an interview with me. Arbaugh enrolled in classes at his community college in Arizona, where he has started taking prerequisites he needs for a degree in neuroscience, and, as he tells Fortune, he’s working on starting his own business—paid professional speaking engagements and live talks. As he talks about all of it with me, his excitement—and a newfound sense of purpose—is palpable. Before his surgery, “I would stay up all night and sleep all day, and I didn’t really [want to] bother anyone or ruin any plans or get in the way of anything,” he says. “I just had no purpose…I was just kind of going through the motions, waiting for something to happen.” Arbaugh never lost the ability to think or speak due to his accident. But in the past year and a half, he has regained more of the autonomy he lost with his disability, and is able to do more things for himself. “I feel like I have potential again. I guess I always have had potential, but now I’m finding a way to fulfill that potential in meaningful ways. It’s a lot different.” When you talk to Arbaugh, he makes all of it seem rather simple. He had never heard of a BCI, or Neuralink for that matter, until his friend from military school, an Elon Musk buff, learned of the first Neuralink clinical trial while researching SpaceX at the end of 2023, Arbaugh recalls. The friend, Greg Bain, reached out to Arbaugh, who signed up to join the very same day (though Bain spelled his name wrong on the application). “I never doubted for a second that it would work,” Arbaugh, who personally didn’t have strong opinions of Elon Musk one way or another, says. Arbaugh says he received an email from the Barrow Neurological Institute the day after he applied and started going through the process. There was a screening call and an interview, and then about a month later he was going into the nearby hospital for a full day of scans and testing. About three months after he applied, Arbaugh found out that he was going to be the first participant, and his surgery was scheduled a few weeks later. While Arbaugh is not paid, Neuralink covers the cost of the surgery and the implant, and the company reimburses him for travel to and from his checkups or for expenses directly related to the study. (Arbaugh says that with FDA approval, Neuralink did pay him for two talks he gave at Neuralink, including the February 2024 talk where he revealed his identity.) Despite the risks of being the first participant of an experimental clinical trial, Arbaugh says it was an easy decision for him. “I decided that, even if it didn’t work—even if something went terribly wrong—I knew that it would help someone down the road,” Arbaugh says. “And I knew that good or bad, they would learn something and push this technology forward.” Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’ but I still see myself as a regular guy. As you may imagine, it was a little harder for his parents. Arbaugh says he remembers sending his mother the consent forms he had to sign for her to read over, which contained a laundry list of potential risks associated with the surgery—and every imaginable thing that could go wrong with the experimental device. He said she read one or two items and then put them away, unable to read any further. But ultimately, both his parents supported his decision, he says, and never showed that the decision was hard on them. “I hadn’t really been excited about many things before that point, so they were just happy to help in any way they could,” he says. Arbaugh was also extremely decisive in his choice to go public with his identity. He says he wanted to show people that he believed this device was safe, and what could be possible for those who used it. “I wanted to share it with people, because I thought it was huge, and I still do,” Arbaugh says. “I think it’s one of the biggest leaps in technology that we’ve had in a really long time, and I think that it’s going to keep growing.” Arbaugh insists that Neuralink has never tried to dictate what he can or can’t say publicly, and he says he has never been asked to sign any kind of nondisclosure agreement. It’s been the opposite, he says: Neuralink staffers have encouraged him to disclose whatever he’d like to. But he has voluntarily chosen not to talk about some things on occasion. For example, shortly after his surgery, some of the threads retracted, causing him to lose much of the control he had over the device. The incident was later published in the Wall Street Journal, and Neuralink published a blog post about it. It was a big deal, Arbaugh says, but he decided to wait for the team to figure out what had happened and how to repair it, which they did. Revealing something like that at the time would have been “extremely rash of me, and it would have absolutely made people lose faith in the product,” he says. “That’s not what I want. I love this thing. I love what Neuralink is doing. I love all of it, and I’m really proud of it.” In the summer update meeting Neuralink published publicly, Seo laid out what the company is focused on next. Neuralink is starting a trial in the United Arab Emirates, called Blindsight, that would help restore sight to the blind. Neuralink is already developing robotic arms for participants, and, during the presentation, Musk said that the company wants to give them sensory control to where they could essentially “inhabit an Optimus robot” and control it with their minds, or attach an Optimus arm or leg to a person to give them full control again of that part of their body. “The future is going to be weird, but pretty cool,” he said. As of right now, Neuralink is still adding patients to its various trials. At the end of July, Neuralink announced it had received approval to introduce a trial in Great Britain via University College London Hospitals and Newcastle Hospitals. Neuralink still has plenty of critics for its more invasive BCI approach and—true to form for all of Elon Musk’s companies—the high employee expectations and long work hours that have led to high turnover. Neuralink has also been accused of poor treatment of the monkeys it has used to test its Link devices. (Regarding treatment of its animals, Neuralink says it works with animals in “the most humane and ethical way possible.” Several of the Neuralink study participants that I spoke to also contested the claim of animal mistreatment.) While some of Musk’s other companies, including SpaceX and the Boring Company, have been accused of being lax when it comes to safety precautions, Musk is adamant that Neuralink is moving slowly and carefully as Neuralink tests its brain chips. “We’re very cautious with the Neuralinks in humans,” Musk said during the summer update. “That’s the reason we’re not moving faster than we are is because we are taking great care with each individual to make sure we never miss.” As more Neuralink patients become vocal about the Neuralink BCI and the company, Neuralink is garnering more global recognition, and investors are pouring in hundreds of millions of capital. Indeed, there is something uniquely compelling about the vision at Neuralink and its mission to help those with disabilities. And there’s something uniquely compelling about Arbaugh, too. Perhaps it’s his sense of humor, his earnestness, or his humility—but it’s hard not to like him at once. He speaks about his three conversations with Musk—once via FaceTime the day of his surgery, in person post-surgery, then later at the Austin gigafactory—nonchalantly, saying Musk is a “cool dude” who “has done a lot in his life and is super impressive, but at the end of the day is just another guy.” After our interview, I asked Arbaugh if he considers himself a cyborg—the sci-fi term coined in the ’60s to describe a human being who has been enhanced by a technological body part or device. “Technically I am a cyborg because I have been enhanced by a ‘machine,’” he says. “But I still see myself as a regular guy…But it’s fun to play around with.” A year-and-a-half after his surgery, Arbaugh still has so much to say about all of it: about neuroscience, about his faith, and about what technology is making possible for paralysis. This whole ordeal has given him a new appreciation for what’s possible, he says: “I always thought that [paralysis was] going to be fixed through drugs, or some sort of new surgery, or something they discovered in science—stem cells or something of that nature.” But now that he has been thrust into the tech world, Arbaugh says he’s thinking about it differently. “I see how the advancements in tech at this point are going to solve so many things. They are, I think, the future of medicine. I think a lot of disabilities, cures, and answers that we’ve been searching for a long time will come through tech—and that kind of surprised me.” In the meantime, there is a lot for him to soak up in this new way of life—where he can play Mario Kart with his dad, go back to college, and build a business: “I definitely didn’t expect for this to ever happen,” he says.

Title: Whales scramble to grab ONDO under $1 as tokenization booms 7000%

Tokenization grew 7000% with ONDO leading the charge, but its price is stalling. U.S. Treasuries surged 7,000% since 2023, led by ONDO’s growth this year. But despite support at $0.90, reversal patterns hint at possible downside. Ondo Finance [ONDO] has been down by 2% on the day, but still leading other Real World Assets (RWA) coins. The altcoin was not left out in the recent decline across the broader market that has extended to stocks. Tokenization of RWAs has recently grown exponentially since the start of Trump’s second term. Momentum grew after the White House Bitcoin report mentioned ONDO, positioning the altcoin as a leader in this space. Per a post by Dami Defi on X, U.S. treasuries tokenized on blockchain had grown by about 7000% in only two years. The category was led by BlackRock, followed by ONDO, which surged by 120% since the start of 2025. Ethereum [ETH], Chainlink LINK], and Solana [SOL] were the leading layers for tokenizing. Messari highlighted that ONDO had grown to over $1.3 billion AUM, which was about 33% of all tokenized assets. Source: Token Terminal Its stablecoins issued on Solana blockchain grew to $250 million, accounting for about 64%. This showed ONDO was dominating deployment of RWAs which was expected to hit $30 trillion by 2034, as per Standard Chartered. Onchain data from Arkham Intelligence showed that a whale was busy accumulating the altcoin under $1 valuation. Their wallet longed about 1.35 million ONDO equivalent to $1.26 million at the time of writing. This came as the leadership expanded minting of stocks to CoWSwap, as per data from EtherScan. They actively tested by deploying American Express on ONDO using CoWSwap. Source: EtherScan The expansion aligned with ONDO’s goal of easing tokenization while ensuring there was enough reach. That way, more protocols onboarded, and user growth could follow since they directly correlate. Despite this huge milestone in terms of tokenizing and chain activity, ONDO price was stalling. Its price had formed two bearish reversal patterns, suggesting more downside potential was due. Initial pattern led to a price drop from $1.15 to $0.85. The second has seen ONDO drop from $1.10 to $0.90, where it set up a floor. Still, the ability of $0.90, holding was dependent on wider market reaction, especially for Bitcoin [BTC]. With the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) at 0.17 and in an uptrend, it signaled capital inflow. This supported the aforementioned capital inflow from the whale’s wallet. Source: TradingView The heads and shoulders pattern hinted at further drops. Therefore, revisiting $0.85 could not be ruled out. However, the anticipation was for the zone to hold for a rebound. Failure could invalidate a potential reversal. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.
