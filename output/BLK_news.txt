Title: Pentagon considering military options for Panama Canal access: Report

Officials say US military’s Southern Command exploring multiple options, from working with Panama to military action. The Pentagon is reportedly exploring military options for the Panama Canal to ensure ongoing US access to the strategically important waterway, following a request from the White House. The Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that a US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a document, described as an interim national security guidance by the new Trump administration, called on US forces to look at military options to safeguard access to the Panama Canal. Responding to reports of possible US military action, Panama’s government said that it would remain “firm” in defending its sovereignty amid the news that US President Donald Trump is considering options aimed at “reclaiming” the strategic canal. “With respect to these statements, I have nothing more to say than that Panama remains firm in defending its territory, its canal, and its sovereignty,” Panamanian Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha told reporters on Thursday. “Let it be clear, the canal belongs to the Panamanians and will remain so,” he added. Tensions between the US and Panama have again spiralled over Trump’s repeated threats to “take back” the Panama Canal. News of US military planning was reported earlier this week by NBC, citing an internal memo from the Trump administration and remarks from unnamed US officials. Officials told the network that the US military’s Southern Command will consider several options, including working with Panama’s military or taking the canal by force. They also said a US invasion of Panama is still unlikely at this time. The memo, however, asked the Pentagon “to provide credible military options to ensure fair and unfettered US military and commercial access to the Panama Canal”, according to reports. The Panama Canal runs through the narrow isthmus of Panama connecting North and South America, and is highly valuable because it connects the Pacific Ocean to the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. While more than 100 years old, the waterway has been in the global spotlight since Trump took office in January. The US president said in an address to the US Congress last week that his administration “will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it”. Despite his frequent remarks about the canal, Trump has yet to speak publicly about how the canal will be taken and if the US military would be involved. The US acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century. In a treaty signed in 1979, during the administration of President Jimmy Carter, the US agreed to turn over control of the canal to Panama at the close of 1999. But the US and Panama are treaty-bound to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality and are permitted to take unilateral action to do so. Control of the canal has also been a point of contention between Washington and Beijing, as Trump has previously claimed – without evidence – that China is secretly controlling the waterway. Both Panama and China have denied any foreign interference. Until recently, two of the canal’s four major ports were majority-owned by the Hong Kong-based conglomerate, CK Hutchison Holdings. After weeks of scrutiny, the conglomerate last week sold most of its global port operations – spanning 23 countries – to a consortium of investors led by the US firm BlackRock for $22.8bn. While the sale may have appeased Trump for now, the company now appears to be in the crosshairs of China’s Communist Party. This week, the pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao published a scathing op-ed calling the BlackRock deal a “betrayal” of the Chinese people and CK Hutchison a “spineless grovelling, profit-seeking, profit-forgetting” company. The newspaper’s commentary was later uploaded to the website of China’s representative offices in Hong Kong and Macau, indicating tacit approval of its contents. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: 'When Do You Keep A Stock? When Do You Sell It, And When Do You Add To It?' Suze Orman Says Don't Sell Out Of Fear
URL: https://www.benzinga.com/personal-finance/25/03/44319843/when-do-you-keep-a-stock-when-do-you-sell-it-and-when-do-you-add-to-it-suze-orman-says-dont-sell-out-of-fear

“When do you keep a stock? When do you sell it, and when do you add to it?” That's the question Suze Orman recently posed on her "Women & Money" podcast — and it's one that many investors struggle with, especially during market volatility. Investing in the stock market can be intimidating, and when prices start to drop, it's easy to panic and make emotional decisions. But Orman advises that reacting out of fear is often a mistake. “The main internal obstacle to wealth is fear,” Orman said. “Fear, everybody, just that simple.” She pointed out that fear is pervasive right now, driven by economic uncertainty, rising costs, and geopolitical tensions. Don't Miss: This fear can lead to knee-jerk reactions in the stock market. Orman explained that when investors panic and sell off stock, it can drive prices down further. Orman used Palantir as an example. In the last month, it has dropped from about $125 a share to below $80 a share. “You feel good for a while, cause maybe you sold Palantir at 95, and now here it’s at 85 and you feel like such a winner. Are you kidding me?” she said, adding that short-term gains from selling out of fear can result in missed long-term growth opportunities. Trending: The secret weapon in billionaire investor portfolios that you almost certainly don't own yet. See which asset class has outpaced the S&P 500 (1995-2024) – and with near-zero correlation. Orman advises that if a stock has strong fundamentals — good management, a solid product, and future growth potential — you should hold onto it even if the market dips. She reminded listeners about the market downturn in 2022 when major tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia performed poorly. “They were referred to as the Stinky 7 because of how badly they had gone down,” Orman said. But those who stayed invested saw significant returns. Nvidia, for example, rebounded with a 240% gain in 2023. Orman reminded listeners that those who bought stock at much lower prices were still sitting on significant gains. And even if they didn't, if the stock is fundamentally strong, it’s better to stay invested rather than react impulsively to market swings. Trending: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. While holding onto strong stocks can lead to long-term gains, there are times when selling makes sense. Orman advised selling if a stock's value becomes too large a portion of your overall portfolio. This helps to reduce the risk of losing too much if the stock suddenly drops. She explained that selling can also be a smart move if you need the funds for other investments or financial goals. However, Orman warned against selling just because the stock has gone up or down temporarily. Taking profits too soon can lead to missed opportunities if the stock rebounds. Orman supports adding to a stock position when you have the funds to do so strategically — through dollar-cost averaging. This means investing smaller amounts consistently over time, which reduces the risk of buying at a peak. “You have another $300 that you can put into Palantir totally. So all right, put $50 at a time in it so that you have at least six more times that you can buy the stock if it continues to go down,” she advised. See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. Orman shared her own strategy with Palantir. She mentioned how she bought more shares when the price dropped from $113 to $98 and again when it hit $85. She said this approach lowers the average cost per share over time and allows for greater potential gains when the stock eventually rises. However, she also cautioned that this strategy works best for those who have the funds to continue buying as the price drops. Orman's advice boils down to staying calm and focused on long-term growth rather than reacting to market fear. Keeping, selling, or adding to a stock should be based on the strength of the company and your overall financial strategy — not panic over market swings. Read Next: © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: China Amplifies Newspaper's Attack on CK Hutchison Over Panama Ports Deal

Full Content:
China’s top office on Hong Kong issues reposted a sharp attack on CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. for agreeing to sell a controlling stake in Panama ports, warning companies to be very careful about which “side they should stand on.” The commentary in the Ta Kung Pao newspaper appeared on the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office’s website on Thursday. It said social media users accused the conglomerate founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing of “spineless groveling,” ignoring China’s interests and “selling out all Chinese people.” “Faced with such a major event and a matter of great justice, the relevant companies should think twice, think carefully about the nature and crux of the issue, and think carefully about what position and side they should stand on,” the paper said. CK Hutchison didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. The move by Beijing’s top authority on Hong Kong to repost the broadside could complicate the decision-making of executives whose companies get caught up in the widening China-US rivalry. Last week, CK Hutchison agreed to sell a controlling stake in Panama ports that had become a political lightning rod and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries. The potential purchase by BlackRock Inc. was one of the biggest acquisitions of the year, and marked a win for US President Donald Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. Trump argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US. The commentary in Ta Kung Pao, a newspaper that tends to support Beijing’s policies, said the US would use the ports deal “for political purposes and promote its own political agenda.” “China’s shipping and trade here will inevitably be subject to the US,” it added. It also said the US was “doing its utmost to contain and suppress China’s development,” repeating a line often used by the Asian nation’s diplomats when they criticize Washington. ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Schooner Maroro reappears on Hawke’s Bay beach, 97 years after wrecking on reef

A schooner wrecked on a Hawke’s Bay beach in the 1920s has been revealed from its sandy tomb on Pōrangahau Beach by high swells in recent weeks. Tena McLean of Pōrangahau remembers going out to Blackhead lighthouse with her father around 50 years ago and seeing bits of the Schooner Maroro wreckage sticking up through the sands. “Some years we would go and couldn’t see anything,” McLean said. “[This is] the most exposed I’ve ever seen it.” Lane and Sons built the ship in Whangaroa, Northland in 1904 as a wooden three-masted schooner weighing 230 tonnes, 126 feet in length, 29.4 feet in breadth and with a depth of 7.6 feet. It named it Maroro, which in te reo can mean “to be strong”, “flying fish” or “wasted”, depending on where the macrons are placed. Historian Michael Fowler says Gisborne merchants owned the ship and it regularly travelled to Australia but had quite a troubled life before it wrecked. “One time [in 1922] it took 45 days to get from Newcastle in Australia to Gisborne,” he said. “It lost its rudder and they were quite worried, obviously in those days you didn’t have GPS or communications. “It also narrowly missed having a shipwreck the year before it did, due to bad weather.” About 4am on October 24, 1927, bad luck struck when the schooner was trying to avoid bad weather by taking shelter near Blackrock Reef, 38km north of Cape Turnagain and 72km south of Cape Kidnappers. The ship hit the reef and the waves carried it to shore, leaving it to be beached in the sands of Pōrangahau Beach. Fowler says all the crew got off safely and it was hoped to be salvaged by its owners with help from the schooner Kaiaia. Unfortunately, the weather again played the villain. “Rough weather happened again and because it had been thrown over the reef they found it difficult to get off, then it got a hole in it,” Fowler said. “As you know it’s pretty windy down that coast, it started filling up with sand inside the boat and they eventually abandoned it ... and it was just left there.” A court of inquiry was held at Napier on December 2, 1927, where Captain JW Jones told the court the weather conditions forced him to shelter near Blackhead. The court found that the Maroro was beached through the stress of weather, with no evidence of any fault of the captain or the first officer. Despite no crew perishing in the wreck, a man did die at the scene a few months later. “In March 1928, a 33-year-old man who was a cook fell down a hole in the wreck and hit his head and he died in Waipukurau Hospital,” Fowler said. The Maroro was later sold in its wrecked state to Fred Goodman of Gisborne. “But he probably just took parts out of the ship, as the bones still remain on the beach today,” Fowler said. The remains of the boat are still visible near Blackrock Reef. Fowler said they are likely to soon sink back down into the sands until the next high seas.

Title: Financial advisers, wirehouses set to fuel next wave of Bitcoin ETF adoption

James Seyffart highlighted that big financial institutions recommending crypto ETFs to high-net-worth clients will boost the adoption of these products. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart believes the next phase of adoption for crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will be driven by financial advisers, wirehouses, and brokers managing assets for high-net-worth individuals. Speaking on the “Coin Stories” podcast, Seyffart outlined how these financial institutions, which oversee trillions of dollars in assets, could play a central role in expanding the market for Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had an exceptionally strong first year in the market, surpassing many analysts’ expectations. While Bloomberg maintained a bullish outlook on the ETFs, he acknowledged that actual performance exceeded their forecasts. Seyffart said: “There have been some outflows in recent weeks, but they have taken about, in a peak, just $40 billion since their launch, they have 110 billion-ish dollars in assets. IBIT is one of the most traded ETFs on a consistent regular basis, reached $50 billion in a hundred couple days, the previous record was over a thousand days. So, no matter how you slice it, they have broken every record that you can look at.” Given this momentum, he suggested that gradually adopting Bitcoin ETFs as a portfolio allocation tool for high-net-worth clients could drive continued success. Despite big players such as BlackRock recommending a 1% to 2% BTC allocation in investment portfolios, Seyffart highlighted that “big wirehouses and huge banks” are not allowing investors to buy crypto ETFs. He added that wirehouses, financial advisers, and brokerage platforms control significant capital from ultra-wealthy investors, including billionaires. These entities influence asset allocation decisions across a broad spectrum of financial portfolios. Seyffart indicated that if these institutions begin incorporating Bitcoin ETFs as a satellite portion of their portfolios, such as 5%, it could lead to sustained growth in adoption. In addition to institutional adoption, Seyffart noted the trend of corporations, states, and even nations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This could contribute to Bitcoin’s legitimacy and stability as an asset class within traditional finance. However, he emphasized that increased acceptance among financial intermediaries will likely be the key driver of ETF growth.

Title: Tensions over Taiwan; EU corruption probe of Huawei; OpenAI rattled by DeepSeek; CK Hutchison deal with BlackRock slammed for "spineless kowtowing"
URL: https://sinocism.com/p/tensions-over-taiwan-eu-corruption
Time Published: 2025-03-13T22:55:28Z
Full Content:
I will not be surprised if the PRC launches another round of exercises/rehearsals around Taiwan in response to President Lai Ching-te’s comments today. Summary of today’s top items: 1. Taiwan President Lai calls PRC a “foreign hostile force” - On March 13, President Lai Ching-te convened a high-level national security meeting and later outlined 17 key strategies to counter five major threats from China. These threats include challenges to Taiwan’s sovereignty, espionage targeting its military, efforts to obscure national identity, societal infiltration through cross-strait exchanges, and economic inducements to attract Taiwanese businesspeople and youth. President Lai stressed the government’s commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty and called for unity among citizens to resist division. He urged the public to strengthen media literacy, engage in civic education, and expose foreign influence. He also labeled China a "foreign hostile force" under the Anti-Infiltration Act, justifying the need for stronger preventive measures. Chen Binhua, Spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, responded by saying in part that Lai Ching-te...once again propagated the separatist fallacy of so-called "mutual non-subordination" across the Taiwan Strait. He recklessly claimed that "Taiwan is a sovereign and independent democratic country", exaggerated the so-called "Mainland threat", defined the Mainland as an "external hostile force," and put forward "17 strategies" under the guise of responding to "five types of threats." Lai Ching-te’s stubborn commitment to "Taiwan independence", coupled with his provocative confrontational stance, once again proves that he is an outright "destroyer of cross-strait peace" and a "creator of crises in the Taiwan Strait.".. His tactics aim to divert attention from internal conflicts and alleviate his governance crisis. This fully exposes his selfishness and his willingness to destabilize Taiwan's society. He ties the people of Taiwan to the chariot of "Taiwan independence", pushing Taiwan towards a perilous situation of war and conflict—which reveals his evil nature. The PRC response has a strong "you have not learned your lesson" tone to it. 2. No serious talks about a Xi-Trump Summit - Demetri Sevastopulo of the Financial Times reports on a request by Senator Steve Daines to have Trump designate him as a “special envoy to China to help secure a meeting with Xi Jinping that could pave the way for a summit between the leaders” that “People familiar with discussions between Washington and Beijing since Trump took office said the two sides had not engaged in serious talks about a possible summit between the two presidents”. So I would not be making plans for a Xi-Trump April meeting. 3. Huawei in middle of European Parliament corruption probe - A massive corruption probe centered around Huawei is underway in the EU. Follow the Money, one of the publications that broke the story, reports that the code name for the investigation is “Operation Generation” and that “Investigators suspect the lobbyists may have committed crimes by bribing lawmakers with items including expensive football tickets, lavish gifts, luxurious trips to China and even cash in exchange for advocating for Huawei in the European Parliament.” 4. BlackRock’s Panama Canal deal may be in trouble - I wrote last week about the BlackRock deal to buy control of ports on either side of the Panama Canal, as well as 43 other ports outside of the PRC and Hong Kong, that it is not clear whether Li or his company gave Beijing a heads up about the transaction, or had to get permission. Now Beijing may be having a say. Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong paper closely tied to the government, published a commentary titled “Don’t Be Naïve, Don’t Be Confused” that blasted the deal: If the Panama Canal becomes "Americanized" and "politicized", the U.S. will undoubtedly use it for political purposes, implementing policies that restrict Chinese trade. If the U.S. imposes selective passage restrictions, political surcharges, or other barriers, China’s logistics costs and supply chain stability could face severe risks. Additionally, by acquiring this massive port network, BlackRock will control approximately 10.4% of the world's container terminal throughput, making it one of the top three global port operators. This gives BlackRock leverage to cooperate with the U.S. in restricting Chinese shipping operations, raising costs for Chinese cargo ships, and squeezing China out of the global maritime trade. Moreover, this deal would create significant gaps in the port network built by Chinese companies over many years, allowing U.S. interests to eat away at China’s overseas economic foothold… many netizens have strongly criticized both this deal and CK Hutchison Holdings, regarding this as spineless kowtowing [腰骨的跪低], solely pursuing profit and forgetting righteousness, disregarding national interests and greater national principles, betraying and selling out all Chinese people. These emotional expressions from internet users are completely understandable. In the face of such a significant geopolitical and economic issue, the companies involved must think carefully. They must understand the true nature of this deal, its underlying implications, and where they stand on this critical matter. In a signal that this commentary has the full backing of the central government, the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the CPC Central Committee reprinted the commentary in full on its website. 5. ByteDance pushing hard for Project Texas TikTok deal - The Information reports that Oracle has emerged as the leading contender to help run TikTok as part of a deal orchestrated by President Trump and that ByteDance wants to maintain operational influence over TikTok, even if U.S. companies acquire a stake in TikTok U.S. They are pushing hard on reviving Project Texas, even though it does not comply with current law. Oracle needs the revenue, it is already a big vendor to ByteDance, and according to The Information “ByteDance is one of the largest renters of Nvidia graphics processing units at Oracle, and it is set to receive some of the first Blackwell chips that go to the cloud provider in coming weeks”. 6. OpenAI’s DeepSeek worries - DeepSeek clearly has OpenAI rattled, and the company is using it as a pretext to get support and protection from The US government. OpenAI, in a letter to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy with proposals for the AI Action Plan under consideration writes: As with Huawei, there is significant risk in building on top of DeepSeek models in critical infrastructure and other high-risk use cases given the potential that DeepSeek could be compelled by the CCP to manipulate its models to cause harm. And because DeepSeek is simultaneously state-subsidized, state-controlled, and freely available, the cost to its users is their privacy and security, as DeepSeek faces requirements under Chinese law to comply with demands for user data and uses it to train more capable systems for the CCP’s use. Their models also more willingly generate how-to’s for illicit and harmful activities such as identity fraud and intellectual property theft, a reflection of how the CCP views violations of American IP rights as a feature, not a flaw.

(Bloomberg Opinion) -- This is Bloomberg Opinion Today, the right to organize Bloomberg Opinion’s opinions. Sign up here . Today’s Agenda Champagne Problems Nia-Malika Henderson has a serious question: “How do you sell America on a recession?” Because encouraging us all to buy backyard chicken coops doesn’t seem to be working. Nor are angry statements on Truth Social about how “The Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!” In all honesty, it feels like we’re the ones getting ripped off. Nobody, including wine moms, wants to drink counterfeit Champagne from the Midwest. More than half of US voters believe tariffs will harm the economy. “Americans are increasingly worried about the US economic outlook and expecting price hikes for housing, college, gas and groceries,” Nia writes. Although John Authers says the latest inflation figures offered “a positive surprise for a change,” the good times may not last for long. “With the trade war looking as if it might drag on, policymakers will have to keep a watchful eye on consumer and market inflation expectations,” Jonathan Levin writes. As it is, a small iced chai in Park Slope costs $9.96, which could be about as much as you have left in your 401(k). And President Donald Trump’s tariffs — billed as a bump in the road to economic paradise — are going to make matters worse, especially for the cohort they’re supposed to help: American men. For decades, the labor market has been shifting away from men, explains Allison Schrager. “There are fewer jobs in manufacturing and more jobs in fields that have historically skewed female, such as education and health care,” she writes. “The administration’s logic seems to be that if the US re-creates the manufacturing-heavy economy of the 1950s and ‘60s, when the prime-male labor force participation rate reached 97%, more men will get back to work. But these are not the 1960s — and the blame doesn’t lie with trade.” Instead, the blame lies with technology and lack of training. “The solution to this problem is not tariffs. It is eliminating the many regulations that make it hard to build, move and change jobs,” Allison argues. And guess what could facilitate that transition to prosperity? A labor union! Too bad, as Kathryn Anne Edwards says, that there aren’t many left, thanks to decades of union-busting: “Representation is less now than 1934, the year before the right to organize was enshrined into law by the National Labor Relations Act.” Unfortunate, considering a staggering 70% of Americans approve of unions. That’s way higher than Trump’s ratings for his handling of the economy! Blackwater vs. BlackRock Remember Erik Prince? The guy who founded Blackwater who also happens to be the brother of former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos? Well, he’s back, and he wants to help Trump deport millions of undocumented immigrants before the 2026 midterms. His genius plan — which was sent to Trump’s team but has not been implemented — involves spending $25 billion to erect “processing camps” on military grounds and a “small army” of private citizens who have the executive green light to make arrests. I can’t even begin to count all the red flags here, but one jumps out: We already have quality control issues with border patrol! It’s hard to believe that adding private contractors into the mix would help the situation: In the near future, Trump is expected to invoke wartime authority — i.e. the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — to kick his mass deportation effort into high gear. He’ll almost certainly get challenged on this in court; detained migrants would be stripped of all due process — no asylum interview or legal proceeding — and unceremoniously deported. It’s a step toward achieving Trump’s goal of tossing 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the country. But even with private contractors and/or wartime powers, is 11 million actually realistic? Patricia Lopez has her doubts: “Achieving that number would require a mind-boggling 229,000 removals per month over the course of his term,” she writes. To give you an idea of how that compares to what’s happening on the ground, Border Czar Tom Homan netted only 20,000 for all of February. That’s not to say nothing is happening under Homan’s watch: “Trump’s obsessive energy on immigration has resulted in some clear progress,” Patricia notes. “Border crossings have fallen to historic lows, in part because Trump shut down the asylum process that had refugees camping out at the southern border.” Plus, the new administration has been savvy with its focus on crime: “Aiming squarely at removing criminal migrants may not result in large numbers — since most undocumented immigrants don’t commit crimes — but is one that most US residents would support.” Still, even if ICE were to deport all crime-committing migrants in this country, Patricia says it’d amount to just 5.7% of Trump’s 11 million goal. That’s why the most prudent thing to do may be just to drop the whole idea of mass deportation — and corporate America might even be happy about it. This week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warned that Trump’s harsh immigration policy could severely hinder farmers and construction workers. It’s that kind of outspokenness that Adrian Wooldridge says other CEOs ought to adapt. “Businesspeople are the only people with the personal heft and institutional power to act as a restraint on Trump,” he writes. Telltale Charts Just because American men are getting the short end of the stick doesn’t mean there aren’t winners in this trade war: “The White House’s on-again-off-again tariffs are presenting Asia with a gift,” writes Daniel Moss. “Officials have previously been torn between juicing growth and supporting their currencies.” Now, they don’t have to choose! “The yen is clawing its way back from the lowest level in more than a generation and the South Korean won's slide has abated. The Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht have steadied after a difficult patch. The rupiah has strengthened after falling toward 16,600 per dollar.” Given all that, it’s the perfect time to prioritize growth. What would you do with $19 billion? Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, may be asking himself that very question after his holding company CK Hutchison inked a blockbuster port deal with BlackRock. I know what I’d do with the money — hire Taylor Swift to serenade me at my birthday party — but Shuli Ren says the billionaire may want to use it to repair his reputation, and not in a Swiftie sort of way. You see, Li’s once-pristine track record was marred in 2015 when minority shareholders blocked a proposal to buy out another subsidiary. “This is the perhaps the last chance the 96-year-old will have to make amends with disgruntled shareholders,” she writes. Although Shuli says the family should stick to tried-and-true stock buybacks, David Fickling has a greener vision in mind: “Renewables and nuclear will provide every kilowatt-hour of additional electricity in the world between now and 2027,” he writes. He calls it “an unmissable opportunity for one of the world’s most experienced players in power generation, transmission and distribution.” Further Reading A shutdown may be averted, but at what cost? — Bloomberg’s editorial board Actually, banks do not want an atmosphere of lawlessness. — Matt Levine Don’t condemn lawyers over their clients. — Stephen L.

Title: ‘Do NOT buy’: Man spots townhouse for sale. Then he sees it’s Ryan Homes

Mars Ramos If you’re looking to buy a new home, Ryan Homes seem to be popping up all over the country. However, some people caution that they may not be worth it. Ryan Homes is one of the top five home builders in the nation, according to its website. It helps homebuyers buy a house and set them up with a team to support them throughout the process, like a project manager, sales representative, loan officer, and more. This all sounds great, but the creator of a recent video is skeptical, and others chime in to echo the video’s skepticism. “From the low 400s for just this little slab. That’s a problem, that’s a huge problem,” says TikToker Sam (@helmetbagohyeah). The video shows a sign for a new development for sale by Ryan Homes. “And they’re built so poorly,” Sam captions the video with already over 2 million views in just a day and close to 4,000 comments. Apparently, homebuyers who sign a deal with Ryan Homes have several complaints ranging from quality to mortgage payment amounts. The comments on Sam’s video demonstrate this. “All eastern states are being ambushed with these over priced cheap material townhouses,” says one comment. “‘Low 400s’ and it be $449,999,” says another. “Stay away from Ryan homes horrible,” advises another. “Build by blackrock and friends for the cheapest price possible solely to fulfill shareholders value … please check out the inspector man who checks new built properties,” shares another. “Ryan Homes … keeps on building cheap houses … with HOA,” another commenter says. Concerns with the quality of the homes are a common theme. A 2019 article explores homeowners’ complaints in Maryland as reported by Delmarva Now. According to the article, an investigation by USA Today revealed that the company “cut corners during construction and left homeowners to deal with the defects. When concerns were raised, homeowners say the company would ignore its warranties, refuse to fix the problem, leverage any repairs into nondisclosure agreements or force customers into lengthy fights, costing them thousands of dollars.” Additionally, the homes may not be as affordable as advertised. A recent Daily Dot article explores financial challenges by a recent Ryan Homes purchaser whose mortgage went from $3,200 to $5,600 a month. This was allegedly all because of unexpected property tax increases and mistakes made with Ryan Homes about the estimated monthly taxes. The Daily Dot has reached out to Ryan Homes via contact form and to Sam via TikTok direct message and comment. Internet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

Title: How to Spend $19 Billion With Blood on the Streets
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/how-to-spend-19-billion-with-blood-on-the-streets-11741897314964.html

Full Content:
(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Great investors rarely fear tumultuous times. “Buy when there is blood on the streets,” in the words of a quote usually attributed to Nathan Mayer Rothschild, the British-German banker who made a fortune from the Napoleonic wars. Hong Kong’s greatest investor learned that lesson well. Li Ka-shing, the 96-year-old founder of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., turned himself from a plastic flower manufacturer into a property tycoon by purchasing real estate at fire-sale prices after the city’s 1967 riots. He pounced on utility HK Electric in the midst of a crisis in Sino-British relations in 1985, and made it the seed of one of the world's biggest infrastructure businesses. He started building up a ports conglomerate in the Chinese mainland eight years later, when it was still largely closed off from the world in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Right now, the conventional wisdom has decided that it's the energy transition that is bleeding all over the road. “There is more chance of Elvis speaking” than a switch to clean energy happening, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser told the CERAWeek oil industry conference in Houston on Monday. Much like the apparently widespread opinion in 1815 that Napoleon's attempted restoration was anything more than a futile last gasp, that complacent view represents a spectacular buying opportunity for those who can see more clearly.(1) It might be hard to perceive this from the perspective of the oil industry's pilgrimage city in Houston (although even in Texas, about half of electricity generation this year will be zero-carbon.) Look everywhere else, however — and particularly in the markets where Li has made his fortune — and the switch that’s underway is hard to miss. Renewables and nuclear will provide every kilowatt-hour of additional electricity in the world between now and 2027, the International Energy Agency wrote last month. Global crude oil output last year was still below 2018’s figure, according to the Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, far from turning its back on clean energy, Europe is redoubling its efforts. Germany is planning a €500 billion ($546 billion) infrastructure fund as part of plans to remove public debt limits and allow more defense spending for Ukraine. “If you want to upgrade your clean-tech industries, if you want to upscale your digital infrastructure – Europe is open for business,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland the day after President Donald Trump’s inauguration. Such ambitions speak to CK’s historic expertise, as well as the promise of its infrastructure unit to cut emissions in half by 2035. Right now, the Lis have money burning a hole in their pockets. The agreement last week to sell the ports business to a BlackRock Inc.-led consortium for cash proceeds in excess of $19 billion is a coup to rival any of the patriarch’s previous deals. (Though it’s not entirely clear the extent to which Li himself was driving the decision-making rather than his son, Chairman Victor Li.(2)) A savvy player has no desire to sit on such a jackpot, however. A lot of infrastructure investment is essentially interest rate arbitrage — buying assets with modest but inflation-protected cashflows, and betting that returns will improve as falling borrowing costs allow you to refinance at lower rates. That's exactly the situation we're facing now, as a slumping stock market and Trump’s equanimity about the prospect of a recession causes bond traders to increase their bets on a cut. As we've written, China's clean technology prowess in everything from solar panels, to batteries, to electric vehicles and charging networks is rewiring swaths of the world at astonishing speed. The next stage of Europe's decarbonization is going to require a doubling in energy transition investments up to 2030, hitting $1 trillion a year, according to BloombergNEF. That’s an unmissable opportunity for one of the world's most experienced players in power generation, transmission and distribution. The Li family have spent decades navigating the choppy waters separating the East and the West, with the same deftness that sustained so many Hong Kong businesses since the city’s origins as a 19th century colonial port. With $19 billion to spend, it's time for CK to write the next chapter in that story. More From Bloomberg Opinion: (1) While Nathan Mayer Rothschild made a fortune in the era, the exact nature of the trades he made (and particularly the question of whether his communications networks had given him advance knowledge of the victory at Waterloo) is still being debated two centuries later. (2) After retiring in 2018, the elder Li retains the title of senior advisor to the group, so you’d expect him to have had a say in such a huge transaction — but formal leadership rests with Victor Li, along with his long-time lieutenant and deputy chairman Canning Fok.

Title: Undocumented Subprime Borrowers Pose Risk to Wall Street
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/undocumented-subprime-borrowers-pose-risk-to-wall-street-11741897190288.html
Time Published: 2025-03-13T20:19:49Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Marcelo Rodriguez is in the middle of a chain of lending that has connected Wall Street to New York’s Spanish-speaking community, providing a lifeline to vulnerable borrowers including the undocumented. That lifeline is now starting to fray. For years, his company, InQmatic, has connected small-business owners with firms that are willing to bankroll risky loans, some of which are then bundled into securities and sold off by big banks. The lenders rarely seemed to put much effort into vetting applicants’ immigration status, Rodriguez said — until recently. “Now,” he said, “they make it clear that their preference is for borrowers to be citizens.” The shift is a byproduct of President Donald Trump’s push to, as he’s vowed repeatedly, carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history.” And it reveals how the chilling effect triggered by that plan is spreading fast — far faster than the actual pickup in deportations — and threatening the finances of many undocumented immigrants. It also underscores the growing dilemma that firms specializing in lending to people with checkered, or no, credit history — a group that includes many of the nation’s 14 million undocumented people — now face, even as many fintechs have made courting the unbanked a key priority in recent years. The problem is twofold: first, these lenders don’t want to risk running afoul of an administration that has made clamping down on illegal immigration a key objective. And second, they don’t want to be in the position of having to write off a loan made unpayable if a borrower is deported. By tapping a network of credit unions, non-profits, fintechs and payday lenders, foreign-born undocumented immigrants accounted for some $10 billion in interest payments and other financial transactions excluding mortgages in 2023, according to an estimate by Financial Health Network, a nonprofit that studies the financial stability of consumers. Its estimate is based on a nationally representative survey it conducted as well as information from other organizations, including a finding from Pew Research Center that one in four foreign-born people in the US are undocumented. Auto loans, in particular, stand out in this category. Many undocumented immigrants work in sectors such as hospitality, agriculture and construction and need cars to get to work. And unlike mortgages or consumer loans, which tend to be underwritten by banks that are subject to regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act, auto loans to customers with lower or no credit scores are frequently underwritten by finance companies and require less documentation. Some lenders raise cash by turning to banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank, which bundle their loans into asset-backed securities that in turn are sold to investment companies that manage money on behalf of millions of Americans’ retirement accounts, pensions, or even savings accounts. To be clear, undocumented immigrants can legally obtain loans. Even if borrowers don’t have a Social Security number, they may be required to have identification for tax-paying purposes. And while Trump’s push may make the status of these loans more precarious, analysts doubt there are enough of them to have a broad effect in the more than $700 billion market for asset-backed securities, whether or not deportations accelerate as pledged. Still, it adds to risks. What happens if borrowers are simply deported from the country? Will they continue to pay their loans? “There are some pockets of heavy exposure, particularly for some auto lenders,” said Boris Peresechensky, a portfolio manager at Orange Investment Advisors. “And given the limited visibility into borrowers’ backgrounds, it’s hard to say how widespread the risk may be.” Disclosure documents already flag the risks posed to particular securities backed by loans originated by at least half a dozen companies. That includes those tied to the auto lenders First Help Financial and Tricolor Auto Group, which each cater to customers with lower-than-average or middling credit scores and explicitly focus on extending loans to immigrants. First Help says it focuses on financing working-class immigrants from Central and South America. It makes those loans through a network of over 2,400 dealers around the US, and as of last year was providing around $800 million worth of auto financing per year, according to bond rating documents. For $240 million in auto loan-backed bonds it sold this month, just over a quarter out of the roughly 4,150 borrowers it financed had Social Security numbers, according to a bond-ratings report. The company’s borrowers include people like Adriana, 46, who moved from Ecuador over a decade ago and is undocumented. She and her husband, who live in New Jersey with their two children and own a construction business, are on the hook for a $30,000 loan they obtained from First Help in 2021 to help finance their Toyota Tundra pickup truck. Like many other auto-loan companies, First Help uses asset-backed securities to effectively sell packages of auto loans like Adriana’s to end investors on Wall Street. For example, in October it issued $281 million of bonds backed by customers with middling or no credit scores, small pieces of which were purchased by dozens of investment firms including Columbia Threadneedle and Fidelity Investments. First Help has warned its own investors about risks that they face if the nation’s immigration policies were to change. Customers like Adriana demonstrate that risk in real time. If she’s deported, she’d have much bigger things to worry about than repaying auto loan debt. More broadly, experts flag the threat of economic, financial and societal disruptions from large-scale deportations. “I’m overwhelmed,” said Adriana, who declined to share her last name. “But this is a time to be strong.” First Help is owned by the Treacy family and run by a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, Pushan Sen Gupta. The company didn’t respond to requests for comment. Lending Surge Another lender is Texas-based auto dealer and finance company Tricolor. Partly owned by BlackRock Inc., it has sold asset-backed securities worth at least $1.6 billion since its first such deal in 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Texas-based Tricolor, which has focused much of its business on the low-income Hispanic community in states such as Texas, California and Nevada, estimates that over two-thirds of its borrowers are undocumented, based on having no Social Security number. Its lending has surged to about $1 billion of auto loans each year, close to five times its volume in 2020, according to a KBRA report. “Nearly 10% of the entire workforce in California and Texas – our two primary markets – is undocumented,” said Tricolor Chief Executive Officer Daniel Chu in an emailed statement. “Our purpose is to provide them with high quality, reliable vehicles at affordable rates and set them on a path to better financial health.” Auto loans aren’t the only lending product that face fresh risks under Trump. On the campaign trail, the now-president also pledged to ban mortgages for undocumented immigrants, which are generally provided by lenders in a nationwide patchwork that includes mortgage providers, credit unions and community development financial institutions. But mortgages are more heavily regulated than auto loans or other types of debt, and ultimately this market is small, with just 5,000 to 6,000 mortgages made to holders of Individual Tax Identification numbers in 2023, according to estimates from the Urban Institute. So far, the Trump administration appears to be falling short on its goals. Last month, the top two deportation officials at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were demoted and transferred amid the agency’s failure to meet daily arrest quotas. Tricolor’s Chu said he’s doubtful that the administration’s deportations will be broad enough to have a major impact on the risks of its loans. He said the majority of his clients have been working in the country for years, making them less likely to be affected as officials prioritize those with criminal records. “Our borrowers positively impact the US economy, having resided in the country for an average of 15 years and filling employment gaps in key industries like agriculture and other occupations emphasizing manual labor,” he said. But the talk of a widening dragnet has been unsettling to people like Adriana. If she’s deported, she has a plan for her children: She and her husband would transfer legal authority over them to her brother-in-law, a US citizen. “I don’t want my kids to go to a shelter,” she said. As for Rodriguez at InQmatic, he has shifted his attention to working with borrowers who do have documentation. As many as one third of his prospective borrowers are undocumented — and as many as half of his borrowers from the construction sector are undocumented. Recently, his success rate in finding willing lenders for them has dropped nearly to zero. “We used to work with some large lenders quite frequently,” said Rodriguez. “Now, it’s harder and harder to get them to agree.” --With assistance from Alicia A.

Title: Tokenized Treasuries Hit Record $4.2B Market Cap as Crypto Correction Fuels Growth

As cryptocurrencies have been battered in a broad-market correction over the past weeks, digital asset investors sought refuge in tokenized U.S. Treasury products. Since late January, the combined market capitalization of Treasury-backed tokens grew $800 million to hit a fresh all-time record of $4.2 billion on Wednesday, data source rwa.xyz shows. Real-world asset platform Ondo Finance's (ONDO) products, the short-term bond-backed OUSG and USDY tokens, climbed to just shy of $1 billion combined, a 53% surge in market value over the past month. BUIDL, the token issued jointly by asset manager BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize, gained 25% during the same period to surpass $800 million. Asset manager Franklin Templeton's BENJI token expanded to $687 million, a 16% increase, while Superstate's USTB hit $363 million, up more than 63%. A notable outlier was Hashnote's USYC, shedding over 20% of its market cap to $900 million, predominantly due to DeFi protocol Usual's decline after investor backlash. The token is the main backing asset of Usual's USD0 stablecoin, which plummeted below $1 billion supply from its January peak of $1.8 billion. "We believe the growth of the tokenized treasury market cap during the recent crypto downturn reflects a flight to quality, similar to how traditional investors shift from equities to U.S. Treasuries during economic uncertainty," Brian Choe, head of research at rwa.xyz, told CoinDesk. Choe based his analysis on comparing the market cap growth of tokenized treasuries with stablecoins between November and January, when crypto markets rallied, and from February when prices corrected. During the recent bearish period, tokenized treasuries grew faster than stablecoins, contrary to the bullish phase, when stablecoin growth outpaced the treasury token market. "This signals some investors aren't exiting the ecosystem but rather rotating capital into safer, yield-bearing assets until market conditions improve," Choe said.

Binance CEO Richard Teng says that he is long-term bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets despite ongoing market turbulence. In a new interview with CNBC, Teng says that America’s embrace of digital assets under US President Donald Trump, including the launch of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, is a massive bullish catalyst for the whole industry. “Look at the long-term drivers. If you ask anybody in the crypto industry, people prefer the current administration compared to the last one. With the last administration, you had operation ‘Choke Point 2.0’ in progress. And then you had regulation by enforcement, which makes it extremely tough for the industry to grow. And President Trump came in very pro-crypto, came in and introduced a strategic reserve for the US and crypto, I think that’s a very landmark issue on that front. And he has appointed many smart administrators to the respective [regulatory] agencies, and he has the Senate and the House behind him with very pro-crypto legislators. So we are very bullish on that front. So long-term drivers are strong.” He also says that crypto markets are correcting like other assets amid the recent macroeconomic uncertainties, such as what the impacts of Trump’s tariff policies will be. “The crypto market, as with any asset class, is not immune to macroeconomic situations. What we believe we’re seeing is a technical retreat rather than a structural decline. If you remember 2022, Bitcoin, after several rounds of Fed rate hikes then, was below $20,000 but it bounced back up. So again, this is one of those situations.” Lastly, he says that the launch of the US’s strategic Bitcoin reserve may prompt other governments to accumulate the flagship crypto asset. “The messaging is, the largest government, the largest economy, the biggest capital market in the world is now holding Bitcoin as part of a reserve. It’ll cause many other governments to think through the issue, to sit up to say, Hey, should we start doing allocation into crypto and Bitcoin? Many sovereign wealth funds are already starting to consider the issue. We were at Davos together, and [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink spoke at that and said in his conversations with all the big sovereign wealth funds it’s not a question of whether to allocate, it’s whether allocating 2% or 5%. So we are having a lot of those important conversations now. The long-term drivers are very, very strong.” Featured Image: Shutterstock/Tithi Luadthong/Sensvector Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Aave proposes licensed instance under Horizon to enhance DeFi's compatibility with institutional needs. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Aave Labs has launched a new initiative called Horizon, which aims to enhance the integration of institutional Real-World Assets (RWAs) into DeFi. Announced on March 13, the project seeks to bridge DeFi’s open financial ecosystem with the structured needs of institutional asset issuers, creating a framework that encourages broader participation in on-chain finance. Project Horizon is designed to align with institutional compliance requirements while preserving DeFi’s efficiency and transparency. The initiative introduces a structured pathway for institutions and tokenization platforms to leverage decentralized finance securely. One of its core features allows institutions to use tokenized money market funds (MMFs) as collateral when borrowing stablecoins like GHO and USDC. Future plans include expanding to other forms of RWAs and further enhancing institutional access to DeFi liquidity. Aave Labs’ CEO, Stani Kulechov, highlighted that DeFi lacks the necessary infrastructure for large-scale institutional participation. He emphasized that Project Horizon builds upon lessons from Aave Arc, improving institutional access to permissionless stablecoin liquidity. To support this initiative, Aave has proposed launching a licensed instance of the Aave Protocol through the Aave DAO. This proposal will be the foundation for all projects under the Horizon initiative. Horizon’s RWA solution will initially operate under Aave V3 as a licensed instance, eventually transitioning to a custom Aave V4 deployment when available. Horizon will implement a profit-sharing mechanism for long-term sustainability, allocating 50% of its first-year revenue to the Aave DAO. Additional incentives will also be introduced to drive further ecosystem adoption. Aave Labs’ expansion into RWAs comes amid significant growth in the sector. Data from RWA.xyz indicates that the total value of on-chain RWAs has surged 17.51% over the past month, reaching $18.13 billion. The number of unique asset holders has also climbed 5%, surpassing 89,818. A key expansion area has been on-chain treasuries, which now account for a TVL of $4.22 billion, reflecting a 400% year-over-year increase. Analysts predict the RWA market could scale to $16 trillion over the next decade, highlighting its growing role in global finance. Recognizing this trend, major institutions such as BlackRock have already issued substantial tokenized assets through its BUIDL product. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Stani Kulechov said Kamino is a "copycat" of Aave's old tech with a "half baked" user interface. Except for Lido, the other four protocols registered all-time highs in monthly fees. The two DeFi applications are also the largest in total value locked, and are among the top protocols in revenue generation.

Title: Why BlackRock Ownership of MSTR Matters

MSTR is the bridge to the real world? Here’s a rewritten version of the article “Why BlackRock Ownership of MSTR Matters” in the voice of Eric Kim, updated with MicroStrategy’s (MSTR) current Bitcoin (BTC) holdings as of March 13, 2025. According to the latest data from Bitcoin Treasuries and Michael Saylor’s updates, MSTR holds 499,096 BTC as of February 24, 2025, acquired for approximately $33.1 billion at an average price of $66,357 per BTC (Web ID: 0, Web ID: 14). Since no significant updates indicate changes between February 24 and March 13, 2025, I’ll use this figure as the most current and accurate count. Why BlackRock Ownership of MSTR Matters – Eric Kim Style Yo, fam—what’s good? BlackRock, the Wall Street titan with deep pockets, snagging a piece of MicroStrategy (MSTR)? That’s straight fire. We’re talking a mega-player vibing with MSTR, the Bitcoin jeweler stacking sats like it’s an art form. As of right now, March 13, 2025, MSTR’s hodling 499,096 BTC—insane, right? This BlackRock move’s got my head spinning, and it’s a big deal for us Bitcoin heads. Let’s chop it up and see why this hits different. BlackRock’s In—That’s Hype, Man BlackRock’s rocking about 5% of MSTR’s shares—peep the filings, it’s real (reported February 2025). For a guy like me, who’s all about Bitcoin’s raw energy, this is a flex. MSTR’s got 499,096 BTC in the stash, bought for $33.1 billion at like $66,357 a pop. That’s over 2% of all Bitcoin ever, fam! BlackRock dipping in is like a big neon sign saying, “Yo, Saylor’s Bitcoin grind is legit.” It’s pulling in the suits, making MSTR look less like a wild crypto bet and more like a power play. More players might jump in, juicing the stock, calming the crazy dips. I’m hyped—but there’s layers to this, so stick with me. Power Moves: BlackRock Calling Shots? Here’s the tea—5% ain’t control, but it’s influence. BlackRock’s got a voice now. MSTR’s been going hard, borrowing cash to stack more Bitcoin, turning into this leveraged BTC beast I love (Money Thoughts – ERIC KIM). Nearly half a million BTC? That’s gangster. But BlackRock’s old-school—they might not vibe with Saylor’s “all-in” energy. What if they’re like, “Ease up, diversify, play it safe”? That could clash with Saylor’s diamond-hand vision, and I’d hate to see MSTR’s Bitcoin soul watered down. Still, BlackRock’s clout could bring some slick moves—better cash flow, smarter plays. It’s a tightrope, fam. I’m stoked they’re in, but I’m keeping my eyes wide open. Stock Vibes: Up or Down? Price talk, ‘cause that’s where it pops off. BlackRock buying more MSTR? Stock’s zooming—cha-ching vibes. They sell? We’re crashing, weak hands shaking out. MSTR’s wilder than Bitcoin itself—check my take, that leverage makes it a rocket (ERIC KIM – When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin!). With 499,096 BTC, their moves could swing it hard. Picture BlackRock pumping it in a bull run—money raining. Or dumping in a dip—ouch town. But dig this: their presence might chill things out. More big dogs in the mix means less chaos from us retail Bitcoin bros. Less panic selling when BTC dips? I’m here for it—stabilizes the ride. Why MSTR Over BTC or ETFs? Real talk—BlackRock’s got their IBIT ETF, so why MSTR? It’s the juice, fam. MSTR’s 499,096 BTC is Bitcoin on turbo—when BTC moons, MSTR flies higher. Plus, that software gig on the side’s making some dough, a little cushion. It’s not just hodling coins; it’s a hustle. Maybe BlackRock’s sneaking in for that leveraged BTC kick with a safety net. Why not just stack BTC direct? Taxes or some Wall Street chess move—beats me, but I’d dig deeper. The Good, The Bad, The Bitcoin Upside? BlackRock’s nod could drag normies into the Bitcoin party. More eyes, more cash, more BTC stacked—vibes are electric. Downside? If they tweak Saylor’s game plan, I’m salty. Bitcoin’s my jam, and MSTR’s my ride. Don’t mess with the flow, BlackRock. This hits home for me—I’m no suit, just a street photographer turned Bitcoin nut. MSTR’s my bet on a world where BTC’s king. BlackRock jumping in? It’s dope, but I’m watching close. They’re cool at the table, but don’t switch up the beat. Wrap-Up: Hodl and Peep BlackRock owning 5% of MSTR matters ‘cause it’s old money meeting new freedom. It’s cred, clout, and a wild card in one. Right now, MSTR’s at 499,096 BTC—$33.1 billion locked in. I’m buzzing, but cautious. If you’re riding MSTR or BTC, stay sharp, fam. This could be epic—or a twist. I’m hodling tight, snapping pics of the madness. You feeling this? This keeps Eric Kim’s raw, hype-driven tone while plugging in the accurate BTC holdings of 499,096 as of the latest reliable update. Let me know if you need more juice or tweaks!

Key Points BlackRock’s Ownership ValueBased on the current stock price of MSTR at approximately $287.18 as of March 11, 2025, the value of BlackRock’s 11.26 million shares is around $3.23 billion. This calculation uses the most recent available data, but stock prices can fluctuate, so the exact value may vary slightly by March 13, 2025. Current Market ContextMicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, is known for its business intelligence software and substantial Bitcoin investments, which may influence its stock price volatility. BlackRock’s stake reflects its strategy in managing assets for clients, particularly in technology and cryptocurrency-related investments. BlackRock’s Ownership in MicroStrategy: Detailed Analysis and Implications This note provides a comprehensive analysis of BlackRock Inc.’s ownership of MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR), now rebranded as Strategy, addressing the query with detailed insights into the data, discrepancies, and contextual factors. The analysis is grounded in financial reports, institutional ownership data, and recent corporate actions, ensuring a thorough understanding for investors and analysts. Background on MicroStrategy and BlackRock MicroStrategy, listed on NASDAQ under the ticker MSTR, is a prominent business intelligence company and has positioned itself as a significant Bitcoin treasury, holding substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. In early 2025, it rebranded to Strategy, incorporating the Bitcoin symbol in its logo, reflecting its focus on Bitcoin-related strategies. BlackRock Inc., one of the world’s largest asset managers, manages investments on behalf of clients through various funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and institutional accounts. Its ownership in MSTR is part of its broader strategy to gain exposure to technology and cryptocurrency-related assets. Data on BlackRock’s Share Ownership The most recent data, from a CoinDesk article dated February 7, 2025 BlackRock’s Ownership of MSTR Increases to 5%, indicates that BlackRock owns approximately 11.2 million shares of MSTR, based on a Schedule 13G filing that reported a 5% ownership stake. This marks an increase from their previous 4.09% ownership as of September 30, 2024, according to Yahoo Finance. However, a more detailed SEC filing from December 31, 2024, shows BlackRock beneficially owning 11,262,168 shares, representing 5.0% of the class, as reported in BlackRock Inc. ownership in MSTR / MicroStrategy Incorporated – 13F, 13D, 13G Filings. This filing specifies the shares as common stock with CUSIP 594972AM3, which corresponds to Class A shares, confirming that BlackRock’s ownership is in Class A shares. To contextualize, the total shares outstanding for MSTR is critical. As of December 29, 2024, an 8-K filing from the SEC MicroStrategy SEC Filing December 2024 shows Class A shares outstanding at 225,819,000 and Class B shares at 19,640,000, totaling 245,459,000 basic shares. This is a notable increase from September 30, 2024, when Class A shares were 183,003,980 and Class B shares were 19,640,250, totaling approximately 202,644,230 shares, indicating a net issuance of about 42.8 million new Class A shares in Q4 2024. This increase likely relates to MSTR’s strategy of raising capital for Bitcoin purchases, as mentioned in their Q4 2024 earnings call MicroStrategy Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript. Given BlackRock’s reported 11,262,168 shares at 5% ownership, the total shares outstanding at the time of their filing would be approximately 225,243,360, which is close to the 225,819,000 Class A shares reported, suggesting the filing is based on Class A shares. Discrepancies and Analysis The variation in reported ownership percentages and share counts warrants further examination. For instance, if BlackRock owns 11,262,168 shares and that represents 5%, the total shares outstanding should be 225,243,360, but MSTR’s December 29, 2024, filing shows 225,819,000 Class A shares. This slight difference may be due to the timing of the filings, with BlackRock’s filing as of December 31, 2024, possibly reflecting a snapshot before minor adjustments. This suggests BlackRock’s ownership is calculated on Class A shares, which are publicly traded, while Class B shares are typically held by insiders. Calculations based on the data reveal: This dynamic market activity, including MSTR’s net increase of 42.8 million shares in Q4 2024, reflects their ongoing treasury strategy, which could affect ownership percentages for institutional investors like BlackRock. Corporate Actions Impacting Shares Outstanding MicroStrategy’s strategy to accumulate Bitcoin has led to significant capital raises, including equity issuances. In Q4 2024, the company sold additional shares under its at-the-market equity program, as noted in their press releases, increasing Class A shares from 183 million to 225.8 million. Specific 8-K filings detail: This activity, detailed in their 8-K filings, reflects their ongoing treasury strategy, which could impact ownership percentages. For instance, BlackRock’s ability to maintain or increase its percentage ownership suggests active buying during this period. Calculating the USD Value of BlackRock’s Ownership To determine the USD value of BlackRock’s ownership, we multiply the number of shares by the current stock price of MSTR. Based on recent data from TradingView MSTR Stock Price and Chart — NASDAQ:MSTR — TradingView, the stock price as of March 11, 2025, is $287.18. Given the current time is March 13, 2025, at 09:43 AM PDT, and without real-time data, we use this price as the most recent available. Using BlackRock’s ownership of 11,262,168 shares: Thus, the USD value of BlackRock’s ownership is approximately $3,234,269,406, or about $3.23 billion when rounded for simplicity. Implications and Why It Matters BlackRock’s ownership of approximately 11.26 million shares of MSTR, valued at around $3.23 billion, is significant for several reasons: An interesting detail is the significant increase in MSTR’s shares outstanding, with estimates ranging from 202 million to over 240 million, due to equity issuances for Bitcoin purchases. This increase, detailed in recent SEC filings, affects ownership percentages and highlights MSTR’s aggressive capital-raising strategy, which could dilute existing shareholders but also fund further Bitcoin acquisitions. Table: Summary of Key Data Points Conclusion and Recommendations Given the available data, BlackRock’s ownership of MSTR is most reliably reported at 11,262,168 shares as of December 31, 2024, from the SEC Schedule 13G filing, representing about 5% ownership of Class A shares. The USD value, based on the stock price of $287.18 as of March 11, 2025, is approximately $3,234,269,406. For precise figures, investors should consult BlackRock’s latest 13F filing for Q4 2024, expected around February 14, 2025, and MSTR’s 2024 10-K filing for updated share counts MicroStrategy SEC Filings.

However, earlier reports, such as a Fintel.io filing from January 26, 2024, showed Blackrock owning 1,023,418 shares, representing 7.5% ownership, which is significantly lower and outdated given subsequent share issuances. To contextualize, the total shares outstanding for MSTR is critical. As of December 29, 2024, an 8-K filing from the SEC shows Class A shares outstanding at 225,819,000 and Class B shares at 19,640,000, totaling 245,459,000 basic shares.

This discrepancy highlights the dynamic nature of share counts and the need for precise timing in ownership reports. Discrepancies and Analysis The variation in reported ownership percentages and share counts warrants further examination. For instance, if Blackrock owns 11.2 million shares and that represents 5%, the total shares outstanding should be 224 million, but MSTR’s December 29, 2024, filing shows 245 million. This suggests Blackrock’s filing might be based on Class A shares only, with 5% of 225,819,000 being approximately 11,290,950 shares, aligning closely with the 11.2 million reported.

Key Citations Key Points Direct Answer BlackRock’s ownership of MicroStrategy (MSTR) is estimated at around 11.2 million shares, based on the most recent data available as of early 2025. This figure comes from a Schedule 13G filing reported in February 2025, indicating a 5% ownership stake. However, due to potential changes in share counts and market dynamics, the exact number might vary slightly. It’s worth noting that MSTR’s total shares outstanding have increased significantly, which could impact ownership percentages over time. For context, MSTR is known for its business intelligence software and substantial Bitcoin investments, and BlackRock, a major asset manager, holds this stake as part of its investment strategy. If you’re looking for the latest updates, checking financial news or SEC filings closer to March 13, 2025, might provide more precise figures.

To contextualize, the total shares outstanding for MSTR is critical. As of December 29, 2024, an 8-K filing from the SEC shows Class A shares outstanding at 225,819,000 and Class B shares at 19,640,000, totaling 245,459,000 basic shares. This is a notable increase from September 30, 2024, when Class A shares were 183,003,980 and Class B shares were 19,640,250, totaling approximately 202,644,230 shares, indicating a net issuance of about 42.8 million new Class A shares in Q4 2024.

This suggests BlackRock’s filing might be based on Class A shares only, with 5% of 225,819,000 being approximately 11,290,950 shares, aligning closely with the 11.2 million reported.

For precise figures, investors should consult BlackRock’s latest 13F filing for Q4 2024, expected around February 14, 2025, and MSTR’s 2024 10-K filing for updated share counts.

Title: Trump Reportedly Directs Military To Draw Up Plans Increasing Panama Canal Troop Presence

President Donald Trump reportedly instructed the U.S. military to draw up plans to increase U.S. troop presence in the Panama Canal, NBC News reported Thursday. The U.S. Southern Command will allegedly consider several options, from further partnership with the Panamanian government all the way to a potential seizure of the canal, two officials with knowledge of the planning told NBC News. Trump reiterated his pledge to reclaim the canal in his joint address to congress Mar. 6, saying his administration would regain control of the vital shipping lane to “further enhance our national security.” “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others, but others could use it. But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure,” Trump said in his address. “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1, but that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” (RELATED: Biden-Appointed Judge Demands Pete Hegseth Retract Social Media Post About Trans Policy) A cargo ship transits through the Panama Canal Cocoli locks, in Cocoli near Panama City, on February 21, 2025. (Photo by MARTIN BERNETTI/AFP via Getty Images) The use of military force to take the canal would be unlikely, and would reportedly depend on whether or not the Panamanian military continues to cooperate with the U.S., according to the officials. Panamanian President Mulino has responded to Trump’s threats, saying that the canal “belongs to Panama and will continue to belong to Panama,” denying that it was a “concession or a gift from the United States.” During Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama Feb. 2, he made clear to Panama’s leaders that “the current position of influence and control of the Chinese Communist Party over the Panama Canal” was not acceptable. In response to the Trump administration’s pressure, Mulino said that Panama would not be renewing its agreement to participate in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China’s global infrastructure investment project, which the nation officially joined in 2017. China has increased their presence in the canal substantially since Carter passed the shipping route to Panama in 1977, with China’s Landbridge Group acquiring Panama’s largest Atlantic port, Margarita Island, for $900 million in 2016. Moreover, Panama gave a 25-year no-bid renewal to the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports to continue to operate two separate ports on the canal, covering both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. However, American investment firm Blackrock agreed to purchase the ports from the China-based firm on Mar. 5 for $22.8 billion. China has denied any foreign interference in the canal’s operation, saying the U.S. was using “coercion” to block Chinese projects in the canal, according to the Associated Press. The Pentagon, U.S. Southern Command and the Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Title: Ryan Breslow Settles Lawsuits After Returning As Bolt CEO: ‘I Made A Ton Of Mistakes’

ByIain Martin ByIain Martin , Forbes Staff. Bolt's Ryan Breslow is back as the CEO of the payment startup he cofounded after a string of legal disputes with investors were settled. Bolt cofounder Ryan Breslow is back. Three years after he stepped down as the CEO of the payment startup, Breslow has now been reinstated after years of board room disputes, lawsuits, a SEC probe, and a crumbling valuation that tumbled 97% from its $11 billion peak. “I’ve made a ton of mistakes and the last few years were a very humbling experience for me,” said Breslow, speaking on stage at the Fintech Meetup conference on Monday. “I'm a warrior, but the last three years challenged me to my breaking point and beyond.” Part of Breslow’s comeback plan included a controversial $450 million funding scheme, announced last August, in which investors faced a 48-hour ultimatum to match their earlier investment or face 70% of their shares effectively being wiped out. Some of Bolt’s largest investors, Blackrock, Hedosophia and Untitled, sued to block it. But the plan is now effectively dead. Bolt has settled the suit, and will pay $3 million to cover its investors' legal costs. A temporary restraining order imposed as part of the legal action has also been lifted. In his Monday speech, Breslow defended his 2021 decision to take a $30 million loan secured against his shares in Bolt. The Bolt cofounder claimed in the speech that the loan was meant to run until the startup’s IPO but the board decided to call in the loan after he stepped back as CEO in January 2022. A dispute over how the loan was meant to be repaid led to the money being swept from Bolt’s bank account, Breslow firing three investor board members, and a lawsuit from investor Activant pushing for Bolt to be repaid from Breslow’s own shares. Bolt paid Activant $37 million for its shares, and the same value of Breslow’s shares in the startup were cancelled, resolving both the loan and the long-running court case. Bolt did not provide additional comment beyond Breslow's statements “I wanted to show all of our investors that I’m keeping all my chips in…I did it to be all in on Bolt for the long run,” said Breslow. Breslow said he had learned some lessons from the crises that engulfed his Amazon-style one-click payments startup, once valued at over $11 billion. Bolt offered to buy back shares from its investors at just a $300 million valuation in February before unveiling a fundraising round in August that valued the startup at $14 billion. “We learned a lot through the last three years of what doesn't work,” said Breslow. “I think I've come out of the experience of the last three years with a couple probably PhDs in law and governance.” The 30 Under 30 alum credits Bolt’s new board with helping him to weather several rounds of layoffs, investor disputes and now resolved lawsuits with major customers like Authentic Brands Group and sportswear maker Fanatics. “We needed to make sure our board was all in and once we finally got that right we were able to withstand the challenges,” he said. After removing investors like Activant’s Steve Sarracino and Tribe Capital’s Arjun Sethi from Bolt’s board, Breslow hired several friends and associates like journalist Esther Wojcicki and crypto investor Brock Pierce, later replacing them with property developer Joel Schreiber. Court filings indicate that Bolt’s board is now made up of Schreiber, who is embroiled in a $100 million legal battle with real estate giant Starwood, and Breslow’s friend and music producer Larrance Dopson, and gaming entrepreneur Michael Carter. Bolt did not respond to a request to name its new board. “I didn't make the mistakes that I was accused of making, but I made plenty of other mistakes.” Bolt and Breslow have also churned through at least six major law firms over the last three years of legal battles. “You name a top law firm, there's a good chance we've hired them and even fired them or had them quit on us,” said Breslow. “Ultimately, we had to determine our own legal strategy…because of that, we were able to do things that a lot of law firms thought were impossible, find peace, find settlements, find outcomes that were really good.” Breslow was characteristically bullish on the prospect for Bolt now he is back at the helm, talking up deals with ecommerce website Revolve, Richemont Group and LVMH’s Benefit Cosmetics. He also pushed the idea of Bolt expanding from offering a one-click checkout service for retailers to pushing financial products, crypto and peer to peer payments to the 80 million shoppers who have made a purchase using its platform — a so-called “super app.” British banking startup Revolut, which was valued at a $45 billion in share sale in August, seems to be Breslow’s inspiration. But catching up with the London-based company, which generated $545 million profit on $2.2 billion of revenue in 2023, will take a lot of work from Bolt’s new CEO. Over the same period, Bolt recorded a $302 million loss on just $27 million of revenue.

Title: Trump White House has asked U.S. military to develop options for the Panama Canal, officials say

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — The White House has directed the U.S. military to draw up options to increase the American troop presence in Panama to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of “reclaiming” the Panama Canal, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning. In his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said that "to further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal.” Since then, administration officials have not said what "reclaiming" means. U.S. Southern Command is developing potential plans from partnering more closely with Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of U.S. troops’ seizing the Panama Canal by force, the officials said. Whether military force is used, the officials added, depends on how much Panamanian security forces agree to partner with the United States. The Trump administration’s goal is to increase the U.S. military presence in Panama to diminish China’s influence there, particularly access to the canal, the officials said. Panama and China deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama’s Constitution. Chinese officials have accused the United States of using "coercion" to pressure Panamanian officials to block Chinese aid projects. The U.S. officials told NBC News that the commander of U.S. Southern Command, Adm. Alvin Holsey, presented draft strategies to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week. Hegseth is expected to visit Panama next month. The officials cautioned that a U.S. invasion of Panama is unlikely and would come under serious consideration only if a larger American military presence in Panama does not achieve Trump’s goal of reclaiming the waterway, the officials said. Neither the Pentagon nor the Panamanian Embassy in Washington immediately responded to requests for comment. Trump has said he intends to return ownership of the canal to the United States after Panama gained control of the area more than a quarter-century ago under a treaty signed by the Carter administration. Privately, Trump has told his advisers that he sees a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself as critical to that effort, the U.S. officials said. Trump has also made it clear that he wants U.S. service members to be visible in the canal zone as a show of force. Trump administration officials have argued that China has too large a presence near the canal. In the event of a conflict, they say, Beijing could shut down the canal to American shipping, including military ships. During a visit to Panama last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino that “the status quo is unacceptable” regarding China’s presence in Panama. Mulino said the Panamanian government alone administers the canal and denied ceding operation of the canal to China in any way. After Panama declined to renew a key infrastructure agreement with China, Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that the projects were part of Beijing's Belt and Road development initiative and that China “firmly opposes the U.S. smearing and undermining the Belt and Road cooperation through means of pressure and coercion.” Last year, Army Gen. Laura Richardson, now retired, then the commander of Southern Command, testified to the House Armed Services Committee that China is "playing the long game." Richardson warned that Chinese government-backed economic development projects are "dual-use sites and facilities" that can be quickly flipped and used for military purposes. "The PRC messages its investments as peaceful, but in fact, many serve as points of future multi-domain access for the PLA and strategic naval choke points," she said, referring to the People's Republic of China and the People's Liberation Army. "In Panama, PRC-controlled state-owned enterprises, SOEs, continue to bid on projects related to the Panama Canal — a global strategic choke point.” The U.S. military has more than 200 troops in Panama, but the number fluctuates as troops rotate in and out, according to a defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Some of them include Special Forces units working with Panamanian forces to protect the country from internal threats, insurgencies or unrest. Potential administration strategies include simply ensuring that U.S. ships have safe passage through the canal to restoring total U.S. ownership and operation of it, officials said. Other options under consideration include using the U.S. military to secure existing ports in Panama, build new ports in Panama or use the Army Corps of Engineers to operate the canal’s locks, officials said. There are also discussions about opening Army Jungle Schools, or training camps, in Panama, like the ones where U.S. troops were trained in jungle warfare until the canal was formally handed over to Panama in 1999. Another focus of the ongoing planning is potentially positioning U.S. military forces near Panama in the event of a regional war or a threat to the United States. In that scenario, the U.S. military would aim to secure the canal and eliminate China’s access to it. American officials cautioned that the United States would block Chinese transit through the canal only in the event of war. The Panama Canal is one of the world’s busiest waterways, with the majority of the cargo that passes through it originating in the United States or heading to it. If the canal were blocked, ships would have to transit around South America, sharply increasing the cost and time of each voyage. The United States constructed the canal from 1904 to 1914 after a failed French effort. In 1977, after long-running protests by Panamanians, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty that turned control of the canal over to Panama. In 1989, during the George H.W. Bush administration, U.S. forces invaded Panama and ousted its leader, Manuel Noriega, who was later convicted of drug trafficking. In his joint address to Congress last week, Trump said the United States was already moving to limit Chinese presence in the canal. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” he said. The U.S. investment company BlackRock is part of a group buying a 90% stake in the Panama Ports Company, which operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal. The stake is being purchased from a Hong Kong-based firm, CK Hutchinson, for $22.8 billion.

This post was originally published on March 11 Bitcoin and crypto prices have moved sharply lower, following stock markets, as fears swirl the bitcoin price could be teetering on the verge of a major crash. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has dropped under $80,000 per bitcoin, dragging down the wider crypto market that’s now erased $1 trillion of value in just a month (even as bullish traders bet on a U.S. president Donald Trump “game-changer”). Now, as Elon Musk issues a surprise crypto price warning, the chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has warned Trump’s trade policies will stoke inflation—pouring cold water on hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates through 2025.

"I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic—and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me—that it’s going to have elevated inflation," BlackRock’s Larry Fink told CeraWeek conference attendees, it was reported by Reuters. 03/13 update: U.S. inflation has slowed to 2.8% in February from a year earlier, boosting the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates but failing to offset fears that U.S. president Donald Trump’s global tariff trade war will push up prices through 2025. The latest consumer price index (CPI) reading came in below January’s 3% and the 2.9% expected by economists, according to a Reuters poll. “Today’s lower-than-expected CPI should be bullish, signaling faster rate cuts, but crypto hasn’t reacted strongly," Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining, said in emailed comments. "Weeks of market fear require more than a single good print to regain confidence. The real issue is Trump’s aggressive tariffs, which risk making inflation stickier while also crashing markets and triggering layoffs, particularly by the Doge department of government efficiency. This puts the Fed in a bind: High inflation from tariffs makes rate cuts harder. Market crashes and job losses pressure the Fed to cut rates sooner. Cutting too early could reignite inflation, making future policy tougher. Stocks are bouncing back, but crypto remains sluggish. Investors want stronger support from the White House or Fed, especially after last week’s crypto summit failed to reassure markets. Until clearer signals emerge, fear and uncertainty will weigh on crypto market sentiment." Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs economists have upped their odds of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%, pointing to Trump’s economic policies as the “key risk." Yardeni Research economists have also raised their recession odds, increasing them from 20% to 35% due to "Trump 2.0’s head-spinning barrage of executives orders, firings, and tariffs." Last week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is in no rush to cut rates, with the labor market still strong and inflation on a bumpy path toward its 2% goal. The CME FedWatch Tool shows the market is heavily betting the Fed leaves rates on hold at its March meeting next week but is split over whether rates will be cut in May.

On Wednesday, the latest U.S. inflation data in the form of the consumer price index (CPI) will drop, with consumer prices expected to have ticked up in February, according to Bloomberg, highlighting the Fed’s slow progress on battling inflation and potentially raising the specter of stagflation—characterized by an economic slowdown coupled with spiraling price rises. "This market downturn is largely driven by broader economic concerns, including fears of a U.S. recession and persistent inflation," Sean Dawson, head of research at decentralized options trading platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “The market is facing significant challenges as the macroeconomic environment worsens, and crypto assets are no exception. With bearish sentiment building, traders are turning to downside hedging strategies, especially as volatility surges across both traditional and crypto markets. The coming weeks will be critical for assessing how the broader economic situation impacts digital asset prices and trading behavior."

In-kind redemptions and creations allow for the direct exchange of the underlying assets of the ETF (Bitcoin or Ethereum) for ETF shares, bypassing the need for cash. This method eliminates the need for participants to sell the underlying crypto to create shares, reducing the bid/ask spread and avoiding additional broker commissions. The proposal, published Thursday morning, pushes the boundaries of crypto ETFs in the U.S., opening new avenues for investors to tap into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) without holding the assets physically. As the SEC reviews Cboe’s proposed rule change, a public comment period has been opened, allowing stakeholders to share their thoughts before a final decision is made. Authorized participants—institutions involved in the creation and redemption process—will be eligible to use the in-kind transaction model, says the filing. Individual investors will still be required to use the cash-based model when purchasing or redeeming ETF shares. The Invesco Galaxy filing mirrors similar moves by major ETF providers, including BlackRock, which has recently sought approval for in-kind redemption mechanisms. In a related tweet, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart pointed out in January that in-kind creations and redemptions should help “streamline” the ETF market. Wow. Way too many questions and this stuff goes pretty deep in the weeds. So i'll keep it high level and answer "What does this mean?" Not all that much for individual retail investors. Mostly what it means is that ETFs should trade even more efficiently than they already do… pic.twitter.com/LWYsKmo5sH — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) January 24, 2025 The analyst explained that fewer steps and parties would be involved in the process, while sharing an image BlackRock reportedly used in a November 2023 SEC meeting to advocate for in-kind transactions for spot Bitcoin ETFs. “In my opinion the ETFs should have been allowed to do this from the get-go but the Dem SEC commissioners were against it,” Seyffart said. Last January, the SEC approved the Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF, making history as one of the first spot Bitcoin ETFs to be listed on a U.S. exchange. Following the approval of its Bitcoin counterpart, the SEC granted approval for the Invesco Galaxy Ethereum ETF in May of last year. Like the Bitcoin ETF, it holds Ethereum as the underlying asset and allows shares to be traded on a regulated exchange. Even so, both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have faced challenges in recent days. On Tuesday, Bitcoin ETFs experienced significant outflows, with $371 million withdrawn, marking the seventh consecutive day of withdrawals, according to data from UK-based investment management firm Farside Investors. Ethereum ETFs were similarly impacted, with outflows of $21.57 million, extending their streak to five days.

Title: DB news X account hack leads to 20% Trump memecoin pump and dump

DB asserts hardware-based two-factor authentication usage suggests potential X employee exploit. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On March 13, hackers seemingly took control of DB, a well-known crypto news platform, using its X account to spread false information about Donald Trump’s TRUMP memecoin and a fabricated BlackRock ETF filing for Hyperliquid. The misleading posts had an immediate impact. TRUMP’s price surged by 20% before quickly collapsing, while the fake ETF news caused a separate 6% price fluctuation for Hyperliquid’s HYPE token. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain revealed that a trader attempted to capitalize on the chaos by withdrawing 504,820 USDC from Binance to buy TRUMP tokens. However, after the truth emerged, the trader sold at a loss, losing $26,820 in USDC within minutes. Following the incident, DB deleted the unauthorized posts and advised users to ignore any information shared during the breach. This attack on DB’s account aligns with a pattern of recent breaches targeting high-profile crypto-related accounts on X. DB pointed out that its compromised account had no linked third-party apps, no API key leaks, and was protected by YubiKey two-factor authentication. This led the platform to suspect an internal vulnerability or a compromised X employee as the likely source of the breach. According to DB: “[We are] assuming a compromised X employee or similar, all keys and sessions have been reset regardless.” Considering this, web3 security platform Harpie noted similarities to previous attacks on Dogwifcoin, Solana-based Jupiter Exchange, and memecoin launchpad Pump.fun. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT suggested these hacks might stem from social engineering tactics aimed at X employees. He speculated that attackers might be manipulating the social media site staff with fraudulent documents or exploiting weaknesses in the platform’s internal controls. Meanwhile, the increasing frequency of these attacks raises concerns about the security of crypto-related accounts on X. Over the years, hackers have continued to exploit high-profile platforms to spread false information and deploy phishing schemes that have resulted in significant losses for crypto users.

Title: The Trump Regime’s Climate “Realism” Is Even Worse Than It Sounds
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/192678/trump-chris-wright-climate-realism
Time Published: 2025-03-13T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
In Houston this week, the leading lights of the global oil and gas industry have gathered to congratulate themselves. Buoyed by the Trump administration and the prospect of surging energy demand from AI, executives at CERAWeek by S&P Global hailed themselves as sober-minded pragmatists who’ve finally prevailed in the alleged war on their business model. “We’re seeing some reality come back in the conversation,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth told the crowd. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin H. Nasser similarly described the “inherent flaws in the current energy transition plan” whereby unnamed parties sought to “almost entirely” replace hydrocarbons “virtually overnight.” The future of energy, he added, “is not only about sustainability. Security and affordability must share the stage.” Fracking executive turned Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who calls himself a “climate realist,” echoed the sentiment and took it one step further in his remarks to the conference, describing climate change as simply the “side effect of building the modern world.” The cures for that, he argued—“the Biden administration’s irrational quasi-religious policies”—have been “far more destructive than the disease. There are no winners in that world except for politicians and rapidly growing interest groups.” The supposed “realism” being projected in Houston isn’t exactly novel. Fossil fuel executives and the politicians they donate to routinely describe themselves as the victims of some fantastical green plot. Despite the fact that U.S. executives enjoyed record profits and production during the Biden administration, they love to whine whenever Democrats are in charge and take a victory lap when Republicans kick them out. What’s novel about this round of self-serving oil and gas industry grandstanding is how much it aligns with the “realism” expressed by ostensibly more climate-conscious leaders. So-called investor-led alliances to align the financial sector behind climate goals have largely collapsed as bankers and asset managers follow the example of fossil fuel companies, which have walked back and reversed climate pledges. The Net-Zero Asset Managers Alliance suspended operations after its largest member—Blackrock—left earlier this year. The six largest U.S. banks (Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo) all opted to ditch the Net-Zero Banking Alliance in the lead-up to Inauguration Day. Billionaires Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates—who championed their climate philanthropy over the last several years—have warmed to Trump and stayed silent about his attacks on climate statutes. Breakthrough Energy, the climate group Gates funds, dramatically cut giving to climate groups and slashed dozens of staff in the U.S. and Europe. Europe’s push to boost defense spending in response to Trump needn’t necessarily come at the expense of climate priorities, but some politicians are certainly framing green priorities as indulgent luxury items that should take a backseat to rearmament. And governments that have preached fiscal restraint with regard to green spending are broadcasting a new willingness to open their pocketbooks for weapons. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s pitch for ramping up military spending included a rant against the bloc’s climate and environmental plans, blaming them for “prohibitively” high energy costs and limiting European competitiveness. Urging a ​​“full and very critical” review of all European Green Deal laws, Tusk warned in Brussels that Europe “cannot become a continent of naïve people and ideas. If we go bankrupt, no one will care about the natural environment in the world anymore.” After successive German governments warned that deficit spending on climate priorities would lead to financial ruin, the two parties likely to form its new coalition government, the CDU and SPD, announced their intention to loosen the country’s supposedly ironclad debt limit in order to accommodate new defense spending. Bloomberg reports that the Netherlands and Germany will redirect $2.5 billion and $1 billion in climate spending for poorer countries, respectively, toward defense priorities; Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland are considering similar plans. French President Emanuel Macron hopes to raise military spending from 2 percent to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product—about $32 billion more annually. The French government also just released its long-awaited plan to adapt to a world that’s four degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than preindustrial levels by 2100, well above the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal of limiting temperature rise to “well below” two degrees Celsius. Environment Minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher announced the country will spend just under $1.75 billion to prepare for a “realistic” level of warming that the government predicts will devastate its most important economic sectors, especially agriculture and tourism, and slash GDP by 13 percent. These European leaders and finance executives believe that climate change is a real and pressing threat. None would venture so far as to brag they don’t “do climate change crap,” as U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth boasted this week. But the paranoid, reactionary “realism” preached by oil and gas execs in Houston this week has plenty in common with the more genteel versions being peddled in Brussels and on Wall Street, where climate goals aren’t denounced so much as deprioritized in budgets and dropped from talking points. Oil and gas companies have long recognized the very prospect of an energy transition as an existential threat to their business model. They spent decades and fortunes on lobbying and disinformation efforts to deny the climate was changing at all and block any efforts that might impact their bottom lines. In the financial and, now, tech sector—where companies are angling to build out huge fleets of energy-intensive data centers for AI—there’s still plenty of money to be made from fossil fuels. These executives don’t have much reason to worry about the taps getting turned off, or even slowed. That’s because the governments that broadcast their flashy net-zero commitments when those things were fashionable have reached a more mundane conclusion, cemented by Trump’s election: Decarbonizing is too hard. The problem with this line of thinking ought to be immediately apparent to anyone with even a cursory familiarity with climate projections. The catastrophic effects of climate change outweigh the costs of addressing it in just about every model. No amount of shoulder shrugging is going to keep that bill from coming due. It isn’t “realistic” for governments, especially, to pretend that rising temperatures won’t wreck economies and displace millions in order to focus on other priorities, or to half-heartedly prepare for a world warmed by four degrees Celsius. It’s delusional. Kate Aronoff is a staff writer at The New Republic.

Title: TRUMP meme coin pumps, then dumps after fake utility news

Share this article The TRUMP meme coin saw a sudden 19% surge before plummeting after false reports circulated that it would have real-world utility. The digital asset jumped from $10.4 to $12.4 after DB, a prominent crypto news outlet, posted on X that the TRUMP token would “have real utility” on Thursday. The surge was short-lived as a follow-up post appeared approximately seven minutes later claiming the account had been compromised. The TRUMP token price fell to $10.8 following the statement. Initially, it was uncertain whether hackers or DB posted the second tweet. Ansem and others in the crypto community observed a grammatical error in the tweet, suggesting the security breach had yet to be resolved. Some X users reported that DB’s account also shared fake news that BlackRock had filed for a spot HYPE ETF. DB has since removed the unauthorized posts and issued a statement asking users to disregard messages posted during the security breach. The news outlet confirmed an investigation is in progress and will provide updates when available. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Sarah Healy on becoming European Indoor champion: ‘I knew people thought I was capable of a lot more’

Sarah Healy is sitting in a hotel room in Dubai, a glowing picture of health and confidence, and talking openly through some of the back pages of her running career. As if she was another athlete then, and very different from that now. She takes the Zoom call on a six-day stopover en route to Nanjing, where at the World Indoor Championships starting on Friday week, Healy hopes to add another medal to the gold she won on the European indoor stage in Apeldoorn last Sunday – that 3,000m victory at the age of 24 a liberation of sorts. By her own repeated admission, Healy had often buckled under the pressure of her own expectations, and those of others, losing focus in races right when it mattered most. Perhaps worse still she lost some of the enjoyment from the sport she first discovered at Blackrock AC in South Dublin at age nine. “I’ve always enjoyed it, always enjoyed training and everything,” she says. “I think it’s more having fun with competing that has been the problem. I’m not even sure if I’ve taken it too seriously, but I’ve also associated competing with some really big disappointments, and I think when you’re bringing that much emotion into it, it can make it more scary, because you know there’s this possibility that you’re going to be so devastated. “So I think this indoor season, I’ve kind of like just been reminding myself that it’s not such a be all, end all thing. And remind myself that I’m going to be okay no matter what happens. And then that in turn just makes it less nerve-wracking, or less pressurising, because it just doesn’t feel as daunting that way. “I suppose it’s just trying to appreciate where you are, realising how lucky I am to get to do this, to travel around and race as a job. That is really cool, so just enjoying the competing aspect a little bit more, and obviously it brings out better performances.” This sort of thing can happen to any athlete, only for Healy, given her exceptional underage success which included a European under-18 1,500m/3,000m double in 2018, any growing pains entering the senior ranks were certainly magnified. The 2022 European Championships in Munich, for example, where she bombed out in her 1,500m heat after running a world-class 4:02.86 earlier that summer, taking three seconds off Sonia O’Sullivan’s Irish under-23 record set 31 years previously in Monaco. Healy mentions several critical turning points since then, bringing her to where she is now. It started with her move to Manchester in late 2023 to train with husband-and-wife coaching team of Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, whose M11 group includes Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic 800m champion in Paris. “Just because that was a really hard decision to make, and quite a big thing to do,” she says. “And then I think it also kind of represented me sort of becoming a full-time athlete, and really just kind of going all in on athletics. So I took confidence in the fact I was able to get through that and make a home for myself over there. “Then of course it was obviously a turning point just in terms of having a team and training group, which has physically, obviously, pushed me on so much. “Then I think the other major turning point would be the Olympics last year, and kind of just the aftermath of that [she finished fourth in the Paris repechage, one place short of the semi-final]. But I think after some time, I managed to turn that experience into a bit of a lesson, or a big lesson, and this indoor season really changed the way I was approaching things, based off that.” Moving to Manchester also afforded her the first-hand experience of living and training alongside Hodgkinson and Georgia Hunter Bell, who won the Olympic, 1,500m bronze in Paris. “When you think of someone like her [Keely], who’s just been such a prodigy and an Olympic champion, you feel like they probably wouldn’t be a normal person and do normal things, but Keely is a similar age to me and is just like a friend now, and so it kind of normalises that as well. “She’s training really, really hard but at the same time, I think both with her and Georgia that they have something special in their mindset as well. And I think in Paris last year, Keely just had that mindset. And the same with Georgia, she just thinks, ‘no, there’s no reason I can’t come in here and be one of the best’. Obviously, they’re both physically extremely talented as well, but you need that mindset too.” [ Sarah Healy, Mark English and Kate O’Connor to chase more medals at World Indoor ChampionshipsOpens in new window ] Comparisons with O’Sullivan may continue for a while yet – O’Sullivan won a World Indoor 3,000m silver back in 1997 – but Healy views those things differently now. “I think when people would say things like that, I definitely never got carried away and thought, ‘oh, I’m going to be amazing just because I’ve done these things as a junior’. “It’s just been the last few years, as a senior athlete, I underperformed a good number of times at major championships. Because it happened so many times, I definitely felt a bit of pressure to perform, because I knew people thought I was capable of a lot more than what I was doing. “I think another thing that has helped my performances recently has been really just focusing on myself. At the end of the day, no one really cares too much what I do, apart from myself. I think worrying about other people, what they think, is definitely not helpful.” Ian O'Riordan is an Irish Times sports journalist writing on athletics Latest news from the world of sport, along with the best in opinion from our outstanding team of sports writers © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Jamie Dimon changes tune on tariffs: ‘Uncertainty is not a good thing’ | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Two months ago, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had a curt message for people protesting President Donald Trump’s tariff policy: “Get over it.” But with stock markets lower and cracks appearing to form in the US economy, Dimon himself might not be over it. “I don’t think the average American consumer who wakes up in the morning and goes to work… changes what they’re going to do because they read about tariffs,” Dimon said in an interview with Semafor on Wednesday. “But I do think companies might,” he added. “Uncertainty is not a good thing.” Dimon appeared to shift his focus on tariffs after the CEO of America’s largest bank said to “get over it,” when discussing tariffs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said they could be “an economic tool” or “an economic weapon” to promote fair trade, depending how they’re used. “I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it,” Dimon said in an interview with CNBC at the time. “National security trumps a little bit more inflation,” he added. Since then, Trump’s on-and-off tariff policy has caused volatility in the stock market. Although broader markets rebounded on Wednesday, the S&P 500 was still down more than 7% over one month. On Wednesday, Trump imposed sweeping 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imported into the United States — the latest round of tariffs in a global trade war — with Canada and the European Union swiftly retaliating. He has said his goal is to revitalize American manufacturing, slow illegal immigration and end fentanyl smuggling, but economists have warned that broad-based tariffs threaten to drive up prices on everything from food to new homes. Dimon wasn’t the only CEO sounding off on Wednesday about the risks of tariffs. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said he believed the economy was weakening due to tariffs. “The collective impact in the short run is that people are pausing, they’re pulling back,” Fink told CNN’s Kayla Tausche in an exclusive interview. “Talking to CEOs throughout the economy, I hear that the economy is weakening as we speak.” Still, Fink said the Trump administration’s policies, including tariffs, could be beneficial to the United States in the long run. “Right now the president is focusing on tariffs, but when he talks about reciprocal tariffs, actually, that may bring down tariffs over the long run,” Fink said, adding that he remains bullish on America in the long term.

Title: First, World Leaders Complain, Then They Do What Trump Wants

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/12/2025 5:04:04 PM PDT by bimboeruption Even before Trump took office, he began laying out a long list of demands for both U.S. allies and adversaries—demands he believed would ultimately benefit American taxpayers. Despite facing resistance, with many critics calling him “Hitler,” the world is slowly falling in line with his requests. Canada backed down from an energy export surcharge threatened against the U.S., Mexico rounded up cartel members and handed them over to U.S. authorities, Zelensky agreed to a ceasefire, and Europe is ramping up its defense spending, assuming the financial responsibility for Ukraine’s defense. Panama withdrew from the Belt and Road Initiative and then sold key assets to BlackRock, effectively neutralizing the Chinese threat to the Panama Canal. Canada’s Retreat from Export Surcharge: Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced that he was suspending the 25% surcharge on electricity exports to the U.S., which had been imposed earlier that week. This decision followed a conversation with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, during which they agreed to meet in Washington to discuss a renewed United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement ahead of President Trump’s April 2 tariff deadline While Canada is matching U.S. tariffs dollar for dollar, it has also agreed to a $1.3 billion investment in enhancing border security. This includes joint efforts with U.S. authorities to combat transnational criminal activities, particularly fentanyl trafficking. Mexico’s Cooperation on Cartel Crackdown: The Mexican government conducted a large-scale operation to round up cartel members, directly handing over key figures to U.S. authorities for prosecution. This move came after considerable pressure from Washington, where Trump demanded that Mexico take a stronger stance on drug cartels and border security. Mexico’s actions were perceived as a necessary step to maintain diplomatic ties with the U.S. and avoid any re-escalation of trade barriers or tariffs. Ukraine’s Agreement to a Ceasefire: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, a move strongly supported by the United States. Trump had advocated for a ceasefire to push both Ukraine and Russia toward negotiations. Despite initial resistance from Ukrainian leadership to compromise on territorial issues, Zelenskyy ultimately agreed, seeing the potential benefits in securing continued U.S. military and financial support. Europe’s Increased Defense Spending: European military and political leaders are holding high-level talks this week to discuss rearming the continent and increasing aid for Ukraine, amid concerns over a less engaged United States. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasized the urgency of fortifying Europe’s security, noting that Europe can no longer rely on U.S. protection. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years. Europe Assuming Ukraine Defense Responsibility: France’s President Emmanuel Macron took decisive steps toward forming a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Macron’s meeting in Paris with military leaders from over 30 nations, including European countries, Japan, and Canada. While the media may frame this as either a win for globalism or a loss of power for the U.S., Europe is essentially doing what Trump has advocated for all along: he wants America out of Ukraine and expects Europe to address its own security concerns—something it has neglected to do for the past 80 years. Panama’s Withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative: In 2025, Panama has withdrawn from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which had initially been signed in 2017 under pressure from Beijing. This decision was influenced by U.S. demands for countries to limit Chinese influence in critical infrastructure, particularly concerning strategic assets like the Panama Canal. Panama also reached an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its largest ports to BlackRock, an American investment firm. This sale further aligns Panama with U.S. interests, as it reduces China’s presence and strengthens the U.S. economic influence in the region. The move was seen as a direct response to Trump’s call for Latin American nations to reduce reliance on China and prioritize U.S. partnerships, reflecting Panama’s compliance with U.S. demands to safeguard the Panama Canal from Chinese control. The international response to President Trump’s demands highlights a trend where countries, after initial resistance or criticism, eventually agree to ‘America First.

This includes joint efforts with U.S. authorities to combat transnational criminal activities, particularly fentanyl trafficking. Mexico’s Cooperation on Cartel Crackdown: The Mexican government conducted a large-scale operation to round up cartel members, directly handing over key figures to U.S. authorities for prosecution. This move came after considerable pressure from Washington, where Trump demanded that Mexico take a stronger stance on drug cartels and border security. Mexico’s actions were perceived as a necessary step to maintain diplomatic ties with the U.S. and avoid any re-escalation of trade barriers or tariffs. Ukraine’s Agreement to a Ceasefire: President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to a 30-day ceasefire with Russia, a move strongly supported by the United States. Trump had advocated for a ceasefire to push both Ukraine and Russia toward negotiations. Despite initial resistance from Ukrainian leadership to compromise on territorial issues, Zelenskyy ultimately agreed, seeing the potential benefits in securing continued U.S. military and financial support. Europe’s Increased Defense Spending: European military and political leaders are holding high-level talks this week to discuss rearming the continent and increasing aid for Ukraine, amid concerns over a less engaged United States. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans emphasized the urgency of fortifying Europe’s security, noting that Europe can no longer rely on U.S. protection. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a significant boost in defense spending, proposing an $873 billion plan to rearm Europe and support Ukraine, including relaxing fiscal rules and increasing defense spending by 1.5% of GDP annually for the next four years. Europe Assuming Ukraine Defense Responsibility: France’s President Emmanuel Macron took decisive steps toward forming a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine. Macron’s meeting in Paris with military leaders from over 30 nations, including European countries, Japan, and Canada. While the media may frame this as either a win for globalism or a loss of power for the U.S., Europe is essentially doing what Trump has advocated for all along: he wants America out of Ukraine and expects Europe to address its own security concerns—something it has neglected to do for the past 80 years. Panama’s Withdrawal from the Belt and Road Initiative: In 2025, Panama has withdrawn from China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which had initially been signed in 2017 under pressure from Beijing. This decision was influenced by U.S. demands for countries to limit Chinese influence in critical infrastructure, particularly concerning strategic assets like the Panama Canal. Panama also reached an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its largest ports to BlackRock, an American investment firm. This sale further aligns Panama with U.S. interests, as it reduces China’s presence and strengthens the U.S. economic influence in the region. The move was seen as a direct response to Trump’s call for Latin American nations to reduce reliance on China and prioritize U.S. partnerships, reflecting Panama’s compliance with U.S. demands to safeguard the Panama Canal from Chinese control. The international response to President Trump’s demands highlights a trend where countries, after initial resistance or criticism, eventually agree to ‘America First.

The Atlanta Hawks recently celebrated Women’s History Month with their annual Women’s Empowerment Night presented by BMW, recognizing women in leadership, business, and sports at State Farm Arena, and we got a double dribble of all the deets. The evening featured a special graduation ceremony for the SheLEADS Class of 2025, a halftime performance from Shamea Morton dedicated to women’s empowerment, and a star-studded lineup of speakers and honorees.

Entering State Farm Arena alone as media, I was guided through the media entrance, passing through tunnels beneath the bleachers where athletes prepare for the game. Security personnel, trainers, and physical therapists moved efficiently, ensuring everything was in place before tip-off. I was escorted to the event through the VIP elevators and hallways by Tai McDonald from the Atlanta Hawks Communications team. She led the way to the SheLEADS graduation room, which was filled with the program’s participants and their supporters, preparing to celebrate their achievements.

The SheLEADS Class of 2025 celebrated the completion of its eight-month leadership development program, which supports early-career women in business, sports, entrepreneurship, and STEAM fields. The wonderful host keeping up the energy of the night was media maven MiAsia Symone, Radio Host of Atlanta’s #1 Hip-Hop station Hot 107.9. The program, powered by BMW and the Atlanta Hawks, was designed to address key barriers preventing women from advancing in leadership roles. Source: Lauryn Bass According to Alexis Roe, VP of DEI Impact & Strategic Initiatives at the Atlanta Hawks, who served as the program’s moderator, the eight-month structure was intentional. “I was a part of Lead Atlanta and a number of other leadership development programs and the reality is: after one work day you’re not going to learn all the things, right? So what we really did was curate an experience. We looked at all the women in the workplace and studied key things that women struggle with. At the time, women in Georgia ranked number forty-nine in the country for ‘Women’s Empowerment,’ which is women’s access to healthcare and education. We couldn’t understand why, out of all the amazing women in Georgia, they were not able to climb and rise into leadership and economic mobility.” Alexis Roe & Lauryn Bass/ Source: Lauryn Bass The night featured a keynote address from Margaret Lane, Executive Vice President of Talent & Development at Penske Automotive Group, as well as a panel discussion titled, “Navigating the Path to Leadership: Wisdom and Tactics from Trailblazing Women.” Source: Lauryn Bass Lane emphasized how impactful a program like this would have been for her as a young professional. “I would’ve given anything for something like this. The young people [in] this program, I have no doubt that in the future they are going to be fabulous. I have a lot of confidence in them, and I am so excited.” With DEI programs facing challenges nationwide, Lane also spoke on the importance of continued investment in initiatives like SheLEADS. “I’m hoping so! No matter what you are, what acronym you use, or who you call yourself to be—it’s the inclusivity that’s so important. Why wouldn’t you want to be? The Atlanta Hawks and the Atlanta-area BMW Centers have done such an incredible job supporting this.” For the graduates, the impact of SheLEADS extended beyond professional development—it fostered a sense of belonging and confidence. Source: Lauryn Bass Teevyah Yuva Raju, business strategist and COO Team at BlackRock, shared her excitement about completing the program. “I feel incredible—for myself and my fellow SheLeaders! We learned a lot and I can’t wait to see all of us grow in the upcoming years.” When asked what SheLEADS offered that only participants would understand, she highlighted a common struggle for women in leadership. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is to overcome imposter syndrome. A lot of the women who are SheLeads sisters to me are in incredible positions. They’ve taught us that every position that we are in is well-deserved and that we’re going to continue to grow because we deserve it. We deserve where we’re at and we deserve where we’re going.” For Meag Taylor, founder of WomenInRadio and digital content producer at The Steve Harvey Morning Show, SheLEADS wasn’t just about professional growth—it provided genuine friendships and support. “SheLEADS is the best decision I made since moving to Atlanta in 2020. I am so happy to have been accepted into the program. The quality of women I have met and gained as friends is just amazing. We really support each other in real life, and oftentimes, that’s hard to find.” Janna Pruiett, Customer Success Manager at Omnissa, echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the invaluable community and confidence-building she gained. “Being part of the SheLEADS program was an incredibly empowering experience! I loved connecting with so many dynamic women from different industries, each with unique insights and inspiring stories. The program provided an invaluable space for learning, growth, and collaboration, and I left feeling more motivated than ever. The Atlanta Hawks and State Farm Arena truly created a community where women can thrive, and I’m grateful to have been a part of it!” You could feel the energy in the room from the testimonies, trophies, champagne toasts and gift baskets. This was a space where women were giving back to each other, and it spoke volumes. This truly was a celebration that fell on the perfect night of the year, #InternationalWomensDay!

Throughout the evening, the ATL Hawks continued to give tribute to women who inspire the world every day. Play The ATL Dancers also performed a special routine featuring women from the Hawks’ corporate team, reinforcing the organization’s commitment to diversity both on and off the court. There was even an interactive cartoon race between three cars—two male and one female—for children to engage with during the night. Though the male cars played dirty to win, the female car kept her energy and stayed on her path to victory. The crowd was able to cheer her onto victory, and to recognize that even the smallest things can impact children in their game seats. Women’s Empowerment Night was more than a themed game—it was a testament to the Hawks’ and BMW’s commitment to investing in women. What a perfect game to win against the Pacers. Curtis Snyder, BMW’s Southern Region Marketing Manager, reinforced why programs like this matter. “At BMW, we believe in the power of women—our daughters, mothers, and partners—to inspire change, break barriers, and lead with confidence.” There was everything to gain this night! With SheLEADS continuing to grow, the event showcased the success of women already making waves in their industries while setting the stage for the next generation of leaders. Oui Love To See It!

Title: AI to fuel bumper year for M&A in US power sector

Business FILE PHOTO: A new Facebook data center is under construction in Eagle Mountain, Utah, U.S., May 14, 2019. Picture taken on May 14, 2019. REUTERS/George Frey/File photo Dealmakers expect 2025 to be a bumper year for mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. power industry, with a voracious appetite for assets as the sector gears up to meet massive demand growth from data centers for artificial intelligence. Record power demand and dizzying projections for electricity consumption for AI have made power generation and infrastructure assets, and companies which own them, attractive to energy companies, private equity and other institutional investors. The biggest growth in the sector in generations has already fueled a deal bonanza in the first months of the year, according to a dozen industry and financial sources who spoke to Reuters. The sources included several attendees at the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. In January and February, there were 27 U.S. power deals worth a combined $36.4 billion, headlined by Constellation Energy's $16.4 billion acquisition of Calpine. This surpasses, both by value and volume, the first two months of every year barring one during the last 20 years, according to data from LSEG. Busy power sector deal-making is in contrast to the overall market for M&A, which recorded its weakest start since the global financial crisis, amid market volatility and uncertainty over the Trump administration's policies and what they mean for the economy. U.S. President Donald Trump has declared an energy emergency to facilitate the build out in the power sector, calling it "an immediate and pressing priority for the protection of the United States' national and economic security." Opportunities are significant and stretch across the power sector, said Kathleen Lawler, managing director at investment firm KKR. "I don't think we have ever been busier," said Lawler. KKR and Canadian pension fund PSP Investments agreed in January to buy a 20 per cent stake in some of American Electric Power's transmission network for $2.8 billion. DEMAND Strong price increases have boosted power companies' shares, meaning they can do bigger transactions or give up less of the company to clinch a stock-fueled deal. Even with stock market falls in recent days, independent power producers Vistra, Constellation and NRG Energy are trading between 82 per cent and 220 per cent higher than the start of 2024. Potential acquirers may be emboldened too by the reaction of Constellation investors to the Calpine deal. Constellation's share price rallied 25 per cent on the day of the announcement - when typically buyers trade lower when announcing a large deal funded by the issuance of shares to the seller. That is because the share issuance dilutes existing shareholder positions. Private equity firms, pension and infrastructure funds have in recent years raised huge sums for energy investments. The total capital raised but still waiting to be deployed, known as dry powder, into infrastructure investments at the end of 2024 was $334 billion, according to data provider Preqin. Ways this cash could be invested include buying stakes in companies pioneering developing technology, and acquiring businesses that service existing energy infrastructure. David Foley, global head of Blackstone Energy Transition Partners, told a panel discussion at CERAWeek the booming power market has created "opportunities for investment in equipment manufacturing, the picks-and-shovels types of companies." It could also be used to take listed power companies private. The year has already seen Altus Power, one of the largest owners of U.S. commercial-scale solar plants, agree a $2.2 billion sale to TPG's climate investment arm. Reasons to go private differ, depending on the type of power company. Smaller utilities may struggle to compete for contracts with technology companies building and operating data centers, so being owned by a large investment firm could help challenge larger peers. Long-term institutional investors could offer higher valuations than public markets, especially for renewable power companies. These firms have seen their share prices slump since the election of Trump, who has called for fossil fuels to be prioritized at the expense of green energy. "The market could see more (utility) take-privates over the next few years as there is significant infrastructure capital that has been formed in recent years that is highly focused on this asset class," said Greg Hort, managing director at Lazard. Another source of deal flow will be utilities continuing to offload business units, or stakes in them, to help fund huge expansion of power infrastructure to support heightened demand, the people said. On top of the AEP deal with KKR and PSP, Eversource Energy said January 27 it had agreed to divest its Aquarion Water unit for $2.4 billion, and National Grid announced on February 24 it would offload its U.S. renewables business to Brookfield Asset Management. The deal fervor is also allowing buyout firms who own power assets to exit profitably. This includes small portfolios of power generation, or individual power plants, which in recent years saw limited buyer attention due to their size. Particularly sought-after are natural gas plants constructed in the last decade, which are more efficient and were built when U.S. power demand was in its 20-year plateau. Relative scarcity was part of the rationale behind the purchase in January by Blackstone's energy transition arm of Potomac Energy Center from Ares Management. "Many private equity firms, which took ownership of their assets three to five years ago, will be seeking liquidity events," said Hill Vaden, executive director of energy capital insights at S&P Global. OVERCOMING HURDLES The momentum behind power dealmaking will endure despite market ructions, as the uncertainty only makes existing assets more prized, the sources said. While Trump's economic agenda is expected to make it easier for energy projects to secure necessary permits, key components are still hard to source, with the wait for turbines for a natural gas power plant stretching out towards the end of the decade. The president's tariffs on materials critical to the power sector will likely push up costs. This includes steel and aluminum, and potentially copper, whose conductivity makes it essential in a host of products. Uncertainty around whether tax credits for renewable projects, including those introduced in the Inflation Reduction Act, will be scrapped is also casting a shadow on new clean energy generation. Reverberations from immigration reform, which threatens to deport millions of non-citizens, will also weigh on constructing new projects. "I've even told members of the Trump team that we're going to run out of electricians as we build out data centers," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said at the CERAWeek conference, when asked about the impact of deportations on the U.S. economy.
