Title: BTC vs ETH ETFs: Why investors are favoring Bitcoin right now

BTC and ETH ETFs reveal contrasting trends this week, with Bitcoin spot ETFs leading inflows and Ethereum ETFs facing a net outflow. Investor interest in crypto-focused ETFs has taken center stage as Bitcoin[BTC] and Ethereum[ETH] show contrasting trends in fund flows. While Bitcoin spot ETFs enjoy significant inflows, Ethereum ETFs grapple with notable outflows. This divergence reveals shifting investor sentiment and raises critical questions about the factors driving these dynamics. Bitcoin spot ETFs saw remarkable inflows of $307 million last week on the 6th of January, reflecting heightened investor confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF emerged as the standout performer, pulling in $498 million. This strong performance highlights the growing appeal of Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, particularly as macroeconomic uncertainties persist. However, not all Bitcoin ETFs shared this positive momentum. The Ark & 21 Shares ARKB ETF experienced a net outflow of $202 million, indicating that while institutional inflows drive the overall trend, some funds face challenges in retaining capital. Analysis of the chart illustrates the consistent rise in Bitcoin ETF inflows, showcasing BlackRock’s pivotal role in steering the market. Source: Sosovalue In sharp contrast to Bitcoin’s success, Ethereum ETFs recorded a net outflow of $186 million over the same period. This marks a continuation of Ethereum’s recent struggles to attract investor interest. Despite this, BlackRock’s ETHA ETF managed to buck the trend, achieving a modest net inflow of $124 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FETH ETF faced substantial outflows, totaling $276 million, further underscoring Ethereum’s challenges. ETH ETF flow chart analysis highlights this disparity, with inflows waning since late 2024. Concerns around staking risks, Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi, and competitive pressures from other layer-1 networks could be contributing to this decline in sentiment. The data paints a picture of investors reassessing Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Source: Sosovalue The divergence in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows offers valuable insights into investor psychology and market dynamics. Bitcoin’s ability to consistently attract capital signals its growing reputation as a safe-haven asset. Institutional confidence, spearheaded by major players like BlackRock, reinforces this narrative. On the other hand, Ethereum’s performance raises questions about its future. Although it remains the second-largest crypto asset, it has struggled to keep up with BTC, and there is growing competition. As Bitcoin solidifies its position, Ethereum faces mounting pressure to address these concerns and regain its footing. These BTC and ETH ETF trends are not just numbers; they reflect broader market shifts. Bitcoin’s strong inflows highlight its potential to serve as a hedge against volatility, capturing both institutional and retail attention. For Ethereum, the outflows suggest a need for clearer narratives to build confidence as a viable alternative asset class. BlackRock’s dominance in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets underscores the growing influence of traditional financial institutions in the crypto space. This trend signals a maturing market but also raises questions about the decentralization ethos that has long defined cryptocurrencies. – Read Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025-26 The latest ETF data highlights a tale of two cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s strong inflows reaffirm its position as the dominant force in the market, while Ethereum’s struggles emphasize the challenges it faces in maintaining investor confidence. As crypto evolves, ETF flows will remain a critical barometer of sentiment and a guide to understanding the shifting landscape.

BlackRock also advocated Bitcoin exposure through its spot ETF, IBIT, as it deems direct exposure complex for many. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s (BTC) adoption is outpacing the transformative technologies of the past, including the internet and mobile phones, according to a recent report by BlackRock. The document highlighted that since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has quickly evolved from a niche innovation to a globally recognized asset. It attributed the evolution to demographic trends, economic shifts, and the ongoing digital transformation of finance. Younger generations, often referred to as “digital natives,” are significantly more inclined to embrace Bitcoin compared to Gen X and Baby Boomers. Their comfort with technology and preference for digital-first solutions have positioned them as the leading demographic in crypto adoption. Regarding economic shifts, trends such as rising inflation, geopolitical tensions, and concerns over traditional banking systems have highlighted Bitcoin’s value as a decentralized asset. It added that, in uncertain times, Bitcoin’s independence from central authorities has resonated with investors worldwide. The third driver is the maturation of digital asset infrastructure, which has lowered Bitcoin’s barriers to entry while creating new use cases. As the global economy digitizes, BTC is becoming integral to the evolving financial landscape. The document also advocates using BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, to gain exposure to BTC. The asset manager argued that while Bitcoin’s adoption grows, direct investment in BTC remains complex for many. IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with nearly $38 billion in inflows, based on Farside Investors’ data. It holds over $50 billion in assets under management and was the largest ETF launched in 2024. Notably, BlackRock launched a new Bitcoin ETF in Cboe Canada on Jan. 13, which will be denominated in Canadian dollars and trade under the same IBIT ticker. Meanwhile, the US dollar-denominated units will trade under the symbol IBIT.U. The ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci praised BlackRock’s efforts to drive Bitcoin adoption via ETFs. He also criticized Vanguard, the second-largest asset manager by assets under management, which has taken a completely opposite approach to Bitcoin. Meanwhile, independent analyst Sam Callahan highlighted that Paragon Advisors disclosed a $21.7 million allocation to IBIT in their 13F Form for last year’s fourth quarter. Paragon has $292 million in assets under management, with IBIT comprising nearly 7.5% of its portfolio, the largest allocation. Callahan said the market did not price registered investment advisers increasing Bitcoin exposure in their portfolios.

The Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to negate their portfolio’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner — suspended activities after investment firm BlackRock announced its departure from the group, according to a press release. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, announced its exit from NZAM Thursday, with its vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand saying the firm’s involvement in the environmental coalition “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” Now, NZAM has pressed pause altogether, halting operations while it conducts a review of its activities, an NZAM press release published Monday stated. (RELATED: UN Reportedly Moves To Unlock Tens Of Millions In Climate Funding For Country Run By Terrorists) JUST IN: The UN-backed Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) group has announced that it will be shutting down completely, following @BlackRock‘s departure. pic.twitter.com/o5htgvFEiH — Will Hild (@WillHild) January 13, 2025 A slew of other financial services had left NZAM prior to BlackRock’s Thursday exit, including Goldman Sachs Group, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. BlackRock’s exit came amid a broader corporate strategy shift away from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, with the firm only supporting about 4% of the 493 environmental and social investment proposals shareholders put forward between the end of June 2023 and the end of June 2024, down from a rate of 47% in 2021. BlackRock was a major supporter of ESG investing in years prior, with CEO Larry Fink claiming in 2020 that “climate risk is investment risk” and that climate change would lead to a “fundamental reallocation of capital.” “The destruction of NZAM is a huge win for consumers,” Will Hild, executive director of conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Although there is a lot of work left to be done, what was effectively a cartel of asset managers has finally ceased taking the focus of businesses off of consumers, raising prices for everyday Americans everywhere from the gas pump to the grocery store.” When reached for comment, NZAM referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to its press release.

Title: Net Zero asset managers suspend operations in wake of BlackRock’s departure

A global coalition of asset managers set up to meet net-zero goals has suspended its operations after the departure of its largest member, BlackRock Inc., in the latest retreat from concerted climate action in the finance sector. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, or NZAMI, said on Monday it launched a review to determine whether the group “remains fit for purpose in the new global context.” That context is marked by pushback against corporate environmental, social and governance programs that has intensified with the political shift to the right, especially in the United States, along with antitrust concerns. The group, which has more than 325 signatories with a total of US$57.5-trillion of assets under management, will halt its activities while it tracks climate-related implementation and reporting among its remaining members. It also removed its commitment statement and list of signatories from its website, it said in an unsigned statement. Last week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said it was leaving the NZAMI because its membership created confusion about its business practices and prompted “legal inquiries” from public officials. It said the move did not change the way it managed funds, and that its portfolio managers still assess climate risks. The NZAMI said it was disappointed by the move but that it respected the decisions its signatories make. NZAMI’s suspension follows a mass exodus of U.S. banks from its sister organization, the Net Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, raising questions about its future. Last week, JP Morgan Chase & Co. quit that organization, after the exits of Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. since the beginning of December. Each said its decision to leave the group did not mean it was abandoning its net-zero goals or efforts to help clients meet their emission-reduction targets. Canada’s Big Six banks remain members of the alliance, but the CEOs of Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal said at a conference last week that the NZBA may not be the most effective tool to encourage climate change efforts at major financial institutions. Companies still need to manage climate risks and prepare for a lower-carbon economy, but worldwide organizations may not be the best way to accomplish that given differing situations in various jurisdictions, said Baltej Sidhu, an analyst at National Bank Financial. “A large portion of this is going to be actuated toward litigation concerns, and also the politicization of the theme of ESG in the U.S.,” Mr. Sidhu said. BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink had been at the forefront of integrating climate risks and decarbonization targets into its investing activities, but in recent years has backed off prioritizing the fight against climate change in his public messaging. In November, Texas Attorney-General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group, accusing the major institutional investors of constricting the fossil fuel industry through “anticompetitive trade practices” by buying up shares and pushing green-energy goals. The fund managers have called the charges baseless. Vanguard quit NZAMI two years ago. The sector-specific alliances exist under an umbrella called Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was unveiled with fanfare at the United Nations climate summit in 2021 as excitement over the potential for the might of the finance industry being directed at climate action crescendoed. Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor – and potential federal Liberal leadership hopeful – Mark Carney, and Michael Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg L.P. and a former mayor of New York, are co-chairs.

Title: Chile Sidesteps Renewables Profit Grab in Advancing Subsidy Bill

(Bloomberg) -- Chile’s lower house approved a bill to expand electricity subsidies for lower-income families after stripping out a measure that would have raised part of the funds required by curbing profits in a segment of the renewable energy industry. The measure, which sought to alter a pricing mechanism for small electricity generators known as pequeños medios de generación distribuida, or PMGDs, was rejected Monday by a vote of 60 against versus 59 in favor. The remainder of the bill was approved 97 to 25. To be sure, the government can still restore the measure when the legislation moves up to the Senate. President Gabriel Boric’s government expects to collect $200 million per year through the measure in a bid to help lower-income households cope with rising electricity prices. Power tariffs, which had been held down since a wave of social unrest in 2019, have now begun increasing gradually. “This bill allows for immediate aid with measures that have an effect,” Energy Minister Diego Pardow said during the debate in congress. “There will be no significant changes in the way the industry works.” The controversial legislation has riled PMGD investors, who argue it contravenes Chilean law by weakening incentives meant to diversify the energy sector that were supposed to last for another decade. While some say these small, mainly solar plants have saturated the market and increased costs for the overall system, the proposed change to the rules has put a chill on investment in a country known as business-friendly. Boric’s bill contains two other funding sources. One is an additional transitory tax on carbon emissions and the other takes advantage of extra revenue from a value-added tax due to higher electricity prices. The legislation still needs to be reviewed by the Senate, where opposition to garnishing the profits of small renewable generators is expected to be stiffer should it decide to push forward. Pardo told Bloomberg news in November that he would be willing to withdraw the PMGD measure to guarantee approval of the other two funding pillars, should it fail to win sufficient support. Were that to happen, the government pledged to review the rules for small electricity generators at a later date. The PMGD system, which offer generators stable prices and therefore protection from bottlenecks and cost distortions from transmission congestion and storage shortfalls, has attracted billions of dollars in investment from companies backed by BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Title: Elon Musk says a third patient got a Neuralink brain implant. The work is part of a booming field

By LAURA UNGARElon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines.“We’ve got … three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X.Related Articles Nation | Biden announces 2 new national monuments in California after wildfires scuttled previous event Nation | SEC sues Elon Musk, saying he didn’t disclose Twitter ownership on time before buying it Nation | Obesity won’t be solely defined by BMI under new plan for diagnosis by global experts Nation | Lawyers for Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs say sex acts are distorted by ‘sexist and puritanical’ prosecution Nation | Daily News, NY Times ask NY judge to reject OpenAI, Microsoft challenges to copyright suit Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year.Musk didn’t provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones.The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess.But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better.Who’s working on brain-computer interface technology?More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington.Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces.Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation.What are the benefits of BCIs?Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis.Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know.”Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink.“We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,” he said.How are BCIs tested and regulated?Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people.While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices.Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study.Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety.She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board.The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll,” said Redberg.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation. Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know.” Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. “We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,” he said. Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board. The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll,” said Redberg.

Title: Wall Street Climate Group Net Zero Suspends Activities Following BlackRock's Exit

The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative—a coalition of investment behemoths turned self-proclaimed climate warriors—hit a wall this week after BlackRock’s dramatic exit forced it to suspend operations. The fallout comes as U.S. political pressure mounts against the green agenda championed by corporate giants. BlackRock, the globe’s largest asset manager with $11.5 trillion under management, walked away citing “confusion over the initiative’s climate efforts” and rising legal scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. Far from serving the public interest, the Net Zero initiative that once had the enthusiastic backing. of BlackRock and other ESG cheerleaders on Wall Street is increasingly seen as out-of-touch with America’s economic needs and the political climate that is rejecting so many of the trendy causes adopted in 2020. The alliance, which once boasted over 325 signatories controlling a staggering $57.5 trillion in assets, was launched in late 2020, amid the ESG craze, the Black Lives Matter movement, and pandemic lockdowns. Its lofty promise? To push the world’s financial powerhouses toward achieving net zero emissions by mid-century. But with the political winds shifting, that dream now appears to be on ice. A letter to members—thinly veiled and light on specifics—blamed “recent developments in the U.S.” for the sudden halt in activities. Though it didn’t name names, the timing speaks volumes. With Donald Trump preparing to take office and vowing to dismantle what he calls the “green tyranny” imposed by global elites, it’s no surprise that Net Zero’s future is in doubt. “As the initiative undergoes this review, it is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting,” the letter noted, clearly signaling a retreat. For months, Republican officials have been ratcheting up the heat. In November, Texas led a coalition of 11 states in suing BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street for allegedly conspiring to choke off coal production by using their clout to push anti-competitive environmental policies. Critics accuse these firms of buying up large stakes in energy producers only to turn around and support initiatives that restrict fossil fuel development, driving up energy prices in the process. Net Zero’s policies haven’t exactly won friends abroad either. In Europe, where governments raced ahead with similar green goals, energy prices soared, and citizens bore the brunt of misguided climate experiments. Critics have branded Net Zero as nothing short of an “energy suicide pact” that puts ideological purity above economic common sense. The backlash hasn’t gone unnoticed on Capitol Hill. Just last month, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee lambasted what it described as a “cartel” of financial firms and environmental activists colluding to impose radical ESG goals on U.S. companies. The committee’s message was clear: Americans won’t stand for unelected elites forcing a climate agenda down their throats. Meanwhile, Trump is signaling that help is on the way for American energy producers. His administration is widely expected to slash environmental regulations and unleash domestic energy production by opening up more oil drilling and cutting red tape. The move could breathe new life into the fossil fuel sector, but it also further undermines the shaky foundations of climate initiatives like Net Zero. For BlackRock and its peers, the decision to exit the alliance underscores a growing realization: ESG investing, long hailed as the future of finance, is running headlong into a wall of political and economic reality. The question now is whether other firms will follow suit, leaving the once-powerful Net Zero alliance in the dust. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Print Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. “We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones.

Title: Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative Pauses Activities Following BlackRock Exit

The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which until last week touted 325 signatories with $57.5 trillion in assets under management that had made a commitment to achieving net-zero portfolios by 2050, will suspend its activities, the organization announced Monday. The move to suspend activities comes after BlackRock announced last week that it was leaving the initiative, following political attacks over its environment, social and governance stance, lawsuits, and divestments. Most major U.S. national banks, including JPMorganChase, have also left a similar initiative, the Net Zero Banking Alliance, in recent months. “Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context,” the NZAM stated. Through its review process, NZAM signatories will be consulted while the initiative tracks signatory implementation and reporting. Pending the outcome of its review, the initiative has also removed from its web site the list of signatories and commitment statements, which also include signatories’ net-zero targets and case studies. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  “As a voluntary initiative, NZAM has successfully supported investors globally as they have sought to navigate their own individual paths in the energy transition in line with their fiduciary duties and clients’ long-term financial objectives,” NZAM stated. Launched in December 2020, the NZAM initiative aimed to support the asset management industry’s commitment to the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The initiative is managed by six founding partner groups: Asia Investor Group on Climate Change, CDP [Carbon Disclosure Project] Worldwide, Ceres, Investor Group on Climate Change, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change and the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of These 10 Firms Were Last Week’s Biggest Losers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Edison International (NYSE:EIX) stands against other firms that were last week's biggest losers. Ten companies fell significantly last week, mirroring a broader market downturn, as investors sold off positions following disappointing news and data that weighed heavily on market sentiment. On Friday, the Dow Jones recorded its largest weekly drop, falling 1.07%, while the S&P’s main index and Nasdaq declined by 0.71% and 0.62%, respectively. To come up with this week’s top decliners, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A wide aerial view of an electric power transmission facility with lines, substations, and overhead wires. Power distribution giant Edison International (NYSE:EIX) dropped its share prices by 19.03 percent last week to $65 from the $80.28 recorded a week prior amid the ongoing Los Angeles wildfire that has resulted in dozens of deaths and billions worth of damages. It doesn’t help that the company is currently under public scrutiny due to a potential connection to the wildfire, after discovering a downed conductor at a tower near the area where the Hurst Fire broke out on Tuesday evening. Edison, however, said it was uncertain whether the damage occurred before or after the fire. At present, Edison said some areas may continue to be de-energized in the coming weeks for public safety and prevent any further wildfire conditions. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) is one of the largest electric utility holding companies in the U.S., focused on providing clean and reliable energy and energy services through its independent companies. Overall, EIX ranks 7th on our list of firms that were last week's biggest losers. While we acknowledge the potential of EIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: American Airlines Mismanaged Employees’ Retirement Funds by Investing in ESG, Court Rules

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/13/2025 12:49:12 PM PST by E. Pluribus Unum ESG investments tend to underperform traditional funds by approximately 10 percent, the judge observed.A district court has ruled that American Airlines failed to prioritize the financial interests of its employees’ retirement funds by enabling fund managers to pursue environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments.The judgment came as part of a 2023 lawsuit filed against American Airlines and the company’s Employee Benefits Committee. The class action alleges that the defendants violated their duty of loyalty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which states that fiduciaries managing retirement investments must act in the best financial interest of the participants.The defendants are alleged to have mismanaged their employees’ retirement assets—401(k) plans—when they hired investment managers pursuing ESG policies to handle the funds, especially BlackRock.ESG looks at nonmonetary factors while making investment decisions. This includes a company’s carbon footprint and chemical emissions, how a business addresses LGBT interests and other political initiatives, and whether a company adopts such programs in its hiring practices.The plaintiffs said BlackRock pursued an agenda to convert their retirement plans’ core index portfolios into ESG funds and that BlackRock’s actions harmed retirement plan participants because such investments pursued socio-political outcomes rather than financial returns.On Jan. 10, Judge Reed O’Connor from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas agreed with the plaintiffs, saying “the facts compellingly demonstrated that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests.” (Excerpt) Read more at theepochtimes.com ...

The class action alleges that the defendants violated their duty of loyalty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which states that fiduciaries managing retirement investments must act in the best financial interest of the participants.The defendants are alleged to have mismanaged their employees’ retirement assets—401(k) plans—when they hired investment managers pursuing ESG policies to handle the funds, especially BlackRock.ESG looks at nonmonetary factors while making investment decisions. This includes a company’s carbon footprint and chemical emissions, how a business addresses LGBT interests and other political initiatives, and whether a company adopts such programs in its hiring practices.The plaintiffs said BlackRock pursued an agenda to convert their retirement plans’ core index portfolios into ESG funds and that BlackRock’s actions harmed retirement plan participants because such investments pursued socio-political outcomes rather than financial returns.On Jan. 10, Judge Reed O’Connor from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas agreed with the plaintiffs, saying “the facts compellingly demonstrated that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests.” (Excerpt) Read more at theepochtimes.com ...

The IRFU’s attempts to further develop frontrow forwards have led them to appoint Seamus Toomey as performance pathway scrum coach. In his time as forwards coach at Blackrock College, Toomey has helped develop players including Ireland internationals Oli Jager, Jeremy Loughman, Thomas Clarkson and Gus McCarthy. Toomey will work alongside national scrum coach John Fogarty and provincial coaching staff to implement the National Scrum Programme, according to an IRFU statement, in “identifying and developing a new generation of front row forwards across the system.” The Limerick man has also worked as a scrum coach with Old Belvedere and is currently part of Neil Doak’s Ireland under-20s coaching ticket. Peter Smyth, IRFU head of elite player development, said: “We’re delighted to confirm the appointment of Seamus to this new and important position within our Performance Pathway. Seamus has accumulated a vast amount of experience and expertise working with young frontrow players across our schools and club game over the course of 20 years, and he will continue to be an invaluable asset to Irish Rugby within this new role moving forward. “Identifying and developing frontrow forwards is a major focus for us and we hope Seamus’ commitment, dedication and proven success in doing so, as he works alongside John Fogarty, our Performance Pathway staff and the Provincial coaches, will drive this forward.” Toomey added: “I am delighted to join the IRFU in this new role at such an exciting time for Irish Rugby. I have worked extensively within different areas of our game over a number of years, but to now have the platform to work at a National Level and use my experience to align our National Scrum Programme across the age-grade programmes and facilitate the continued development of world-class front row players to represent Ireland is a hugely exciting opportunity.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. “We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who's working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know." Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. “We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be," he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board. The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll," said Redberg. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

(Bloomberg) -- Wally Adeyemo, the number-two official at the Treasury Department, will leave the Biden administration for a role at Columbia University focusing on economic statecraft and energy policy, according to a person familiar with the matter. Adeyemo, 43, was one of the architects of the sweeping sanctions the US imposed on Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As Janet Yellen’s deputy, he also worked on domestic policy issues, including the administration’s major stimulus packages, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. He will have fellowships at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs and the Center on Global Energy Policy, where is expected to focus on the use of economic tools in national security and issues related to energy security. In the early months of the administration of Joe Biden, Adeyemo presented a policy review that called for an overhaul of the use of sanctions and seemed to presage a reduction in their use as a policy tool. But in the years that followed, the US ramped up its use of the restrictions, slapping a wide range of limits on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine and using them in the Middle East after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel. The Biden administration issued more than 8,000 sanctions in four years, twice as many as President Donald Trump did in his first term or President Barack Obama did across his two terms in office, according to a Jan. 8 report from Castellum.ai. US Treasury Hires Economists to Study Consequences of Sanctions Adeyemo, who was born in Nigeria, held positions in both the Obama and Biden administrations. Between those, he was the first president of the Obama Foundation and senior adviser at BlackRock Inc. and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Title: American Airlines Mismanaged Employees’ Retirement Funds by Investing in ESG, Court Rules
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/american-airlines-mismanaged-employees-retirement-funds-by-investing-in-esg-court-rules-5790994
Time Published: 2025-01-13T18:59:58Z
Full Content:
A district court has ruled that American Airlines failed to prioritize the financial interests of its employees’ retirement funds by enabling fund managers to pursue environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments. The defendants are alleged to have mismanaged their employees’ retirement assets—401(k) plans—when they hired investment managers pursuing ESG policies to handle the funds, especially BlackRock. ESG looks at nonmonetary factors while making investment decisions. This includes a company’s carbon footprint and chemical emissions, how a business addresses LGBT interests and other political initiatives, and whether a company adopts such programs in its hiring practices. The plaintiffs said BlackRock pursued an agenda to convert their retirement plans’ core index portfolios into ESG funds and that BlackRock’s actions harmed retirement plan participants because such investments pursued socio-political outcomes rather than financial returns. The defendants allowed “their corporate interests, as well as BlackRock’s ESG interests, to influence management of the plan,” the court stated. BlackRock had managed roughly $11 billion worth of assets under American Airlines’ employee retirement plan by the end of 2022, according to the court document. The case was filed by Bryan P. Spence, an American Airlines pilot who is a participant in the company’s retirement plan. The judge said ESG investments often underperform traditional investments by roughly 10 percent. “For instance, when compared to the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000 indices in 2023, ESG funds dramatically underperformed non-ESG funds, with ESG-related funds returning about 8 percent compared to about 14 percent for both indices,” the court stated. “BlackRock managed billions of dollars in plan assets at the same time it owned 5 percent of American stock,” making it one of the largest shareholders in the company, it stated. BlackRock had also funded roughly $400 million of the airline’s corporate debt when the company was going through financial challenges, according to the court document. The court observed that BlackRock is known to have pursued ESG criteria as a policy and that the defendants enabled such a course of action because of the “outsized influence” BlackRock had on the company. “For example, as a large company who consumes copious amount of fossil fuels, American was potentially susceptible to a proxy fight of its own by failing to comply with BlackRock’s climate-related demands,” the court stated. The defendants endorsed the ESG goals of those tasked with overseeing employees’ retirement funds, had conflicts of interest with BlackRock, and also upheld a “corporate commitment” to ESG, the judge wrote, while finding that American Airlines had breached its obligatory duties to retirement plan participants. At the time, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis told The Epoch Times that Fink seemed to have “caught some heat from some folks.” “Maybe he’s needed to try to find some way to camouflage his messaging because there’s definitely been some criticism,” Patronis said. Prior to the October 2022 letter, BlackRock was downgraded by Swiss multinational investment bank UBS, with an analyst saying there was “environmental pressure to earnings and risk from the firm’s ESG positioning.” “Investment companies will not push their political agenda on Mississippians, especially through fraudulent and deceptive means,” Michael Watson, Mississippi’s secretary of state, said in a statement at the time. “All citizens should have the opportunity to make informed and educated decisions when investing their hard-earned money.” According to the spokesperson, being part of the pact led to confusion regarding the company’s practices, with public officials making legal inquiries into the business. Despite its exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, BlackRock continues to back what it calls sustainable investing.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/13/2025 10:35:54 AM PST by EBH The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation gave a fresh deadline of Feb. 10 to BlackRock to resolve an issue regarding oversight into the asset manager’s investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing three people with knowledge of the matter. The FDIC may open an investigation into BlackRock and demand more information from the company if it fails to make sufficient progress toward resolving the issues, the report said. The move by the FDIC follows a Jan. 10 deadline that BlackRock failed to meet, according to the report. snip BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street now collectively control some $26 trillion in assets. Since the financial crisis of 2009, investors have poured money into their low-cost index funds, catapulting the three firms into the ranks of the largest owners of most large U.S. corporations.

I asked who controls the proxy, the provider of the index, or the investor who bought into it. They did not have an answer, nor did they ever come back to me. For those who are not aware, when you buy an individual stock, you have voting rights via the number of shares on corporate decisions like hiring the CEO and Board of Directors, mergers and a few other things. You have direct control of those votes. John Bogle, the modern father of index (passive) investing, was on record as saying no more than 25-30% of the market should be passive investing. We went over 50% in early 2024. Why is this important? If the voting control was via the vendor (i.e.-BlackRock, Vanguard, Invesco, etc.), then all the decisions are centralized by a few people who run those organizations. Too many people focus on saying these organizations CONTROL the investment companies, but they do not. Legally, the INVESTORS still own via their passive investment. But VOTING CONTROL is even more important, as so many entrepreneurs realized, like Zuckerburg, etc. If you wonder how DEI crap got so quickly into the major corporations, likely look no further than the VOTING control, not the ownership control. It needs to be made clear that the vendors DO NOT HAVE VOTING CONTROL, and proxy voting MUST be pushed to the investor, regardless of what that takes. As far as this battle is concerned, the way I read it is that BlackRock is negotiating for regulatory relief/a settlement to settle a pattern of voting that is questionable to the regulators (it could be possible they didn’t fully comply with Biden Admin requests in how they voted, hence having to deal). The attempt to stretch this out is to try to renegotiate with the incoming administration instead of now, in all likelihood. They know the current game is up, and now it is about reputation risk and staying away for being blamed for the DEI initiatives they backed when convenient but damning if continued. 7 posted on 01/13/2025 11:37:01 AM PST by LRoggy (Peter's Son's Business ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: EBH This is why cumbag Fink went to Mar A Lago. 8 posted on 01/13/2025 11:46:03 AM PST by AAABEST (That time Washington DC became a corrupted, existential threat to us all...)

If the voting control was via the vendor (i.e.-BlackRock, Vanguard, Invesco, etc.), then all the decisions are centralized by a few people who run those organizations. Too many people focus on saying these organizations CONTROL the investment companies, but they do not. Legally, the INVESTORS still own via their passive investment. But VOTING CONTROL is even more important, as so many entrepreneurs realized, like Zuckerburg, etc. If you wonder how DEI crap got so quickly into the major corporations, likely look no further than the VOTING control, not the ownership control. It needs to be made clear that the vendors DO NOT HAVE VOTING CONTROL, and proxy voting MUST be pushed to the investor, regardless of what that takes. As far as this battle is concerned, the way I read it is that BlackRock is negotiating for regulatory relief/a settlement to settle a pattern of voting that is questionable to the regulators (it could be possible they didn’t fully comply with Biden Admin requests in how they voted, hence having to deal). The attempt to stretch this out is to try to renegotiate with the incoming administration instead of now, in all likelihood. They know the current game is up, and now it is about reputation risk and staying away for being blamed for the DEI initiatives they backed when convenient but damning if continued. This is why cumbag Fink went to Mar A Lago. ChainCatcher news, FOX reporter Charles Gasparino stated that Trump’s team has consulted with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and at least one senior executive while searching for a candidate for Secretary of the Treasury. It is reported that Trump has a long-standing working relationship with Fink, who is one of the best risk managers in the industry and often consults him on market-related views. Fink will not be a candidate for Secretary of the Treasury, but this indicates that Trump has a grand plan for implementing economic policies. https://x.com/CGasparino/status/1858617422116176180 That makes such good sense. If the stock is held in a mutual fund, the managers of the fund should at least be disqualified from voting. “I heard a stat that the 3 or 4 largest investment companies are the largest shareholders in all of the companies that make up the S&P 500. Crazy stuff...” ____________________________________________________________ One more reason a S&P Index fund with very low fees makes the best instrument for growing your wealth over the long haul. The biggest financial players use it the same way. Blackrock and Larry Fink are crooked as snakes. I’ve had conversations with my stock broker for many years about my dislike for him.

Title: Here's why 2025 is shaping up to be the year of altcoins

Time Published: 2025-01-13T18:27:12Z
Full Content:
Since bitcoin's price surged by more than 100% over the past 12 months, crypto is back in the headlines. Enthusiasts who had been waiting out the bear market are preparing for what they hope will be another round of 2021's crypto bull market. Here's why: The four-year bitcoin halving cycle, which cuts the rate of new-coin creation in half, is at the core of crypto's boom and busts. Following the event, demand outpaces tightened supply, driving prices up over the following year. As bitcoin holders reap profits from the rise, some of those gains trickle down into altcoins in a scenario resembling the tide that lifts all boats. So far, this cycle has been on repeat since bitcoin's inception in 2009. And unless something changes, investors anticipate a similar pattern will play out this year. With the latest halving in April, expectations for a 2025 rally are running high. Below is a chart that shows bitcoin's price moves over time overlaid with halving events. Matthew Le Merle, the CEO of Blockchain Coinvestors, says 14 years is enough data for crypto investors to trust a pattern. Historical context shows a cycle where bitcoin has three years of being the highest-performing asset and one of being the weakest. The slight caveat is that bitcoin tends to slow down in the third year of the uptrend, and altcoins (cryptos besides bitcoin) catch up or even outpace it in percentage gains, which could make 2025 the year of altcoins. The end of the latest crypto bull market caught many investors off guard following speculation that bitcoin could go to $100,000 and even $200,000 before entering a bear market. But those hopes were dashed after it touched only $70,000 before it plunged by about 74%. Altcoins followed shortly behind. The boom was also tainted by unprecedented investment scams and the bubble in nonfungible tokens. Bitcoin is now bouncing back, as it did in previous cycles. The table from Morningstar below shows bitcoin as the highest-performing asset globally on an annualized basis in three-year increments. Assets are listed by rows in order of performance, with the highest at the top and lowest at the bottom. In 2024, bitcoin ended the year up by about 124%, placing it as the top-performing asset for the second year in this cycle. In each of those cycles, altcoins trailed bitcoin in the first two years and rallied into steeper percentage gains in the third, according to data from Pantera Capital. The firm refers to the bitcoin-to-altcoin transitions as phases one and two, where the former is led by bitcoin price surges and the latter by altcoins. Once that has played out, the crypto market comes crashing down for the start of another bear market. "Why is that?" Le Merle said. "It's because once bitcoin has gone up three years in a row, a lot of bitcoiners have a lot of capital that they want to diversify, and they're willing to move some of their capital into the altcoins." However, some factors could hinder the two-phase transition. First, there's much more support for bitcoin because of an incoming crypto-friendly presidential administration, the addition of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, institutional money, and corporations and governments considering it in their treasuries, Le Merle said. All this could mean a stronger third year for bitcoin. The downside, he added, is the law of diminishing returns, which simply suggests that the bigger bitcoin gets, the harder it will be to compound steeper returns. The makeup of crypto's market participants has also shifted. "In blockchain and crypto, it used to be very much individuals and retail folks making personal decisions," Le Merle said. But as institutional and professional investors increasingly manage crypto, he expects the weight of the capital to shift toward top-tier crypto assets. This means larger-market-cap altcoins could be up for a big comeback. At the same time, the newer offshoots with fewer use cases could be traded among speculative retail. But that doesn't mean meme coins are falling away. Quite the contrary, traders will always be betting for a quick buck in every corner of the markets. WendyO, the pseudonym for the crypto-influencer host of "The O Show" whose YouTube channel has almost 230,000 subscribers, said this cycle is already looking much different from 2021's for a few notable reasons. First, decentralized-finance protocols and NFTs, with digital artwork such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, were wildly popular in the last bull market. This year, not so much — instead, traders are eyeing meme coins, specifically those pegged to anything AI-related. The crazier and funnier a meme coin is, the higher it's going, said Adrian Zduńczyk, a chartered market technician already witnessing a surge in bizarre-themed coins. He expects the crypto bull market of 2021 to return with even stronger volume over the next six to seven months. Meme coins' popularity stems from their easier accessibility and community-like structure. WendyO noted that in this corner of the market, venture capitalists aren't getting in ahead of the gains or before the coin offerings. There also aren't as many founders making empty promises about use cases. So everyone knows what they're getting into, which is like a gamified gamble where you get in, make money, and then get out before it goes to zero, she said. Second, in 2021, ethereum's blockchain was highly active for altcoin creation. This time, solana's blockchain has become a popular launching pad for meme coins since it has cheaper transaction fees. In December, 1.2 million new tokens were launched on solana's chain, up from only 172 in January 2024, according to Dune. Below is a chart from CoinGecko demonstrating the number of new cryptocurrencies entering the market since 2021. As for the incoming Trump administration, WendyO believes it's too soon to be overly enthusiastic about a crypto-friendly Washington before the new policies are made clear. While she expects widespread support for digital assets, she's concerned institutional investment may be favored over retail or decentralized means of transacting. If that occurs, she believes it could bring the bull market to a premature halt. "We want to be able to transact 24/7, 365 days. We don't want to be accredited investors to participate in crypto. If we want to buy bitcoin, we don't want to be forced to go through BlackRock," WendyO said. "And that's a really big switch that we're seeing this cycle. Last cycle, we didn't have the bitcoin spot ETF, and we didn't have the ethereum spot ETFs."

Title: Black Rock latest to leave Net Zero Alliance

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/13/2025 10:19:28 AM PST by CFW Blackrock Inc. is the latest to announce it has left a United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), among several within one month and not soon after Donald Trump was elected president. It did so as it and roughly 60 companies are being investigated by Congress for allegedly colluding as a “woke ESG cartel” to “impose radical environmental, social, and governance goals on American companies.” Last month, Goldman Sachs was the first to withdraw from the alliance, followed by Wells Fargo, The Center Square reported. Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan next announced their departure. According to the "bank-led and UN-convened" alliance, global banks joined, pledging to align their lending, investment and capital markets activities with a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050. Major U.S. banks began leaving the alliance after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to increase domestic oil and natural gas production and pledged to go after “woke” companies. They also announced their departure two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. While the companies haven’t appeared to seem daunted by state investigations, Trump's reelection appears to be a different matter. (Excerpt) Read more at thecentersquare.com ...

Title: Exclusive-Investor climate group suspends activities after BlackRock exit
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusiveinvestor-climate-group-suspends-activities-after-blackrock-exit-3810071
Time Published: 2025-01-13T18:11:17Z

By Simon Jessop and Ross Kerber LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) -A flagship coalition aimed at aligning the asset management industry with global climate goals said it was suspending its activities on Monday, days after BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest investor, left amid a political backlash in the United States. The pause raised concerns that companies will lower their efforts on climate change even after the hottest year on record, but could buy organizers time to review what actions might still be acceptable for U.S. fund firms. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion inassets, left the Net-Zero Asset Managers(NZAM) initiative on Jan. 9 citing confusion over its climate efforts and legal inquiries from public officials. The step followed months of escalating pressure from someRepublican politicians over its stance on investing in fossilfuel companies, with concern that such pressure could risefurther as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. The group counted more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion in assets as members, according to its website as of last week, before the departure of BlackRock. In a letter to its members first reported by Reuters, the partner groups which help manage the NZAM said they had decided to conduct a review of its activities. "Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context. "As the initiative undergoes this review, it is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting. NZAM will also remove the commitment statement and list of NZAM signatories from its website, as well as their targets and related case studies, pending the outcome of the review." CONTAGION EFFECT NZAM was set up in 2020 as executives and investors grew enthusiastic about solving climate change, sentiments that have faded. Still, changes by the NZAM initiative could prevent the sort of flight by asset managers that diminished the influence of another investor climate group, the Climate Action (WA:ACT) 100+, last year. At the time, big fund firms cited independence concerns, not politics, as a reason for their dropping out. Since then pressure from U.S. Republican officials has increased on executives to back away from reflecting environmental, social and governance (ESG) assessments in their investment decisions. These include an inquiry from the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and a lawsuit by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states that claimed that fund activism had cut coal production and boosted energy prices. For its part, the NZAM initiative has asked members to support the goal, agreed by countries, of capping global warming and aiming to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Kathy Mulvey, a campaign director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Massachusetts-based advocacy organization, said groups including NZAM "have been an important avenue to keep us on track" toward meeting emissions-reduction targets. Whatever the results of NZAM's review, she said, "clearly the financial sector's actions to advance emissions reductions and the clean energy transition aren't going away." Among other members of NZAM, a representative for JPMorgan's asset management arm declined to comment on Monday's move. In a statement sent by a representative, State Street (NYSE:STT)'s asset management arm said it "supports the announced NZAM review and will carefully evaluate its findings upon completion."

JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon is nothing if not consistent when it comes to his views on Bitcoin (BTC). “Bitcoin itself has no intrinsic value,” he said in an interview with CBS News on Sunday. “It’s used heavily by sex traffickers, by money launderers, ransomware. So I just don’t feel great about Bitcoin.” Similar to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Dimon was a longtime opponent of bitcoin. Unlike Fink — who underwent a 180 degree reversal in his views a couple of years ago — Dimon has continued holding the same negative outlook even as the bank he leads has profited off of bitcoin's growing use as a financial product, including serving as an authorized participant for BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF. JPMorgan also recently rebranded its blockchain platform, formerly Onyx, to Kinexys as it aims to double down on real world tokenization. The goal, according to JPM’s co-head of Payments Umar Farooq, is to reduce limitations of the current financial infrastructure, like tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). The banking giant said in November that it plans to introduce on-chain foreign exchange capabilities on its platform as soon as the first quarter of 2025. Dimon's most recent comments came just days ahead of Donald Trump reassuming the U.S. presidency. Trump and team have promised and at this point appear set on delivering a far friendlier regulatory environment for bitcoin and crypto in general.

Climate change events continue to intensify. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP January 8, 2025. ) No matter how often bank regulators, international standard setters, rating agencies, or financial reform advocates warn banks that climate change is serious, the frequency of disasters driven by climate change shows they are not heeding the warnings. Such disasters have significantly increased and intensified in the last several decades. According to the National Centers for Environmental Information, from 1980–2024, there have been slightly more than 400 climate disaster events in the United States with losses exceeding $1 billion. Banks in the U.S. are not required to measure and report to regulators or market participants how climate change can impact their credit and investment portfolios; consequently, none of us can gauge how banks can withstand increasingly more damaging natural disasters. Between 1980 and 2024, 32 Drought, 67 Tropical Cyclone, 203 Severe Storm, 23 Wildfire, 45 Flooding, ... [+] 24 Winter Storm, and 9 Freeze billion-dollar disaster events affected the United States Trump Administration Shows Strong Signs of Eliminating Any Bank Focus on Climate Change Speaking before the House’s Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions in 2021, I made several climate change risk identification, measurement, and disclosure recommendations to bank regulators and to bank executives. On October 2022, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency appointed a Chief Climate Risk Officer. Another commendable action was in October 2023 when together with the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the OCC published the Principles for Climate-Related Financial Risk Management for Large Financial Institutions. Also in 2023, for the first time, the Federal Reserve conducted a pilot climate scenario analysis to identify the climate risk-management practices and challenges of JPMorgan, Citibank, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo. According to the Fed, the CSA’s purpose was also “to enhance the ability of large banking organizations and supervisors to identify, estimate, monitor, and manage climate-related financial risks.” The incoming administration unfortunately is showing signs that not only is climate change not a focus, it could dismantle President Biden’s climate change actions and also punish organizations that focus on this important issue. In his last administration, Trump was quick to issue an executive order dismantling climate change actions during the Obama administration. U.S. Emissions (billions tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) Note: Red line: Trump eliminates key Biden climate policies. Blue line: Biden climate policies stay in place. Gray line: The current U.S. climate target. Moody’s Ratings in its 2025 Environment, Social, and Governance Outlook report explained that “the US (Aaa negative) election outcome may have a dampening effect on global climate action.” Importantly Moody’s Ratings analysts pointed out that “many countries will move forward with clean energy investment to meet decarbonization as well as energy security and economic competitiveness objectives.” Unfortunately, since the Trump administration has already been signaling that banks should have less regulation, it is highly unlikely that banks will be required to be transparent about their exposures to climate change in their lending or trading portfolios. Additionally, more American banks and other types of financial institutions are likely to reduce or eliminate commitments to reducing how they contribute to climate change. It is important to remember that banks are special, because they are interconnected to every facet of an economy. Corporations and other financial institutions often follow whatever bank executives do. In just the last 30 days, the six largest banks in the U.S. (JPMorgan, Citibank, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo), reneged on their commitment to the Net Zero Banking Alliance ; Blackrock also left the group this week. These developments are troubling, since the point of this bank-led and United Nations-backed organization is for the members to align their lending, investment, and capital markets activities with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Ironically, the NZBA just announced in October that the group was making good progress. If banks were prepared for the adverse impact of climate change, the fact that they fled the NZBA might not be as troubling. However, none of six American banks’ CEOs has given a credible explanation as to why fleeing this group was necessary; worst yet, none has explained what the commitment to net-zero greenhouse emissions of his or her bank will be. Once again, our financial institutions’ leadership on the international stage will be sorely lacking. Banks Are Unprepared For Climate Change When the Federal Reserve released the climate change scenario results on May 2024, the data was more convincing that U.S. banks are not prepared to be sufficiently capitalized and liquid to survive catastrophic climate change events. The Fed stated that the six banks “reported significant data and modeling challenges in estimating climate-related financial risks. For example, participants noted a lack of comprehensive and consistent data related to building characteristics, insurance coverage, and counterparties’ plans to manage climate-related risks. In many cases, participants relied on external vendors to fill data and modeling gaps.” Remember, these are the banks, whose professionals tell us repeatedly that they know how to measure risks emanating from commercial real estate exposures, cryptocurrencies, leverage portfolios, and financial derivatives. So, is it indeed true that there is not enough high-quality data to model climate-related financial risks? If so, then banks need to increase their capital and liquidity levels to withstand the uncertainty of how much climate change could hurt their safety and soundness. Or is it that banks do not want to measure how severe climate change could hurt them, since disclosing that could hurt their stock and bond prices? Either way, legislators and bank regulators need to demand that banks focus on how climate change could imperil the economy. In the climate change scenario exercise, banks did admit that “better understanding and monitoring of indirect impacts (e.g., disruptions to local economies) and chronic risks (e.g., sea level rise) are important for managing climate-related financial risks.” Also important to remember is that banks are very connected to insurance companies. Banks extend all kinds of loans and lines of credit to insurance companies; they are also counterparties to insurance companies in repurchase agreements and financial derivatives. Importantly, the type and number of mortgages that banks underwrite, significantly depends on whether and how residential and commercial borrowers are insured. The six big banks highlighted in the Fed climate change exercise “the important role that insurance plays in mitigating the risks of climate change for consumers, businesses, and banks. They noted the need to monitor changes across the insurance industry, including changes in insurance costs over time, and the impacts of those changes on consumers and businesses in specific markets and segments.” Climate Change affects all bank risks Climate change events are significant drivers of rising credit, market, operational and liquidity risks in banks. These financial risks are very interconnected, and all too often are positively correlated; this means that precisely when borrowers who are hurt by climate change default on their loans, this leads to market volatility because stock and bond prices decrease precipitously. Hence, banks’ asset quality can suffer from both credit and market risks simultaneously. Because banks and insurance companies have significant asset and liability mismatches due to their role as financial intermediaries, any climate change stress can quickly hurt their earnings and even their liquidity. The interconnections between banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions means that even if climate change were to hurt only one type of financial institution, there is a very high risk of contagion throughout the entire financial system and the economy of Main Street. Banks’ Bonds And Stocks Do Not Price In Climate Change Risk At the end of last year, the Senate Budget Committee released a report that details the detrimental effect of climate change on every sector of the economy, including capital markets. Now, with the tragic fires in Los Angeles still burning, the costs will be significantly higher. Climate-change risk drivers can generate significant costs and financial losses for banks. Both banks and bank supervisors need to evaluate banks’ existing risk management policies, processes, and procedures to assess whether banks are sufficiently capitalized and liquid to cope with climate-change related risks. Unfortunately, investors are at risk because banks’ bonds and stocks have not priced in climate change risks, because financial institutions and corporations are not required to identify, measure, control and monitor their climate-related risks and to disclose them to the public. Bond and stock prices are important markets signals not only for investors but also for regulators. This opacity in the financial system is dangerous not only to investors but also to ordinary Americans. Rather than influencing banks to ignore climate change, the incoming Trump administration and bank regulators should be pushing banks to do the opposite.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock Canada, the Canadian arm of the global investment management firm, announced Monday the launch of its iShares Bitcoin ETF on Cboe Canada. The fund, trading under the tickers IBIT (Canadian dollars) and IBIT.U (U.S. dollars), is designed to offer Canadian investors a regulated and accessible means of gaining exposure to the world’s largest digital asset. BlackRock’s new Bitcoin ETF adopts a funds-of-funds approach, meaning that it invests substantially or all of its assets in the US-listed iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which in turn invests in and holds long-term Bitcoin. Investors can buy shares of the ETF through standard brokerage accounts. “The launch of the iShares Bitcoin ETF in Canada underscores BlackRock’s commitment to innovation and providing clients access to an expanding world of investments,” said Helen Hayes, Head of iShares Canada, BlackRock. “The iShares Fund provides Canadian investors with a convenient and cost-effective way to gain exposure to Bitcoin and helps remove the operational and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly,” she added. The Bitcoin ETF joins seven other iShares products already trading on Cboe Canada. The exchange handles approximately 15% of all trading volume in Canadian listed securities. It’s also a go-to platform for ETFs from Canada’s largest issuers, Canadian Depositary Receipts, and various growth companies. “Cboe has a history of bringing many first-of-their-kind products to market, including spot crypto ETFs in the United States, and we’re thrilled to continue our leadership in innovation by listing BlackRock Canada’s IBIT ETF on Cboe Canada,” said Rob Marrocco, Global Head of ETF Listings at Cboe. As of January 10, the Canada-listed iShares Bitcoin ETF had net assets of around $701,338, with 25,000 units outstanding. BlackRock charges a management fee of 0.32%.

Title: Wall Street breaks from net-zero climate alliance ahead of Trump term

Climatedepot.com Executive Director Marc Morano reacts to President-elect Donald Trump’s vow to overhaul Biden’s climate agenda. Wall Street's largest banks simultaneously exited the same net-zero climate alliance that was probed by Republican lawmakers last year, announced just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump will be sworn into office. Since 2021, banking giants have been prominent members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a global group of financial institutions "committed to financing ambitious climate action" to transition the economy to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. However, since December, six of the world's largest banks, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of America, have all separately announced their leaving the alliance, which encourages its member banks to additionally "design, set, and achieve" science-based, net-zero targets. The banks said that they remain committed to emission reduction targets, but they will do so independently. A POTENTIAL SECOND WITHDRAWAL FROM PARIS CLIMATE TREATY COULD LOOK DIFFERENT THAN FIRST US EXIT JPMorgan Chase & Co. sign and building exterior seen in New York City. (Plexi Images) "We will continue to work independently to advance the interests of our Firm, our shareholders and our clients and remain focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security," a spokesperson for J.P. Morgan, the latest bank to withdraw from the alliance, said in a statement. BlackRock, the world's largest investment firm, also announced on Thursday it was separating from a major climate group, the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, which works with asset managers to attain net-zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. The synchronicity of the exits comes just weeks before Trump, who is expected to break away from President Biden's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target and potentially withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, will assume the presidency.

(Michael Nagle) "The sudden exodus of these big US banks out of the NZBA is a lily-livered effort to avoid criticism from Trump and his climate denialist cronies," said Paddy McCully, a senior analyst at Reclaim Finance, the Guardian reported. "A few years ago, when climate change was at the front of the political agenda, the banks were keen to boast of their commitments to act on climate," McCully added. "Now that the political pendulum has swung in the other direction, suddenly acting on climate does not seem so important for the Wall Street lenders."

Title: Why 2025 Will Be a Year of M&A in DeFi

The final quarter of 2024 marked a surge in cryptocurrency mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity, signalling that the post-election sentiment shift could spark even more deals in the new year. M&A has already been on the rise, and the recent acquisition of Bridge by Stripe marked a significant milestone that highlights a trend of the increasingly blurred lines between traditional finance and digital assets. According to The Block Pro data, activity in 2024 was still behind 2022's all-time high of 271 deals, signaling steady yet restrained growth but there are signs that the record may be broken in 2025. With major institutions including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale launching Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, and the Trump election fueling optimism, the stage is set for a renewed M&A wave. The key question now is – what does M&A mean for driving innovation in the DeFi space? Recent high-profile acquisitions, such as Stripe’s purchase of Bridge and Robinhood’s acquisition of Bitstamp, underscore the undeniable intersection between traditional finance and digital assets. These deals aren’t just about expansion, they’re a clear signal that firms are looking to strengthen their offerings to meet the growing demands of institutional clients who want secure custody and robust risk management. A lot of discourse has focused on pitting DeFi against TradFi, but the recent M&A activity suggests we may be entering a new era where finance is finally a unified, evolving ecosystem. Traditional finance has hurdles to clear in its DeFi transition, especially around regulatory compliance and accessibility. To navigate these waters, TradFi needs enterprise-grade solutions that not only meet regulatory standards but also simplify the user experience. DeFi platforms, while powerful, can sometimes be challenging for non-crypto native users due to their complex interfaces Those looking to branch into crypto should focus on platforms like Enzyme with transparent on-chain infrastructure, that combines automated features like smart contracts, automated investment strategies, and risk management tools within a user-friendly interface. This approach simplifies the management of digital assets, ensuring compliance without the usual complexity of blockchain technology. By adopting these tools, traditional financial institutions can transition into the DeFi space more easily, minimizing risk while maintaining control. For builders and managers, consolidation caters to the convenience of accessing a wider pool of resources within a secure, integrated infrastructure, making it easier to innovate. This global movement bridges the gap between Web2 and Web3, gradually dissolving the boundary to form a unified, innovative space. It’s also happening within the decentralized space itself. M&A plays a key role in driving composability in DeFi by enabling the consolidation of resources, technologies, and expertise from multiple projects, which can strengthen interoperability between different protocols. Composability is the ability for different protocols and apps to integrate and work together, enabling users to build complex financial solutions and acting as a catalyst for growth in the DeFi space. This increasing consolidation and merging of different protocols and resources empowers builders to build new financial products. This reduces barriers to entry, meaning developers can create powerful applications without starting from scratch, while users benefit from easy access to interconnected services. Liquid Staking Tokens are a prime example of composability and a key trend that is predicted to grow in 2025. Earning staking rewards while also being used as liquidity or collateral, they strengthen capital efficiency and maximize the utility of assets across the DeFi ecosystem. The future for decentralized finance is bright. Established Ethereum protocols have been consistently building and improving. These advancements, combined with a more favourable regulatory environment and enhanced user experiences, are setting the stage for significant growth. The future of decentralized finance lies in composability and interoperability. Networks should not be an obstacle to investment, but navigating them can sometimes be complex. Simplified interfaces that bridge the complexity of multiple networks allow users to focus on opportunities rather than technical barriers. As M&A activity continues, crypto firms will have to balance the innovation of DeFi with the practical realities of regulation, governance, and market competition. This consolidation is key to building secure ecosystems and meeting the increasing expectations of investors and builders.

Title: Crypto’s Compliance Conundrum

As Bitcoin continues to rise and institutional investors pour over $20 billion into crypto ETFs, a fundamental shift is occurring in digital asset markets. The appointment of Paul Atkins as SEC Chair, known for favoring market-driven solutions over heavy-handed enforcement, has fueled optimism that crypto can finally balance innovation with regulation. But the crypto industry faces a stark choice that no amount of regulatory flexibility can overcome: either sacrifice the unlimited programmability that makes these systems revolutionary, or accept that their compliance from an anti-money laundering regulation perspective cannot be fully automated or built into the system. This isn't a temporary technological limitation about one system or another – it's as fundamental as the laws of mathematics. To begin to see why, we can think about an economy where shells are money. If we pass a law that nobody can transact more than 10 times per day or hold more than 10% of the shells, we have an enforcement problem. How do we know who holds which shells when? Information asymmetry stymies compliance and compliance devolves to a surveillance challenge. Blockchain technology solves that problem. If everyone sees where all the shells are all the time, then enforcement works. We can build compliance into a system and deny banned transactions. Here, the transparency from the blockchain enables automated compliance. But the long-held premise of Web3 is to automate stock exchanges and myriad complex interactions. Doing so requires moving beyond shells to a system where users create their own assets and upload their own programs. And permissionless access to publish these complex programs causes trouble for users who may be exposed to malicious programs or scams, the system which may face congestion, and regulators who care about preventing financial crimes. The core challenge lies in what computer scientists call "undecidability." In traditional finance, when regulators impose rules like "no transactions with sanctioned entities" or "maintain capital adequacy ratios," banks can implement these requirements through their existing control systems. But, in a truly decentralized system where anyone can deploy sophisticated smart contracts, it becomes mathematically impossible to verify in advance whether a new piece of code might violate these rules. JPMorgan's recent rebranding of Onyx to Kinexys illustrates this reality. The platform now processes over $2 billion in daily transactions, and participation is by participants who meet regulatory criteria before joining. Unlike typical cryptocurrency platforms where anyone can write and deploy automated trading programs (known as smart contracts), JPMorgan's system maintains compliance by restricting what participants can do. This approach has attracted major institutional players like BlackRock and State Street, which collectively have more than $15 trillion in assets under management. Many crypto enthusiasts view such restrictions as betraying the technology's promise. These compromises are not just pragmatic choices – they're necessary for any system that aims to guarantee regulatory compliance. The Securities and Exchange Commission's mandate to protect investors while facilitating capital formation has grown increasingly complex in the digital age. Under Gary Gensler's leadership, the SEC took an enforcement-heavy approach to crypto markets, treating most digital assets as securities requiring strict oversight. While Atkins' anticipated principles-based approach might seem more accommodating, it cannot change the underlying mathematical constraints that make automated compliance impossible in permission-less, fully programmable systems. The limitations of fully automated systems became painfully clear at MakerDAO, one of the largest decentralized lending platforms with over $10 billion in assets. During March 2024's market turbulence, when Bitcoin's price swung 15% in hours, MakerDAO's automated systems began triggering a cascade of forced liquidations that threatened to collapse the entire platform. Despite years of refinement and over $50 million spent on system development, the protocol required emergency human intervention to prevent a $2 billion loss. Similar incidents at Compound and Aave, which together handle another $15 billion in assets, underscore that this wasn't an isolated case. This wasn't just a technical failure – it demonstrates the impossibility of programming systems to handle every potential scenario while maintaining regulatory compliance. The industry now faces three paths forward, each with distinct implications for investors: First, follow JPMorgan's lead by building permission-based systems that sacrifice some decentralization for clear regulatory compliance. This approach has already gained significant traction: six of the top ten global banks have launched similar initiatives in 2024, collectively handling over $2 trillion in transactions. The surge in regulated crypto products, from ETFs to tokenized securities, further validates this path. Second, limit blockchain systems to simple, predictable operations that can be automatically verified for compliance. This is the approach adopted by Ripple with its newly launched RUSD, designed to be compliant with the New York Department of Financial Services standards based on the limited purpose trust company framework. While this constrains innovation due to the restriction action space that users can make, it enables decentralization within carefully defined boundaries. Third, continue pursuing unlimited programmability while accepting that such systems cannot provide strong regulatory guarantees. This path, chosen by platforms like Uniswap with its over $1 trillion in total trading volume in 2024, faces mounting challenges. Recent regulatory actions against similar platforms in Singapore, the U.K. and Japan suggest this approach's days may be numbered in developed markets. For investors navigating this evolving landscape, the implications are clear. The current market enthusiasm, largely driven by regulated products like ETFs, indicates the industry is moving toward the first option. Projects that acknowledge and address these fundamental constraints, rather than fighting them, are likely to thrive. This explains why traditional financial institutions' blockchain initiatives, despite their limitations, are seeing dramatic growth – JPMorgan's platform reported a 127% increase in transaction volume this year. The success stories in crypto's next chapter will likely be hybrid systems that balance innovation with practical constraints. Investment opportunities exist in both regulated platforms that provide clear compliance guarantees and innovative projects that thoughtfully limit their scope to achieve verifiable safety properties. As this market matures, understanding these mathematical constraints becomes crucial for investors' risk assessment and portfolio allocation. The evidence is already clear in market performance: regulated crypto platforms have delivered average returns of 156% over the past year, while unrestricted platforms face increasing volatility and regulatory risks. Atkins' principles-based approach might offer more flexibility than Gensler's prescriptive rules, but it cannot override the fundamental limits of automated compliance. Just as physics constrains what's possible in the physical world, these mathematical principles set immutable boundaries in financial technology. The impossible dream isn't cryptocurrency itself – it's the notion that we can have unrestricted programmability, complete decentralization and guaranteed regulatory compliance all at once. For the crypto industry to deliver on its revolutionary potential, it must first acknowledge these immutable constraints. The winners in this next phase won't be those promising to overcome these mathematical limits, but those who design intelligent ways to work within them.

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Matt Maddox succeeds Nick Woodhouse, who will continue to work at the company as executive vice chairman. Senior Editor, Men's Authentic Brands Group has reached outside its ranks for a new top executive. Matt Maddox, the former chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts, has joined the company as president. He succeeds Nick Woodhouse, the longtime right-hand man to Authentic founder Jamie Salter, who will transition to executive vice chairman. Woodhouse will continue to remain active in the business, the company said. Over his two-decade career at Wynn, Maddox is credited with playing a pivotal role in the company’s global expansion. He was the first employee to relocate to Asia, where he served as chief financial officer of Wynn Resorts Macau, helping develop Wynn Macau and Wynn Palace. He returned to the U.S. and became the chief financial officer of Wynn Resorts in 2008, was promoted to president in 2013 and CEO in 2018.

His experience at the publicly held Wynn Resorts is also expected to be valuable to Authentic as it ponders whether to finally enter the public market or to take on other outside investments. You May Also Like In 2021, Authentic filed plans to go public but pulled back from those plans after CVC Capital and HPS Investment Partners, along with its other shareholders, which include BlackRock, Simon Property Group, Leonard Green & Partners and others purchased significant equity. Salter has since said that he’s in no rush to go public, but that it might be something to consider in the future. Sources said Maddox could help solidify that thinking while also helping Authentic to continue to diversify its holdings globally. “Matt is an exceptional leader, and I’m thrilled to welcome him to Authentic,” said Salter, chairman and CEO of Authentic. “His vast experience in scaling founder-led, complex, high-growth businesses and ability to drive operational excellence will be incredibly valuable as we diversify our business across new verticals and industries.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 18 Stocks After Major AI Event. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed after major AI event. After the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Jim Cramer had a lot to talk about NVIDIA and other stocks. While you can take a look at what he had to say about Wall Street’s favorite AI GPU stock by opening our full list, Cramer emphasized that there is a clear division in the stock market. He pointed out “Well again I think that there’s two markets. There’s the healthcare market, the materials market, uh, the food and beverage market. David, that area is just wasteland.” He shared that safety isn’t on investors’ minds when understanding the current stock market. I learned from my friend Michael Haley who is a demolition man that safety never takes a vacation,” Cramer shared and added “He was not speaking about snacks. Because safety’s last!” The CNBC host also commented on a recent report which shared that consumers might be able to save money by using GLP-1 weight loss drugs. According to him, “If you want to save some money, well, look it’s four hundred dollars. That they’re saving. And by the way, you know, the average person in this country, four hundred dollars, nice saving.” Another segment that’s caught his attention recently is the alcoholic beverages market. The Surgeon General’s recent opinion of placing a cancer warning on these beverage bottles hasn’t escaped Cramer’s attention. However, he doesn’t think a warning label will deter consumers. Cramer commented that in the aftermath of the Surgeon General’s remarks, “liquor’s just being crushed.” He recalled the Prohibition and shared “All I can tell you is that, we did this thing in prohibition, we had this thing called prohibition, it didn’t work. That was a real way to wipe it out.” Yet, even though the stocks are down, they might not have seen different performance had the warning not been issued. According to Cramer “People don’t wanna own these stocks anyways because of interest rates. It’s just a double whammy.” Following a comprehensive press conference by President-elect Trump, bond yields soared as investors fretted about political stability. Cramer believes technology stocks are more resilient to rising bond yields but other sectors like healthcare suffer. Yet, according to him “If you were in healthcare right now you’d be saying, what, if you’re Rob Davis at Merck, you say like listen, things aren’t that bad. But it doesn’t matter because it’s all caught up with bonds.” One government official in Cramer’s crosshairs was FTC chair Lina Khan. Cramer commented on the increased frequency of mergers and acquisitions in the US this year. “I love these deals, David. They take out a competitor,” he shared. “You can raise numbers. It’s rationalizing the American industry. It’s everything that a previous guest [Lina Khan] on this network, hated,” according to Cramer. He also shared thoughts about Khan’s actions against Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company. The case “is about hurting small businesses,” believes Cramer. However, he believes that it should have been about inflation instead. “Never did she [Khan] ever say that it was about keeping prices down for the consumer. But inflation is the single biggest problem that we have in this country economically. And so she completely missed that boat. And then she injected Reagan into that,” he opined. Finally, while materials, industrial, healthcare, and alcoholic beverage stocks are struggling, the “Magnificent 7 is what moves things,” said Cramer. He also believes that “if Biden’s legacy is that the Magnificent 7 did really well, well I mean given that I’m a dollar sign represented by a man, I’m thrilled.” To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on Tuesday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

(NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a food and snack company that makes and sells some of the best-known snack product brands such as Oreos, Toblerone, and Dairy Milk. Like other food companies, and despite the fact that defensive stocks do well in a tight economy, Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ)’s shares have lost 23% over the past year. The share price drop is due to consumer preference for affordable food products. Cramer’s comments for Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) revolved around the impact of GLP-1 products on food companies: “They have to merge. Look at Mondelez. Mondelez has to merge. Overall, MDLZ ranks 8th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed after major AI event.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) stands against other top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. Jim Cramer in a recent program on CNBC recommended investors to avoid worrying when others are anxious or get too excited about something when others are also doing the same. Cramer said by the time an idea is common among investors, its price already reflects its potential. “Stocks don’t quite travel at the speed of thought but they come pretty close. So the moment a preponderance of hedge fund and mutual fund managers decide that the economy is slowing, speeding up, or flatlining, stocks start trading like that’s already the case. Usually, it takes some time to build that kind of consensus, which is why you rarely see these moves happening instantaneously. But once the big institutional portfolio managers are on the same page about something, you can be pretty darn confident that it’s baked into the averages. This is some basic economics 101 stuff.” If every piece of news is priced in, does that mean it’s meaningless to invest in stocks and you are better off putting your money in broader market funds? Cramer calls this idea “bogus” and says the market is pretty irrational at times and stocks are incorrectly priced, giving investors an opportunity. “The simple truth is that markets are not perfectly efficient. In fact, frankly, they’re often irrational. They ignore things, make mistakes, misvalue information every day. And that’s a major reason why anyone can make money picking individual stocks. These anomalies are everywhere, and they can be great for your portfolio,” Cramer added.

With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Security personnel at their consoles, monitoring a global network of threats in real-time. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 74 Jim Cramer was recently asked about Palo Alto Networks. He instead recommended Crowdstrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) as a better buy. ” Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD) fell precipitously, almost 10% over a week, with nothing going on whatsoever. Therefore, that was a disparity with the fundamentals, which I think are excellent. The one to buy right now, at this moment, is Crowdstrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), as it’s starting to bounce back. That’s the one now playing offense after we had George Kurtz, the CEO, visit 130 companies in 100 days as part of what you’d call the apology tour for what occurred in the third week of July. I really like that one better now.” Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “A non-benchmark stake in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWD) (-40%) was the biggest detractor among individual stocks. The shares of this cybersecurity platform provider fell precipitously in July, after a glitch in a CrowdStrike software update led to a global outage for many of its customers that, among other impacts, caused the mass cancellation of flights around the world. After bottoming out in early August, the stock made a partial rebound by quarter end, but we exited the fund’s holding during the summer.” Overall, CRWD ranks 5th on our list of top stocks from Jim Cramer’s Latest Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of CRWD, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
