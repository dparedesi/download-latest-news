Title: Sex Sells: How OnlyFans Turned Fetish-Friendly Celebs and Porn Stars Into a Multibillion-Dollar Juggernaut That Rivals Legacy Studios

By Tatiana Siegel For the same amount of money it takes to buy one of Hollywood’s five remaining major studios, some investor may walk away with the nine-year-old porn-friendly platform OnlyFans. While Skydance’s bid to buy Paramount in a deal valued at $8 billion continues to spark daily headlines, little-known Hollywood player The Forest Road’s efforts to buy OnlyFans for $8 billion is playing out with far less fanfare. That’s a stunning juxtaposition considering the Paramount portfolio consists of CBS, Showtime and the “Godfather” trilogy, while popular content on OnlyFans includes pictures of Carmen Electra’s feet and nudes of “Wizards of Waverly Place” alum Dan Benson. It also signals an economic shift in the entertainment industry. Related Stories Politico Bets on New Podcast Push to Take on TV's Sunday News Cycle Megyn Kelly Expands Digital Network With Emily Jashinsky 'After Party' Aimed at Fans of Politics, Comedy “The name of the game is streaming and online content, and the OnlyFans $8 billion valuation could exceed the price tag of some legacy Hollywood studios, speaking to a new world for the industry where headwinds abound,” says Wall Street analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities. Popular on Variety But do the numbers add up? Many in Hollywood’s private equity space are skeptical that Forest Road, which is led by Zachary Tarica and reportedly manages $127 million in assets, could raise $8 billion. The Century City-based film financier has occupied a niche space in Hollywood since 2017, backing such films as Maggie Gyllenhaal’s “The Kindergarten Teacher” for Netflix and Guy Nattiv’s “Skin” for A24. Few outside the AFM set are familiar with the company and its slate of films, which also includes “The Manson Brothers Midnight Zombie Massacre” and “Chronicle of a Serial Killer.” In 2019, Forest Road invested in Yale Productions, which churned out low-budget movies like the 2023 Uma Thurman-Samuel L. Jackson pairing “The Kill Room.” Last month, Yale filed for bankruptcy, listing more than $55 million in liabilities against $18 million in assets. And in 2023, former Disney COO Thomas Staggs and onetime TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer stepped down from the Forest Road board. According to the SEC filing, Forest Road “has expanded its specialty finance platform across blockchain, digital assets, technology, entertainment, real estate, renewable energy tax credit lending, film tax credit administration, and tax credit brokerage.” But a source who has dealings with Forest Road says the company is legit. “They are very much in touch with BlackRock, Ares and these monster funds,” the source says. “They would not have any problem raising huge money on a deal like this.” (In October, Forest Road and Ares Management founders David Kaplan and Bennett Rosenthal bought a Formula E team.) Forest Road did not respond to a request for comment on this story. On the seller side, even less is known about Leonid Radvinsky, the 43-year-old majority owner of OnlyFans. The Soviet-born billionaire, who bought a 75% stake in OnlyFans’ parent company Fenix International in 2018, has reportedly donated millions to causes involving Ukraine and Israel. (Radvinsky has denied that he pledged $11 million to Israel lobbying group AIPAC.) The father of four, who is partly based in Florida, does not do press. OnlyFans declined comment for this story. While a potential Forest Road-OnlyFans transaction is shrouded in mystery, plenty is known about the parade of random celebrities who have migrated to the platform and how they are monetizing their brands. OnlyFans allows content creators to upload videos to their subscribers and takes 20% of their fees. Initially, the content was mostly explicit, earning OnlyFans a reputation as a purveyor of pornography. Bella Thorne was an early adoptee, making $1 million on her first day on the platform, but faced backlash from the sex worker community, which labeled her a “tourist.” More recently, a wide range of notable names have joined. “Harry Potter” alum Jessie Cave, catering to a fetish community, posts videos of and sounds made by her hair. In response to criticism for taking the OnlyFans plunge, Lily Allen wrote in an X post: “Imagine being an artist and having nearly 8 million monthly listeners on Spotify but earning more money from having 1,000 people subscribe to pictures of your feet. Don’t hate the player, hate the game.” Others, like rappers Cardi B and Trey Songz, offer behind-the-scenes content (including adult-oriented material in Songz’s case). At one point, Australian rapper Iggy Azalea was among the top earners, but she has mostly left the platform in favor of Telegram. The two biggest areas of growth for OnlyFans come via the comedy world and sports stars. While Whitney Cummings is the most high-profile comedian on the platform, having debuted a special there, newbies are benefiting most. In 2023, OnlyFans launched the grassroots comedy show “LMAOF,” which highlighted up-and-coming comedians whose humor might be too risqué for mainstream audiences. Some earnings have been wildly exaggerated. Blac Chyna reportedly pulled down $240 million from OnlyFans, but later said the true number was closer to $2 million. Still, there is real money to be made. On June 11, model Sophie Rain, who is believed to be among the highest paid on the platform, posted a screenshot of her earnings from subscriptions alone since she joined in 2023. The figure was more than $76 million. (An OnlyFans source did not dispute that figure.) “The Sopranos” star Drea de Matteo says she staved off foreclosure on her Laurel Canyon home by starting a page and posting racy content. “I got myself out of a lien on my house. I was in foreclosure,” she tells Variety. “But then the men are fickle and they drop off, and, you know, I’m not like super freaking naked all the time. People know that. Like it’s more of a me-and-my-panties vibes. So if you really want to make the big bucks, you gotta go full-on.” Adds de Matteo: “I was a moderate success. But to be totally honest, I wasn’t Bella Thorne. It saved my life, and now I have to think about doing other things because it won’t sustain.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: A Chinese herbal-medicine stock with no revenue has surged 60,000% this year. 5 things to know about the company's mysterious spike.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/regencell-bioscience-rgc-stock-price-rally-stock-split-china-ipo-2025-6
Time Published: 2025-06-18T14:57:47Z
Full Content:
Shares of a little-known Chinese herbal medicine company have surged this year, with a fresh rally seeing the price quadruple in less than a week. It's been a head-scratching move, since the company is unprofitable, and shares have moved on seemingly no news. Regencell Bioscience Holdings, a Hong Kong-based firm specializing in traditional Chinese medicine, saw its US-listed stock soar 398% over the first two days of the week. But that move pales in comparison to the year-to-date increase, which amounted to roughly 60,000% through Tuesday's close. The company, which offers a proprietary oral formula it says can help treat disorders like ADHD and autism, has not generated any revenue, according to a regulatory filing from October. Over the last two fiscal years, the company said it lost a combined $10.4 million. So, what on earth is going on with this stock? Here's what to know. Regencell, which trades under the ticker "RGC" on the Nasdaq, soared 283% on Monday after its 38-for-1 stock split went into effect. The company originally announced the stock split on June 2. While stock splits don't generate any value for the company — with overall market cap staying unchanged — they are often viewed as a bullish driver, since a lower per-share price can make a stock more appealing to retail investors. Regencell finished Monday with a market cap of $30 billion, which swelled further to $39 billion at Tuesday's close. That made it — at least temporarily — worth more than more well-known companies like Lululemon, Kraft Heinz, and Reddit. The rapid rise of Regencell stock was bound to catch the eye of the retail crowd, but even the enduringly bullish cohort is incredulous about what might be going on. Though Regencell is still less talked about than flagship stocks like Tesla and Apple, users on Reddit were quick to identify the surge this week, with some speculating that Regencell was the market's newest "meme stock." "Regencell is doing some weird stuff again," one user wrote on the subreddit r/shortsqueeze. "I'm trying to decide if I should pull out before a possible crash," another user, who said they were a longtime investor, said on the r/pennystocks subreddit. "I was gambling. Didn't have a clue what this company is," another user wrote on a separate thread on r/shortsqueeze about Regencell this month. "I've been watching it go the last two weeks and keep telling myself that it will crash as soon as I buy back in." Regencell stock was also surging around the time Robert F. Kennedy Jr. continued his anti-vaccine push, with the Health and Human Services Secretary removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices last week, an independent panel that helps shape vaccination policies in the US. Regencell says it has a proprietary Traditional Chinese Medicine formula, a liquid-based oral formula it says can help treat ADHD or Autism Spectrum Disorder. The formula, which is meant to be taken twice a day and aims to treat the "fundamental cause" of neurocognitive disorders, contains "only natural ingredients," the firm says. Its website lists various herbs with qualities that can help with blood circulation, digestion, "detoxication," and other functions. "We have not generated revenue from any TCM formulae candidates or applied for any regulatory approvals, nor have distribution capabilities or experience or any granted patents or pending patent applications and may never be profitable," the firm said in its October filing. The company only has a small number of shares available to trade, one factor that can explain the large swings in its stock. Out of its 500 million shares, just 30 million are available for public trading. That's a far lower percentage than the average for the more widely traded stocks that populate major indexes. Most of the company is owned by Regencell's CEO, Yat-Gai Au. He owned 86% of the company, or a $426 million stake in the first quarter, according to holdings data. His net worth has surged to as much as $33 billion this week, according to Bloomberg, vaulting him into the ranks of the world's richest people. Regencell's second-largest holder, Digital Mobile Venture, owned 7.6% of the company at the end of the first quarter, or around $37.5 million. RBC, BlackRock, and Morgan Stanley also owned miniscule amounts of the stock. Initial public offerings from Chinese or Hong Kong-based firms have been in the spotlight recently. A report from The Wall Street Journal this week said that more than 20 China-based companies and 17 Hong Kong-based companies that went public on the Nasdaq since 2020 have lost 50% of their value or more in a single trading day over the last two years. In 2022, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority issued a warning about a "heightened threat of fraud" related to small-cap companies that had recently gone public on US exchanges. Many of the companies associated with fraud had operators based in China or broker-dealers based in Hong Kong, the regulator said. In many cases, the broker-dealers were allocated 90% or more of the public float, Finra said, meaning they held most of the IPO shares. The small remaining float leaves stocks vulnerable to market manipulation, it said, referring to such companies as "ramp-and-dump schemes." Jump to

Title: BlackRock’s $638 mln Bitcoin buy: Ultimate hedge, confirmed?

BlackRock buys 6,088 BTC, triggering major short liquidations and fueling Bitcoin’s role as digital gold. BlackRock just bought 6,088 Bitcoin [BTC], worth nearly $638.5 million—one of the largest single BTC acquisitions this quarter. Naturally, this injected a fresh wave of institutional conviction into the market. Of course, the ripple effect wasn’t limited to sentiment alone. On-chain data suggests this move triggered a domino of trading activity, forcing speculators to rapidly recalibrate. Following the purchase, short Bitcoin liquidations surged. It was the second-biggest jump after the 9th of June, when liquidations reached a high on a price breakout. Back then, BTC’s breakout triggered mass exits from bearish positions. This time, the pattern repeated. As shorts unwound, the upward pressure kicked in fast. Bitcoin’s price responded with an immediate spike, showing bulls were quick to reclaim control. Moreover, if BlackRock’s allocation inspires follow-on institutional buying, a cascade of liquidations could fuel another leg up. Source: CryptoQuant Despite the price rally, Bitcoin’s Exchange Outflows have shrunk in the last week. Fewer withdrawals of BTC generally mean that traders and investors alike, with BlackRock leading, are purchasing and holding onto assets, looking to further increase their value. That said, should outflows start climbing again, it could confirm another round of accumulation and signal bullish continuation. For now, the market sits on edge, waiting for either a cooling or an ignition. Source: CryptoQuant BlackRock’s timing is crucial. It comes against the backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions and growing concerns regarding fiat stability. Traditionally, gold was always the go-to hedge during such times. However, today, Bitcoin appears to be increasingly getting popular as a virtual hedge. BlackRock’s move mirrors the institutions’ attitudes towards Bitcoin are shifting. It is no longer seen as a mere speculative asset—it is being increasingly woven into broader macro strategies.

Title: Auditory cortex neurons that encode negative prediction errors respond to omissions of sounds in a predictable sequence
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242
Time Published: 2025-06-18T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Predictive coding posits the brain predicts incoming sensory information and signals a positive prediction error when the actual input exceeds what was predicted, and a negative prediction error when it falls short of the prediction. It is theorized that specific neurons encode the negative prediction error, distinct from those for the positive prediction error, and are linked to responses to omitted expected inputs. However, what information is actually encoded by omission responses remains unclear. This information is essential to confirm their role as negative prediction errors. Here, we record single-unit activity in the rat auditory cortex during an omission paradigm where tone probabilities are manipulated to vary the prediction content. We identify neurons that robustly respond to omissions, with responses that increase with evidence accumulation and directly correlate with tone predictability—key characteristics suggesting their role as negative prediction-error neurons. Interestingly, these neurons showed selective omission responses but broad tone responses, revealing an asymmetry in error signaling. To capture this asymmetry, we propose a circuit model composed of laterally interconnected prediction-error neurons that qualitatively reproduce the observed asymmetry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these lateral connections enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding across receptive fields, and that their validity is supported by the free energy principle.

The discrepancy between the predicted and actual input, known as the prediction error, is used to update the brain’s internal models. This process is thought to occur through canonical circuits, hierarchically organized neural networks where top–down predictions and bottom–up prediction errors create a feedback loop that allows the brain to refine its models. Recent work suggested that positive prediction errors, occurring when the actual input exceeds the predicted input, and negative prediction errors, occurring when the actual input is less than the predicted input, are calculated in separate populations of neurons within these canonical circuits [6–9]. While extensive research has investigated positive prediction errors using the oddball paradigm and its variations [10–18] these studies face significant limitations. Specifically, oddball responses consist of more than just positive prediction errors. First, they also contain sensory signals, which are often hard to disentangle. Additionally, a deviant stimulus also represents the omission of the standard stimulus, thereby generating a negative prediction error, which further complicates the interpretation. In contrast, responses to omitted expected stimuli do not contain sensory input and could directly represent negative error signals, potentially offering a crucial step in elucidating the computation of prediction errors. Omission responses have been observed in human studies [19–24] and more recently in single neurons within the visual and auditory cortices [7,9,25–28]. However, omission responses could arise from processes other than predictive coding and may not necessarily represent negative prediction errors. Therefore, it is crucial to characterize the information encoded in these responses to confirm their functional role and investigate how they might arise from the interactions between prediction and sensory signals, an area that remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigated how neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond to the omission of expected auditory stimuli while manipulating their predictability. We use high-resolution extracellular recordings to simultaneously record activity from a large population of neurons across multiple cortical layers, while presenting tone sequences where the probability of tone presentations was systematically varied. We identified a subset of auditory neurons that exhibit two key characteristics of negative prediction-error encoding. First, the neurons displayed omission responses whose intensity was directly correlated with the statistical likelihood of specific omitted tones, demonstrating a quantitative representation of the prediction error. Second, these neurons exhibited omission responses that built up from trial to trial, reflecting predictions established by the accumulation of evidence through repeated exposure to the stimuli. These neurons, which we named “Probability Encoding Omission Neurons” (PEONs), were primarily found in the granular and supragranular layers of the auditory cortex and were distributed across different auditory fields including primary auditory cortex (A1), ventral auditory field (VAF), and anterior auditory field (AAF), with a significantly higher proportion observed in A1. Interestingly, while PEONs showed selective responses to omissions, they responded broadly to tones, highlighting an asymmetry between the processing of top–down predictions and bottom–up sensory signals. To explain these dynamics, we propose a novel circuit model that includes separate negative and positive error calculations within narrowly tuned auditory streams, with prediction error neurons laterally interconnected between adjacent streams. This architecture not only accounts for the observed asymmetry and probability encoding in sensory processing but also demonstrates how lateral connections can enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction-encoding, a concept supported by the free energy principle [1,3]. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the existence of negative prediction error neurons in the auditory cortex and propose a circuit-level hypothesis for how these errors might be computed and integrated within cortical microcircuits. In this study, we focused on the right auditory cortex of Urethane-anesthetized rats, utilizing extracellular recordings to monitor responses to auditory stimuli. Across 18 electrode penetrations involving 10 rats, we successfully captured the activity of 990 single units. For each rat, we first used a surface microelectrode array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) (Fig 1A) to map the various parts of the auditory cortex (Fig 1B) [29–31]. We then used a Neuropixels electrode array to record different layers of the chosen area for each penetration (Fig 1C).

The same representation is used as in panel E. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g001 To explore the neural response to auditory stimuli and their omission, we devised eight experimental conditions (Fig 1D). Each condition featured an oddball sequence of two tones with distinct probabilities, along with a consistent occurrence of tone omissions at a rate of 5%. To create varied prediction contents while maintaining a fixed omission rate, we utilized two tones and controlled their relative predictability. We selected two distinct pure tones (denoted as Tones A and B), one octave apart, that consistently elicited responses from most neurons for each penetration (see details in “Methods”). The sequences were systematically designed but presented in a random order. Each sequence comprised 1,000 stimulus items, including omissions, and featured Tones A and B at varying probabilities to achieve distinct levels of predictability. The specific ratios of Tones A and B were carefully controlled as follows: 95% Tone A and 0% Tone B (exclusively Tone A), 90% and 5%, 85% and 10%, and 75% and 20%. This pattern continued, adjusting further to 20% and 75%, 10% and 85%, 5% and 90%, until reaching 0% and 95% (exclusively Tone B). We observed diverse patterns of neural responses to omissions. Fig 1E and 1F illustrate responses from three exemplary neurons to tone omissions during two distinct tone sequences: one with 95% Tone A and 5% omissions, and the other with 95% Tone B and 5% omissions. Some neurons exhibited strong responses when either tone was presented but did not respond to their omission (Fig 1E), and some neurons displayed selective responses to the absence of specific tones, with the intensity and nature of these responses varying depending on which tone was omitted (Fig 1F). To determine whether omission responses encode negative prediction errors, we investigated how neurons’ responses to omissions were modulated by the predictability of the omitted stimuli. For neurons encoding negative prediction errors, their response should correlate with the content of the prediction. In our experimental design, the content is determined by the probabilities of the two tones, which is equivalent to the probability of one tone, since their total is fixed at 95%. Therefore, we first evaluated which neurons’ omission response correlated with the probability of tone presentation. The omission response was defined as the neuron’s mean firing rate during a 5–120 ms window after the omission, with a local baseline subtracted on a per-trial basis. This baseline was calculated as the mean firing rate from –24 to 5 ms relative to the expected tone onset, capturing the neuron’s state just before the tone was omitted [32]. We then computed the Spearman’s correlation between each neuron’s average omission response under each condition and the corresponding probability of tone presentation (either Tone A or B). For each neuron, the tone whose omission response increased with higher probability was designated the “omission preferred” (OP) tone, while the other was termed the “omission non-preferred” (ONP) tone. Under this definition, the correlation coefficients measured against the OP tone were all positive, unlike those measured against the ONP tone, which would be negative. Next, we examined whether distinct groups exist based on how strongly each neuron’s omission response correlated with predictability of the OP tone. To achieve this, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients and used an unbiased elbow analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters (see details in “Methods”). The elbow analysis revealed that it is optimal to cluster the data into two distinct neuronal subpopulations (see the elbow analysis in S1 Fig): one comprising 771 neurons with little or no modulation of omission responses by tone probability (mean Spearman’s ρ = 0.048), and a second comprising 219 neurons exhibiting a robust positive correlation (mean ρ = 0.18) (Fig 2A).

The p-value shown below reflects the result of a bootstrap analysis comparing the observed PEON count in each area to a simulated null distribution; the asterisk denotes statistical significance (p < 0.05). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g002 Fig 2B illustrates the omission responses of two example neurons across eight different conditions. These range from scenarios with 0% OP tone (95% ONP and 5% omission) to scenarios with 95% OP tone (0% ONP and 5% omission). The peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs), aligned to the expected onset of the omitted tone, have been baseline-subtracted to isolate the omission response. Neuron 1 (from Cluster 1 in Fig 2A) exhibited only a weak correlation (Spearman’s ρ = 0.12), while Neuron 2 (from Cluster 2) showed a pronounced increase in omission response as the probability of the OP tone increased (rho = 0.36). To further examine these PEONs without introducing double-dipping biases, we conducted a split-data analysis by dividing trials into two independent subsets (odd and even trials, denoted as ODD and EVEN trials) to ensure the robustness of our analyses. All PEONs were identified using only one half (e.g., ODD) and subsequently tested on the complementary half (e.g., EVEN), ensuring that selection and evaluation were fully independent. Using the ODD trials, we identified 123 PEONs according to two criteria: (1) a significant correlation (p < 0.05) between their omission responses and the probability of the corresponding OP tone, as verified by Spearman’s correlation test; and (2) a significant omission response (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon sign‐rank test) to this OP tone in the four conditions where it was presented as standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), when the OP tone is most predictable and omission responses should be greatest (see details in “Methods”). We refer to these PEONs as PEONODD. To confirm the reliability of our selection criteria and ensure that the identified neurons were not specific to one trial subset, we applied the same classification procedure to the EVEN trials, identifying a separate group of PEONs referred to as PEONEVEN. For additional comparison, maximizing statistical power and evaluating probability encoding without trial-based data splitting, we identified PEONALL, a group classified using all available trials. Out of a total of 990 neurons, we identified 123 (13%) PEONODD, 60 neurons (6%) showed correlation with probability but no omission response, and 807 neurons (82%) showed no correlation (Fig 2C, top). On the other hand, when using the EVEN trials, 145 neurons were classified as PEONEVEN, 69 showed correlation but no response, and 776 showed no correlation. Although the precise numbers varied slightly between subsets, the classification proportions were broadly similar, supporting the robustness of the procedure. To assess consistency more directly, we quantified the overlap between the two independently identified PEON subsets. A total of 61 neurons were classified as PEONs in both ODD and EVEN trial sets, significantly exceeding the overlap expected by chance (expected: 18 neurons; hypergeometric test, p << 0.001). This result supports the stability of the classification approach, even when applied to trial-split subsets with reduced statistical power. For comparison, when using all trials without splitting, 200 neurons were classified as PEONALL, 70 showed correlation but no response, and 720 showed no correlation. Pie charts for both PEONEVEN and PEONALL classifications are shown in S2 Fig. Fig 2D presents a box plot that aggregates the omission response of all PEONODD on EVEN trials. To quantify the relationship between omission response and OP tone probability, we performed a direct Spearman’s correlation analysis using all individual neuron data points, which revealed a significant positive relationship (Spearman’s ρ = 0.34, p = 1.6 × 10−27, n = 984, representing 123 neurons × 8 probability conditions). The strength of this relationship indicates that neural responses systematically increase as the probability of the OP tone increases, providing strong evidence that these neurons encode stimulus probability. This significant relationship confirmed the robustness of the probability-encoding property, which is likewise replicated in the analysis of PEONEVEN on ODD trials and PEONALL using all trials (see S2 Fig). From here onward, we present the results from the PEONODD group. Equivalent analyses for PEONEVEN and PEONALL are provided in the S2–S5 Figs to further support the robustness and generalizability of our findings. To investigate the anatomical basis of predictive coding in the auditory system, we analyzed the laminar and areal distribution of PEONODD. We used current source density (CSD) analysis of local field potential (LFP) responses to determine cortical layer depths and categorized neurons into layers based on established criteria (see “Methods”). Fig 2E illustrates the distribution of these neurons across cortical depths, demonstrating that PEONODD are distributed across all cortical layers, with a higher proportion found in the supragranular (16.2%) and granular (13.4%) layers compared to the infragranular layers (9.8%). A similar distribution was also discovered from PEONEVEN and PEONALL (see S3 Fig). To assess whether these distributions differed significantly from a random distribution, we performed a two-sided bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. The analysis revealed a marginal trend in the supragranular layer (p = 0.058) and a significant difference in the infragranular layer (p = 0.029), whereas the granular layer did not show a significant deviation (p = 0.62). Further examination of these results indicated that PEONs were present at a lower-than-expected rate in the infragranular layer. We similarly examined neuron distribution across different auditory fields, summarized in Fig 2F, using bootstrap analysis with 300,000 samples. This analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of PEONs in A1 (p = 0.0036), whereas VAF (p = 0.9442) and AAF (p = 0.9926) did not show significant deviations from the distribution expected under the null hypothesis. Further examination suggested that PEONs were present at a higher-than-expected rate specifically in A1 relative to the other auditory fields. To confirm that PEONs encode negative prediction errors, it is essential to show that their responses to omissions increase over time as predictions are gradually formed, reflecting a growing discrepancy between the predicted and actual outcomes. We analyzed PEONODD from EVEN trials and focused on omissions of the OP tone in sequences where it was the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, and 95%), and therefore expected to evoke the largest omission responses. We grouped these responses by their sequence position and computed the mean firing rate (±standard error) for each bin. This grouping tests whether the omission response increases as more tones precede the omission, which is the expected pattern if these neurons are indeed signaling a negative prediction error that strengthens with increasing prediction. Our analysis revealed a notable pattern: the magnitude of the PEONs response to these omissions progressively increased throughout the sequence, achieving a steady state or plateau after approximately 400 standards were presented (Fig 3A). The dynamics of the trial-by-trial omission response were fitted by a logistic growth curve, expressed as: (A) Firing rate of PEONODD for omission events (on EVEN trials) in the four conditions where the OP tone was the standard (75%, 85%, 90%, 95%), grouped by sequence position. The x-axis represents the bin center (i.e., its sequence position), and the y-axis represents the firing rate in spikes per second. The black dots indicate the mean firing rate across all PEONODD for each bin, and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM), showing variability across neurons. The blue line represents the logistic growth curve fit to the data, illustrating how omission responses evolve over successive standards. Data were averaged across sequences where the OP tone was the standard (95%, 90%, 85%, and 75%). (B) Firing rate of PEONODD in response to the presentation of tones across the first 50 trials. The x-axis represents the trial number, and the y-axis represents the firing rate in spikes per second.

The blue line represents the exponential decay model’s fit to the data, indicating a rapid decline in response intensity over the initial trials as the neurons adapt to the repeated tone presentations.

The blue line represents the exponential decay model’s fit to the data, indicating a rapid decline in response intensity over the initial trials as the neurons adapt to the repeated tone presentations. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g003 where represents the firing rate as a function of n, and n is the bin center corresponding to the sequence position of the omissions (i.e., the number of tones presented preceding each omission). The logistic function depicts a saturating increase in response magnitude. Here, an R2 value of 0.51 indicates the model’s moderate success in capturing the variability in responses. To demonstrate that the observed increase in omission response was not caused by gradual changes in network activation over time, we also examined how PEONs responded to standard tones over the first 50 trials (Fig 3B). The results indicated a rapid decline in response intensity over successive trials. This decay was fitted using an exponential decay model: where is the firing rate at trial . An R2 value of 0.75, indicating a substantial fit to the data. As expected, this encapsulates the phenomenon of stimulus-specific adaptation or a decrease in positive prediction error, where the response to an expected stimulus diminishes rapidly. These trends were consistent also for PEONEVEN during ODD trials and PEONALL over all trials (see S4 Fig). Finally, we investigated whether PEONs are exclusively responsive to omissions or if they also react to tone stimuli. The population responses of PEONODD from EVEN trials revealed a pronounced asymmetry in omission and tone responses (Fig 4A, top). Omission responses showed tone selectivity based on probability: as described before for PEONODD, the response strength systematically increased with the probability of the OP tone. In contrast, tone-evoked responses for both OP and ONP tones exhibited an inverse relationship with probability. Specifically, the response to the OP tone (blue line) decreased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = –0.19, p = 2.1 × 10−8, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), showing adaptation to the increasingly standard OP tone (Fig 4A, bottom). Similarly, the response to the ONP tone (orange line) increased as the probability of the OP tone increased (Spearman’s ρ = 0.20, p = 6.7 × 10−9, n = 861, representing 123 neurons × 7 probability conditions), which means it also shows an inverse relationship with probability, but with respect to the ONP tone’s own decreasing probability, reflecting deviant detection of the increasingly rare ONP tone. In essence, PEONs selectively signal negative prediction errors only for OP tone omissions, while their responses to both tones exhibit symmetrical adaptation to the standard tone and deviant detection of the deviant tone, without tone-specific selectivity in the direction of probability modulation.

(C) The left chart categorizes the 90 PEONs validated on EVEN trials, meaning they were originally identified in ODD trials and continued to show significant omission responses to OP in EVEN trials (90 of 123 PEONODD). These neurons were divided into selective PEONs, which responded significantly to omissions only when OP was the standard, and non-selective PEONs, which exhibited significant omission responses when either OP or ONP was the standard. The right chart further classifies the 59 OP omission-selective PEONs based on their tone responses—those responding to both tones, only to the OP tone, only to the ONP tone, or to neither.

(C) The left chart categorizes the 90 PEONs validated on EVEN trials, meaning they were originally identified in ODD trials and continued to show significant omission responses to OP in EVEN trials (90 of 123 PEONODD). These neurons were divided into selective PEONs, which responded significantly to omissions only when OP was the standard, and non-selective PEONs, which exhibited significant omission responses when either OP or ONP was the standard. The right chart further classifies the 59 OP omission-selective PEONs based on their tone responses—those responding to both tones, only to the OP tone, only to the ONP tone, or to neither. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g004 When examining individual neurons, we found that, as expected from the definition of PEONs, their omission responses were highly selective. A substantial proportion of PEONs detected the absence of one tone while responding to both. This is illustrated in Fig 4B, which shows the responses on EVEN trials of an example PEONODD. This neuron’s omission response (left column) increased with OP probability, exhibiting robust firing at high probabilities (90%–95%). Despite its selective omission response, it showed significant responses to both OP tone (center column) and ONP tone (right column), especially when the tone probabilities were low (5%–10%). To ensure that the selectivity observed in omission responses is not merely due to residual effects from the previous trial’s tone responses—such as lingering activity or altered baseline activity—we verified that omission selectivity is independent of tone selectivity. To do this, we measured the omission selectivity index (OSI) and the tone selectivity index (TSI) for each PEON (see details in “Methods”). The results showed no significant correlation between OSI and TSI across the PEON population (Spearman’s ρ = –0.03, p = 0.78, n = 123 neurons). This lack of correlation indicates that a PEON’s preference for a specific tone (e.g., Tone A over Tone B) does not predict its preference for the omission of that tone. Therefore, omission selectivity was not a residual effect from the previous trials. To quantify this selectivity across the population, we examined how many PEONs exhibited significant omission responses under different conditions. Out of 123 PEONODD, 90 demonstrated significant OP-omission responses in EVEN trials (with an additional 5 showing significant responses only to ONP omissions). Of these 90 neurons with OP omission responses, 59 (66%) were selective for OP omissions, whereas 31 (34%) were non-selective, exhibiting significant omission responses for both tones (Fig 4C, left). To further characterize the omission-selective group, we examined their responses to tone presentations to determine whether they responded exclusively to one tone or to both (Fig 4C, right), 41 (or 69%) exhibited significant responses to both the OP and ONP tones across experimental conditions (see details in “Methods”). Additionally, 3 PEONs responded exclusively to the OP tone, 9 solely to the ONP tone, and 6 did not significantly respond to either tone. Similar trends in tone responses were observed when validating PEONEVEN validated on ODD trials and in PEONALL (see S5 Fig). In both cases, most omission-selective neurons responded to both tones, while smaller subsets responded exclusively to one tone or to neither. This consistency across datasets further supports the robustness of the omission response selectivity and its relationship to tone-evoked activity. In summary, these characteristic responses—observed in a considerable subpopulation of individual PEONs, which are selective for omissions but broadly responsive to tones—mirror the population responses and indicate an intriguing functional asymmetry. This raises the question of how computational principles and circuitry give rise to this phenomenon. To further understand how PEONs, which we presume to be negative prediction-error neurons, can display this observed asymmetry in top–down and bottom–up processing, we developed a neural circuit model consisting of multiple streams within a “predictive-coding module” (Fig 5A). This model was based on the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes a circuit module that integrates negative prediction error computation [6].

(E) Distance-dependent properties of lateral connections, showing delay and weight as a function of the distance between streams (see more details in “Methods”). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g005 Each predictive-coding module includes six leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons divided into two streams: one stream calculates the positive prediction error and upregulates the prediction, while the other stream calculates the negative prediction error and downregulates the prediction. A sensory neuron (denoted as I) receives the sensory signal and propagates the information in a bottom–up manner. In contrast, a prediction neuron (P) receives the prediction signal and propagates the information in a top–down manner. A positive prediction-error neuron (PE+) receives excitatory synaptic input from the sensory neuron and is suppressed by the prediction neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I+). Conversely, a negative prediction-error neuron (PE–) receives excitatory synaptic input from the prediction neuron and is suppressed by the sensory neuron via an inhibitory interneuron (I–). All synaptic connections are static synapses that include three variables: synaptic weight, time constant, and synaptic delay (see details in “Methods”). The activity of PE+ enhances the prediction signal through excitatory analog feedback, while the activity of PE– suppresses the prediction signal via inhibitory analog feedback. In our simulation, the sensory signal was designed to replicate the experiment, featuring an analog pulse stimulus with an intensity of S_strength (ranging between 0 and 1) and a duration of 20 ms, delivered with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 150 ms (see Fig 5B, top). Conversely, the prediction signal was modeled as a similar analog pulse as the sensory signal, but varied in intensity (P_strength), which could be enhanced by excitatory feedback from PE+ or diminished by inhibitory feedback from PE– (Fig 5B, bottom). It is important to recognize that our model assumes the temporal profile of the prediction signal is learned through a separate mechanism, while the predictive-coding module adjusts only the signal’s magnitude based on prediction error. Predictive coding modules from different streams, each processing a specific frequency according to a tonotopic organization, are interconnected through lateral excitatory synaptic connections. These connections run from PE+ of one module to PE– of another (as illustrated between streams A and B in Fig 5C). Intuitively, this setup enables PEONs, represented as PE–, in one stream to respond to stimuli in another stream, endowing them with a broader bottom–up receptive field. Moreover, this configuration allows an unexpected stimulus in one stream to inhibit the predictive signal in other streams. For example, as shown in Fig 5C, if the sensory signal in Stream B is unexpected, PE+ in Stream B will activate, causing PE– in Stream A to also activate through the lateral connection. This activation will then suppress the predictive signal in Stream A. Thus, when an unexpected Tone B is detected, indicating that Tone A (or other tones) is unlikely, the prediction for Tone A (or other tones) is consequently reduced. Conversely, since the absence of an expected Tone B does not necessarily suggest the presence of Tone A (or other tones), our model does not include lateral connections running from PE– to PE+. Our comprehensive model includes five streams: Stream 2 is tuned to detect the OP tone (Tone A), while Stream 4 detects the ONP tone (Tone B) (see Fig 5D). The model incorporates a simple receptive field structure for sensory signals. Specifically, Stream 2 receives Tone A at full strength (S_strength = 1), whereas the adjacent Streams 1 and 3 receive Tone A at half strength (S_strength = 0.5). Similarly, Stream 4 receives Tone B at full strength, and the adjacent Streams 3 and 5 receive Tone B at half strength. Additionally, the model features lateral excitatory connections between streams that are distance-specific (Fig 5E). The synaptic delay between any two streams is proportional to their spatial separation, and the synaptic weight decreases with the inverse square of their distance (see more details in “Methods”). We conducted multiple simulations using the model, each featuring unique probability combinations of tones A and B, along with a consistent 5% omission rate, mirroring the conditions of our rodent experiments. Each simulation included 500 stimuli—either tone A, B, or an omission (O)—across a total of 75 s. Importantly, every simulation began with no initial predictions across all streams (P_strength = 0). Here, we demonstrate the model’s responses using the example where the sensory inputs consist of 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, randomly ordered as shown in Fig 6A. The spiking activities of Neurons I, P, PE+, and PE− across the five streams are illustrated in Fig 6B. Notably, Neuron P began firing after a few seconds, particularly in Streams 1–3, which are responsive to Tone A. This activity indicated that the prediction for Tone A was beginning to be established. Consequently, the positive prediction error, reflected by PE+’s spiking activity, began to diminish. Additionally, the spiking activity of PE−, primarily associated with the omission of Tone A, was also observed in Streams 4 and 5. This was largely due to lateral connections from PE+ in Streams 1–3. The prediction signals across the five streams, detailed in Fig 6C, show that P_strength increased and plateaued in Streams 1–3, caused by PE+’s firing, with Stream 2 displaying the highest value.

Our goal was to reproduce the experimentally observed asymmetry: selective responses to omissions of the preferred tone, but broad responses to both tones. The raster plots of this PEON, presented in Fig 6D for a simulation containing 90% A, 5% B, and 5% O, characterize responses to different stimuli: Tones A, B, and omissions O. The PSTH reveals that while the PEON consistently responded to omissions, it did not respond to Tone A (in later trials), which was anticipated. Importantly, the PEON did respond to Tone B, a response enabled by lateral connections. In Fig 6E, we present raster plots from a different simulation with 5% A, 90% B, and 5% O. Similar to the previous simulation, the PEON in Stream 2 responded to Tone B via lateral connections. It also reacted to Tone A, facilitated by the lateral connections from nearby Streams 1 and 3, where PE+ was activated by the deviant Tone A. Notably, there was no response to omissions, as the prediction in Stream A was not effectively established due to the minimal occurrence of only 5% A. In conclusion, the PEON in Stream 2 demonstrated the asymmetry of receptive fields in bottom–up sensory and top–down predictive processing, reflecting the findings in the rodent experiment. Note that this asymmetry requires that the weights of the lateral excitatory connections from nearby neurons (as shown in Fig 5E) exceed the inhibitory weights within the module (see S1 Table). This setup ensures that sensory inputs from the neighboring streams can overcome inhibition to elicit a response on PEONs. When the number of lateral neighbor neurons increases (there are only two in our model), reduced excitatory weights can remain effective. Furthermore, we believe these lateral connections could be activity-dependent (e.g., via spike-timing-dependent plasticity) and further refined through self-organization. However, this lies beyond the scope of our current study. To assess the validity of the proposed model with lateral connections (the model labeled “Lateral PE+ to PE–”), we evaluated two alternative models and compared their predictions against the experimental data. The alternatives included: a model with lateral connections from Neuron I to PE– across different streams (termed “Lateral I to PE–”, depicted in Fig 7A), and a model with no lateral connections at all (referred to as “No lateral”). For each model, we measured the responses of the PEON in Stream 2 to Tones A, B, and omission O under different probabilities of Tone A (Prob(A)): from 0% (95% B and 5%O) to 95% (0% B and 5%O). The results are shown in Fig 7B, together with the correlation between the firing rate and Prob(A).

Top panels show the firing rates of PEON in Stream 2 in response to Tone A (red), Tone B (blue), and omissions (O, gray) across varying probabilities of Tone A (Prob(A)). Bottom panels display correlations between firing rates and probabilities for Tones A, B, and omissions for each model. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003242.g007 In our proposed model, the PEON’s response to omission significantly correlated with Prob(A) (Spearman’s ρ = 0.79, p = 2.1 × 10−108, n = 500 trials; see “Methods” for further details), indicating that the PEON did encode the probability of the stimulus within its stream. For Tone A, the PEON exhibited reduced responses as Prob(A) increased, demonstrating a significant negative correlation between firing rate and Prob(A) (r = –0.73, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). This occurred because PE+ in nearby Streams 1 and 3 detected less surprise at higher Prob(A) values, leading to less activation of the PEON in Stream 2 through lateral connections (as also noted in Fig 5E). Conversely, for Tone B, the PEON’s response positively correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.81, p < 1 × 10-250, n = 4,750 trials). At higher Prob(A) values, Tone B emerged as the deviant tone. This led to an enhanced detection of surprise by PE+ near Stream 4 for Tone B, which subsequently activated the PEON in Stream 2 more strongly through lateral connections. In the alternative “Lateral I to PE–” model, the PEON’s response to omission was also correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 500 trials). For Tone A, unlike the proposed model, the PEON in Stream 2 did not exhibit decreased responses at high Prob(A) values. This occurred because the PEON directly received sensory input from Neuron I, which remained unchanged across different Prob(A) settings. Despite this, a positive correlation between the firing rate and Prob(A) was observed (r = 0.82, p = 4.3 × 10−123, n = 4,750 trials). This was due to slightly increased responses from Neuron I in nearby Streams 1 and 3, which were caused by an elevated membrane potential resulting from frequent stimulation by Tone A. Conversely, for Tone B, the opposite effect occurred: Neuron I near Stream 4 showed an increase in membrane potential due to frequent stimulation of Tone B at low Prob(A) levels. Therefore, despite only minor changes in firing rate across different Prob(A) values, a negative correlation was observed (r = –0.42, p = 3.5 × 10−204, n = 4,750 trials). In the alternative “No lateral” model, the PEON’s response to omission correlated with Prob(A) (r = 0.38, p = 9.2e−19, n = 500 trials), as this encoding occurs within the stream without the need for lateral connections. For Tone A, the PEON displayed no responses, which was anticipated since it could only react to an omission in the absence of lateral connections. For Tone B, the PEON exhibited similar responses as to omissions, since in Stream 2, any stimulation differing from Tone A was treated as an omission. Consequently, a similar positive correlation was observed (r = 0.58, p < 1 × 10−250, n = 4,750 trials). To validate these models, each demonstrating unique encoding characteristics, we compared them to data from our rodent experiment. In our analysis, Tones A and B corresponded to the OP and ONP Tones, respectively. The correlation patterns we observed in our experimental data (see Fig 4A) align closely with the predictions of our proposed model. The positive correlation for omission responses, negative correlation for responses to OP tone, and positive correlation for responses to ONP tone are all successfully captured by the model with lateral PE+ to PE− connections. These results support the proposed model with its lateral connections facilitating positive prediction errors, distinguishing it from the alternative models. The models discussed so far have not taken into account that the strength of sensory signals could diminish due to frequent exposure to a specific stimulus. To address this, we analyzed responses from neurons in the thalamus (n = 130 neurons) across various probabilities of the OP Tone (see S6A Fig and “Methods” for details). Accordingly, we modeled the sensory signal strength, S_strength, as a function of Prob(A) (S6B Fig) and conducted simulations. By simulating various levels of sensory adaptation (see “Methods”), our results reaffirmed that only the proposed model successfully replicated the probability encoding characteristics observed in the rodent data (S6C Fig). Our next step was to explore the potential computational benefits of the proposed lateral connections, particularly in terms of enhancing prediction encoding. How do these connections influence prediction signals? Without lateral connections, not only would Stream 2 predict Tone A, but also the neighboring streams (e.g., Stream 1), due to their broad sensory receptive fields receiving half-strength sensory signals. However, with lateral connections, these predictions are reduced not only by the omission of Tone A but also by the presence of Tone B. Particularly, we theorized that this additional reduction would suppress the already low prediction signals in the neighboring streams. This leads to a scenario where the prediction signal is predominantly strong in Stream 2, thus resulting in a more precise encoding of Prob(A) across streams. To test this, we first assessed the steady value of P_strength after the prediction signal stabilized across various stimulation sequences (as in Fig 6C). These sequences varied Prob(A) from 0% to 95%, with increments of 1%. In Fig 8A, we plotted the time courses of P_strength for each 75-s simulation under different Prob(A) settings, focusing on Stream 2, where our target PEON was situated, and the adjacent Stream 1. For comparison, the time courses for Streams 1 and 2 in the model without lateral connections (“No lateral”) are shown in Fig 8B. The steady value of P_strength was determined by averaging values over the last 50 s (from 25 to 75 s). It was plotted as a function of Prob(A) for both models, with and without lateral connections, across Streams 1 and 2 (as shown in Fig 8C). In both streams, P_strength increased as Prob(A) rose. However, the increase was less pronounced in the model with lateral connections, especially at lower Prob(A) values. We further analyzed the contrast in P_strength between Streams 1 and 2 by calculating the decibel value (logarithmic ratio of P_strength in Stream 2 to that in Stream 1). This contrast was significantly greater in the model with lateral connections compared to the model without, particularly when Prob(A) was less than 0.5 (Fig 8D). This suggested that the lateral connections enhance the contrast of prediction signals across streams.

This is supported by the observation that P_strength was generally lower with lateral connections (as shown in Fig 8C). To investigate this further, we measured P_strength across Prob(A) for all streams in both models (Fig 8E) and then calculated the average P_strength across streams for each Prob(A) setting (Fig 8F). The findings suggest that with lateral connections, the network requires less “energy” or smaller prediction signals to effectively encode sequences, particularly in less predictable scenarios where the occurrences of Tones A and B are equal, such as Prob(A) = 0.5. This demonstrates a more efficient encoding strategy. Conversely, without lateral connections, the network expends more energy to manage more unpredictable sequences. This study aimed to understand how negative prediction-error neurons in the rat auditory cortex respond. We combined electrophysiological recordings with computational modeling to demonstrate an asymmetry in prediction-error signaling, which we attribute to “lateral prediction suppression” where positive and negative prediction errors interact through lateral connections to enhance the precision and efficiency of prediction encoding. Omission paradigms are a powerful tool for isolating negative prediction-error signals, as they eliminate the confounding influence of sensory input present in positive prediction error paradigms (e.g., oddball sequences). In human studies using EEG and MEG, mismatch negativity (MMN) responses to unexpected omissions in tone sequences have been reported, which are interpreted as evidence for predictive coding mechanisms [17,20,22–24,33]. More recently, single-neuron recordings in animals have begun to reveal the neural mechanisms underlying these auditory prediction errors. Studies have reported omission-responsive neurons in the auditory cortex of both awake and anesthetized rodents. One study found that 35.6% of neurons in awake animals and 19.5% of neurons in anesthetized rats and mice exhibited significant responses to the omission of expected tones [34,35]. Another study, using more complex stimuli involving the omission of expected gaps within auditory sequences, also demonstrated robust omission responses in unanesthetized rats [25]. Alongside these auditory findings, multiple studies in mouse visual cortex have documented sensorimotor prediction-error signals, specifically negative prediction errors, in response to unexpected reductions in expected sensory input [7,36,37]. These studies demonstrate that neurons in V1 exhibit negative mismatch responses when expected visual flow is weakened or omitted during locomotion. A molecularly distinct population of neurons in V1 has been identified that selectively responds to unexpected omissions of predicted visual stimuli [9] Extending this sensorimotor framework to the auditory system, a recent study showed that neurons in the auditory cortex responded to unexpected reductions in movement-contingent sound within a virtual reality environment, signaling a negative prediction error [28]. Building upon this foundation, our study’s conceptual advance stems from our paradigm design that systematically varies tone probabilities while maintaining consistent omission rates, allowing us to characterize negative prediction error as a continuous, probability-encoding mechanism rather than simply a binary deviance detector. This approach also reveals the dynamic nature of these prediction signals, which develop gradually through repeated exposure to statistical patterns in the environment. The subsequent sections will explore how these findings, along with our observations of asymmetry in predictive processing, led us to develop a circuit-level model that offers a new perspective on information flow in predictive coding networks. Our model builds upon the framework proposed by Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, which describes predictive coding as a canonical cortical computation [6]. Their model emphasizes hierarchical processing with distinct neuron populations computing positive and negative prediction errors. Consistent with this framework, our findings provide evidence for both types of prediction error in the rat auditory cortex. While we focused on characterizing negative prediction errors in PEONs, we also observed oddball responses in the broader population of non-PEON neurons (S7 Fig), with enhanced responses to unexpected tones. Since such responses have been interpreted as positive prediction-error signals in previous studies, we infer that at least some of these neurons encode positive prediction error [16,18,38–41]. More importantly, our model additionally describes how predictive coding modules, which process bidirectional information, interact both vertically and horizontally across sensory streams. This provides a means for prediction errors to integrate across bottom–up receptive fields. Moreover, we hypothesize that there is also a receptive field for top–down signaling. Traditionally, a neuron’s receptive field is defined by the range of external stimuli that can directly evoke its activity, a concept rooted in bottom–up sensory processing. However, neurons like PEONs are influenced not only by bottom–up sensory input but also by prediction signals generated in other brain areas. Therefore, their effective response properties – what we might term their “predictive field” – are shaped also by the specificity of the prediction. We believe that the asymmetry between the bottom–up receptive field and the top–down predictive field provides a means to integrate predictions and prediction errors, and that it could be inverted (i.e., a larger predictive field than receptive field) at other hierarchical levels. Our circuit model proposes that unexpected stimuli in one frequency stream inhibit predictive signals in adjacent streams via lateral prediction suppression. This enhances the contrast between the predicted frequency and others, sharpening the prediction signal and facilitating more efficient updates to the internal model, conceptually analogous to lateral inhibition in sensory systems, which serves to enhance the contrast of bottom–up sensory input [42]. That is, the lateral prediction suppression we propose for the top–down predictive field is functionally analogous to lateral inhibition in the bottom–up receptive field. Biological evidence strongly supports the existence of excitatory lateral connections between adjacent frequency channels in A1. These connections play a crucial role in spectral integration and the processing of complex auditory stimuli [43–45]. Anatomical studies have revealed that pyramidal neurons in A1 exhibit long-range horizontal collaterals that form connections across different frequency representations, often aligning with isofrequency bands [46,47]. Physiological investigations have demonstrated that these intracortical pathways contribute significantly to the breadth of subthreshold frequency receptive fields, which can span up to five octaves [48,49]. The strength and probability of these connections are distance-dependent, with stronger and more probable connections between neurons tuned to close frequencies, weakening as the frequency distance increases [50,51]. This organized network of lateral connections facilitates the integration of spectral information across different frequency channels, supporting complex auditory processing and cortical plasticity in A1. Similar patterns of lateral connectivity have been observed in other sensory modalities, such as orientation-specific connections in visual cortex [52] and whisker-related connections in somatosensory barrel cortex [53], suggesting a common organizational principle across different sensory areas. The development of these lateral connections might involve both innate and learned components. While the basic framework of these connections may be genetically predetermined, their refinement occurs during early postnatal development through experience-dependent plasticity [54]. This developmental process allows for the fine-tuning of these connections based on sensory experience, optimizing the auditory cortex for processing the specific acoustic environment encountered during critical periods of development. In our model, the one-way excitation from PE+ to PE− neurons allows for rapid recalibration of expectations across streams. This asymmetry enables efficient updating of predictions based on positive surprises while avoiding false alarms from mere absences. Integration across frequency channels enables complex interactions, with sequences of tones providing predictive information about subsequent tones. Naturalistic sounds like tone clouds can activate multiple streams simultaneously, leveraging the network’s capacity for sophisticated auditory processing [55]. Building upon these anatomical and functional observations of lateral connectivity, we can consider how our proposed circuit model might be interpreted through theoretical principles. The free energy principle [1,56] potentially offers an elegant explanatory framework for understanding why these lateral connections may have evolved. Could the lateral prediction suppression we observed be more than just a convenient circuit mechanism? When viewed through the lens of free energy minimization, these connections might represent an optimal solution for efficient predictive processing. In S1 Text, we provide a mathematical treatment that suggests when a simplified form of the free energy principle is applied to a two-tone paradigm similar to our experimental design, lateral interactions between prediction errors across different streams emerge naturally from the formalism. In our mathematical exploration, we considered a simplified generative model where auditory tones at different frequencies are represented as hidden variables with linear relationships to sensory inputs. By deriving the update rules for prediction signals under free energy minimization, we found that the resulting equations comprise three key components: updates based on prediction errors within the same frequency stream, lateral interactions of prediction errors across different frequency streams, and a temporal decay term. Notably, the lateral interaction term emerges from the correlation structure of sensory inputs across different frequencies—a statistical regularity well-documented in natural auditory environments [57]. These theoretical derivations align remarkably well with our proposed circuit model, where lateral connections between PE+ and PE− neurons across different frequency streams play a crucial role in shaping prediction signals. This theoretical perspective raises intriguing possibilities about why the brain might implement the asymmetric receptive fields we observed. The efficient coding strategy—where unexpected stimuli in one frequency channel not only signal prediction errors within that channel but also laterally modulate predictions in neighboring channels—could represent an evolutionarily advantageous solution for minimizing computational costs while maximizing predictive accuracy. Such a theoretical framing might also explain the directionality of lateral connections we proposed, flowing primarily from positive to negative prediction error neurons rather than bidirectionally. While experimental validation of these theoretical predictions remains a challenge for future work, the mathematical alignment between our empirical findings and free energy principles suggests that lateral prediction suppression could be a fundamental computational motif in predictive processing, potentially extending beyond the auditory system to other sensory modalities. Our finding that PEONs are more prevalent in granular and supragranular layers aligns with current views on the laminar organization of predictive coding circuits [4]. These layers are thought to be primary sites for prediction error computation and integration of top–down predictions with bottom–up sensory input. The relative scarcity of PEONs in infragranular layers suggests these neurons may be less involved in generating feedback predictions to earlier processing stages. Regarding their distribution across different auditory fields (A1, VAF, AAF), while PEONs were present in all areas examined, they showed a significantly higher proportion in A1 compared to VAF and AAF (based on bootstrap analysis). This potential enrichment in A1 might suggest functional specializations within primary auditory cortex related to negative prediction error signals, although the presence of PEONs across fields still supports the idea that predictive coding is a widespread cortical computation [6]. However, this raises questions about potential functional specializations not captured by our current paradigm. A notable feature of the PEON omission responses is their shape; rather than exhibiting a sharp, transient peak as seen in typical tone responses, they often display a more gradual onset and prolonged duration [27,32,34] compared to both typical auditory evoked responses and the idealized, instantaneous prediction-error signals assumed in simplified predictive coding models, including our own. While our model effectively captures the probability encoding and asymmetry of PEON responses, it does not explicitly model the detailed temporal dynamics. Functionally, a more gradual negative prediction-error signal might help prevent drastic responses to slightly delayed expected input—contrasting with the rapid responses needed for unexpected stimuli. Furthermore, the negative prediction-error signal could reflect a prediction not only about the content (i.e., the tone) but also about its timing. In other words, the prediction signal could be gradually ramped up according to a hazard function, modeling how the brain adjusts its anticipation of an event as time passes [58–61], and the negative prediction-error signal could follow a similar pattern. We suspect that this ramp-up response involves a recurrent cortical circuit normally inhibited by sensory input; when the input is omitted and disinhibition occurs, the negative prediction-error signal gradually increases. Future computational modeling that explicitly incorporates recurrent connectivity and temporal integration mechanisms will be crucial for elucidating the precise neural mechanisms underlying this observed latency. A notable limitation of our study is the absence of explicit “prediction neurons” in both our experimental findings and computational model. While we identified neurons responding to prediction errors, we did not find neurons directly representing predictions about upcoming stimuli. Predictive signals might be generated in higher-order auditory areas, non-auditory regions providing top–down input, or encoded in a distributed manner across neuronal populations. Further computational modeling of distributed prediction encoding could help guide future experiments by suggesting specific patterns or population-level dynamics to look for in neural data. It is important to consider whether the observed omission responses might themselves be a prediction signal, rather than solely a prediction error. However, several aspects of the PEON activity argue against this interpretation. First, a prediction signal should precede the expected time of the stimulus, while PEON omission responses occur after the expected tone onset. Second, prediction signals should appear consistently across all trials, regardless of whether the stimulus is presented or omitted. Instead, we observe that PEONs exhibit markedly different activity patterns between presentation and omission trials—in some cases showing smaller responses when tones are presented compared to when they are omitted. Thus, the PEON activity pattern is more consistent with a negative prediction-error signal, reflecting the mismatch between expectation and reality, rather than just the expectation itself. Future research should address the limitations of our study, such as the potential effects of anesthesia on neural responses, by comparing findings with those from awake and behaving animals. Additionally, employing more complex stimuli and varying spectral distances between tones could further probe the limits of the proposed lateral prediction suppression mechanism. Another important direction is identifying the specific neuronal populations involved in prediction-error signaling. While our study focused on firing rate dynamics, different neuronal subtypes may play distinct roles in encoding positive and negative prediction errors. Techniques such as optogenetic tagging, juxtacellular recording, or genetic labeling could help determine whether PEONs correspond primarily to excitatory pyramidal neurons or specific subtypes of inhibitory interneurons, providing critical insights into the circuit mechanisms underlying predictive processing in the auditory cortex. All experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the ethical guidelines established by the Japanese Physiological Society for the care and use of animals in physiological studies. The experimental protocol was approved by the committee on the ethics of animal experiments at the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo (JA21-9). The study involved 10 male Wistar rats, aged 11–12 weeks, and weighing between 250 and 350 gms. The animals were housed in a carefully controlled environment with a 12-h light/dark cycle, ensuring optimal conditions for their well-being. Food and water were provided ad libitum throughout the study. To minimize animal suffering, all surgical procedures were conducted under appropriate anesthesia. Upon completion of the experiments, the animals were humanely euthanized using an overdose of pentobarbital sodium (160 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally), following established guidelines for the humane termination of animal studies. The rats were anesthetized using urethane, with an initial dose of 1.5 g/kg administered intraperitoneally and supplementary doses of 0.5 g/kg provided as needed to ensure stable and deep anesthesia. This depth of anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of corneal and pedal reflexes. The animals were secured using a custom-made head-holding apparatus. Atropine sulfate (0.1 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously at the onset of the procedure to reduce bronchial secretion viscosity. Local anesthetic xylocaine (0.3–0.5 ml) was applied at the incision site before making the skin incision. A needle electrode was inserted subcutaneously into the right forepaw to serve as ground. A small craniotomy was performed near the bregma landmark to place a reference electrode, ensuring electrical contact with the dura. A larger craniotomy was performed over the right auditory cortex (4.0 mm posterior and 6.0 mm lateral to bregma), and the right temporal muscle, cranium, and dura covering the auditory cortex were surgically removed. The exposed cortical surface was kept moist with saline to prevent drying. Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid drainage was conducted to minimize cerebral edema. Throughout the experiment, an adequate and stable level of anesthesia was ensured by monitoring the animals’ respiratory rate, heart rate, and hind-paw withdrawal reflexes. Neuronal activity was recorded using both a custom-designed surface microelectrode array [62] and a Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array (IMEC, Belgium) [63]. To record neuronal activity epipially over the auditory cortex, a surface array (NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) comprising 64 platinum electrodes was employed. Each electrode had a diameter of 100 μm and a center-to-center distance of 500 μm, covering an area of 4.5 × 3.0 mm. The array featured 0.3-mm diameter holes between the electrodes to allow the insertion of a Neuropixels array. Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) were recorded using amplifiers with a gain of 1,000, a digital filter bandpass of 0.3–500 Hz, and a sampling frequency of 1 kHz, employing the Cerebus Data Acquisition System (Blackrock Microsystems LLC, Salt Lake City, UT, USA). We mapped the click-evoked responses to pinpoint the location of the auditory cortex (AC). A click was defined as a monophasic positive wave lasting 20 ms. 60 clicks were administered at a rate of 1 Hz, and LFPs were recorded. The peak amplitude of the middle-latency auditory-evoked potential (P1) within the first 50 ms following the stimulus onset was measured from the grand averaged LFP. To identify three subfields within the AC—A1, AAF, and VAF—we analyzed the spatial distribution of the P1 response. For recording neuronal activity across different cortical layers, we used the Neuropixels 1.0 electrode array [63]. The array features 384 active recording sites (out of 960 sites total) located at the bottom approximately 4 mm of an approximately 10 mm shank (70 µm wide, 24 µm thick, 20 µm electrode spacing), with the reference and ground, shorted together. The probe’s ground and reference pads were soldered to a pin, which was then connected to a skull screw on the animal. Recordings were made in internal reference mode. Data acquisition for the Neuropixels arrays was performed using Neuropixels version 1.0 acquisition hardware, specifically the National Instruments PXIe-1071 chassis and PXI-6133 I/O module for recording analog and digital inputs (Neuropixels version 1.0, IMEC, Belgium). The signal was collected from the most distal 384 recording sites (bank 0) at a 30 kHz sampling rate. Raw voltage traces from the Neuropixels arrays were filtered, amplified, multiplexed, and digitized on-probe. Data acquisition and initial processing were managed using Open Ephys software (www.open-ephys.org). Spike sorting was conducted using Kilosort 3 [64], and further manual curation was performed with Phy software (https://phy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This process involved removing artifacts, merging duplicate clusters, and discarding units with insufficient refractory periods, intermingled waveforms, or unstable firing patterns. Only well-isolated neurons meeting strict inclusion criteria were retained for analysis. The cortical depth of the recording site, estimated via CSD analysis, had to be within 0 µm to +1,800 µm from the pial surface. The lower bound of 1,800 µm was chosen to confine recordings to the auditory cortex, preventing the inclusion of neurons from subcortical areas or unintended regions. Additionally, neurons had to fire at least 200 spikes per session to ensure sufficient statistical power, while those exhibiting strong drift in firing rate or waveform shape were excluded to maintain stationarity. To assess the frequency-tuning properties of all recorded neurons, we measured the frequency response area (FRA) at each recording site. The auditory stimuli consisted of pure tone bursts with a 5-ms rise/fall time and a 20-ms steady-state duration. The tones covered a wide range of frequencies, spanning 18 distinct values from 1.6 to 64 kHz, and were presented at seven different sound pressure levels, ranging from 20 to 80 dB SPL in 10-dB steps. In total, 126 unique tone bursts were used to characterize the FRA. The stimuli were delivered in a pseudorandom sequence with an inter-tone interval of 600 ms, and each tone was repeated 20 times. FRA maps were generated for each neuron based on their responses to the presented tones. After examining the FRA maps, we selected two tones that were one octave apart and elicited robust responses from most recorded neurons. These two tones were then used as the stimuli for the subsequent experiments investigating the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions using an intensity well above the threshold of a typical neuron. To investigate the neural responses to tone sequences and omissions, we designed eight experimental conditions, each employing an oddball paradigm with two distinct tones and a fixed 5% probability of tone omissions. The stimuli were the two sinusoidal tones chosen before with a duration of 50 ms, including 5-ms rise and fall ramps. These tones were arranged in sequences of 1,000 stimuli, with an SOA of 150 ms. In the first condition, one tone (Tone A) comprised 95% of the sequence, while the other tone (Tone B) was absent. Across the subsequent conditions, the proportion of Tone B gradually increased by 5% increments, while the proportion of Tone A decreased accordingly. This resulted in the following sequences: This design allowed us to systematically manipulate the relative probabilities of the two tones while maintaining a consistent rate of omissions. By progressively shifting the balance between the tones across conditions, we could examine how the neural responses to tone omissions were influenced by the statistical context provided by the sequence. Omission response was defined as the firing rate measured in a 5–120 ms post‐omission window, with a local baseline subtracted on a per‐trial basis. The baseline was computed as the mean firing rate within a −24 ms to +5 ms window relative to the expected tone onset, a period that closely reflects the neuron’s state immediately prior to the omitted tone and controls for transient adaptations or fluctuations that might occur mid‐sequence. The computed baseline was then subtracted from the mean firing rate obtained during the post‐omission period, yielding a final omission response value that was typically around zero when the neuron exhibited no net change in firing rate. Although we corrected responses using this immediate pre‐omission baseline, we also examined pre‐sequence spontaneous firing rates and observed no correlation between those rates and omission responses (see S8 Fig). This methodology is consistent with established work [32], which demonstrated robust omission responses using a similar immediate reference period. To examine the presence of distinct groups based on the strength of the correlation between each neuron’s omission response and predictability of OP tone, we performed k-means clustering on the correlation coefficients. Thus, neurons encoding predictability exhibited either strong positive or strong negative correlations. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the elbow method, which identifies the “knee point” in the plot of within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters. The knee point suggests the optimal number of clusters where adding more clusters does not significantly improve the model’s fit to the data (see S1 Fig). The k-means clustering analysis was performed using the k-means function in MATLAB with 10 replicates for each cluster number. The WCSS was calculated for each cluster number, and the optimal number of clusters was determined by finding the knee point in the WCSS plot. The clustering results were then visualized using histograms to display the distribution of correlation coefficients within each cluster. To mitigate potential biases such as double dipping—where the same data are used both to select and evaluate effects—and to ensure the robustness of our probability encoding analysis, we employed a split‐half approach. For each probability condition, the 50 omission trials were divided into two equal halves—an odd‐indexed “training set” and an even‐indexed “testing set,” with each set providing 25 omission trials per condition. Using only the training set, we computed Spearman’s rank correlation between each neuron’s omission response and the probability condition. Neurons with a significant correlation (p < 0.05) were provisionally labeled as “correlated,” and the OP tone for each neuron was defined based on the direction of the correlation in the training data. From this subset of correlated neurons, we then pooled the training‐set trials in the conditions where the OP was standard (75%–95%) and applied a one‐sample Wilcoxon sign‐rank test (p < 0.05) to determine whether their omission response was significantly above zero. Because the omission response is computed as the firing rate minus a local baseline, testing against zero effectively assesses whether post-omission activity exceeds the neuron’s immediate pre-omission baseline. Only neurons that exhibited both a significant correlation and a robust omission response were designated as PEONs in the training set. All subsequent population plots—such as boxplots or group correlations—were generated solely from the testing set, ensuring that any observed trends were unbiased by the training‐set selection process. Complementary analyses were also carried out using even‐indexed trials for training (with odd‐indexed trials for testing) as well as a non‐split method utilizing all trials; these additional analyses, presented in the in S2–S5 Figs, confirm that our main conclusions do not depend on the specific trial split. To ensure that neuronal responses across different tone probability conditions were not biased by differences in statistical power due to varying trial counts, we implemented a standardized subsampling procedure. For each neuron, within each condition, we limited the analysis of tones to 50 trials per stimulus type to prevent conditions with more trials from exerting disproportionate influence. If more than 50 trials were available, we selected every k-th trial, where k was chosen to achieve 50 trials (e.g., for 100 trials, k = 2; for 200 trials, k = 4, etc.). This ensured that all conditions were analyzed with equal statistical power. For analyses comparing tone responses with the split-half approach used for PEON identification and characterization (see “PEON Identification” section), an additional subsampling step was performed. After the initial reduction to 50 trials per condition, the remaining trials were further divided into ODD and EVEN subsets, with each subset matched to the corresponding half used for omission responses. For each PEON and each repetition, omission responses were extracted from the four conditions in which the OP tone was presented as the standard (i.e., 75%, 85%, 90%, and 95% OP tone). The omission responses were binned based on their sequence position, and for each bin the mean firing rate and standard error were computed, yielding a two-dimensional response matrix that captures the temporal evolution of omission responses. The mean omission response was then modeled with a logistic growth function using MATLAB’s nlinfit function. The model was defined as: FR(n) = a/[1 + exp(–b × (n – c))], where n represents the bin center corresponding to the sequence position, and a, b, and c are free parameters estimated from the data. The goodness-of-fit was assessed by calculating the R-squared value based on the residual and total sums of squares. To control for non-specific drift in neural activity, responses to standard tones during the first 50 trials were similarly analyzed. These responses were fitted with an exponential decay function of the form: FR(n) = d + e × exp(–f × n), where n denotes the trial number, and d, e, and f are free parameters. The fit quality was evaluated using the R-squared metric. To determine the laminar distribution of neurons, we adapted the methodology from Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. We used CSD analysis on local field potentials recorded with Neuropixels electrodes to identify cortical layer boundaries. The earliest clear current sink, typically corresponding to the border between layers 3 and 4, was used as a key marker. Individual neuron depths were estimated based on their distance from the probe tip, as determined by spike sorting. Neurons were then classified into supragranular (Layers 1–3), granular (Layer 4), and infragranular (Layers 5–6) layers. Cortical thickness and layer boundaries were set according to Shiramatsu and colleagues [62]. To assess the relationship between tone-evoked selectivity and omission selectivity, we computed selectivity indexes – TSI and OSI for each neuron. TSI was calculated as: and represent the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to the and tones, respectively, averaged across the seven probability conditions in which each tone was presented. OSI was calculated as: and denote the neuron’s mean firing rate in response to omissions occurring in the 4 sequences where the and tones were standard, respectively. To test whether a neuron’s tone selectivity predicted its omission selectivity, we computed Spearman’s correlation between TSI and OSI. We constructed a circuit of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons following with membrane time constant and membrane resistance . When , neurons emitted a spike () and were reset to for a refractory period of 2 ms. Synaptic currents and were modeled with instantaneous rise and exponential decay, and equivalently for , with time constants and . Spikes from presynaptic neurons were delivered with a synapse-specific delay and weight as detailed in S1 Table within each stream module. Lateral connections between streams and delivered spikes with delay and weight . Sensory stimulation was presented through the input neuron I by setting its to a constant (target stream) or (adjacent streams) for 20 ms. Similarly, prediction signals were fed to the P neuron by setting with identical timing. P_strength was initialized to 0 and updated by spikes in prediction neurons as follows: and clipped to ensure at all times. Both and were raised to their respective values for 20 ms at the start of each trial, then reset to for the remaining 130 ms. The model was written in Brian2 [65], which allowed calculating exact solutions for the internal neurons of the circuit (PE+, PE–, I+, I–). The remaining neurons (P and I), synapses and P_strength were integrated with a time step of 0.1 ms by forward Euler integration. Simulations were run over 500 trials. To model sensory adaptation, we adjusted the input by using an adaptation factor a, which is greater than zero, and a base firing factor b, which is between 0 and 1. The input strength for the A and B streams under different values of Prob(A) was adjusted as follows: Examples of S_strengthA versus Prob(A) are shown in S6 Fig, with 12 combinations of a (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5) and b (0.1, 0.3, 0.5). (A) The elbow method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for classifying neurons based on the correlation between omission response and OP tone probability. The x-axis represents the number of clusters, while the y-axis represents the WCSS, which measures clustering compactness. A sharp inflection point, or “elbow,” is observed at k = 2, indicating that a two-cluster solution best balances model complexity and explained variance.

The largest tokenized U.S. Treasury fund, the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), can now be used as collateral on two of the most active crypto trading platforms, Crypto.com and Deribit, issuer Securitize said in a Wednesday press release. The listings allow institutional traders to post BUIDL tokens as margin for leveraged trades on those two exchanges, while also earning yield on the underlying token. The tokenized Treasury market is one of the fastest-growing sectors among tokenized assets, growing about 400% in the past year to over $7 billion in market capitalization, rwa.xyz data show. These tokens let investors earn a yield on their idle cash, just like a money market fund, but without leaving the blockchain environment. They are also increasingly being used as collateral for trading. With $2.9 billion in assets, BUIDL is the largest of the tokenized Treasury funds and is backed by a short-term yield-bearing portfolio of cash and U.S. Treasuries. "Tokenized Treasuries are being actively used to improve capital efficiency and risk management across some of the industry’s most sophisticated trading venues, while still offering yield," Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said in the statement. "The [BUIDL] fund is evolving from a yield-bearing token into a core component of crypto market infrastructure."

Title: Globalist Finance-Capital Can’t Get Enough of War. “NATO’s Quest for War”. Ret Admiral Cem Gürdeniz

While the Ukraine War continues, Israel attacked Iran on June 13, 2025, citing the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) decision against Iran, which was taken with a small margin of votes, in a conjuncture where the US declared that the Nuclear Talks with Iran in Oman would continue. On the other hand, it has been revealed that the United States, although it knew that this attack would take place and supported it, gave the wrong messages to Iran under the guise of diplomacy and created a suitable smoke screen environment for Israel to provide tactical and even strategic surprises. Thus, while the Russia-Ukraine war as well as the biggest genocide in recent history in Gaza, continues a new and bigger front has been opened in West Asia. Although the ostensibly main reason is geopolitical, economic reasons are at least as important and even its twin brother. Throughout history, finance-capital has been on the side of wars, not peace. Because they work with the goal of constantly expanding earnings. Factories, arms manufacturers, banks want access to new markets, new sources of raw materials. Lenin described this feature of finance capital as the stage of “imperialism”. Finance capital has adopted the principle of waging wars for the world, colonies, raw material resources and new markets. Thus, from the hegemons with which they have a symbiotic relationship, they direct their surplus production to underdeveloped states through both borrowing and investments, and demand military intervention when necessary. This situation is carried out in harmony with the achievement of geopolitical goals of the hegemons. As long as geopolitics and finance-capital vision work in harmony, the hegemon continues to impose its global will. .

(VOA/Screengrab) . On the other hand, the world of finance and capital uses war as a means of overcoming the economic crises it faces. While wars overshadow economic crises, they serve as a new revival for the economy. For example, the United States survived the Great Depression of 1929 with the Second World War. The military industry is also one of the leading elements of finance capital, which wants war. Because as well as being a very lucrative sector, it also makes a great contribution to employment. Therefore, it is always essential for finance capital to always create enemies by maintaining the constant threat environment and to increase defense expenditures regularly. The hegemonic order of the United States functioned in this way, especially after the end of the Second World War. The state structure under the command of finance capital of the USA, which initially used the blood of its own children in Korea and Vietnam, abolished the compulsory military service system after 1973 and the majority started to use the cheap blood of other nations and organizations through proxy wars. Human life has no value for finance capital. The important thing in the plunder of weak countries is the multiplication of profits. It is not worth it if millions die for the gain to multiply. Today, the U.S. supports constant wars to keep Eurasia fragmented, to dominate the rimland geopolitics, to weaken the international transportation corridors led by China and Russia, and to break the influence of organizations such as BRICS and the SCO, in order to maintain its hegemony jointly with finance capital. Although Trump said during the election under the MAGA Slogan, that they would abandon these goals and withdraw into themselves and strengthen their economies primarily as a production and trade power, he has surrendered today. In 2024, the total economic size of the world was 110 trillion dollars at current prices. In response to this value created by real economies, as of 2024, the total contract value of interest-rate derivatives (IRS), currency derivatives and commodity/share-based derivatives of the finance-capital world was 730 trillion dollars. The owners of this value, which is based on 40 times the tangible assets and seven times the real economy, are the global finance capital oligarchy. The vast majority of these large assets are owned and controlled by American banks, huge financial firms such as the American BlackRock, the Soros Foundation, companies such as Rothschild & Co, the Edmond de Rothschild Group, techno-feudal SpaceX, Palantir and London-based (City), etc. As in the past, giant firms and multinational corporations that control finance capital can exert great pressure on governments. War or peace is decided by this structure, not democratically elected governments. Worse still, this structure, which advocates free elections under the discourse of democracy, decides who will come to power in which country. It can influence elections with its monetary power. He can buy politicians. He can make a coup. The vast majority of this structure is made up of people of Jewish origin who have been influential in the financial world for centuries, or groups such as Zionist loyalists or neoconservatives. The hard power of this structure consists of the American, British and Israeli armed forces and intelligence agencies, which are unconditionally linked to each other at the highest level. In the second layer, the extremist NATO structure with a gradual neocon tandem under the control of NATO Secretaries General (France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, 3 Baltic Republics, Sweden, Norway and Finland) and in the Indo-Pacific area, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Philippines, Australia, New Zealand takes place. Political pillars include EU governing bodies, American neocons belonging to the majority democratic party and partly republicans, Zionists and evangelicals as inseparable and indispensable allies of finance capital. Although Trump and the “America First” or MAGA group drew new road maps outside of finance-capital interests to recover the US economy, which had declined in production with a debt stock of 36 trillion dollars when they came to power, they could not impose their own will. They could not stop the Ukraine-Russia war or the genocide in Gaza. On the contrary, they encouraged Israel to attack Iran in a fierce manner. They retreated in all areas. Trump has done almost the opposite of what he said in his campaign promises. This situation is similar to the fact that all three presidents (JFK, LBJ, and Nixon) who came with the promise of ending the Vietnam War had to continue the war. Finance capital plays a major role in the election of elected presidents in the United States. As long as they serve their interests, they don’t cause problems. But anything can happen when presidents take a course that goes against the interests of finance capital and, most importantly, the interests of Israel. Because finance capital has infinite dollar power in its hands. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu thanked President Trump for his support, saying “Long live Israel, long live America” shortly after the June 13, 2025 Iran attack that will determine his political future. Trump also said that if Iran attacks American targets in the region, the United States will protect itself. Although US Secretary of State Rubio said that Washington was completely outside this process, it later turned out that Trump was aware of every stage. In fact, with his rhetoric of peace and negotiations, Trump has made a kind of mask for Israel’s attacks. It is known that Israel has been with Iran from the ammunition it uses to intelligence, air refueling and air/missile defense system support. In fact, it turned out that he had sent 300 Hellfire missiles to Israel weeks ago. On the other hand, Trump’s refusal to visit Israel during his visit to the Gulf countries in mid-May 2025 was considered a serious pressure message to Netanyahu. However, Trump paid the price for this move against the Zionists, who play a decisive role in American politics, with the riots that broke out in the country. Trump’s pressure on Netanyahu seems to have been lifted by the anti-ICE riots that began in Los Angeles and AIPAC’s financial influence in Congress. Trump failed to show the same resistance to Netanyahu as Obama, whom he criticized so much, in attacking Iran. It can be said that the Epstein files may have an impact as well as the role of pro-Israel financiers who provided Trump with large financial aid in this process. This shows that Trump is not as powerful in US politics as he claims. We can already say that in the new election cycle, the voters whom Trump promised to end the wars will abandon him. In fact, Israel has made a huge deal of a bid on Trump and the MAGA group. . California National Guard in front of protestors. (Public Domain) . Whether Trump wants it or not, he has become a slave to neocon and Zionist politics. From now on, Iran’s counterattacks and the intensity and tempo of the escalation will also affect Trump’s political future. If Iran attacks U.S. targets and there are U.S. casualties, that would put a strain on Trump and the MAGA group. If Iran retaliates and there are American casualties, Trump could suffer serious reputational damage in the process. Finance-capital does not care about this situation. A new president is found who will respond to his wishes. If the war turns into a protracted war of attrition, we can imagine that finance capital will be able to launch separatist movements and uprisings in Balochistan, Khuzestan and the Kurdish regions of Iran in coordination with MI6, the CIA and the Mossad, as long as the number of lost lives in Israel does not increase. On the other hand, what will happen after this attack is also very important for the future of the Iranian regime. Because, as always, Netanyahu is calling on the Iranian people to rise up in his speech. The Iranian people have not responded to these invitations in the past. On the contrary, hostility towards America and Israel has increased. This time, the attacks on nuclear facilities are in fact an attack on the reputation of the regime and the Iranian people. After the assassinations in the past, this time with the effect of killing many high-level people, this situation may strengthen the bond with the Iranian regime, on the contrary. Therefore, with the support of the people, the Iranian regime will be able to evaluate this attack as an existential attack and increase the escalation and spread the war. Moreover, the Iranian regime will be able to mobilize all its efforts towards the production of nuclear weapons from now on in order to survive. On the other hand, due to the Gaza genocide, Israel’s reputation and credibility in the international arena has been completely destroyed, except for the United States and a few European countries. There is no longer a state that values the unilateral legitimacy of the attacks of an aggressive and lawless state like Israel. The attitude of Russia, China and the Global South towards Israeli aggression will also be decisive in determining the future. . Fire after Israeli attack on 15 June 2025 (Licensed under CC BY 4.0) . Regional and global geopolitical dynamics are now turned upside down. Israel’s attack on Iran does not only affect the Middle East; it will affect continental balances, US-Russia-China relations and the “global race between the great powers”. This Israeli attack will prevent the United States from gathering energy against Russia and China. If Israel and the U.S. fail to achieve their political and military goals after this attack, and if the Iran-US conflict begins, China and Russia’s access to their geopolitical goals will accelerate. A build-up in the region to protect Israel would upset the balance of power in the Pacific theater of operations by the United States. This creates a huge vacuum for Europe and especially for NATO. This attack has opened Pandora’s box. The future of the Khamenei, Netanyahu and Trump regimes is now entirely dependent on Tehran’s decisions. If the escalation increases and the war spreads, Israel and the United States will be affected. If Iran backs down, the regime will collapse. NATO, under the command of Finance Capital, sees the continuation of wars as an existential necessity. NATO’s function came to an end in 1900 when the Berlin Wall fell and Germany was reunited. However, the opposite happened, NATO expanded. The number of members has increased from 16 states to 32 states today. Image: Mark Rutte (Screenshot von der NATO-Plattform) Since taking office on October 1, 2024, NATO Secretary General and former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has been making extraordinary efforts to ensure that NATO is not left without enemies. Even the fact that Russia has been turned into NATO’s worst enemy today does not satisfy him. Its main goal is to drag NATO and Russia into the Third World War, in which nuclear weapons will also be used. It continues all kinds of propaganda activities to increase the defense budgets of Canada and European NATO states without limits and almost foolishly making fools of its opponents. Last week at Chatham House, the Pax Britannica’s repository of imperialist minds and ideas, in the presence of British Prime Minister Starmer, the number one Russophobe and warmonger, he said: “NATO’s economic size is 25 times greater than Russia’s… 50 Trillion dollars. Russia’s economy is 2 trillion dollars… However, with this economic size, Russia produces 4 times the ammunition produced by NATO. If we want to keep our people safe, we have to increase our defense spending to 5% of our national income. You can choose not to do that, but in that case, you’d better start learning Russian.” The salaried officer of NATO does not get up to speed and adds. “It is restructuring Russia’s military and producing weapons much faster than expected… Russia could be ready to use military force against Nato within 5 years.” Rutte’s apparent goal is to persuade the 32 participating NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% at the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 24-25. Will it succeed? Hardly. The arguments of Rutte and his fellow London Financial Oligarchy and American neocon representatives will only be welcomed by the governments of states such as France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Greece, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, the three Baltic Republics, Sweden, Norway and Finland, which serve the interests of a handful of western oligarchs and neo-oligarchs rather than the interests of their own people. For the last three years, Rutte has been clinging to the propaganda of the US, the EU and the Zionist-controlled collective western media. It is almost peddling a third world war over the fear that Russia, which was deliberately antagonized by NATO’s unlimited expansion after 1999 and forced to make a move over Ukraine, would invade Europe. He is begging for the prolongation of the war in Ukraine. For the past 80 years, Europe has imported prosperity to its people under the security umbrella of the United States. Rutte wants shock treatment to change the 80-year-old habit and for Europe to stand on its own two feet without the United States. He says: “Every ally must do its part, because the United States has borne more than that burden. Europe and Canada will contribute more, while the United States will remain steadfast in its commitment to NATO. Russia is reorganizing its army with Chinese technology and producing weapons much faster than expected. Russia produces ammunition in three months as NATO produces in a year. This year, it is expected to produce 1500 tanks, 3 thousand armored vehicles and 200 Iskander missiles. Russia may be ready to use military force against NATO in 5 years. Let’s not kid ourselves, we are all on the eastern front now. The new generation of Russian missiles is traveling well above the speed of sound. Distances between European capitals are now measured in mere minutes. There is no distinction between east and west, there is only NATO… A 400 percent increase in air and missile defense is required. We see how Russia is spreading fear from the sky in Ukraine. Our armies need thousands of armored vehicles, tanks and millions of artillery shells. We must double our supporting capacities such as logistics, procurement, transport and health support. The Allies will invest in more warships and aircraft. For example, the allies of the United States will receive at least 700 F-35 fighter jets in total. We will also invest in more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-range missile systems. We will allocate more resources to space and cyber capabilities. What is clear is that if we don’t invest, our common defense will not be credible.” And where are these weapons mostly going to be bought? From the USA, of course. According to representatives of Finance Capital, NATO, which won the Cold War under the leadership of the United States, can do whatever it wants in the European security architecture. According to them, if the Soviets were destroyed without a single shot being fired, this should have continued and Russia should have collapsed as well. The goal was to force Russia into a Yugoslavia-like disintegration and integrate these parts into the western-centered economic and political structures of finance capital. However, this plan did not succeed. Because it is not easy to dismantle a nuclear state. North Korea is standing ground. Rutte’s biggest mistake is that he is making the capability comparison based on national income. The comparison should be made directly on the basis of combat capability. Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, which started with a special military operation (SMO) in 2022, opened a new window to the collective west. Cheap blood had been found. Through the Ukrainian regime, Ukrainians would serve US/EU geopolitics and finance capital. The US/EU has poured a huge number of weapons and financial aid into Ukraine. Up to a million Ukrainians have died. Although the war appears to be between Russia and Ukraine, in reality it is still partly between NATO and Russia. What I mean by partial NATO is that the war is being waged without full NATO consensus with the will of the governments in the London financial oligarchy and the US neo/Ziocon sphere of influence, such as the UK, the USA, Italy, France, Germany, Romania, Poland, the three Baltic Republics. Like former NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, Rutte is doing all kinds of stunts for the continuation of the war, even though he does not have the mandate and does not have the authority, and continues to reflect the will of the elite decision-making states within NATO, even though there are no NAC decisions. Turkey maintains its active neutrality thanks to the geopolitical leverage provided by the Montreux Convention on the Straits. However, no one should doubt that collective West is making every effort to remove this lever thanks to the mandate lovers among us. In the words of former secretary general Stoltenberg, NATO provides security for one billion. So the remaining seven billion doesn’t matter. For example, you will not hear any criticism from Rutte against Israel about the genocide in Gaza. Nor can you hear any criticism of last week’s denial of freedom of navigation in the international waters of the Eastern Mediterranean by the Israeli Navy with the argument of a preemptive blockade. In reality, NATO is protecting the interests of the 1% US/EU elite, not the one billion. Because this elite controls financial funds, stock markets and money markets seven times (670 trillion dollars) of the total global national income, that is, 107 trillion dollars. NATO is the instrument of this wheel to create and sustain wars. It needs constant threats. What Rutte says: “For example, the allies of the United States will receive at least 700 F-35 fighter jets in total. We will also invest in more unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and long-range missile systems. We will allocate more resources to space and cyber capabilities. What is clear is that if we don’t invest, our common defense will not be credible.” Yes, wars are the lifeblood of the military industrial structure. According to Rutte and his ilk, someone must die so that the factories can work. At the end of the wars, cheap raw material resources should be placed at the disposal of finance capital. It seems that a President like Trump, who came to power by challenging this structure with the slogan of MAGA, is not able to stop wars. The endless wars in Vietnam and Afghanistan are obvious. Wars don’t end when presidents say it’s okay. The oligarchic global finance ends with the decision of the capital structure and the war finance and industry. One façade closes, the other opens. In history, there have been states that have challenged the will of finance capital and hegemony. The best example is the Turkish War of Independence and India’s independence under the leadership of Gandhi. Today, the balances are changing rapidly. Russia, China, North Korea, Venezuela, Cuba and Iran have formed a front of resistance against this impudence, especially in recent years. In the meantime, Trump’s rhetoric and actions about Canada and Denmark (Greenland) cause serious fractures within NATO. However, I think that finance capital will avoid such statements, which will create a fracture within NATO with the discipline of Trump through the Los Angeles uprising, especially in the post-Israel-Iran war period. The US neo/ziocons who serve Israeli geopolitics and global finance capital interests have defeated Trump and the MAGA Group for today. Trump, is now a slave to Israel and neocon interests. After September 11, 2001, Israel and all the states around it was rendered no longer a threat to it. But Iran is different. First of all, it is not like the Arabs. It won’t be an easy bite. Turkey, on the other hand, is the target of the neocon and finance capital world with its obstacles to the establishment of a Kurdish state in the south, our military presence in the TRNC and Cyprus, the sovereign rights provided to us by the Montreux Convention in the Black Sea and the Blue Homeland theses. Today, if the financial capital world controlled by Israel, the US and the EU succeeds in regime change in Iran, they will undoubtedly turn to Turkey in the eastern Mediterranean with this energy and high morale. After the collapse of the Syrian regime, which was the most important buffer state between Turkey and Israel, Turkey became a neighbor of Israel (and therefore the American neocons and ziocons). This is not only a geographical rupture, but a strategic one. This situation shows that Turkey’s southern security doctrine has collapsed. Unfortunately, the interests of the United States and Israel have been served in this process. Israel attacked Iran on June 13 with 200 warplanes. Many of these planes used Syrian airspace. We have contributed to this situation. If Israel enters a confrontation with Turkey tomorrow, it will use Syrian airspace to access Turkey without hindrance. As Israel did to Iran, “pre-emptive strike” or “regime weakening” scenarios can be devised against Turkey. I hope that the politicians in power and the opposition, who supported the collapse of the regime and a functioning state in Syria for sectarian reasons alone , are learning from this picture. The support of the same political group for the Annan Plan in 2004, which will bring the end of the TRNC and our military presence on the island, is also in mind. Israel’s June 13, 2025 attack dramatically affected the geopolitics of the region and the diplomatic and military balances. In this confusion, we need to determine our geopolitical position very clearly. The future of the Iranian regime has become completely dependent on Iran’s actions. If tensions escalate and escalate into a full-scale war, the U.S. and Israel will be shaken, and if Iran withdraws, the regime will collapse. Turkey must clearly determine where it stands in this mess. It should not be forgotten that the collapse of Iran is much more than a regime change. This is the collapse of a regional resistance, that is, the disappearance of the last of Turkey’s geopolitical buffers after Syria. If Iran falls, there will be no defensive line around Turkey, consisting of independent blocs. Syria has already collapsed; Iraq is de facto divided. The message that Turkey will be next in line after Iran is no longer a conspiracy, but a clear expression of the dynamics in the region itself. This is an attack not only on Iran, but also on the independent defense reflexes of finance capital in the face of neocon hegemony. If Iran is a target today, tomorrow Turkey’s geopolitical interests and all its strategic programs and efforts will be turned into legitimate targets. The vacuum created by the collapse of Iran will be filled by new proxies of Israel and the United States. If Turkey remains passive in this process, it will face a hostile generation around itself. Passive diplomacy and the “wait-and-see” reflex produce active siege. Turkey may enter the “next country” pot after the collapse of Iran. “The “Iran Operation” is a message directed at all countries in the region that have independent defense doctrines. If Iran fails to respond, it will collapse. If Turkey does not prepare, it will be next. Turkey should be able to transform its national power into strategic influence. Turkey should not fall into the position of a weak country, especially in the field of Strategy. Israel may have lost its legitimacy, but it is actually establishing influence through its active strategy and ability to move. Turkey should increase its technological, diplomatic and military preparations to transform its power into strategic effectiveness. First of all, internal peace and stability must be established immediately. Internal political settling of scores must be put aside. Under the discourse of Turkey without terrorism, all kinds of initiatives and discourses that will harm the constitutional amendment and the spirit of Lausanne should be avoided. A Monaco Model integration model should be adopted with the TRNC as soon as possible, and naval and air bases should be established on the island quickly. A new army should be established for Southeastern Anatolia, Iraq and Syria, and preventive measures should be taken if necessary against any attempt by the YPG/PYD and similar formations in Syria against an independent Kurdish state. Restrictive measures against the US, EU and Israeli influence agents in Turkey should be taken immediately. In this context, measures should be taken and control measures should be taken in advance to implement the destruction tactics applied in Russia and Iran through drones secretly smuggled into the country by trucks, in areas close to critical bases, factories, strategic locations and command and control centers in Turkey. Our last word: “Think and practice like Atatürk.” Let’s not forget that 100 years ago, the biggest owner of finance capital and hegemony was spoiled by the British; The Turks were the only nation that could slap in the face in Kut Ül Amare, in the War of Independence and in Lausanne and was never a colony. We succeeded 100 years ago and we will succeed again. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article. Follow us on Instagram and X and subscribe to our Telegram Channel.

Title: Moldovan Authorities Attack Orthodox Church Trying to Impose Western-Fomented ‘Woke’ Agenda
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/moldovan-authorities-attack-orthodox-church-impose-woke-agenda/5891435
Time Published: 2025-06-18T13:38:22Z

The Moldovan government continues to implement Russophobic and pro-Western policies. In addition to promoting automatic alignment with the EU and NATO, the Maia Sandu regime is attacking the Orthodox Church and traditional values ​​of Moldovan society just to eliminate any similarity with Russia. A recent case of police violence against peaceful Christian protesters in Chisinau made it clear that the Moldovan government is ready to use extreme methods, taking the forced Westernization of the country to its ultimate consequences. On June 15, Moldovan police used violence against Orthodox Christians who were taking part in a peaceful demonstration in defense of traditional values. The Christian demonstration criticized the government’s support for the so-called “LGBT Pride Parade” that was taking place in the country’s capital. LGBT activists blocked the streets of Chisinau and tried to attack the Christian protesters. Local police, instead of calming the situation and punishing the attackers, joined the LGBT extremists and attacked the peaceful Christian protesters. Images circulating on the internet show Moldovan police severely beating protesters. The videos show an Orthodox priest being thrown to the ground, as well as a man with a child being beaten by police officers. Several Christians were detained, but the police completely ignored the provocations of the LGBT activists, using force only against those who were peacefully carrying Orthodox icons and crosses through the streets of Chisinau. The incident occurred amid a wave of pro-Western policies being forcibly implemented in Moldova by the pro-EU regime of Maia Sandu. The government’s measures aim at full alignment with the EU and NATO, including in the political, diplomatic, economic and cultural spheres. A scandal involving the illegal sale of Moldovan fertile land to Western financial groups such as BlackRock was recently revealed. In the same vein, Chisinau has been worsening relations with the pro-Russian autonomous regions of Gagauzia and Transnistria. The embrace of the LGBT agenda follows the same trend of radical Westernization, as it represents an adherence to European anti-traditional cultural guidelines. Stevan Gajic, a professor of comparative politics at the Institute of European Studies in Belgrade, commented on the case explaining that the LGBT agenda is being used in Moldova as an imposition by NATO. He explains that the Western alliance has started a “fight against Orthodox Christianity” and that Moldova has joined this tendency. “LGBT ideology is being force-fed to Moldovans (…) [It has] nothing to do with LGBT rights per se [but rather with an] imposed agenda, which always has a political component (…) Here LGBT is only a political flag of NATO,” he said. In the same vein, Portuguese international law professor Alexandre Guerreiro stated that Moldova has become a “target” of the West and that Sandu has used her power to promote Western actions against her own country. He explains that Chisinau is becoming increasingly authoritarian, oppressing its own people just to advance the EU’s “woke” agendas, even if this violates the values ​​and interests of the Moldovan people themselves. “Moldova has long been defined as a target and Maia Sandu has made it ripe for the implementation of agendas and ideals that are contrary to what Moldovan society is. Sandu has embraced a pro-European Union agenda, has been pushing for reforms and changes that please Brussels and place Moldova at a point of such dependence on the EU that Chișinău is completely under European protectorate. The latest events in Moldova are being completely ignored in the West, probably because they are yet another example of how undemocratic and increasingly oppressive the Sandu government is asserting itself to impose Brussels’ woke agenda at all costs,” Guerreiro said. In fact, the Russophobic madness in Moldova is also a key factor in understanding the promotion of anti-traditional values. With the Russian people being largely conservative in moral matters and with the defense of traditional values ​​being an important guideline for Moscow, Chisinau reacts by being as liberal as possible. This even leads the country to attack the Orthodox Church, which is the majority religion of Moldovans themselves. This is a very similar process to what is happening in Ukraine, with the Kiev regime banning the Orthodox faith, despite it being the religion of more than 80% of Ukrainian citizens. Moldova could face a serious internal crisis if it continues to attack the values ​​of its own people. The current peaceful demonstrations against the LGBT movement could escalate into mass protests and riots, creating a situation of instability for the unpopular Sandu government. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Major Crypto Exchanges To Accept BlackRock’s $2.9 Billion Tokenized Money Market Fund As Collateral

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. Robert Mitchnick (left), head of digital assets at BlackRock, and Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize For years, crypto traders posting collateral on exchanges have faced a tough tradeoff: use stablecoins like USDC or tether, which are, well, stable but pay no yield, or roll the dice with volatile assets like bitcoin and ether, risking a double hit when markets turn south: losses on your trade and on the collateral backing it. Collateral plays a critical role in crypto. It’s the security deposit behind leveraged bets, ensuring traders can cover their losses when things don’t go their way. But until now, the options were limited: stable but idle, or productive but unpredictable. Now, there’s a third way. BlackRock’s BUIDL, the asset manager’s first money market fund issued on a public blockchain in partnership with tokenization specialist Securitize, will become accepted as collateral on Crypto.com and Deribit, two of the industry’s largest exchanges. That means institutional and experienced traders of these platforms can now post a yield-bearing, blockchain-native version of U.S. Treasurys to back trades. Because BUIDL is both less volatile and income-generating (it currently pays around 4.5% annually), exchanges can offer lower minimum collateral requirements, freeing up more capital for traders to deploy elsewhere. “This is a major turning point,” says Michael Sonnenshein, COO at Securitize. “We're really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem. They're now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” Since its launch in March 2024, BUIDL has grown to $2.9 billion in assets. Its largest holders include Ondo Finance, which tokenizes real-world assets, and Ethena Labs, the creator of the USDe stablecoin. Crypto.com, which says it serves over 140 million users globally, will make BUIDL available as collateral to institutional clients in select jurisdictions across its full suite of services, including spot, margin, derivatives, and OTC trading, according to President and COO Eric Anziani. Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange with over $1.1 trillion in volume in 2024, will allow institutional clients to post BUIDL as collateral for futures and options trading, and make it available on its spot exchange. Historically, most of collateral on Deribit has been denominated in bitcoin. “In the end, it boils down to choice and efficiency,” says the exchange’s CEO Luuk Strijers. “80-85% of our business is institutional, and we are getting more of these traditional firms that don't necessarily hold a lot of crypto but hold a lot of dollars and don't want to miss out on yield.” The integration could also accelerate adoption across the industry. Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the U.S., is in the process of acquiring Deribit for $2.9 billion. So BUIDL could soon be available across Coinbase’s broader ecosystem, bringing tokenized Treasurys even deeper into the crypto trading stack.

Title: Traversal emerges from stealth with $48 million from Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins to reimagine site reliability in the AI era

Allie Garfinkle is a senior finance reporter for Fortune, covering venture capital and startups. She authors Term Sheet, Fortune’s weekday dealmaking newsletter. They met at 10 p.m. each weeknight, after class at Columbia University. Sometimes talking over Zoom until 2 AM, Anish Agarwal, Raaz Dwivedi, Ahmed Lone, and Raj Agrawal talked about what it might mean to walk away from their lives—for a startup. All academics in some form or fashion, the group swapped ideas at the intersection of their research: causal machine learning, reinforcement learning, and AI agents. For Agarwal, the decision wasn’t to be taken lightly. That semester, he’d just started a tenure-track faculty position at Columbia after earning his PhD from MIT—he had an academic career that was taking shape. But he was drawn to the entrepreneurial unknown. “I had to get in the game,” said Agarwal, who’s originally from Singapore. “I was looking around at my peers—for example, at Cartesia and Reflection AI. They’re all super smart, and out here building companies. By DNA, they’re researchers with some commercial instinct. They’re solving really hard technical problems, and continuing to produce research in a very cool package. That felt right. That was my motivation.” From those late-night meetings came Traversal, a startup founded in 2023 that focuses on observability and site reliability engineering (SRE)—helping engineers pinpoint and troubleshoot complex software failures with speed and precision. Troubleshooting is “one of the most complex workflows in software,” said Agarwal, Traversal’s CEO. “It’s why you can have 50 people firefighting in a war room until they find the answer.” Today, Traversal launches from stealth with $48 million in funding from its seed and Series A rounds, Fortune has exclusively learned. Sequoia led the company’s seed round, while Kleiner Perkins led Traversal’s Series A. Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross’s NFDG and Hanabi (led by Mike Volpi and Bryan Offutt) are also investors. Traversal—named for both the computer science concept of a graph traversal and the idea of journeying through complex systems—counts among its customers Digital Ocean, Eventbrite, Cloudways, and a number of undisclosed Fortune 100 financial services companies. The company and others like it exist to stop software infrastructure crises and limit downtime. “Imagine you’re having a heart attack right now,” said Agarwal. “That’s the only thing that matters. It doesn’t matter what happens ten minutes from now, or what your dinner is going to look like. An engineering team has two heart attacks a week, and a debilitating condition. So, you never get time to think about planning ahead and being great.” The bigger the company, the higher the stakes of this problem: Bratin Saha, chief technology and product officer at DigitalOcean, said via email that “the sheer volume and complexity of our cloud infrastructure—serving hundreds of thousands of customers—means that even minor platform incidents can quickly escalate, impacting customer experience and incurring significant costs.” Saha told Fortune that, over six months, Traversal has helped resolve problems 37% faster. Traversal’s traction over the last two years is both a product of this moment in tech, the AI wave—and timeless. “Whenever something new shows up, whether it’s a new trend, new market, new kind of product, or a new kind of technology, guess what? It needs to be monitored,” Sequoia partner Bogomil Balkansky said. “That’s observability. And it needs to be secured, which is security. And that’s why those two domains—observability and security—periodically produce big winners.” Some winners from observability in recent years that Balkansky points out: Splunk, Datadog, Dynatrace, AppDynamics, and New Relic. For Traversal—which sits at the intersection of observability and AI, and builds on existing observability tools—this means there’s opportunity, especially given that the company’s riding the vibe coding wave. “The amount of code being written was already growing at a staggering rate, and with AI code generation, it’s accelerating like never before,” said Kleiner Perkins partner Mamoon Hamid. “With more code created by AI, there is more surface area to troubleshoot. There is a need for AI to autonomously troubleshoot, mediate and even prevent complex incidents at scale—self-healing codegen.” The academic-to-entrepreneur path that Agarwal and his cofounders now walk is well-trod, from VMware’s Mendel Rosenblum to Databricks’s Ali Ghodsi, and more. And though there’s much they don’t have in common, academic research and startups do share at least one key feature. “Most jobs, you’re at A and you have to get to B, and getting from A to B is really hard,” said Agarwal. “In research, though, you don’t really know where A is and you don’t know where B is. And even if you do know, it’s still very hard to get to—and I loved that. I enjoyed the uncertainty.” ICYMI…Here’s our exclusive on the New York-based health tech startup Tennr, which raised a $101 million Series C at a $605 million valuation to tackle the convoluted web of patient referrals.

Title: Anti-woke lawsuit may unintentionally threaten Trump's coal revival agenda
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/anti-woke-lawsuit-may-unintentionally-threaten-trumps-coal-revival-agenda
Time Published: 2025-06-18T11:00:41Z
Full Content:
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum discusses the Trump administration’s efforts to promote energy independence, countering China’s technological dominance and more on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.’ Recent news about coal company bankruptcies serves as a natural experiment on the clash between various federal and state goals, regulations, litigation, and market realities. It also underscores the importance of having a coherent overarching policy that helps achieve President Donald Trump’s energy agenda. In both of his campaigns, President Trump stated that he would like to see a revival of the U.S. coal industry, which has been decimated over the years. President Trump’s April 2025 executive order (EO) outlines various steps from lifting barriers to coal mining, to classifying the metallurgical coal used in steel production in the "critical minerals" category. While coal has been losing its prominence in electricity generation, both in the U.S. and other developed countries, it still represents one-third of global electricity generation. With the right investments and a drive to make coal more efficient and environmentally friendly, the U.S. can play a prominent role in the future of the global coal industry that includes investment in next-generation technologies to reduce coal’s environmental footprint. In fact, President Trump’s EO underlines "clean" several times and emphasizes "accelerate development of coal technologies." But one integral part of the plan should be to generate enough interest in the private marketplace to fund the necessary investments in the quickly shrinking coal industry. CLIMATE LAWFARE IN BLUE-STATE COURTS COULD HURT US ENERGY CONSUMERS, EXPERT SAYS: 'HUGE EFFECT' There was one well-intentioned, but unexpected hurdle that potentially stood in the way of this goal: up until the last few years, the global push for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targeted the fossil fuel industry broadly and the coal industry specifically. The goal of these ESG policies was concerning for the fossil fuel industry as the push to reduce carbon emissions intensified in board rooms and Democrat-led states. These targets aimed to lower investments in the industry through different means, such as introducing stringent reporting requirements. Many opposed these targets, pointing to energy realities and an increasing global energy demand that required healthy investment in the sector. Since the 180-degree turn in the political arena last November, ESG has gone mute. Major financial institutions, from banks to asset managers, are largely back to focusing on maximizing returns, causing a mass exodus from ESG organizations like Climate Action 100+, the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), and the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAMI). However, today we face another threat to much-needed investments in the energy sector – ironically not from those seeking to eliminate fossil fuels, but those claiming to protect them. Citing ESG, Texas led 10 other Republican state attorneys general in an antitrust lawsuit against Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, accusing the major asset managers of pressuring coal companies like Peabody Energy and Arch Resources to reduce coal production, effectively driving up energy costs for consumers. If found at fault, these companies – who have been previously accused of boycotting the fossil fuel industry – would be required to divest their holdings in the companies listed in the lawsuit: Peabody Energy, Core Natural Resources, NACCO Industries, Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Vistra Energy, Hallador Energy, Warrior Met Coal, and Black Hills Corporation. This is a result that many green groups could only dream about a year or so ago. By forcing Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street to fully divest from their holdings, the coal industry would lose nearly $18 billion ($17.9B) in capital – severely undermining President Trump’s goal to revive the American coal industry. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION There are multiple problems with this litigation: experts have been discussing the reasons behind the quick decline of coal since the early 2010s. Abundant and economical natural gas, renewable energy developments, cheap Chinese steel and, of course, federal and state climate regulations are recognized as major culprits for the decline, not asset managers. In addition, these asset managers named in the suit are all purely passive, minority investors in these companies through index funds. It would be hard to connect the decline in the industry to the management of their investments – which collectively only hold between 8.3% - 34.19% of shares in the coal companies according to the lawsuit. But what this lawsuit will do is to strangle the funds that could be used to modernize and grow the industry, ultimately leading to a lower resource base and higher energy prices. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP If the markets are an indication of how investors see this litigation, look no further than the stock market following the announcement of President Trump’s own DOJ and FTC filing in support of the lawsuit. On May 22, the share prices of several major coal companies (Peabody, Hallador, and Core Natural Resources) closed in the red despite the overall market ending the day up (Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and the S&P 500). This could only hasten the demise of the industry, rather than "reinvigorating America’s beautiful clean coal industry" as the President has envisioned. The second Trump administration came in with a goal of secure and abundant energy. Every policy or administrative action should take into consideration how the process and remedies can clash with each other and become a roadblock in the way of achieving this vision. This litigation is a perfect example of how things can end up with unintended consequences.

Title: BlackRock Dumps 14 Funds, Many Being Sustainable Products
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/thematics-sectors/blackrock-dumps-14-funds-many-being-sustainable-products/

The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com BlackRock is clipping more than a dozen mutual funds and ETFs from its lines, about half of which focus on sustainable investing. In most cases, the funds appear to have struggled to attract assets: The majority each represent less than $50 million. In all, they account for $549 million, with nearly half of that in the $254 million BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund, which has been in operation since 1992. The asset management giant filed notices Friday for many of the closures, largely for the sustainable funds. The firm did not offer specific explanations for eliminating any individual funds but stated in an announcement that “as we evolve our platform and launch new strategies, we also constantly assess how our funds are meeting investors’ investment objectives and the evolving needs of our clients.” More than any other asset manager, BlackRock has faced the brunt of campaigns against sustainable investing and ESG, or environmental, social, and governance criteria. Over the past several years, BlackRock has been blacklisted by some states for allegedly boycotting the fossil fuels industry, despite being one of the biggest investors in it. Some of the ire stems from public comments by CEO Larry Fink, who had characterized social and environmental responsibility as necessary causes for asset managers. Recently, though, BlackRock has ended its membership in international climate groups, and it subsequently had investment restrictions lifted in Texas. Currently, the company, as well as Vanguard and State Street, face an antitrust lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican states, including Texas, over climate-related initiatives. The sentiment against ESG may have adversely affected demand for the sustainable products, but it’s unclear how much that factored into the low asset levels and decisions to end the funds. It’s notable that all but one of the funds being shuttered are actively managed, and most are at least four years old, said Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar. “That also reflects the trend that passive is gaining more traction and active strategies are losing ground,” she said. Investors have been pulling money from the company’s US sustainable funds, data from Morningstar Direct show: Still Pretty Big: BlackRock has about $2.8 billion in assets in its sustainable US mutual funds and $55.9 billion in the iShares ETFs, the Morningstar data show. The company is also the dominant player in sustainable investing globally, with much of its assets in institutional strategies, Bioy said. “They’re still providing investment opportunities for investors who want to get exposure to the [energy] transition, but that’s in forms other than mutual funds and ETFs.” ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Mutual fund shareholders and retirement savers stand to benefit more than others from dual share class approval. Dozens of single-stock ETFs using leverage have recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. The company on Wednesday joined the ranks of fund managers that have filed for exemptive relief to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization. One firm is converting a $12 billion mutual fund to an ETF, and it isn’t alone in doing so before the SEC approves dual share classes. The ETF, named after Truth Social, will be managed by Trump’s new fintech, Truth.fi. Proxy advisors are accused of being cartels, but shareholder advocates say they side with corporations in nearly all voting recommendations. © 2025 The Daily Upside

ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com ETFs tracking energy, aerospace, and defense stocks have wiped out initial losses following the onset of the conflict between Iran and Israel, instead climbing to new highs amid speculation that a prolonged conflict might drive up oil prices and fuel demand for weapons. The attacks and Iran’s retaliatory strikes, which also sent shock waves through Israeli-focused funds and broader markets, have far-reaching implications, with gains and losses expected to amplify the market turmoil of the first half of 2025. Still, some experts maintain that holding is the best strategy and that diversification will continue to keep portfolios afloat, particularly since US Treasury yields have actually risen. “This just adds to the chaos we’ve already had this year,” said Sonu Varghese, a global macro strategist at Carson Group. “How we’re talking to advisors is, ‘Diversification may not have worked for the last 10, 15 years, but it’s really showing its colors now.’” The iShares MSCI Israel ETF (EIS) — which tracks an index of Israeli firms, including its major banks, and has $272 million in assets under management — fell from $86 to $82 a share Friday afternoon, per NYSE Arca data, but has since rebounded to a high of $86.70. The ARK Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL), which also tracks Israeli companies, saw a similar dip Friday but is now up to a high of $25 a share. Other sector ETFs whipsawing in the aftermath include: Back Away, Bonds: In the wake of the strikes, investors have flocked to so-called safe haven ETFs like those tracking the Japanese yen and the long end of the yield curve (such as bonds with a maturity of more than 20 years). However, a properly diversified portfolio doesn’t just rely on bonds to diversify from stocks, Varghese said, but includes things like gold and managed futures. “There’s a bull case and the bear case, and that’s directly being reflected in our portfolios,” Varghese said. “I’m not saying this was exactly predictable, but our portfolios have been positioned to account for the fact that bonds may not be the best diversifier going forward.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Mutual fund shareholders and retirement savers stand to benefit more than others from dual share class approval. Dozens of single-stock ETFs using leverage have recently been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm, which offers six digital assets ETFs, announced a new global product leadership team earlier this year. The company on Wednesday joined the ranks of fund managers that have filed for exemptive relief to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds. Vanguard reduced fees on 87 funds earlier this year, and Schwab just lowered costs on ETFs with $66 billion in total assets. ETFs tracking the performance of weight-loss drugs have largely underperformed since launching in late 2023. The company is prepping a private credit mutual fund that adds a unique flavor — tokenization.

Title: Fidelity, Franklin Prep Solana ETFs with Staking

The SEC has warmed up to crypto ETFs and staking, but whether it will approve both in the same package is a question. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com In the crypto ETF world, there’s a lot at stake. Eight asset managers have filed or refiled Solana ETF trusts with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the past several days. The barrage of filings suggest that the regulator has been in talks with the firms about their proposals. Amended documents often indicate that companies are incorporating changes that the SEC wants to see — and the development hints that spot Solana ETFs may be approved relatively soon. “Crypto filings generally see some back-and-forth conversation with the SEC, but it seems like Solana ETFs have a high probability of being approved within the next few months, according to precedent set by previous crypto products,” said Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi. The recent filings have been updated to allow the proposed Solana ETFs to stake a portion of their shares. Staking, in which owners pledge tokens that are used to help secure the network, allows owners to get rewards in the form of more Solana. While the SEC recently expressed concerns with a pair of proposed Ethereum and Solana ETFs that would use staking, the agency’s Division of Corporation Finance has also commented that staking does not amount to a securities offering under the Securities Act of 1933. The proposed Solana ETFs come from a variety of issuers: Stake Through the Heart: “Ethereum ETFs were denied staking when they were first launched, but since then have filed for staking approval,” Islam said. “While the SEC has not yet approved staking for Ethereum ETFs, it’s possible it could potentially be approved alongside Solana ETFs.” The asset manager disclosed that it will close and liquidate the mutual funds and ETFs, including the BlackRock Impact Mortgage Fund. ETFs with exposure to shipping and defense have largely held strong despite a series of Israeli missile strikes against Iran.

Title: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Expects $1,000,000 Bitcoin Price Due to These Two Catalysts

Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz predicts Bitcoin (BTC) will one day be worth a whopping $1 million for two main reasons. In a new interview on the Schwab Network, Novogratz says Bitcoin will eventually increase 850% from its current value due to increased adoption and a weakening US dollar. “The price moves on two metrics. One is adoption, more and more people being introduced to it. We call it orange pilling them. Somebody orange pilled Larry Fink, that was a big deal, because now he got all BlackRock engaged. In Invesco, our partners engaged, and more and more financial institutions are engaged. The other is the macro backdrop, which I think continues to be government spending too much money.” He also believes that younger generations will prefer investing in the top crypto asset over gold, which would send Bitcoin higher. “And so how do I think Bitcoin can go to a million? Well, gold is roughly a $20 trillion asset, and Bitcoin is roughly a $2 trillion asset. We had Warren Buffett retire. Charlie Munger passed away. They didn’t like Bitcoin. They’re not Bitcoin people, but I bet you their grandkids are right. Kids like digital stuff. And as we have this wealth transfer from baby boomers, who are all, rest their souls, going to slowly pass away and that money gets passed down, they’re going to be more willing to buy Bitcoin than gold.” Novogratz previously said Bitcoin has become an “institutionalized macro asset” just like gold or silver. Bitcoin is trading for $105,270 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Ethereum whale activity at 6-year peak – Is $2,650 ETH’s next stop?

With inflows not seen since 2017 and Wall Street stepping in, Ethereum may be primed for more. Ethereum [ETH] is staging a comeback, and the whales are leading the charge. On the 12th of June, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH added over 871,000 ETH in a single day, marking the largest daily net inflow to these addresses since 2017. This aggressive accumulation spree comes amid reports that BlackRock has scooped up $15.46 million worth of ETH, showing institutional confidence in the asset. With both whales and Wall Street piling in, Ethereum’s next chapter may be closer than the market thinks. For six consecutive days, wallets holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH have absorbed over 800,000 ETH daily; a level of sustained buying not seen since the 2017 bull run. Source: Glassnode The surge peaked with a record-breaking 871,000 ETH added in a single day, according to Glassnode. As the chart shows, this aggressive accumulation has pushed total holdings in these mid-tier whale addresses above 14.3 million ETH, showing a sharp reversal from earlier outflows. The scale and consistency of this buying spree point to a strong resurgence of long-term confidence in Ethereum. Source: X Ethereum’s accumulation wave isn’t just retail-driven – it now has Wall Street behind it! On-chain data reveals that BlackRock purchased $15.46 million worth of ETH via Coinbase Prime; a rare direct allocation to Ethereum amid a broader surge in accumulator address activity. Source: CryptoQuant As highlighted in CryptoQuant’s chart, inflows into long-term holding addresses have exploded to all-time highs, just as ETH price begins to stabilize above $2,500. ETH showed resilience just above the $2,500 mark, with price action holding steady near the 200-day EMA and the 50-day EMA at press time. This convergence zone is acting as a strong support base. Source: TradingView ETH has shown resilience despite recent dips, rebounding from intraday lows as buyers step back in. At press time, the RSI stood at 48.9—technically neutral but tilting slightly bearish—indicating potential for upward movement if momentum improves. With whale accumulation and institutional interest gaining traction, a move toward the $2,600–$2,650 range looks achievable, provided ETH holds support above $2,500. Conversely, a drop below $2,435 could open the door to further downside risk.

Title: Legal experts and economists sound the alarm over the EU’s sustainability rules rollback

Dozens of legal scholars and economists have issued stark warnings over attempts by the European Commission (EC) to weaken corporate accountability laws, saying the action will wreck corporate accountability commitments, slash human rights and environmental protections, and lead to higher costs for companies and society. Under pressure from corporate lobbyists, the EC has been discussing reshaping rules that govern how companies monitor and report their activity. Last month, both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz escalated their campaign against the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), which covers firms’ supply chains, claiming that the regulations threatened to make European businesses uncompetitive. In a speech, Macron told business executives the CSDDD should be “put off the table” entirely, expressing support for an EC “Omnibus Simplification Package” that would eliminate requirements for companies to monitor their supply chains for violations, remove mandatory climate transition plans, and significantly weaken enforcement mechanisms including civil liability provisions. But legal and economics scholars, environmental organizations and businesses, along with countries such as Sweden and Denmark, have united to defend the regulations. “The members of the European Parliament shouldn’t be fooled into thinking that if they remove this article that that’s going to somehow amount to a reduction in regulatory burden,” said Thom Wetzer, associate professor of law and finance at the University of Oxford, and the founding director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme. “What will come in its place is a very litigious landscape and differential implementation of national requirements. You will have replaced a nicely uniform obligation with a patchwork of a variety of different and uncertain obligations.” In May, Wetzer and more than 30 other legal scholars sent a letter to the EC warning that, far from reducing costs, scrapping the regulations would create a range of new financial and legal risks for companies, as well as making it harder for them to achieve their sustainability and climate goals. The scholars warn that, “Without guiding regulations, corporate climate transitions will be more disorderly and costly.” Furthermore, Wetzer notes, many European companies have already taken steps to comply with the regulations. Indeed, towards the beginning of the year, 11 major brands, including the likes of IKEA [F500E #85, as Ingka], Maersk [F500E #70] and Unilever [F500E #49] came out in support of the CSDDD, signing an open letter that stated: “Investment and competitiveness are founded on policy certainty and legal predictability. The announcement that the European Commission will bring forward an ‘omnibus’ initiative that could include revisiting existing legislation risks undermining both of these.” “Businesses have already started to put in place reporting frameworks to be able to align with the regulatory package,” Wetzer told Fortune. “There has been a lot of investment in the regulatory architecture on the assumption that this would stay in place for a long time. If you change this regulation and you go beyond simplification, you run the risk that all of those investments go down the drain.” Legal scholars aren’t the only experts to have sounded the alarm on the EC’s plans. Also in May, more than 90 prominent economists criticized Omnibus proposals, strongly refuting claims that the sustainability regulations harm European competitiveness. Instead, they point to other factors behind Europe’s economic challenges, including the energy price crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, declining global demand, wage stagnation, and chronic underinvestment in public infrastructure. The economists’ statement emphasizes that implementation costs for sustainability regulations are minimal, citing a London School of Economics study that estimated compliance costs for large companies at just 0.009% of revenue. They argue that the benefits of the regulations far outweigh such modest expenses, and further note that, with an estimated €750 billion investment gap in sustainable initiatives, the weakening of sustainability reporting requirements could undermine crucial programs like the Clean Industrial Deal and discourage private investment in sustainable projects. “Economic choices are political choices,” said Johannes Jäger, a professor at the University of Applied Sciences BFi Vienna. “With the Omnibus proposal, the European Commission is choosing to reward short-sighted corporate lobbying at the expense of people, planet, and long-term economic resilience.” To this point, many critics of the Omnibus package have framed it as opportunistic, saying it is an attempt to both mimic and placate U.S. President Donald Trump who, whilst threatening Europe with tariffs, is carrying out a program of sweeping deregulation across America. U.S. companies have been at the forefront of lobbying efforts to undermine the CSDDD, with watchdogs claiming that investment giant BlackRock helped carve out exemptions from the directive for large financial firms. “With the Omnibus proposal, the European Commission is choosing to reward short-sighted corporate lobbying at the expense of people, planet, and long-term economic resilience.”Johannes Jäger, professor, University of Applied Sciences BFi Vienna Such actions have motivated other European finance leaders to rally around the CSDDD. In February, more than 200 financial institutions, representing $7.6 trillion in assets under management, urged the EC to maintain strong sustainability standards. Aleksandra Palinska, executive director at the European Sustainable Investment Forum, warned that the Omnibus would “limit investor access to comparable and reliable sustainability data and impair their ability to scale-up investments for industrial decarbonisation.” Rather than following Trump and doubling down on deregulation, European finance experts have urged the EU to maintain its resolve, along with its reputation for probity. In January, François Gemenne, a professor at HEC Paris and a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, said that “the best response to the policies implemented in the U.S. is to beef up the EU green agenda, not to weaken it. Rather than follow Trump’s way, we should design our own path.” Wetzer agreed, saying that the Omnibus proposals harm the European Union’s standing as a rational actor. “The European Union is proving itself not to be a reliable regulator because they’re flip-flopping in the face of changing political winds,” he said. In turbulent times, he suggested, a strong stabilizing influence is required. “We should chart our own course based on our assessment of the fundamentals.” But beyond the legal and economic impacts, it is the environmental and human rights implications of the EC’s proposed changes that have drawn the most fire. In March, more than 360 global NGOs and civil society groups issued a joint statement against the Omnibus, stating that EC President Ursula von der Leyen was “deprioritizing human rights, workers’ rights and environmental protections for the sake of dangerous deregulation.” “The European Union is proving itself not to be a reliable regulator because they’re flip-flopping in the face of changing political winds…”Thom Wetzer, associate professor of law and finance, University of Oxford and founding director of the Oxford Sustainable Law Programme In comments accompanying the letter, Marion Lupin, policy officer for the European Coalition for Corporate Justice, said: “The message from Brussels couldn’t be clearer: industry interests come first, while people and the planet are left behind … hundreds of civil society organisations around the world are standing up—no to deregulation, no to greenwashing, and no to this reckless rollback of corporate accountability.” As the Omnibus proposal moves through the European Parliament, the key question is whether EU institutions will preserve their original ambition to guide Europe through its sustainability transition, or acquiesce to corporate lobbying power. The outcome will likely have far-reaching implications for corporate accountability, human rights, and the fight against climate change. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: They walk among us

Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, arrives at the G7. 2025. Image: Number 10 / Creative Commons 2.0. The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. We hoped against hope that the new British government – one that trumpeted its ‘green’ aspirations, the “gift of kindness,” and a firm commitment to human rights – would break free from the malign influence of oil-funded Tufton Street lobbyists, arms manufacturers, and the billionaire press. But even though the faces have changed our hopes have been cruelly dashed. Right from the off it became apparent that Sir Keir Starmer's government is in thrall of the same dark forces. They still walk among us! Peaceful Labour’s duel tragedy is that, far from keeping its promise to oversee a decade of national renewal, putting “service before politics”, its government has broken promises both on the environment and to uphold ancient rights of freedom of assembly. The Exxon-funded Tufton St think tank Policy Exchange is infamous for having composed the last Tory manifesto and drafting the authoritarian Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) and Public Order Acts in response to peaceful climate activism on behalf of its fossil fuel paymasters. Despite originally opposing the Public Order Act and promises to ‘rectify’ protest legislation, the current government has now backtracked on that promise. Lord Walney has been sacked from his post as a (supposedly) ‘Independent Adviser on Political Violence and Disruption’ for conflicts of interest, and his report, ‘Protecting our Democracy from Coercion: an independent view of political violence and disruption’, shelved. But the draconian Public Order Act remains in place. The so-called Walney 16, climate activists sentenced to up to four years for peaceful protest, remain locked up as political prisoners. Sociopath Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, had argued during the second reading of the PCSC Bill: “It would, I think, be wrong if we ended up with higher sentences for peaceful protest and public nuisance than for stalking. That would be to get the balance wrong.” The High Court ruled in May 2024 that the then Conservative government had indeed acted unlawfully in bringing in the Public Order Act under the provisions of the anti-democratic ‘Henry the Eighth clause’ which Liberty described as “undemocratic, unlawful, and unacceptable.” The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. However, Cooper backtracked after becoming home secretary, opting to appeal against the quashing of the very legislation she once condemned. The Court of Appeal found against the government. The government’s continuation of Conservative rhetoric and frustration at judicial independence on asylum cases was also clear in recent calls to exploit “legal loopholes,” drawing criticism even from the hardline Lady Justice Carr. Another unprincipled U-turn has been ordained by foreign secretary David Lammy. When he was a backbench MP in 2018, he described Donald Trump as a "tyrant" and "a woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath.” Consultancy He now discounts his own denunciation as old news. He now says he looks forward to finding “common ground” with Trump. He now wants us to believe that the US president is suddenly "someone that we can build a relationship with in our national interest." This common ground inevitably includes championing the interests of oil at home and overseas. He has invited Shell and BAE Systems into Whitehall diplomatic roles, describing the relationship as "a strong shared endeavour." Peter Mandelson has performed a similar act of obeisance, having called Trump “reckless and dangerous to the world” in 2019 and then after his elevation to ambassador to the court of Trump announcing a “fresh respect for the US president." This volte face likely relates to his time leading the consultancy Global Counsel, which has lobbied the new administration on behalf of Shell and Anglo American. It's efforts have also benefited JP Morgan (which has ploughed $430bn into fossil fuel projects since 2015), Standard Chartered (similarly $71bn), and the Palantir organisation founded and chaired by conservative libertarian Peter Thiel who donated to Donald Trump’s political campaign. Vehicle Before the election, Labour pledged not to grant new oil exploration licences but said existing Conservative-approved projects would remain. However, in 2023, courts ruled the Rosebank and Jackdaw licences unlawful due to regulators’ failure to assess the full climate impact, and both were rescinded. Following the ruling the companies behind these projects, including Equinor (for Rosebank) and CNOOC (for Jackdaw), were invited to reapply for the licences, but with a more thorough evaluation of downstream emissions from the burning of the extracted oil and gas. Dishearteningly, Keir Starmer has signalled that, should the companies reapply and be granted new licences, he would not block them, cynically sidestepping his pledge not to approve new exploration with the excuse that the original licences had been submitted before the election. Starmer had pledged to deliver a green prosperity plan before the Labour Party conference delegates in 2022. “It’s time to write a new chapter of Labour Party history about how we built a fairer, greener, more dynamic Britain by tackling the climate emergency head on and using it to create the jobs, the industries, the opportunities of the future," he said. "And what will it mean for working people? Cheaper bills and higher living standards. Labour’s Green Prosperity Plan is the vehicle through which we will turn Britain’s economy around.” Endorsed This pledge was underpinned by the Cedefop report, ‘Skills in transition – The way to 2035’, which concluded that demand is likely to increase upskilling in sectors such as construction, transportation, waste management, electricity, architecture and engineering as these sectors constitute the starting points for a successful green transition and a bedrock for future prosperity. Even the bad boys of Wall Street, Ernst & Young, has admitted: “Green jobs, which contribute to environmental protection and climate action, are projected to drive economic growth and create new opportunities, potentially boosting GDP while also fostering a sustainable future.” But given the government’s multi-facetted Faustian pact with the oily agents of Thanatos, it was inevitable that the government would drop its £28 billion commitment to a green transition. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, accepted a £10,000 donation from Lord Donoughue, who also bankrolls the climate denying Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF). The ‘green growth agenda’ seems now to have been no more than a smokescreen for business as usual. GDP growth is certainly not the solution, but even by their own standards, the government has failed to read the runes. Astonishingly, two months after the election last year, Policy Exchange was welcomed as hosts of a reception at the Labour Party conference and Lisa Nandy endorsed their presence by taking part in a subsequent seminar. Hostility Sam Simons of Stop Polluting Politics has written of the continuing influence of the science denialist think tanks: “It is pressure groups like Policy Exchange and its chums on Tufton Street that should be the target of government scrutiny – not peaceful protestors. "Labour must cut its ties with Policy Exchange and show they truly work for the people, not polluters.” While its Machiavellian maneuvers on behalf of big oil are well-documented, Policy Exchange’s ties to the shadowy Gatestone Institute – a network of disinformation specialists who spread hate and fear of Muslims – reveal even darker intentions. Douglas Murray, who once served on Gatestone's board, openly endorsed extreme nationalism at last year’s National Conservatism conference. He said: “I see no reason why every other country in the world should be prevented from feeling pride in itself because the Germans mucked up twice in a century.” Murray is also associate director of the Henry Jackson Society (HJS). Nafeez Ahmed, a journalist at Byline Times, describes them as “a neocon trojan horse for [...] state-expansionism, state-militarisation, interventionism, rampant market deregulation and privatisation in the interests of Western investors, coupled with anti-Muslim hostility and white supremacism.” Zombies Nevertheless, Robin Simcox, a research fellow at HJS was appointed by the last government as the commissioner for countering extremism, fueling fear of environmental activism when he disingenuously warned that environmental groups would "become increasingly militant and that acts of violence will be the logical end". He is still in post. In January 2021, the Conservative government appointed William Shawcross – an HJS board member – to lead the review of its anti-radicalisation programme, Prevent. Amnesty and 16 other groups boycotted it, citing concerns over his perceived anti-Muslim bias and downplaying of far-right threats. It was also revealed that when Shawcross was Charity Commission chairman, he had, through the auspices of Professor Gwythian Prins of the GWPF, approached Christopher Snowdon of the tobacco and oil-funded Institute of Economic Affairs to discuss how such industries might influence public debate without opposition from charities. Shawcross also remains in post at Prevent. Also endorsed by the Labour party by its presence at the 2023 conference was Peter Thiel’s ubiquitous Spy-tech firm Palantir, which created software to support drone strikes and immigration raids. Palantir has since secured a £330m contract to build a central database holding all NHS data. Peter Thiel aligns himself with ‘Dark Enlightenment’ ideologue Curtis Yarvin, endorsing the idea that democracy is incompatible with freedom and likening immigrants to zombies. Misleading Yarvin has written: “Our goal, in short, is a humane alternative to genocide. That is: the ideal solution achieves the same result as mass murder (the removal of undesirable elements from society), but without any of the moral stigma.” Thiel also openly supports dismantling social welfare programs that many working Americans depend on, such as Social Security, and opposes nearly all limitations on corporate rights to profit from workers’ labour. Cori Crider, founder of Foxglove, a team of lawyers and tech experts dedicated to fighting for ‘tech justice’ warns: “A firm like [Palantir] has no place being the ‘operating system for the NHS’ – period”. She adds that the company “makes no secret of its desire to keep profiting from war and surveillance”. Democracy For Sale notes that Labour and Wes Streeting have accepted £120,000 from John Armitage, a Policy Exchange trustee with private health ties. Streeting has also spoken as a guest of Policy Exchange twice in the past year. Also welcomed at the 2023 Labour conference was energy company SSE, which, despite accusations of misleading the public over ‘green investments’ sponsored a talk entitled ‘Delivering net zero’, and Cadent Gas which sponsored another greenwashing event: ‘How can the energy sector support customers on the journey to net zero?’ Greased Other previous sponsors, who no doubt expect a return on their investments, include National Gas, which provides infrastructure on behalf of British Gas, EDF Energy, E.ON, nPower and ScottishPower, and Offshore Energies UK (formerly Oil and Gas UK) which has successfully, lobbied for a rollout of carbon capture infrastructure as a distraction from their core activity: the exploration of offshore gas. In 2023, these fringe events were hosted by the New Statesman. At the time Clive Lewis MP expressed an exasperation undoubtedly felt by those of us who considered the New Statesman a trusted publication of the liberal left. "Why are they accepting sponsorship and funding from some of these ethically and morally questionable corporations?" he told openDemocracy. "People want change under a Labour government" he continued, adding that hosting these companies indicates "the same palms are going to be greased." He concluded: "I think it's entirely possible to be on the side of entrepreneurs…without necessarily having to get into bed with big oil companies, big corporations, or the likes of Palantir – and the Labour Party should be really clear about that." They have failed to be. Corrupted Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, told openDemocracy: “The fossil fuel lobby is no stranger to cosying up with policymakers – they've had a lot of success and made a lot of cash from doing so in the past. "But Labour must not make the same costly mistakes as the Conservatives by giving these self-serving climate-wreckers the opportunity to launder their political reputation. "The next government must have bold policies and a strong commitment to tackling the climate crisis, not another one that ends up in the back pocket of polluters and dodgy operators.” Also welcomed into Labour’s inner circle, and in attendance at last year’s conference where his firm hosted a drinks reception, was Iain Anderson, a financial lobbyist who supported Liz Truss and represented climate offenders such as BlackRock and Santander. As reported by openDemocracy one Labour MP said: “The British state has been corrupted by big money. It would appear that whoever is in Downing Street, bankers and business leaders call the shots. Suspend "The Tories lost the trust of the British public in no small part due to their dodgy dealings. If the Labour government isn’t careful it will go the same way. [...] It is a clear conflict of interest for a lobbyist to work in the government.” Just after the election, the Labour party accepted a £4m donation from Quadrature Capital, which has stakes worth more than £135m in fossil fuel companies. “Quadrature’s largest corporate shareholding positions linked to Israel’s war in Gaza is with Palantir Holdings, [...] with more than $72m of shares held in June,” reported open Democracy. The omnipresent Palantir has long-standing contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense, including support for fighter programs like the F-35. While David Lammy suspended 30 arms export licences to Israel, he refused to suspend licences related to F-35s. Once again, Palantir had its way. Scandal Since the UK election, it has been clear that the neocons have been buoyed by the election of a fellow traveller in the USA, and with new wind in their sails they have ramped up their incursions into the political mainstream. Both major parties are now pandering to the Reform party’s base and, in doing so, Labour is sacrificing any remnants of socialist principle. The now ubiquitous use by Labour of phrases like ‘tax burden’, ‘taking back control of our borders’ and eco ‘zealots’, straight from the Reform lexicon, is evidence of this drift. Graham Stringer, a Labour MP and also a GWPF trustee, once voted against accepting human-driven climate change and in 2017 told The Independent: “I am sceptical about everything – that is what scientists are. [There] has been an enormous amount of shoddy work masquerading as science with regards to climate change.” Before the election, Carys Boughton of the Fossil Free Parliament campaign group said: “It’s a scandal that Labour is allowing Graham Stringer to stand again. Purge "To keep a forthright, prominent climate denier in the fold is to suggest that the party doesn’t understand the urgency of the crisis we are facing. We need Labour to actively stand against the forces that are compromising good climate policy, be they external or within their own ranks.” Yet Stringer retains the Labour whip. Christopher Chope MP, another GWPF supporter, took up a place on the Energy and Net Zero All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) to influence policy on a green transition. Although he hasn’t declared any formal connection to climate denial groups, cocking a brazen snook at the committee, he recently attended the launch of Heartland UK/Europe, a branch of the foremost US climate science denial hub funded by Koch Industries. Bob Ward, the director of communications at the LSE’s Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, said: “Heartland no doubt feels emboldened by the prospect of a new Trump administration that is promising to carry out an ideological purge of anything related to climate action.” Emboldened Indeed, the Commons standards committee has, in the past, expressed fears that "hostile foreign actors [could seek to gain] improper access and influence" through the APPGs, and that companies and foreign powers could use APPGs to buy political influence. It is now clear that far from being a new broom, the new administration has continued the Conservative’s symbiotic relationship with lobbyists working on behalf of those whose interests do not include our wellbeing as a nation: the oil industry proxies of Tufton Street, as well as a broader network of far-right ideologues aligned with the resurgent Trump regime. The home office maintains that: “The first duty of the government is to keep citizens safe and the country secure.” The failure of Starmer’s executive to confront these forces, newly emboldened and operating with a sense of impunity, has opened the door to a dark age of authoritarianism and climate precipitated societal collapse. Revolution This essay highlights climate denial and spin—whether as an aspect of government corruption, or how it’s reported. Today’s media ecosystem – across social, corporate, and state platforms – has been captured by a handful of powerful actors: billionaire owners, political fixers, and advertisers. They use this control to advance narrow, often toxic agendas at the expense of truth and public interest. Frustration among those committed to honest reporting has reached boiling point in the UK. The media’s capture by vested interests and a broken regulatory landscape are barriers we must overcome in order to tell and hear objective truth – whether about climate breakdown or the cynically fomented culture wars dominating public discourse on a raft of issues of our times. If democracy is to survive, this must be challenged. Media Revolution, launched in October 2024, is a collaborative, self-organised working group created to do exactly that.

Title: Trump Will Delay Enforcing TikTok Ban for a Third Time, White House Says

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Under a U.S. law that went into effect Jan. 19, 2025, it is illegal for American companies to host or distribute TikTok in the country as long as it remains controlled by its Chinese owner, ByteDance. The legislation passed last year with overwhelming bipartisan support, on fears that the popular video entertainment app’s ties to China‘s communist regime make it a national security risk. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the ban. But since taking office, President Donald Trump has issued two executive orders delaying enforcement of the law, and now he’s going to give TikTok — which has said it has more than 170 million U.S. users — yet another stay of execution. Popular on Variety Related Stories Politico Bets on New Podcast Push to Take on TV's Sunday News Cycle Megyn Kelly Expands Digital Network With Emily Jashinsky 'After Party' Aimed at Fans of Politics, Comedy On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump will sign an additional executive order this week “to keep TikTok up and running.” The new deadline to reach a deal keeping TikTok legal is now mid-September. “As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark,” Leavitt said in a statement (via CBS News). “This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.” Earlier Tuesday, Trump told reporters on Air Force One that a TikTok deal would probably require approval by China’s government and he said, “I think President Xi will ultimately approve it, yes.” Asked whether he has the legal authority to extend the deadline again, Trump claimed, “Yes, I do.” Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, ByteDance is required to sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or be outlawed. The law does not permit Trump to postpone its enforcement. But he has done so anyway, as his administration tries to figure out a new structure for TikTok in the U.S. that would let it stay legal. The Trump administration reportedly proposed spinning off TikTok’s U.S. business into a new company majority-owned by U.S. investors, with ByteDance retaining a stake of less than 20% to comply with the law. Potential investors in TikTok could include Oracle, Blackstone and VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, which have been reported to be part of the deal talks. Oracle is seen as a logical partner, as the company has an existing agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data. But the deal evidently fell apart amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China over Trump’s move to impose steep tariffs on Chinese goods. In April, prior to Trump’s previous deadline, ByteDance said that it was in discussions with U.S. government officials “regarding a potential solution for TikTok U.S.” but that an agreement was not finalized because “there are key matters to be resolved.” ByteDance also said any agreement would be subject to approval under Chinese law. After TikTok lost an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds, the app briefly shut down in the U.S. on Jan. 18. But about 14 hours later, TikTok restored service — citing Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to find a solution. Meanwhile, Apple and Google pulled TikTok from their U.S. app stores amid legal uncertainty over Trump’s executive order delaying enforcement of the TikTok-targeted law, but restored TikTok in February after assurances from the White House they would not be held criminally liable for doing so. Trump, during his first term as U.S. president, tried to ban TikTok on national-security grounds but those efforts were shot down by federal courts. Trump joined TikTok in June 2024 during his presidential campaign. At a press conference in December, Trump said, “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” because “there are those who say” the app helped drive support for him among young voters. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including BlackRock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Ethereum: Here’s why ETH could be set for a bullish move soon

Following major whale purchases last weekend, increased ETH ETF inflows and instituitonal adoption, ETH could be set for a major breakout. Ethereum [ETH] whales (1K-10K ETH holders) have net-accumulated the most ETH they ever did in a single day since 2018. This was a whopping $2.5 billion in ETH absorbed by whales, as shown quite clearly by Glassnode data. This upward sharp spike on the histogram confirmed this record whale net position change. It was a knee-jerk that reflected the same kind of gathering that was witnessed in 2017, right before the significant bull run of Ethereum. The quantity of supply by the whales started gaining swiftly as it moved back past the 14 million ETH level after showing a multi-year decline. Meanwhile, price action of ETH was declining, indicating that the whales were front running retailing in a stealth accumulation play. Source: Merlijn The Trader/X Previous episodes of this kind of accumulation of whales have been followed by a significant bullish run in ETH. In case the pattern maintained the same trend as 2017, then a huge price breakout might be in store. The chart confirmed rising whale conviction, thus, it was possible that low retail action would be followed by the hurricane. A historic step may be in the offing by ETH. Over the past week, Ethereum saw a net inflow of over $450 million into spot ETFs—marking the third-largest weekly inflow since August 2024. This surge reflected a strong wave of institutional buying, reinforcing the idea that quieter market periods often become accumulation phases for banks, institutional investors, and other savvy players. Interestingly, this renewed interest came as ETH’s price hovered near a key support level, even while inflows were rising—a classic sign of bullish divergence. While March and April 2025 were marked by bearish ETF outflows, the tide shifted in May and June with two consecutive weeks of strong inflows. This shift signals growing market confidence and a potential turning point for Ethereum’s momentum. Source: Crypto Rover/X A bullish setup appears to be forming for Ethereum, driven by a notable drop in exchange supply and a surge in inflows. Rather than signaling a market top, these dynamics suggest a consolidation phase that could precede a breakout. Since early 2025, data from Token Terminal has shown a parabolic rise in tokenized assets under management on Ethereum. Major institutions such as BlackRock, PayPal, and Franklin Templeton have contributed to this growth, signaling a significant increase in institutional trust in Ethereum’s infrastructure. Ethereum is increasingly establishing itself as a financial hub, now anchoring over $4 billion in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Historically, strong capital inflows and the rising adoption of RWAs often precede major price revaluations. If this trend continues, Ethereum may be on the verge of a significant breakout.

Title: Timing not right on ESG lawsuits

No one who cares about America’s energy future argues that the big investment firms that withheld capital from the coal industry to meet their Environment-Social-Governance goals deserve condemnation. Their moral preening meant higher energy prices for Americans and a threat to the high-paying jobs and consistent source of energy that the coal industry provides. But the coal industry has received a lifeline, courtesy of President Donald Trump’s Day 1 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which called for an all-of-the-above energy policy that encourages production of all available fuels to meet the fast-growing demand. Now, as these big investment firms are backing off the DEI and ESG policies that harmed the coal industry so much, another threat has materialized. Ken Paxton of Texas and 10 other GOP state attorneys general have filed a lawsuit against Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard. The suit claims the firms violated federal antitrust law by forcing the coal companies to reduce output so the investment firms could meet their ESG goals. The suit contends this amounts to collective influence being used to pressure American coal companies, such as Peabody Energy and Arch Resources, to take actions that reduced their profitability. The suit also calls for the named firms to divest from coal. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, polarized ‘environmental’ agenda,” Paxton said in a release about the lawsuit. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.” But what if they’ve stopped? What if this actually isn’t much of a problem anymore? What if this lawsuit actually does more harm than good to consumers and President Trump’s energy agenda? Increasingly, voices on the right are saying the answers to these questions, and thus the lawsuit itself, might be problematic. Coal market rigging is so 2024. Blackrock is undertaking an “ongoing review of our global practices” in light of President Trump’s orders on DEI and ESG and “will adapt” to changing laws. It has folded its DEI program into a “Talent and Culture” group and no longer requires managers to interview a diverse slate of candidates for each job. Meanwhile, many on the right are concerned the lawsuit could encourage the big investment firms to back out of the coal industry, leaving it starved for funding at a time when America needs its energy the most. “Though I’m generally supportive of ensuring companies are not influencing certain types of energy investments, this lawsuit by 11 GOP AGs would actually force divestment from coal – the opposite of what we want in an “above all” energy market,” wrote George Landrith, president of the free-market think tank Frontiers of Freedom, on X. “Plus these asset managers have openly moved away from ESG, dropping different climate commitments and funds. This suit feels unnecessary and problematic because demand for energy is increasing. To keep up, we need investments in all forms of energy – including coal.” In fact, Landrith wrote, the AGs should reconsider this suit “unless they want to help out the environmentalists that have been pushing for the end of coal for years. To meet POTUS’s goal of American energy dominance, we need fewer political lawsuits & more energy investment.” The heart of these 11 AGs is in the right place. The big investment firms do deserve punishment for limiting the output of these firms that were trying to provide the energy security all Americans depend on – all for radical-left goals that even they don’t adhere to anymore. But the reality is this could scare investment away from coal firms at the time they need it most. If these AGs want to protect America’s energy supply, they will stand down and let the coal industry and its biggest investors settle their own scores. “Thankfully the tide is turning,” wrote Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kansas, on X. “Major institutions are backing away from extreme ESG groups like @NetZeroWatch, @ActOnClimate100 after conservative pressure. And while I support the recent lawsuit by 11 GOP AGs against asset managers pushing green energy, I’m concerned about the suit forcing coal divestment. We need more investment in energy, not less. Divestment is the goal of the enviro left, not ours.” Image: Pixabay / Pixabay License No one who cares about America’s energy future argues that the big investment firms that withheld capital from the coal industry to meet their Environment-Social-Governance goals deserve condemnation. Their moral preening meant higher energy prices for Americans and a threat to the high-paying jobs and consistent source of energy that the coal industry provides. But the coal industry has received a lifeline, courtesy of President Donald Trump’s Day 1 “Unleashing American Energy” executive order, which called for an all-of-the-above energy policy that encourages production of all available fuels to meet the fast-growing demand. Now, as these big investment firms are backing off the DEI and ESG policies that harmed the coal industry so much, another threat has materialized. Ken Paxton of Texas and 10 other GOP state attorneys general have filed a lawsuit against Blackrock, State Street and Vanguard. The suit claims the firms violated federal antitrust law by forcing the coal companies to reduce output so the investment firms could meet their ESG goals. The suit contends this amounts to collective influence being used to pressure American coal companies, such as Peabody Energy and Arch Resources, to take actions that reduced their profitability. The suit also calls for the named firms to divest from coal. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, polarized ‘environmental’ agenda,” Paxton said in a release about the lawsuit. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers.” But what if they’ve stopped? What if this actually isn’t much of a problem anymore? What if this lawsuit actually does more harm than good to consumers and President Trump’s energy agenda? Increasingly, voices on the right are saying the answers to these questions, and thus the lawsuit itself, might be problematic. Coal market rigging is so 2024.

Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of UndermineTreasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion. Here’s the expansion timeline for Turbulent Timeways: Venture into six of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Players will be able to venture into six of Mists of Pandaria’s storied dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more! All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown. When you hit ‘Find Group’, you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Magister’s Terrace After his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the demon lord Kil'jaeden, Kael'thas has returned to the Isle of Quel'Danas to make the final preparation for his master's arrival. Mana-Tombs The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel located beneath the forest of Terokkar. The Blood Furnace At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operation throughout the First and Second Wars. The Botanica The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. The Shattered Halls At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. The Underbog Coilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. Prime your minds for an especially tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Warlords of Draenor Timewalking is here! Players will be able to adventure into six of Warlords of Draenor’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Auchindoun Auchindoun is the holy mausoleum of the draenei, a sanctum of the Light in which the spirits of the dead find respite. The crystalline structure also serves to protect and shield draenei souls from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger for draenei spirits. This fact makes it a location of particular interest to Gul’dan and his Shadow Council, who seek to gain favor with their demonic masters. The Bloodmaul Slag Mines On the northern outskirts of Frostfire Ridge, the Bloodmaul ogres run a brutal mining operation amidst the sweltering heat of active volcanic caverns. Slaves from across Draenor are transported to the mines, never to leave alive. The Slag Mines produce abundant yields of gemstones and ore, but it is rumored that the true purpose of these mines is to dig for an ancient relic of immense power. The Everbloom After the disruption of the Dark Portal, the Kirin Tor realized that to fight the Iron Horde on their own soil, they would need a supply line to reinforcements. Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to botani as the Everbloom, a sacred place within the Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind. Grimrail Depot The Grimrail Depot is a vital hub in the Iron Horde war machine, allowing for the transport of troops and material produced in the Blackrock Foundry to the front lines of the war being waged across Draenor. The Depot's namesake is the Grimrail itself, a massive train that can bear entire battalions of troops and artillery. On this day, the Grimrail has been fitted with a massive railgun powerful enough to shatter the shield protecting Shattrath and is about to depart... Shadowmoon Burial Grounds The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner’zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land. Neltharion's Lair The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth. Vault of the Wardens This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely. Players will be able to venture into five Classic dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons.

The latest funding comes in addition to a separate $5 billion debt financing plan announced earlier this month. The fundraises underscore Musk’s renewed focus on building out his AI ventures after leaving the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (aka DOGE) in May. Last year, xAI raised $6 billion in a Series B round in May and another $6 billion in a Series C round in December, which included investments from Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, BlackRock, the Qatar Investment Authority, and Kingdom Holding Company. Following the Series C funding round, xAI was valued at $50 billion. In March, xAI acquired X (formerly Twitter), Musk’s social media platform, through an all-stock transaction, granting xAI access to a massive real-time data stream for training its AI systems. At the time of the acquisition, the combined value of xAI and X stood at $113 billion. @xAI has acquired @X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt). Since its founding two years ago, xAI has rapidly become one of the leading AI labs in the world, building models and data centers at… — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 28, 2025 The company has also invested heavily in hardware, building a supercomputer nicknamed Colossus, which is expected to use more than 200,000 GPUs. “This isn’t a hype cycle. It’s a capital regime shift—one where AI isn’t the bubble; it is the system,” Shay Boloor, chief market strategist at the Futurum Group, told Decrypt. “Musk just showed us the going rate to play: $9.3 billion and counting.” While the specifics of the investor composition remain undisclosed, the combined $9.3 billion financing package, comprising both debt and equity, will finance xAI’s expansion into larger data centers and the continued deployment of its flagship chatbot, Grok. According to investor briefings cited by Bloomberg, xAI has already spent the majority of the $14 billion it raised prior to this latest fundraising effort. “This is infrastructure capital—poured into GPUs, training runs, and the bandwidth layer that turns AI hype into functionality,” Boloor added. “Musk isn’t building an app; he’s buying the base layer. And he’s betting that whoever controls computing power controls the future.” xAI did not respond to Decrypt's requests for comment.

Family offices are reportedly investing a lot more in a certain type of alternative investment amid global uncertainty, according to the biggest asset manager in the world. Private credit is emerging as a top alternative asset for family offices, according to a new survey by BlackRock, reports Bloomberg. Of the 175 family offices around the world that were surveyed, more than half have a bullish outlook on private credit and nearly one-third say they are planning to increase allocations to the asset class this year. Says Armando Senra, head of the Americas institutional business at BlackRock, “They are diversifying their exposure within private markets. While allocations used to be primarily into private equity growth, now what you see is high interest in private credit, the beginning of interest in infrastructure.” The survey also finds that 30% of respondents plan to commit more of their money to the infrastructure market. Lili Forouraghi, BlackRock’s head of family offices, health care, endowments, foundations and official institutions in the US, says the super-rich are increasingly interested in the potential of private credit to generate a higher yield than public bond markets. She also says that infrastructure investments related to decarbonization and “the whole buzz of AI plus data centers, those are the areas that have intrigued a lot of our clients.” The survey finds that, on average, alternative investment comprises 42% of assets in family office portfolios, up from 39% in a prior 2022-2023 survey, and that private credit holdings make up anywhere from 15% to 30% of some family offices’ portfolios.

The round was co-led by BlackRock-managed funds and Kleiner Perkins, and included new investments from the Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Greycroft, and more. Existing investors General Catalyst, Lux, Elad Gil, and Mary Meeker’s growth fund Bond also participated. Applied Intuition’s raise comes just one year after it completed a $250 million Series E, which put the company at a $6 billion valuation. The company makes software that helps companies and government agencies develop autonomous vehicle solutions. That includes simulation software and managing data. “When they think like, ‘I have this software or AI problem,’ we generally want them to think about us,” CEO Qasar Younis told TechCrunch last year. “Like we want to be that first call.” Applied Intuition works with most of the major automakers, as well as autonomous vehicle companies such as Gatik and Kodiak. The company has also increasingly pushed into the defense space. In its newsletter announcing the funding round, Applied Intuition shared that it was asked by the U.S. Army to help bring autonomous tech to some of its vehicles. The company was able to take an infantry squad vehicle from “bare bones” to autonomous in just 10 days. This included developing a “pedal-pushing robot to physically turn the wheel and press the throttle and brake pads.” Correction: This article was updated to include that Applied Intuition closed a $600 million Series F and tender offer.

Title: Cardano Founder Draws Line In The Sand–’I’ll Retire If This Fails’
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-ill-retire-if-this-fails/
Time Published: 2025-06-17T18:00:09Z

Charles Hoskinson has delivered his sharpest ultimatum yet to the Cardano community, telling viewers of a June 16 white-board livestream that he will “simply retire” if the network rejects his plan to overhaul its 1.7 billion ADA treasury—now worth about US $1.1 billion at the current spot price of roughly $0.64 per ADA—into an actively managed, multi-asset sovereign wealth fund. Hoskinson opened with a stark assessment: the on-chain treasury—about 1.7 billion ADA, worth roughly $680 million at current market prices—remains a “passive, single-asset, unmanaged” pool whose purchasing power collapsed when ADA fell from its 2021 peak near $3 to last year’s $0.25 lows. “If ADA collapses, you lose enormous amounts of your spending power,” he warned, contrasting today’s diminished war-chest with the “almost five billion dollars of buying power” the treasury briefly commanded during the last bull run. Hoskinson’s remedy is the same sovereign-wealth-fund architecture he first floated a week ago, but this time the IOG chief drilled into mechanics—divesting up to 100 million ADA into cash via OTC “iceberging,” redeploying proceeds across Bitcoin, asset-backed and algorithmic stablecoins, and real-world-asset yield strategies, then recycling profits back into ADA or further investments. The structure would sit under a Wyoming DAO that owns an offshore vehicle in BVI or Cayman, employing professional asset managers and subject to an elected, audited governing board. What rendered the session extraordinary—and electrified social channels—was Hoskinson’s tone. He confessed to being “thoroughly tired” of “paralysis analysis” and vitriol on X , declaring: “I’m not going to cuddle people anymore… I’m going to tell you in a frank, adult way what we need to do.” Then came the ultimatum: “Our burden is to submit a governance action and you get to decide. […] It’ll become very clear to me if I share ideas and they don’t get adopted that the ecosystem has lost confidence in my ability to lead, in the ideas that I bring to the table. In which case I don’t provide value to the ecosystem and I’ll just simply retire. If you adopt the ideas and they’re successful, well then I’ll stay. If you adopt the ideas and they fail, obviously I have bad ideas. There’s no ego in that. That’s just objective reality. And that’s where we’re at.” Hoskinson further alluded to the recent fraud allegation and the conflict with the Cardano Foundation. Clearly emotional, he continued: “I again wish I could be nicer, but again, rubicons were crossed, things were done, and wounds will never heal because of what’s been said and done. And I am thoroughly tired of the current paralysis analysis that we’re stuck in.” He warned the Cardano community that the ecosystem still has a lot of catching up to do in many areas compared to its competitors, and that this will only be possible with a functional treasury. “We are not the market leader. Even though we enjoy technological superiority, we currently do not have a fully functioning governance superiority, nor do we have the investment momentum necessary to go to number one. Now, with good strategy, good governance, and decisive action, we can grow every year and get into a very strong position. But we have to act.” Hoskinson argued that the proposed fund could “prime the pump” by seeding both Cardano-native stablecoin issuers (USDM, USDA) and Bitcoin DeFi protocols, using treasury-owned BTC to entice liquidity from the world’s largest crypto asset. “The headline that Cardano takes a position in Bitcoin as an ecosystem is a very powerful one,” he said, hinting at cross-chain partnerships and on-chain fee capture that would ultimately flow back to ADA holders. Critics inside Cardano have voiced fears that off-loading nine-figure ADA tranches could crater the token’s price or saddle the DAO with Wall Street-style fees. Hoskinson countered both points. First, he cited OTC liquidity data, noting “billions and billions of dollars of divestments” have already been absorbed during past sell-offs without existential damage. Second, he framed manager fees—“25 to 100 bps”—as standard in an industry that already services MicroStrategy, Grayscale and BlackRock-sized allocations. To insulate the treasury from mismanagement, the DAO’s elected board would control asset-manager mandates, while an independent audit layer would “verify that everything that’s happening in this structure is correct.” A built-in “rip-cord” would allow Cardano Governance to liquidate positions back into ADA if strategies sour. A formal governance action is expected to surface at Rare Evo in Denver this August, giving ADA voters the first opportunity to bless or reject the framework. Hoskinson made it clear that his future rests on the outcome: “If you adopt the ideas and they’re successful, then I stay… If not, I’ll retire.” For an ecosystem that has long prided itself on measured, peer-reviewed progress, the founder’s demand for decisive action—and his threat to walk away—marks a pivotal moment. Whether Cardano embraces an active sovereign wealth fund or clings to its passive reserves may dictate not only the chain’s DeFi prospects but also the role Hoskinson plays in the project he created eight years ago. At press time, ADA traded at $0.63. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of Undermine Treasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion. Here’s the expansion timeline for Turbulent Timeways: Venture into six of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Players will be able to venture into six of Mists of Pandaria’s storied dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more! All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown. When you hit ‘Find Group’, you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Magister’s Terrace After his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the demon lord Kil'jaeden, Kael'thas has returned to the Isle of Quel'Danas to make the final preparation for his master's arrival. Mana-Tombs The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel located beneath the forest of Terokkar. The Blood Furnace At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operation throughout the First and Second Wars. The Botanica The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. The Shattered Halls At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. The Underbog Coilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. Prime your minds for an especially tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Warlords of Draenor Timewalking is here! Players will be able to adventure into six of Warlords of Draenor’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Auchindoun Auchindoun is the holy mausoleum of the draenei, a sanctum of the Light in which the spirits of the dead find respite. The crystalline structure also serves to protect and shield draenei souls from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger for draenei spirits. This fact makes it a location of particular interest to Gul’dan and his Shadow Council, who seek to gain favor with their demonic masters. The Bloodmaul Slag Mines On the northern outskirts of Frostfire Ridge, the Bloodmaul ogres run a brutal mining operation amidst the sweltering heat of active volcanic caverns. Slaves from across Draenor are transported to the mines, never to leave alive. The Slag Mines produce abundant yields of gemstones and ore, but it is rumored that the true purpose of these mines is to dig for an ancient relic of immense power. The Everbloom After the disruption of the Dark Portal, the Kirin Tor realized that to fight the Iron Horde on their own soil, they would need a supply line to reinforcements. Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to botani as the Everbloom, a sacred place within the Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind. Grimrail Depot The Grimrail Depot is a vital hub in the Iron Horde war machine, allowing for the transport of troops and material produced in the Blackrock Foundry to the front lines of the war being waged across Draenor. The Depot's namesake is the Grimrail itself, a massive train that can bear entire battalions of troops and artillery. On this day, the Grimrail has been fitted with a massive railgun powerful enough to shatter the shield protecting Shattrath and is about to depart... Shadowmoon Burial Grounds The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner’zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land. Neltharion's Lair The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the drogbar that once worshipped the great dragon built their capital within this ancient lair. Now, Dargrul, chieftain of the drogbar, rallies a massive army within these depths. Bolstered by the Hammer of Khaz'goroth, this army will surge from the mountainside if left unchecked, devastating Highmountain and threatening the security of all Azeroth. Vault of the Wardens This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out, and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana's betrayal and the Legion's attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely.

By Blizzard Entertainment 21 hr 48 min ago Once more, the Bronze Dragonflight has discovered growing disturbances in the timeways, with several rapidly intersecting our own! Starting today, Timewalk through a previous expansion each week for seven consecutive weeks, beginning and ending with the Battle for Azeroth. This grand tour through World of Warcraft's past delivers six new Timewalking Dungeons for players to undertake—Atal'Dazar, Freehold, King's Rest, Shrine of the Storm, Temple of Sethraliss, and Waycrest Manor. Players can also shop at a new Battle for Azeroth vendor located in the harbors of Boralus and Dazar'Alor. Also, for a limited time, the Timewalking quest available from the weekly quest giver will offer an increased reward—a Heroic level Cache of Undermine Treasures with items level 649-658. The reward upgrade is only available for this special Timewalking event. Those who run any Timewalking dungeon during the event get the “Knowledge of the Timeways” buff, granting a 5% increase to experience when killing monsters and completing quests. Completing Timewalking dungeons increases the effect and also extends its duration. This is a stacking buff, and after four applications, it transforms into “Mastery of the Timeways,” increasing the experience gained from killing monsters and completing quests to 30%. The buff lasts through death and is account-wide, which makes for an excellent opportunity to level up any alts. This season, you'll get the new Chrono Corsair mount for completing the “Master of the Turbulent Timeways III” achievement awarded to those distinguished champions who maintain “Mastery of the Timeways” for any five weeks during the event. Other rewards from previous Turbulent Timeways events, such as the Timely Buzzbee mount, can be found on the Timewalking vendor any week. Enemies and loot will automatically scale to your level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic, and you'll earn Reputation with a faction associated with the dungeon. While Timewalking is active, you will gain a 50% bonus to reputations earned from quests and creature kills for all reputations related to the corresponding expansion. Here’s the expansion timeline for Turbulent Timeways: Venture into six of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Players will be able to venture into six of Mists of Pandaria’s storied dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: “I”) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the “Type” dropdown menu. Selecting “Find Group” will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic Dungeons. Head to Outland to face Illidan and his cohorts once more! All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown. When you hit ‘Find Group’, you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Magister’s Terrace After his defeat in Tempest Keep, Kael'thas Sunstrider publicly revealed his alliance with the ruthless Burning Legion. Intent upon summoning the demon lord Kil'jaeden, Kael'thas has returned to the Isle of Quel'Danas to make the final preparation for his master's arrival. Mana-Tombs The original exiles on Draenor found death to be an unsettling and unfortunate consequence of life, and so the draenei hid their dead away in the subterranean grave-city of Auchindoun, a labyrinthine marvel located beneath the forest of Terokkar. The Blood Furnace At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operation throughout the First and Second Wars. The Botanica The mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic naaru: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the Burning Legion. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. The Shattered Halls At the heart of Outland's barren Hellfire Peninsula stands Hellfire Citadel, a nearly impenetrable bastion that served as the Horde's base of operations throughout the First and Second Wars. The Underbog Coilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. Prime your minds for an especially tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Warlords of Draenor Timewalking is here! Players will be able to adventure into six of Warlords of Draenor’s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Auchindoun Auchindoun is the holy mausoleum of the draenei, a sanctum of the Light in which the spirits of the dead find respite. The crystalline structure also serves to protect and shield draenei souls from their eternal enemies: the Burning Legion, who hunger for draenei spirits. This fact makes it a location of particular interest to Gul’dan and his Shadow Council, who seek to gain favor with their demonic masters. The Bloodmaul Slag Mines On the northern outskirts of Frostfire Ridge, the Bloodmaul ogres run a brutal mining operation amidst the sweltering heat of active volcanic caverns. Slaves from across Draenor are transported to the mines, never to leave alive. The Slag Mines produce abundant yields of gemstones and ore, but it is rumored that the true purpose of these mines is to dig for an ancient relic of immense power. The Everbloom After the disruption of the Dark Portal, the Kirin Tor realized that to fight the Iron Horde on their own soil, they would need a supply line to reinforcements. Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to botani as the Everbloom, a sacred place within the Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind. Grimrail Depot The Grimrail Depot is a vital hub in the Iron Horde war machine, allowing for the transport of troops and material produced in the Blackrock Foundry to the front lines of the war being waged across Draenor. The Depot's namesake is the Grimrail itself, a massive train that can bear entire battalions of troops and artillery. On this day, the Grimrail has been fitted with a massive railgun powerful enough to shatter the shield protecting Shattrath and is about to depart... Shadowmoon Burial Grounds The traditional burial grounds of the Shadowmoon clan are the final resting place for countless generations of ancestors. The fallen chieftain Ner’zhul, in the depths of his depravity, has sacrificed the very soul of his clan in a desperate quest for power. Now the ancestral spirits are restless, tormented, and used to fuel dark rituals that will pull all of Draenor into the void if allowed to run their course. Skyreach Atop the crowning pinnacle of the Spires of Arak, amidst the clouds, Skyreach stands as the seat of power of the Adherents of Rukhmar. The arakkoa have gathered and harnessed the Apexis technology of their forebears, and now they are ready to unleash the focused power of the sun upon their enemies. Prime your minds for a fel-tangled chrono-spatial conundrum and more in this week’s Bonus Event. Simply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons: Black Rook Hold Carved from the greatest mountain of Val'sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. Court of Stars Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance, in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. Darkheart Thicket In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. Eye of Azshara Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Golganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara's followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her Wrath to lay waste to the land.

Title: Crypto wrap: Ethereum ETFs hit ATH, SPX6900 cools off, XRP outlook remains bullish

Ethereum, XRP, and SPX6900 are moving in different but equally significant directions this week, revealing major developments across the crypto market. The market is showing signs of rotation, and investor attention is quickly shifting among top altcoins as new narratives unfold. While institutional accumulation pushes Ethereum ETFs to an all-time high in on-chain holdings, SPX6900 takes a breather after a parabolic rally, and XRP sustains a bullish tone despite ongoing legal hurdles. Institutional interest in Ethereum has sharply intensified, propelling ETF-related on-chain ETH holdings to their highest levels in history. Recent CryptoQuant data shows that Ethereum ETFs now retain close to 4 million ETH, with BlackRock leading a wave of accumulation that has accelerated throughout June. Notably, the ETFs have seen strong accumulation momentum even as the price of Ethereum (ETH) remains largely flat around the $2,500 mark. The spike in inflows, particularly from BlackRock and Grayscale, as depicted by Coinglass data, confirms that large funds are positioning early for a potential ETH rally. This surge in institutional buying comes amid growing optimism in Ethereum’s broader ecosystem, supported by increased activity in DeFi and rising stablecoin volumes. The aggressive accumulation further aligns with diminishing exchange reserves and rising staking levels, suggesting that the market is preparing for reduced ETH liquidity and possible upward price pressure. Notably, the inflows into Ethereum ETFs have surpassed Bitcoin ETFs over recent weeks, marking a significant shift in investor sentiment. As inflows continue to dominate daily activity, Ethereum may be setting the tone for the next wave of altcoin momentum. Meanwhile, SPX6900 has cooled off after an extraordinary 230% rally that played out between May and mid-June. The altcoin’s parabolic move took it from $0.50 to nearly retest its all-time high of $1.77 before losing steam around $1.70. The rally, which was initially triggered by a golden cross on May 6, followed a textbook parabolic structure with four accelerating legs and shallow pullbacks. However, a sharp decline in open interest and spot outflows of over $6.4 million on June 14 indicated a decisive shift in sentiment. Although the correction has been intense, technical indicators suggest that SPX6900 is entering a healthy consolidation phase rather than a full breakdown. The RSI has cooled from an overheated 75 to around 40, and the MACD has flipped bearish, signalling that momentum is resetting. Currently trading around $1.39, SPX6900 is holding key support at $1.30. A rebound from this level could see the token test $1.50 again, with a potential retarget of $1.71 if volume returns and sentiment stabilises. While Ethereum and SPX6900 shift gears, XRP continues to attract bullish interest even as its legal battle with the SEC drags on. Notably, a joint request from Ripple and the SEC to pause appeals until August 15 has not dampened optimism in the market. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP In light of the pending motion for an indicative ruling, the parties have requested that the Second Circuit continue to hold the appeals in abeyance, with the @SECGov to file a status report by August 15, 2025.https://t.co/7oQvL5Rx7U — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) June 17, 2025 The requested pause is tied to a pending ruling in the Southern District of New York regarding a $125 million escrow and the SEC’s demand for a $50 million penalty. Although the case remains unresolved, XRP derivatives show that traders are staying confident. Open Interest in XRP has climbed above $4 billion, and the positive funding rate suggests that leveraged long positions remain in play. Even though long liquidations have slightly outpaced shorts in the last 24 hours, the market bias remains bullish. From a technical standpoint, XRP recently bounced off the 200-day EMA and is now attempting to reclaim higher levels around the 50-day and 100-day EMAs near $2.24. If the price manages to close above those barriers, it could test resistance near $2.33, a level aligned with a trendline connecting the year’s previous peaks. Despite the indecisive RSI near 49, MACD indicators are leaning bullish, offering signs of a potential upside continuation if momentum follows through.
