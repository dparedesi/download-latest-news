Title: BlackRock: Bitcoin ETF Mania Is Still in ‘Very Early Days’
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-mania-very-early-days/
Time Published: 2025-06-11T03:30:40Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, says the explosive success of the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is only the beginning. Speaking with Bloomberg’s ETF IQ on June 9, Mitchnick described the Bitcoin ETF phenomenon as being in its “very early” phase, with institutional capital still gradually working through onboarding and due diligence pipelines. “There has been nothing like this,” Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas said, citing IBIT’s unprecedented growth. The ETF reached $70 billion in assets under management in just 341 days—a record-breaking pace compared to the previous fastest, GLDY, which took 1,691 days. “Just ridiculous numbers here,” Balchunas added. Mitchnick credited this historic inflow to a combination of retail enthusiasm and the beginning stages of professional allocation. “It is a lot of things coming together,” he said. “You don’t get a chart like that without a confluence of actors all occurring at the same time.” He continued: “Out of the gate it was retail and investor demand, and that ran the gamut of small retail investors to ultra net worth. Now, more recently, we have seen steady progress of more wealth advisor adoption, more institutional adoption.” But despite IBIT’s dominance and the sector-wide momentum, Mitchnick stressed that institutional penetration remains low. “Very early,” he said when asked how far wealth advisor adoption is. “What we have seen is a concerted effort by most of the largest firms to progress through their diligence and research and approval process… You’ve seen that fast-tracked by a number of firms. We’re talking by quarters, not months.” That timeline reflects the structural reality of traditional asset management, where new ETF approval involves multi-year workflows. “Slowly but surely,” Mitchnick noted, “you have seen an acceleration, particularly in the last couple months, of more notable firms lowering barriers, granting approval to their advisors to use this, and that is set to continue.” Beyond regulatory comfort, Bitcoin’s evolving risk profile is playing a pivotal role in institutional interest. “Bitcoin is a volatile asset,” Mitchnick acknowledged. “At the same time, its risk and return drivers are markedly different from most of the rest of the assets in a traditional portfolio. That is important.” He underscored the appeal of Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets. “When institutions are looking at this, they are heavily focused on that correlation—whether it is zero or, even in some periods, negative. Then the portfolio construction case is compelling to them,” he explained. “When you look at this as a global scarce emerging monetary alternative with a whole set of risk and return factors, that correlation is what should prevail.” Asked whether the crowded Bitcoin ETF market—with a dozen products now trading—might need consolidation, Mitchnick responded optimistically. “A lot of them have been very successful. IBIT has been the leader by a fair margin, but there’s such demand that it is exciting… That is a good thing.” On the subject of Ethereum and the forthcoming iShares ETH ETF, Mitchnick was more cautious. “It is a little more of a retail-concentrated investor base than we have seen with IBIT,” he said. “The institutional investment thesis with Bitcoin as a growing global alternative is resonating quite strongly. But when we talk about Ether, there is an exciting story there, but it is more about a technology story. That is a much harder case for a lot of institutions to underwrite, especially compared to other technology things.” Ultimately, Mitchnick framed BlackRock’s digital asset strategy not as a short-term marketing play, but as a gradual integration of Bitcoin into global portfolio theory. “Many of our clients are watching closely,” he said. “We believe this is just the beginning of a multi-year journey that will redefine asset allocation globally.” With IBIT continuing to lead the pack in flows and performance—up 121% since inception—BlackRock appears well-positioned not only to ride the ETF wave but to shape its direction. “This is still the very early days,” Mitchnick reiterated. “The story is far from over.” At press time, BTC traded at $109,625.

Roughly half the participants said that their companies had increased spending on blockchain while one in five said it was a key part of their firms' strategies, although many also expressed concerns about regulation. "So, the future of money is here and it has only just begun," the report said. "But it's clear greater regulatory certainty is still required for the potential of crypto to be fully realized." The Q2 2025 State of Crypto report just dropped. TL;DR: The world loves stablecoins. pic.twitter.com/agOZ8naqoF — Coinbase 🛡️ (@coinbase) June 10, 2025 The report underscores the growing embrace of digital assets and their underlying technology with many companies that were once crypto skeptics now part of the mix of adopters. Financial services powerhouses BlackRock and Goldman Sachs are among others, have kickstarted blockchain initiatives but the survey found that companies in a range of industries and sizes have also incorporated blockchain into their businesses. The number of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) using blockchain has doubled over the past year, with more than 80% of these firms saying that crypto could help them "address at least one of their financial pain points," Coinbase found. "The future of money is nowhere more visible than among small and medium businesses, the backbone of the U.S. economy," the report said. "Onchain technology, especially for payments, holds great appeal to a group who see transaction fees and processing times as their top financial related pain points." Blockchain is the underlying tech on which Bitcoin's network runs: a distributed, online ledger that records transactions and cannot easily be tampered with as it uses cryptography. The technology has now lots of other uses, other than payments, with the likes of Walmart using it to track its food supply chain and major banks deploying it for their own financial products. A number of small Nasdaq-listed companies have started buying Bitcoin as a way to secure better returns for their shareholders, a trend popularized by Strategy—formerly MicroStrategy—which pivoted from software development to become a Bitcoin treasury and now manages more than 582,000 BTC worth over $62 billion. The survey also found that 18% of the small and medium businesses surveyed used stablecoins. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to the value of non-volatile assets—typically the dollar. Coinbase contracted a third party to undertake the research, which looked at 100 of the Fortune 500 firms. It said that the initiatives included "internal company projects, investments, partnerships, and product/service launches."

ByNina Bambysheva ByNina Bambysheva, Forbes Staff. This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Crypto Confidential newsletter. Sign up here to get Crypto Confidential days earlier free in your inbox. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - MAY 28: U.S. Vice President JD Vance delivers a keynote address at The Bitcoin Conference at The Venetian Convention & Expo Center on May 28, 2025, in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Yet another Bitcoin Conference has thundered to a close. This year’s pilgrimage for the faithful took place at the Venetian, Las Vegas’ most ostentatiously faux palace—a mock Venice built in the Nevada desert, complete with a casino, chlorinated canals and costumed gondoliers. Fitting, really, for the new reality of bitcoin: loud, celebrated, and depending on your vantage point, either triumphant or gaudy. Some 35,000 people poured in, an all-time high for what began as a fringe gathering of cypherpunks. The conference even set a Guinness World Record for the most bitcoin payments in a single day, if that sort of thing impresses you. Bitcoin itself hit $111,000 days before the event, a milestone barely celebrated in a market where all-time highs are now routine. At last year’s conference in Nashville, Donald Trump promised to make America “the crypto capital of the planet” and “the bitcoin superpower of the world.” This year’s installment felt like, well, proof-of-work. Trump’s lieutenants Vice President JD Vance and Crypto and AI Czar David Sacks took the stage in the main venue to offer receipts: The Securities and Exchange Commission’s warfare against crypto is over. Gary Gensler is out. Landmark crypto bills are making their way through Congress. The bitcoin reserve is in the works. Ross Ulbricht, the Silk Road founder, is free. Operation Chokepoint 2.0, the campaign to choke crypto’s access to banking, has become a phrase mentioned mostly in postmortems. Major financial institutions, once terrified of reputational blowback, are swiftly rolling out digital asset desks again. And dozens of companies, including public ones, are adopting crypto treasury strategies. All this within the first 100 days of Trump’s second presidency. “Promises made, promises kept,” as Trump’s crew likes to say. "I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House," Vance boomed at his 9 a.m. keynote (doors opened at 5:30 a.m. to handle the traffic). “We prioritize eliminating the rules, the red tape and the lawfare that we saw aimed at crypto by our predecessors.” During his panel with the Winklevoss twins, David Sacks asked the audience what else was on the industry’s wishlist. The loudest answer? “Remove the capital gains tax.” Cameron Winklevoss added: “It would be great if the American government started proactively buying bitcoin.” The irony is hard to overlook. Bitcoin was meant to be apolitical, decentralized, pure—a middle finger to the traditional financial establishment and states’ monopoly on money. And yet, the conference at times felt like an RNC spinoff, complete with speeches by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., and ovations for politicians who wouldn’t have touched the asset five years ago. The president himself called bitcoin a scam in 2021. Now he’s all in. After all, crypto has boosted Trump’s net worth by about $1 billion in under a year, according to Forbes’ calculations. His digital asset holdings are now worth more than any single piece of real estate he owns, including the combined value of Mar-a-Lago and Trump Tower, writes Dan Alexander. A week before the conference, Trump hosted the largest buyers of his meme coin at a White House dinner. His family has not-quietly-at-all seeded an entire portfolio of crypto ventures: DeFi-focused World Liberty Financial, the publicly traded crypto miner American Bitcoin, and Trump Media, which announced during the conference it’s raising $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin for its corporate treasury. I kept wondering what Satoshi would say. Maybe he’s watching. If so, I doubt he’s smiling. Some purists did complain. Not just about the politicization of bitcoin, but about the creeping presence of “shitcoinery.” Companies behind cryptocurrencies like XRP and Sui, long associated with the other side of crypto’s ideological divide, were apparently among the sponsors/supporters. Among prominent panel topics were stablecoins and tokenization. “Most bitcoiners don’t care about the SEC’s opinion or what BlackRock and Robinhood have to say. Most bitcoiners, I guess, want to see more bitcoin stuff. Don’t forget bitcoin is about the separation of money and state. We should not invite the state. We can’t forget all the pain, suffering, murders, famine, and stealing that the state has done for centuries. bitcoin liberated us from the state,” vented one observer. Of course, internal squabbles like this barely register outside the crypto echo chamber. The reality is that the conference, like bitcoin itself, has outgrown its rebel roots, morphing into something far bigger, louder and more institutionally embedded than its earliest adopters ever imagined. Among other high-profile guests were billionaires Michael Saylor, Justin Sun (a major investor in Trump’s crypto ventures), Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, members of Congress and Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Council of Advisors for Digital Assets. Ross Ulbricht delivered a closing speech, his first after being freed from prison. Three themes dominated the agenda. First, the rise of crypto treasuries. There are now over 70 public companies holding bitcoin (and we were early to spot this trend). It may still be the center of gravity, but it’s no longer the only asset in the orbit: there’s also growing attention on companies adding solana, ether and even XRP to their balance sheets. Second, legislative momentum. The stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act is on track to pass Congress. Excitement is building around the U.S. market structure bill, which could finally bring clarity and codified legitimacy to crypto in America at large. Third, cultural mainstreaming. The asset once thought of as a tool for opting out of the financial system is now being folded neatly into it: politicians are using it as a campaign plank, nation-states are buying in (the head of Pakistan’s crypto council announced at the conference that the country is also planning to establish a bitcoin reserve) and corporations are writing playbooks around it. “There’s an old-time saying ‘Everything is good for bitcoin’,” assured me Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike and Twenty One Capital—one of the new bitcoin treasury companies, backed by Tether and SoftBank Group. “Do I love every single thing Trump is doing? No, there's plenty of stuff I would do differently personally if I were president. But are there things I love about the administration? Yes, I love having a bank account in the United States, where my passport is issued,” he said, alluding to the unraveling of Operation Choke Point 2.0. Perhaps he’s right. After all, partially thanks to the administration’s push on the bitcoin reserve and its wholesale embrace of the industry born out of Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation, more people than ever know about bitcoin and use it. Meme coins too, but that’s besides the point. Turns out, decentralization scales best with help from the state.

Title: How a flood of retail investor money into private markets could stress the whole financial system

Time Published: 2025-06-10T19:10:33Z

Retail investors are increasingly being offered access to private markets as investing heavyweights compete for their business. But the shift has created a host of risks for individuals and the broader financial system. That's the takeaway of a new report from Moody's, which warned of "systemic implications" as ETFs and retirement funds facilitate a flood of money from individual investors. Once reserved for the investing world's elite echelons, the booming private equity and private credit markets are slowly being opened up to Main Street investors. The development has sparked some debate about the wisdom of offering everyday people access to illiquid, complex investments. The report from Moody's comes as the $1.4 trillion market for private equity and credit investments has exploded in recent years. As public listings have dried up, more companies have turned to private markets for funding; however, investments from institutional investors are slowing, driving the big players to look for new frontiers. In recent months, giants including BlackRock, State Street, KKR, and Apollo have unveiled ETFs, target date retirement funds, and other investment vehicles aimed at Main Street — and there's reason to be wary, Moody's said this week. Among other risks, a flood of new money into the space could set off a race among money managers to deploy capital, the firm said. "If competition for retail capital outpaces the supply of quality assets, and if growth outpaces the industry's ability to manage these complexities, such challenges could have systemic consequences," Moody's analysts wrote. "Some managers may be tempted to compromise on underwriting standards or stretch into riskier assets to keep pace with inflows and capitalize on the opportunity." What's more, retail investor participation risks heightening volatility in times of market stress, and the market itself is less liquid and more complex than stocks. One of the big draws of the stock market for investors is that you can buy or sell shares at a moment's notice. Not so with private investments, which don't necessarily have "mark to market" valuations. "One of the most pressing concerns for 'Main Street' investors is liquidity and the inherent lack of it in private markets. Retail investors often require quicker access to their capital and have less long-term investment flexibility," Moody's wrote. The ratings agency points to the Great Financial Crisis, when people turned to their 401(k)s for cash while the economy soured. In such a situation, if money is locked up in private market investments, people could have trouble accessing their money. "In volatile markets, retail investors may run for the exits, which would exacerbate liquidity needs and the risk of potential mismatches between a product's available liquidity and what investors are expecting."

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund hits $70B faster than any ETF in history

With this pace, could BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF really surpass Satoshi Nakamoto as the world’s biggest BTC holder? BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin [BTC] ETF has made history by becoming the fastest exchange-traded fund to exceed $70 billion in assets under management. The milestone reflects broader market confidence and positions BlackRock’s offering as a potential game-changer in the evolution of crypto investment products. Remarking on the same, Eric Balchunas took to X (formerly Twitter) and noted, “IBIT just blew through $70B and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days.” Balchunas also highlighted that BlackRock’s IBIT is surpassing expectations, reaching $70 billion in assets under management nearly five times faster than SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)—the previous record-holder. Eric Balchunas on IBIT While GLD took over 1,600 trading days to achieve the milestone, BlackRock’s IBIT accomplished it in a fraction of the time, reinforcing its explosive market entry. That being said, since its 2024 debut, the ETF has secured over $9 billion in inflows in 2025 alone, earning a spot among the top five U.S. ETFs. This coincided with BlackRock recently acquiring 2,704 Bitcoins valued at roughly $283.9 million, along with 28,239 Ethereum [ETH] tokens worth an estimated $73.2 million. This rise in BlackRock’s prominence is also being reflected in the number of institutions joining the list of embracing IBIT. For instance, the Moscow Stock Exchange has listed Bitcoin Futures tied to IBIT. Additionally, JPMorgan has also planned to roll out ETF-backed loans, beginning with BlackRock’s flagship crypto fund, indicating growing confidence and utility in Bitcoin-focused investment products. Hence, with over 661,000 BTC under management, BlackRock’s IBIT has officially become the largest institutional holder of Bitcoin, surpassing both Binance and Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Currently valued at $71.9 billion, the ETF’s meteoric rise has also positioned it to potentially overtake even Satoshi Nakamoto’s estimated holdings by next summer, according to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. Therefore, as IBIT shares trade near $62 and Bitcoin crosses the $110,000 mark, the ETF continues to dominate its peers, securing nearly $49 billion in net inflows since its 2024 debut. As expected, this trajectory paints IBIT as the most influential player among spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. market.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin Fund Flies Past $70,000,000,000 Faster Than Any Other ETF in History: Bloomberg Analyst

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust exchange-traded fund has passed the $70 billion mark faster than any other ETF in history by a long shot, according to analysts. Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas says in a post on the social media platform X that IBIT has surpassed the $70 billion mark five times faster than the gold-based GLD product. “IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days… When BlackRock filed for IBIT, the price was $30k and the stench of FTX was still in air. It’s now $110k (a return that is 7x that of the mighty S&P 500) and is now seen as legitimate for other big investors.” According to data from blockchain analytics platform Arkham, BlackRock currently holds $76.19 billion worth of digital assets in its crypto wallets. In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened, not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The US has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the US doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: Guggenheim chooses Ripple’s XRPL for latest tokenized commercial paper issuance

Ripple will invest $10 million as part of the Guggenheim alliance to accelerate real-world asset tokenization on XRPL. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Guggenheim Partners is bringing its Treasury-backed fixed-income product to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) through a new partnership with Ripple, Bloomberg News reported on June 10. Guggenheim Treasury Services, a subsidiary of the investment giant, will offer tokenized US commercial paper with customized maturity terms of up to 397 days on XRPL. The product is fully backed by US Treasurys and aims to provide institutional-grade fixed-income exposure in a tokenized format. The development comes amid rising institutional interest in Ripple’s network. As part of the agreement, Ripple will contribute $10 million to the asset, marking a strategic investment aligned with its push to expand real-world asset (RWA) tokenization across decentralized ecosystems. The fixed-income product may also become available for purchase using RLUSD, Ripple’s US dollar-pegged stablecoin. Since its debut in December, RLUSD’s supply has surpassed $300 million and operates across both the Ethereum network and the XRP Ledger. The partnership builds on Guggenheim’s earlier foray into blockchain finance. In September 2024, the firm tokenized $20 million worth of commercial paper on Ethereum (ETH), a move that marked its first experiment with on-chain debt instruments. That initiative laid the groundwork for broader exploration into how blockchain can streamline issuance, settlement, and access to short-term credit products. Tokenized Treasurys and money market funds are gaining traction as asset managers seek to modernize distribution and settlement. Industry leaders including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have launched blockchain-native versions of cash-equivalent funds, while tokenization platforms such as Securitize are lowering entry barriers for investors. As of the end of March, the RWA market has now surpassed $10 billion in total value locked, with tokenized US Treasurys accounting for the vast majority of it. The Ripple-Guggenheim partnership represents a broader shift as financial incumbents look to integrate blockchain for greater transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in the fixed-income market.

Title: Panama Canal Boss Says MSC Ports Deal Threatens Neutrality

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo credit: Flystock/Shutterstock June 10 (Reuters) – The sale of two ports near the Panama Canal to a global consortium led by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) threatens the canal’s principle of neutrality, the canal’s head Ricaurte Vasquez told the Financial Times. “There is a potential risk of capacity concentration if the deal comes the way it is structured as we understand right now,” Vasquez told the FT in a report published on Tuesday. “If there is a significant level of concentration on terminal operators belonging to an integrated or one single shipping company, it will be at the expense of Panama’s competitiveness in the market and inconsistent with neutrality.” MSC is one of the world’s top container shipping groups. MSC and the Panama Canal Authority did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Shipping Giant MSC Set to Become World’s Largest Terminal Operator in $22.8B Hutchison Ports Deal CK Hutchison confirmed last month that MSC, run by the family of Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte, was the main investor in a group seeking to buy 43 ports, including the two ports in Panama, for $22.8 billion. The clarification follows weeks of scrutiny and criticism in China over CK Hutchison’s plan to sell the ports to a consortium, which was previously led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock. BlackRock remains part of the group. The proposed sale has also drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce Chinese influence around the Panama Canal and termed the deal a “reclaiming” of the waterway after it was first announced. In April, China’s top market regulator said it was paying close attention to CK Hutchison’s planned sale and that parties to the deal should not try to avoid an antitrust review. Vasquez added that the canal should use the ports deal as an opportunity to become a terminal operator itself by reactivating a project to build a terminal in the Port of Corozal at the Pacific end of the canal, according to the FT.

Title: Bitcoin ETF Frenzy: BlackRock’s Speed Run To $70 Billion Shakes The Market
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrocks-speed-run-to-70-billion-shakes-the-market/
Time Published: 2025-06-10T14:30:46Z

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has hit a new high. It reached $70 billion in assets in just 341 trading days. That makes it the fastest fund ever to cross that line. Investors poured in at a pace few expected. And the milestone shows how much appetite there is for regulated Bitcoin products. According to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, IBIT “blew through $70 billion” on June 9. That run is roughly five times quicker than SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), which took 1,691 trading days to hit the same mark. IBIT now manages about $71.9 billion and holds 661,457 BTC. It sits ahead of Binance, with 629,190 BTC, and Michael Saylor’s Strategy at 582,000 BTC. $IBIT just blew through $70b and is now the fastest ETF to ever hit that mark in only 341 days, which is 5x faster than the old record held by GLD of 1,691 days. Nice chart from @JackiWang17 pic.twitter.com/5VeGT9twpQ — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 9, 2025 Based on reports from Farside Analytics, IBIT led all 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs since its January 2024 debut. It attracted nearly $49 billion in net inflows, dwarfing rivals. Yet not every day has been smooth. After a 31-day streak of fresh money, IBIT logged its largest single-day outflow—$431 million—on May 30. That shift is a reminder that these funds still move with Bitcoin’s own ups and downs. At the current pace, BlackRock could hold more Bitcoin than its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, by next summer. Addresses tied to Nakamoto are estimated to control around 1.1 million BTC—about 5% of the total 21 million coins. If IBIT reaches that level, one single firm would match the original stash. It’s a sign of how big institutions are moving into a market once ruled by individuals. IBIT shares traded at $61.77 at the time of writing. That’s up 5.30% over the past week, as Bitcoin’s spot price climbed back toward $110,000. When Bitcoin spikes, the ETF follows. When it dips, the fund can see outflows. In an interview last week, Blockstream CEO Adam Back opined that most individuals require an easy means of acquiring Bitcoin. According to him, most newcomers are unaware of how to configure wallets or manage private keys. However, he also cautioned against keeping “90% of it in ETFs” as it would introduce new risks. His opinion reflects the conflict between access convenience and the preservation of Bitcoin’s original design. BlackRock’s blockbuster ETF is a watershed for crypto. It reflects wealthy demand from institutional investors and brings Bitcoin within more mainstream accessibility. But it raises new questions about who controls the keys and how that power might shape markets.

Title: Circle Stock To $300?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Representation of cryptocurrency and Circle logo displayed on a screen in the background are seen in ... More this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on June 10, 2022. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Circle Internet Group Inc (NYSE: CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, has rapidly emerged as one of the market’s most watched stories following its IPO. Currently trading around $115 — a significant increase from its IPO reference price of $31 — the company has attracted substantial institutional support and increasing public interest from investors. With the crypto-fintech sector gaining momentum and regulatory clarity becoming more apparent, many are now asking: could Circle ultimately reach $300 per share? But there is a downside case, too. See: Can Circle Stock Drop 80%? Also, check out What’s Better - Circle Stock Or Bitcoin? Additionally, See: How Can Circle’s Revenue Grow By 3x? Circle’s current primary revenue source is derived from the yield produced by the reserves supporting USDC, which now has a circulating supply close to $60 billion. These reserves, mainly invested in short-term U.S. Treasuries, generate dependable, scalable interest income — providing a foundational revenue stream. In 2024, Circle reported over $1.5 billion in revenue, primarily from interest earned on these reserves. If USDC’s circulation grows to $150–200 billion over the next three to five years — a feasible scenario given the surge in global demand for stablecoins — Circle’s reserve income alone could reach $4–5 billion annually. In addition to passive income, Circle’s product roadmap features enterprise-grade APIs for programmable payments, digital identity layers, FX rails, and on-chain treasury services. This infrastructure-first strategy positions Circle similarly to a “Stripe for digital dollars.” With substantial traction in these services, Circle could generate $2–3 billion in additional revenue from software-like recurring sources. Combining this with reserve yield, total revenue could grow to $6.5–8 billion annually within five years. See - How Circle can 3x its Revenues. Circle’s capital-light operational model allows it to scale profitably. Despite high partner distribution expenses — such as payments to Coinbase — its underlying margin profile remains robust. Over time, net margins in the range of 25–30% are likely as the business diversifies and gains more control over customer relationships. If net income reaches $1.8–2.4 billion, and Circle holds 300–350 million shares outstanding post-IPO, the company could achieve earnings per share (EPS) in the $6.00–8.00 range. At a price of $300 per share, Circle would have a market capitalization in the range of $45–50 billion. This would correspond to a price-to-earnings multiple of 40–50x, which is in line with the valuation of rapidly growing, high-margin fintech platforms — especially those developing enterprise infrastructure (e.g., Stripe, Adyen, or legacy Visa during its earlier growth phase). In this situation, Circle would be valued not just for growth, but for being a unique crypto-native company with strong compliance, significant partnerships (e.g., BlackRock, Visa), and a pivotal role in the tokenization of real-world assets. A share price of $300 for Circle is not merely a bullish aspiration — it represents a goal that illustrates the company’s desire to become the digital financial infrastructure layer of the internet. To achieve this, Circle must increase the circulation of USDC, enhance its platform services, and demonstrate its ability to generate stable earnings at scale — all while maintaining regulatory credibility. If this vision becomes a reality, Circle won’t just be a stablecoin company — it will be a fundamental component of the financial system of the future. In such a landscape, a price of $300 may not signify overvaluation, but rather a fair valuation. Investing in a single stock like CRCL carries risks. Conversely, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which contains 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. What’s the reason for this? Overall, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided higher returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in a less volatile experience, as shown by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. India is a sizzling market for private credit, though some participants are wondering if in their eagerness to close deals, investors are shutting their eyes to risks, especially the legal minefields around collateral and bankruptcy. A decade ago, India’s banks were struggling with the world’s biggest load of soured corporate loans. At about $200 billion, the write-offs on that exposure have been large. Deposit-taking institutions that tried to recover the debt via insolvency proceedings have had to accept harsh haircuts. Traditional lenders are so scared by that experience that personal credit, which was less than half of banks’ advances to industry 10 years ago, is now 1.5 times as large and growing nearly twice as fast. Credit demand and supply have changed in other ways, too. Large firms, traditionally the heaviest users of bank financing, seem the least interested in project finance. They are borrowing selectively to fund acquisitions and refinance existing debt rather than to create new capacity. Also Read: Finance in India has a new bogey called private credit Startups and their founders are far more eager to raise debt, though that’s mostly because venture capital funds have become stingy. Initial public offerings are being delayed in a slowing economy, and equity valuations for many unlisted firms are cooling off. Non-bank financiers, too, are starved for funding. Banks have turned cautious about these firms’ exposure to overleveraged households. This is a perfect scenario for non-traditional lenders—global insurers, asset managers and sovereign wealth funds—to fill in the void left by banks and pocket a cool 18-20% return. Värde Partners, Oaktree Capital Management and Davidson Kempner are among the most aggressive, though everyone from BlackRock to Allianz Global Investors is participating enthusiastically in the deal-making. Local players appear quite miffed. Even though they’re in on many small loans, the foreign money deluge is cutting them out of marquee transactions. Domestic private-credit ventures, especially those affiliated with banks, are also keen to earn high rates of return on capital. But they’re more interested in the return of capital. Some of them have struggled to raise funds because they aren’t seen as bold enough. Also Read: Much more private credit will be needed to feed India’s rapid economic expansion Their foreign rivals, meanwhile, lack neither capital nor courage. As a few prominent Mumbai financiers told me, overseas institutions may be mispricing the true credit risk, which won’t end well. Greed may hurt foreign investors, who will then cry that it’s hard to get repaid in India. Some already are. In 2021, US lenders gave $1.2 billion to Indian entrepreneur Byju Raveendran for his eponymous online education venture, then the country’s most valuable startup. Now Byju’s has collapsed and the money is largely gone. Creditors will be lucky to get even a few cents on the dollar from bankruptcy proceedings in India. And yet, Byju’s is no longer a cautionary tale in a gung-ho market. Creditors are chasing special situations, such as a nephew who needs a hefty loan to buy out an uncle. The other opportunity is in restructuring. Last month, Shapoorji Pallonji Group, a real estate and construction conglomerate, raised $3.4 billion from Deutsche Bank and other investors to refinance previous high-cost debt. This deal, a new record for India’s private-credit market, has raised eyebrows. Although repayment is due in three years, the yield on the zero-coupon bond is as high as 19.75%. The collateral is also tricky. The deal is reportedly backed by about $3.6 billion of real estate and investments in oil and gas. The crown jewel is a 9.2% stake in Tata Sons, valued at roughly $18.6 billion. Also Read: Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate rejigs top deck, appoints dual CEOs But how will value from the holding company of Tata Group, whose listed units are worth $325 billion, ever be realized? Shares in privately held Tata Sons aren’t freely transferable. That’s the official position of the charitable trusts that are its majority shareholders. Maybe investors are betting that the trusts will eventually relent or that they will buy out Shapoorji, the largest minority shareholder. Neither outcome can be predicted with any degree of certainty.The bold bet shines a light on the buccaneering spirit that has taken over India’s nascent private-credit industry. Policymakers would want to see more risk-taking in creation of new assets. India’s new central bank chief has slashed interest rates, reducing the repo rate by a more-than-expected half percentage point on Friday. He has also flooded the financial system with liquidity. But given the cloudy outlook for global trade and local consumption, corporate investment isn’t India Inc’s priority. Swapping assets among one another is. As for the money, there are enough private lenders willing to write checks of $100 million or more. And if they don’t, someone else will. ©Bloomberg The author is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering industrial companies and financial services in Asia.

The company’s asset management joint venture with BlackRock had earlier announced its complete leadership team and unveiled a digital-first investment platform. The stock opened higher at ₹305.80 and touched an intraday high of ₹306.85 before paring gains, currently trading below Monday’s closing price of ₹304.25. Jio BlackRock Asset Management, an equal joint venture between Jio Financial and NYSE-listed BlackRock, named key executives across critical functions. Sid Swaminathan continues as managing director and CEO, while new appointments include Gaurav Nagori as COO, Amit Bhosale as chief risk officer, and Amol Pai as chief technology officer. The company launched early access registration for its digital-first platform, offering educational content on investment fundamentals ahead of the official product launch. Swaminathan indicated the platform would eventually feature investment products incorporating BlackRock’s data-driven investing capabilities. The leadership announcement follows SEBI’s approval for the joint venture, which had initially boosted Jio Financial shares nearly 4 per cent on Monday. However, Tuesday’s trading suggests investor enthusiasm may be cooling despite the strategic developments in the company’s asset management business. The broader market indices continued their fourth consecutive day of gains, adding approximately 35 basis points from Friday’s levels. The stock closed flat on the NSE at ₹302.40.

Title: More Crypto IPOs Are Coming: 3 Initial Public Offerings To Watch For

More the Wall Street - New York Stock Exchange logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Circle, the issuing company of the USDC Stablecoin, went public last week under the ticker “CRCL”. The company’s stock surged over 168% during its first day of trading, blowing investor expectations out of the water. Their wildly successful listing will likely trigger a rush of additional crypto companies to list or accelerate their plans to go public. I’ve put together a list of the top 3 crypto-related public listings that will likely make headlines in the months to come. Before we get to the list, let’s quickly review the numbers of Circle’s recent listing to grasp just how impressive the outcome was for its investors. Circle first announced its plans to go public on May 27th, 2025, though the company had filed for an S-1 registration with the SEC back in January 2024, which signalled its intention to go public. The company was initially targeting to raise $624 million by offering 24 million shares as part of its listing transaction. During the road show, the price was estimated at $24-$26 per share. Due to strong demand, the company increased the offering to 32 million shares at $27-$28 per share, upping the amount raised to $896 million. Even at the increased valuation, the company received 25 times more demand for the shares than expected, meaning the deal was 25 times oversubscribed. To put this in context, this implies that there was demand for ~850 million shares vs the 34 million that Circle was offering for sale. Part of the excitement came from the fact that ARK Invest and Blackrock had strong demand to invest. Circle finally penned the deal by selling 34 million shares at $31 per share, raising a total of $1.05 Billion and valuing the company at $8.1 Billion on a fully-diluted basis. During the first day of trading, the company’s share price rose by 168%, closing the day at $81.69. This valued the company at ~$20 billion. While the excitement around Circle’s IPO is partly rooted in the optimism surrounding U.S. dollar pegged stablecoins, the deal also implies strong investor interest to participate in the future of the digital economy that’s being built around Bitcoin and digital assets. You can bet that other companies in the space are observing the deal with optimism and will likely work to accelerate their plans to list this year. Here are the top 3 companies that have announced or reported plans to list in the months ahead: Gemini As reported three days ago, the U.S.-based crypto exchange owned by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, filed for an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the U.S.. In terms of projected valuation, the company has not yet reported a price, but its last priced round back in November 2021 valued the company at $7.1 Billion. The estimated listing date is late 2025 or early 2026. Kraken The San Francisco-based exchange has also been reportedly getting ready for an IPO in early 2026, although no formal registration has been filed. The company’s last priced round was all the way back in 2019, when it raised $13.5 Million at a $4 Billion valuation. The company has reportedly been working with banks to complete a debt offering to boost growth ahead of the listing. Bitgo Back in February the U.S. based custodian was reported to be eyeing an IPO “as early as this year”, though no formal registration has been filed yet. Bitgo’s last priced round was done in August 2023, valuing the company at $1.75 Billion. These are just three companies-- after Circle’s warm welcome, you can bet that there will be more announcing plans to list soon. In a market where Bitcoin Treasury company stocks and Bitcoin ETFs are performing so well, equity from companies that provide the infrastructure for the industry seems like a logical next step.

Title: Bitcoin climbs back to $110k amid sustained corporate, institutional interest

Bitcoin surges past $110k as institutional demand grows on back of strong ETF inflows amid easing geopolitical tensions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin (BTC) rebounded above $110,000 on June 9, regaining ground lost in last week’s selloff as investors rotated back into digital assets on the back of strong ETF inflows, easing macroeconomic tensions, and renewed optimism across risk markets. The world’s largest crypto reached an intraday high of $110,653 from a daily low of $105,426 earlier in the day during Asia and UK trading sessions. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $110,200, up 4.10% over the past 24 hours. The sharp climb comes amid strong demand from institutional and corporate buyers, especially via spot Bitcoin ETFs, as a key driver behind the move. Additionally, easing geopolitical tensions between the US and China, as well as momentum on a US Bitcoin reserve renewed optimism in the market. Spot exchange-traded crypto funds issued by BlackRock, Fidelity, and other major US firms have collectively seen over $11 billion in inflows over the past seven weeks, solidifying Bitcoin’s inclusion into traditional financial portfolios. On-chain data shows that BTC reserves on centralized exchanges continue to decline, suggesting reduced selling pressure even as prices rise. The latest move may also restore investor confidence after the asset failed to hold above $108,000 in earlier sessions this week. Bitcoin’s rally also coincides with fresh accumulation from high-profile firms. Strategy confirmed a recent purchase of 1,045 BTC between June 2 and June 6. Meanwhile, corporate interest in adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset is continuing to gain steam and filings are picking up pace in recent weeks. While volatility remains elevated, the $110,000 breakout could set the stage for a push toward $115,000 and eventually $120,000 if macro conditions remain favorable, which would put BTC in line with Standard Chartered’s projections for the second quarter. The wider crypto market also showed strength despite trading far from its all-time highs. Ethereum (ETH) was up nearly 6% to $2,660, while Solana (SOL) climbed 4% to $159 as of press time. Meanwhile, BNB and XRP were up 2% and 2.53%, respectively, while Dogecoin (DOGE) and Sui were roughly 6% each over the past day. Despite growing optimism, sharp reversals remain possible in the event of ETF outflows or renewed macro pressure stemming from geopolitical risks. At the time of press 12:06 am UTC on Jun. 10, 2025, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 4.18% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $2.19 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $57.45 billion. Learn more about Bitcoin › At the time of press 12:06 am UTC on Jun. 10, 2025, the total crypto market is valued at at $3.44 trillion with a 24-hour volume of $121.15 billion.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT rockets to $70B in 341 days, 5x faster than previous record

IBIT currently holds nearly 20% of all Bitcoin holdings listed, but public companies prepare to acquire more BTC and shake the supply distribution. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) crossed $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) on June 6, being the fastest to reach this mark in just 341 trading days. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported the milestone on X, noting that the fund beat the previous speed record of 1,691 days set by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) by five times. In addition to speed, IBIT’s dominance also shines among other spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs. According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, the BlackRock fund commands more than triple the next-largest vehicle, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC), with $21.3 billion under management. Furthermore, it dwarfs Ark 21shares’ ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB, with their $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion under management, respectively. Grayscale’s legacy GBTC fund remains sizeable at $19.3 billion, but it is still more than three times smaller than IBIT. IBIT holds about 662,707 BTC, nearly 20% of the 3,404,140 BTC which is custodied on behalf of public companies, private companies, governments, exchanges, and DeFi smart contracts. However, IBIT’s dominance among institutional Bitcoin holders might be threatened as interest extends beyond ETFs and suggests distribution over BTC’s supply in the next few years. VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, shared data from Wells Fargo on June 9 that six publicly traded firms collectively hold or plan to raise up to $76 billion for potential Bitcoin purchases. The companies include Strategy, Twenty One Capital, Strive, Semler Scientific, Nakamoto Corp., and Trump Media and Technology Group. Sigel highlighted that the pool equals 56% of the spot Bitcoin ETF complex’s current assets under management and 16% of the net ETF inflows accumulated over the past 16 months. IBIT’s rapid ascent to $70 billion cements the spot Bitcoin ETFs as the dominant gateway for institutional exposure, while parallel corporate capital raises point to deeper supply consolidation in the months ahead.

Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante Well, the bromance is officially over — Trump and Musk are done playing footsie, and wouldn’t you know it, Elon just showed up rocking a fresh black eye. Welcome to the club, buddy. Jewish Heritage Month wrapped up with a bang — and not the kind you’d expect. We got Trump at the White House, waxing poetic about how Jews built America (or something like that), in between deals with one of Epstein’s most esteemed customers, Mohammed bin Salman, in Riyadh — you know, the place where half the supposed 9/11 hijackers were from… though oddly, many of them are still alive and well. Don’t ask questions. What were they talking about? Oh, just the usual: AI surveillance grids, Palantir wet dreams, and something about the Greater Israhell project turning northern Saudi into a techno-dystopian smart gulag called NEOM. Very cutting edge. If you liked Gaza, you’ll love what they’re cooking up next. And speaking of cutting edge — you better believe those mRNA jabs got fast-tracked harder than a BlackRock ETF. Safety trials? Pfft. Who needs those when Pfizer’s got your back and the media’s already told you it’s safe, effective, and if you don’t take it, you’re probably a domestic terrorist? Oh, and did I mention Trump’s beautiful new bill? This monstrosity says no state or local government can regulate AI or “automated threat detection systems” for the next ten years. That’s right — AI is officially untouchable. The robots can spy, flag, and maybe even “neutralize” — all for your safety, of course — and there’s absolutely nothing your local sheriff can do about it. Meanwhile, Palantir (aka Thiel’s techno-snakepit) is busy testing its kill systems in Gaz-A-Lago, helping cleanse what’s left of the women and children over there. Great practice for what’s coming to a smart city near you. And just when you thought it couldn’t get weirder: Kristi Noem went all the way to the Wailing Wall to cry about antisemitism (and maybe her poll numbers). Not to be outdone, Israel fired warning shots over diplomats’ heads, killed two Zionist Christians in D.C., and had the algorithm fix the news cycle the next day. Nothing to see here. Oh, and apparently South Korea decided now was the perfect time to open its first Holocaust museum. Totally random. Totally normal. Meanwhile, back in the Empire of Debt, Elon Musk ditched DOGE, bailed on the $5,000 freedom checks he teased, and the trillions he was going to “cut” magically vanished — as expected — into the black hole known as the U.S. military-industrial-Israel complex. But hey, he did get a nice shiner for his troubles. And Trump? The guy who once swore he’d pay off the national debt? He’s back with a plan to increase spending by up to $6 trillion. Gotta love that America First fiscal discipline. Anyway, I’m all out of ATODASOs. But you already knew this was coming. Anyway, my world tour is continuing. Catch me at Freedomfest on June 14th in Palm Springs (HERE is my exact speech time and topic). I’m personally very excited to finally meet Ross Ulbricht in person. I told his mother years ago that Ross would not stay in jail for the rest of his life and my prediction came true! If you’d like to join us, you can get 10% off at Freedomfest using the code ANARCHAPULCO. After that, I’ll be speaking at Porcfest in New Hampshire from June 16-22nd. And, in September, I’ll be speaking at Liberpulco in Serbia and Liberland. I don’t think the exact dates and tickets have been put live yet but it should be in the first week of September. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Title: Why BlackRock’s move could bring Ethereum’s $3K price closer than ever!

BlackRock is the prophet; is its $50 million buy the prophecy signaling Ethereum’s $3k destiny? Among mega-cap assets, Ethereum [ETH] stands out as one of the few still holding onto its May gains, currently trading over 3% above its early-May levels. But this resilience isn’t accidental. Instead, it appears to be part of a calculated allocation strategy by BlackRock. You see, over the past ten days alone, the firm has deployed $50 million into ETH. For an institution built on performance, such capital deployment isn’t speculative. Could this, then, be a signal that BlackRock is positioning ahead of a broader market repricing, with Ethereum’s once-distant $3k target now within striking distance? In less than a week, nearly $700 million slipped out of BlackRock’s Bitcoin [BTC] spot treasury (IBIT), with one day alone seeing almost half a billion in outflows. But it’s not just the ETF, BlackRock also liquidated approximately 5,400 BTC, amounting to a substantial $56 billion sell-off on the 30th of May. Consequently, this significant unwind contributed to heightened market volatility, triggering risk-off sentiment that pushed BTC to retrace back to $100k by the 5th of June. Naturally, one would expect Ethereum to mirror this downturn, especially with millions wiped from derivatives. However, ETH demonstrated relative resilience, limiting losses to 6.8% compared to BTC’s double-digit decline. In fact, ETH settled into a tight trading range, indicating reduced volatility and more stable price dynamics relative to Bitcoin. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) As previously mentioned, this resilience isn’t a fluke. Instead, this stability aligns with strategic capital flows. Beyond BlackRock’s direct accumulation, its Ethereum ETF (ETHA) recorded nearly $319 million in inflows over the past week, marking the first sustained weekly inflows since the November 2024 rally. According to AMBCrypto, such consistent demand signals a deliberate strategic allocation. Hence, reinforcing BlackRock’s positioning in Ethereum as a part of a broader, data-driven investment thesis. Given the scale of BlackRock’s investment, it’s a fair question to ask – Does the world’s largest asset manager see something the broader market is missing? Ethereum’s on-chain and market structure data suggest so. Right now, ETH supply on cold wallets is at a 7-year low. At the same time, over 340,000 ETH are sitting in the staking queue, waiting to be locked up for yield. So we’ve got less ETH circulating, and more getting sidelined. Then there’s the derivatives market. In May, ETH open interest exploded past $35 billion, even higher than during the last bull market peak. Source: Coinglass Put it all together, and it looks like BlackRock is betting on a structural supply squeeze. With more ETH being locked for staking, long-term holds, or leveraged futures, the amount available for trading keeps shrinking, and that’s exactly where their thesis might be taking shape. In turn, making the elusive $3k target look a lot closer, and turning Ethereum’s current consolidation into a strong setup for a potential breakout.

Title: Kadena issues first grant from $25M real estate tokenization fund in Bank of England pilot

CurveBlock leads the charge as the first real estate development firm in the UK Digital Securities Sandbox. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Public PoW blockchain Kadena makes its first capital deployment from a $50 million grants program, backing UK startup CurveBlock in the Bank of England’s Digital Securities Sandbox. Kadena has awarded the first grant from its new $50 million ecosystem fund, allocating $400,000 to CurveBlock, a UK-based startup building tokenized real estate inside a regulated financial sandbox. The milestone marks a pivotal intersection between open blockchain infrastructure and government-led experimentation with digital securities, underscoring growing institutional appetite for compliant pathways into tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). CurveBlock is the first real estate firm accepted into the UK’s Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS), a joint initiative of the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority. The DSS allows blockchain-native financial instruments to operate under modified CSD and exchange rules through 2028, enabling the issuance, trading, and settlement of digital securities with relaxed regulatory constraints. Kadena’s grant is the first deployment from its newly expanded $50 million program, half of which ($25M) is explicitly earmarked for RWA tokenization. The initiative is designed to support builders working on tokenized debt, real estate, and other compliant asset rails, with applicants eligible for equity-free funding, infrastructure support, and code review. CurveBlock’s grant reflects growing interest in aligning public blockchain tech with real-world institutional demand. “Our Grants Program and token standards are essential to enabling compliant, scalable tokenization,” said Stuart Popejoy, CEO of Kadena. “We’re doubling down on ecosystem real-world use cases institutions need.” The DSS launched in late 2024 and represents one of the world’s most advanced attempts at legally enabling digital securities experimentation. Participating firms can scale projects through a series of regulatory gates. CurveBlock recently cleared Gate 1 with support from Kadena and will continue testing live real estate tokenization flows over the coming months. Annelise Osborne, Kadena’s Chief Business Officer and former Moody’s executive, believes that a lack of infrastructure, not institutional interest, is the real bottleneck for RWA adoption. “With this $25 million, I really hope we’ll have a lot more builders and a lot more fintechs that come from the tokenization side… I’m a huge believer that they’re going to grow,” she told American Banker. Osborne has also noted the importance of proof-of-work infrastructure, like Kadena’s Chainweb, in delivering scalable and secure tokenization rails. Kadena’s approach differs from many rivals in that it combines parallelized PoW chains with upcoming EVM compatibility and a token standard designed for compliance. The grant program’s broader goal is to accelerate the adoption of this infrastructure for real-world applications, particularly where on-chain permissioning and regulatory controls are critical. The real estate tokenization market alone is projected to grow to $19.4 billion by 2033, with recent months seeing a 260% surge in overall RWA market cap to $23 billion. Institutions including Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and BlackRock are actively piloting tokenized securities, suggesting that demand for compliant blockchain rails is no longer hypothetical. Kadena’s grant to CurveBlock is a notable signal that public-chain infrastructure may yet play a central role in that evolution. If successful, the experiment could shape not just the future of tokenized real estate in the UK, but also influence US and EU approaches to sandbox-based digital finance.

Title: BTC, Ether, XRP, Solana, USDT, RLUSD — Social Media is Going Crazy for These 6 Crypto Assets, Here’s Why

The week ended on a promising note for several cryptocurrencies as social sentiments turned positive this Thursday. According to data from the on-chain analytical platform Santiment, market participants are collectively expressing excitement about several crypto assets, notably BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, USDT, and RLUSD. Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin appears to be trending due to an increase in bullish BTC price predictions despite the asset’s drop to $100,000, treasury acquisition by leading companies, and new Spot Bitcoin ETF filings, among other reasons. Notably, President Trump’s Truth Social announced the launch of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, with excerpts of the filing noting that “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust.” Similarly, conversations regarding ETH and the Ethereum blockchain highlight its staking security model and rising institutional interest rates, with key players like Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity backing ETH. Right behind ETH, XRP, and SOL are now leading altcoin-based conversations. While cross-border payment discourse and institutional adoption by Ripple partners are making up a huge part of the ongoing discussions for XRP, the recent move by a Chinese-based firm, Webus, to raise $300 million for an XRP treasury plan has become a trending topic. On the other hand, Solana’s high transaction speed and significant Total Value Locked (TVL), the Layer-1 blockchain and its native token SOL have earned it a spot in the conversation pit this week, with traders and investors showing keen interest in SOL. Ripple’s RLUSD and Tether’s USD are stablecoins heating up this week. The RLUSD stablecoin can successfully be embedded into Ripple’s UAE and Dubai-based global payment networks upon regulatory approval. Similarly, the USDT has been mentioned along with several futures platforms, including KuCoin, ByBit, Binance Futures, and OKX, with market participants anticipating mass adoption in the long term.

Title: Binaryx Platform Announces Global Expansion as Real Estate Tokenization Accelerates Toward $16 Trillion Market

June 09, 2025 10:45 ET | Source: Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC Binaryx Bali Asset 1 DAO LLC London, UK, June 09, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Binaryx, a fractional real estate investing platform, is announcing its move to commercial scale following a successful pilot phase. With $4.4 million in processed investments, with a second-by-second payment of dividends to investors, and 25 tokenized properties launched, Binaryx is contributing to the broader shift toward real estate tokenization — a market projected to unlock $16 trillion in value by 2030. According to a recent statement by Boston Consulting Group, asset tokenization could unlock a $16 trillion market by 2030, with real estate expected to comprise a substantial share of that value. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has publicly endorsed tokenization as “the next generation for markets,” while Citi calls it “the future of assets” in its 2023 Money, Tokens and Games report. But why real estate? And why now? Real Estate: The Ideal On-Ramp to the Token Economy While tokenization has been applied to everything from art and carbon credits to equities and treasuries, real estate stands out as uniquely suited for this transition. Why? Because it checks every box for blockchain-enhanced ownership: Tokenization offers a solution to many of real estate’s pain points — reducing the capital required to participate, opening up cross-border investment flows, and enabling secondary market liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. According to JPMorgan’s 2025 statement on Blockchain’s role in commercial real estate, “Many people avoid real estate because of the upfront capital required. Tokenization, or fractionalizing assets, could open real estate to a broader audience.” Breaking Down the Barriers Traditional real estate investment has long been seen as the domain of high-net-worth individuals, family offices, and institutions. It’s capital-intensive, illiquid, and fragmented by jurisdiction. Enter tokenization — the process of converting ownership of physical assets into digital tokens on the blockchain, which promises to make fractional ownership, cross-border investing, and instant liquidity not only possible but increasingly mainstream. “Tokenization has the potential to revolutionize traditional asset management by offering greater efficiency, transparency, and access,” says Roger Bayston, Executive Vice President at Franklin Templeton. “It’s not just about digitizing securities. It’s about creating an entirely new financial infrastructure.” For real estate specifically, the transformation is overdue. Despite being one of the largest asset classes globally, valued at over $379.7 trillion, according to Savills, real estate remains among the least liquid. Assets can take months or even years to sell, and transaction costs are notoriously high. Tokenization reduces friction by enabling near-instant transfers on digital asset platforms, cutting out intermediaries and reducing settlement times from weeks to minutes. From Concept to Market: Binaryx Bridges the Gap Still, the real-world application of tokenized real estate has remained limited — until now. While many platforms have lingered in the experimental phase, Binaryx, a fractional real estate marketplace, is transitioning from pilot phase to broader market implementation. Founded by a team from Ukraine, the platform aims to simplify access to international real estate by lowering entry thresholds. Through asset-backed tokens, the platform offers exposure to real estate that generates passive income from rent or profit from appreciation, all without the traditional burdens of ownership. “Our goal was to break down the invisible wall between everyday investors and institutional-grade real estate,” says Oleg Kurchenko, founder and CEO of the Binaryx Platform. “By tokenizing real properties across markets like Bali, Turkey, Montenegro, and beyond, we’re opening the door to income-generating assets that were previously out of reach for millions.” Binaryx Platform’s tokenized assets are backed by a legally sound structure: each property is owned by a separate DAO LLC registered in Wyoming, USA, providing full transparency and investor protection under U.S. law. This structure enables direct, traceable ownership for token holders, not just exposure to a fund. On the Binaryx platform, you're not buying into a pooled vehicle like a REIT. Instead, you become a direct co-owner of a specific property through a DAO LLC, with your ownership rights securely recorded on-chain and legally recognized in the U.S. This structure enables a higher degree of transparency and control compared to traditional pooled real estate models such as REITs or crowdfunding platforms. A Growing Global Investor Base with Real Returns Binaryx Platform has seen continued user growth and activity since its launch. As of mid-2025, over 2,000 investors have already joined the platform, building diversified portfolios from properties across Bali, Montenegro, Turkey, and other fast-growing markets. Behind these numbers are real people seeing tangible results. Tomas, an investor from Germany, invested $10,000 in a property in Bali and began receiving monthly income almost immediately. After 11 months, his investment grew by +18.97% in capitalization, earning him $994. Another user, Kat — an IT professional from France — began with $8,200 and earned a return of +17.04% in just one year. “What impressed me most is the transparency and control,” she says. “I choose the property, I track the returns, and I can sell anytime on the secondary market.” These individual experiences reflect a broader trend: an increasing number of people are turning to tokenized real estate as a practical way to grow their wealth. Binaryx continues to attract a global investor base that values transparency, legal clarity, and control. “We’re building a borderless real estate market where trust is earned through transparency,” says CEO Oleg Kurchenko. “That’s why our retention and reinvestment rates are so strong. People invest — and then they come back.” With tangible assets, a legal framework, and recorded transactions, the platform reflects a new approach to digital property ownership. Not Without Risks — But No Longer a Thought Experiment Of course, tokenized real estate isn’t without its challenges. Legal enforceability varies by jurisdiction. Custody standards are still evolving. Secondary markets are thin, for now. But these are not fatal flaws. They’re typical growing pains of any disruptive innovation. As infrastructure, regulation, and investor understanding mature, tokenized real estate is expected to shift from niche curiosity to mainstream portfolio allocation. If the $16 trillion projection holds, tokenization won’t just be the future of real estate — it will reshape how we own, trade, and grow wealth from real-world assets. What’s Next? Looking ahead, the Binaryx platform plans to further enhance the investor experience in the coming quarter. The roadmap includes: These developments aim to make real estate investing through Binaryx even more seamless, transparent, and rewarding for everyday investors. About the Binaryx Platform Binaryx is a real estate tokenization platform that operates under Wyoming’s 2021 law (W.S. SF0038), turning real estate properties into digital tokens. For each property, Binaryx creates a dedicated LLC in Wyoming that issues tokens on the blockchain. When you buy these tokens, you become a co-owner of the LLC that owns the property, with all ownership rights protected by state law.
