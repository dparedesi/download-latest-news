(NASDAQ:SMCI) stands against the other trending AI stocks. As the earnings season unfolds, investors are eager to see how artificial intelligence (AI) investments among S&P 500 companies are yielding results. Analysts anticipate profit growth to decelerate, with S&P 500 earnings projected to rise by 5.3% compared to the same quarter last year, down from a 13.2% increase in the second quarter, per a report by news agency Reuters. The technology and communication services sectors are expected to show the strongest year-over-year growth, with technology earnings forecasted to increase by 15.4% and communication services by 12.3%.

Title: Troubled retailers face a Halloween crunch with consumers spending less
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/troubled-retailers-face-halloween-crunch-190000616.html
Time Published: 2024-10-12T19:00:00Z

(Bloomberg) -- A predicted slide in Halloween consumption is the latest blow for heavily-indebted retailers battling mounting overheads and the trend of consumers trading down to cheaper products. Most Read from Bloomberg The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record San Francisco to Shut 9% of Public Schools Amid Budget Woes US spending for the holiday will drop by 5% to $11.6 billion this year, according to the National Retail Federation. Sales of greeting cards and costumes are likely to see the greatest decline, a hit to merchants reliant on seasonal splurges in what’s already been a tough year for the industry. Households on the lower end of the income scale are broadly struggling as unemployment has edged higher this year and underlying inflation has remained persistently high. Retailer Michaels Cos. said on a recent earnings call that households earning less than $100,000 are retrenching, resulting in lower basket sizes. “2024 has been a perfect storm for retailers of all stripes,” said Erica Weisgerber, a partner at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton LLP. “Inflation, high operational costs, and reduced consumer spending have been especially challenging for brick-and-mortar retailers, and online retailers have struggled with steep competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon.” Many of the troubled firms, including Michaels and At Home Group Inc., are owned by private equity managers after buyouts during the pandemic proved ill-timed when interest rates rose and inflation crimped household budgets. Home, clothing and hobby retailers dominate the list of distressed retailers because the size of their debt means they lack the liquidity to compete with better capitalized competitors, according to Moody’s Ratings. Still, Michaels and At Home are hopeful that they can win a larger slice of the holiday spending. Hellman & Friedman LLC’s At Home saw a strong start to Halloween spending after flat second-quarter net sales of about $443 million, chief financial officer Jerry Murray said on a September earnings call. Apollo Global Management Inc.’s Michaels also saw a revenue pop tied to Halloween as customers began to buy inventory earlier this year, according to people on last month’s earnings call. That’s a fillip for the firm whose earnings declined by about 20% to $50 million in the second quarter from a year earlier, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Apollo and Hellman & Friedman declined to comment. The pullback is creating challenges for the wider industry and has contributed to several high-profile bankruptcies this year, including Joann Inc., Big Lots Inc. and Conn’s Inc. It also makes it harder to turn around firms simply by slashing costs. “Retailers are finding that their low-hanging efficiency efforts do not go far enough,” said Holly Etlin, a partner in AlixPartners’ turnaround practice. With capital markets shunning troubled firms, more retailers turned to bankruptcy rather than distressed exchanges over the past year as the companies require deeper restructuring that is best done in court, Moody’s Ratings said in a report last month. It’s part of a wider trend that saw quarterly filings for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection rise to the highest level since 2012 in the three months through June. Private equity’s widespread failure to hedge against rising borrowing costs also means it’s less able to come to the rescue of troubled firms, which could have knock-on effects for the economy and jobs. “The private equity players that often have backstopped retailers have been in a new deal lull as multiples collapsed and rates for leveraged deals skyrocketed,” said James Gellert, executive chair at risk analytics provider RapidRatings International Inc. Listen here to the Credit Edge podcast on Schroders’ bullish outlook on CRE private debt Week in Review China’s onshore high-yield debt market this week suffered its worst day of trading in years as investors pulled money out of bonds and poured it into stocks in response to government stimulus. Meanwhile, domestic developer Country Garden Holdings Co. missed a self-imposed target date for getting key creditor support for terms of its restructuring plan. Inflows to private credit funds helped BlackRock Inc. pull in a record $221 billion of total client cash last quarter, bringing the world’s largest money manager to an all-time high of $11.5 trillion of assets. A potential bidding war for HPS Investment Partners is set to swell the fortunes of its three founders as rival groups vie for a piece of the red-hot private credit market. A group of private credit firms including 26North Partners are closing in on a deal to lend to Vista Equity Partners-backed Alegeus Technologies, after the software firm tried to refinance existing debt with a new leveraged loan. Banks led by UBS Group AG sold $1 billion of leveraged loans to help finance Vista Equity Partners’ buyout of software company Jaggaer, the market’s latest acquisition deal to include a second-lien component. In Europe, Blackstone Inc. is investing in a C$1.125 billion ($822 million) second-lien tranche that is helping finance AutoScout24’s purchase of Canadian online car marketplace Trader.

Title: BlackRock Is Selling Bitcoin To Buy Ethereum, Will This Bullishness Trigger Another Altcoin Season?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-buy-ethereum/
Time Published: 2024-10-12T17:30:34Z
Full Content:
New reports have revealed that BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and American multinational investment company, is now selling Bitcoin (BTC) to buy Ethereum (ETH). Many market watchers propose that this unexpected investment change could trigger a bullish rally for Ethereum, potentially catalyzing another altcoin season. Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics tool has uncovered a shocking new transaction executed by asset manager, BlackRock. In its official X (formerly Twitter) account, Lookonchain disclosed that BlackRock has recently sold off 182 BTC, valued at $11.34 million. Around the same period, the blockchain analytics tool recorded BlackRock purchasing 7,574 ETH tokens, worth approximately $18.52 million. This surprising development indicates a potential shift in BlackRock’s investment strategy, hinting at the investment giant’s newfound favor in Ethereum. As the world’s largest Bitcoin fund, BlackRock’s decision to dump Bitcoin for Ethereum comes as a shock to many crypto community members, with discussions flooding the space about the real reason behind the asset manager’s investment decision. According to some market watchers, BlackRock’s move is a reflection of its clients’ digital asset preferences, as the asset manager could be selling Bitcoin and buying Ethereum based on client requests. Other crypto community members are seeing BlackRock’s investment move as a sign that the price of Ethereum could be gearing up for a substantial rally. As the number one altcoin in the market with the largest market capitalization, a massive price rally for Ethereum could potentially trigger the long-awaited altcoin season. Historically, a price increase in Ethereum paves the way for other altcoins in the market to see similarly bullish gains. With the market already expecting a significant altcoin season in this bull cycle, BlackRock’s unexpected investment move is fueling speculation in the market about a potential Ethereum price surge that could outperform Bitcoin. As of writing, BlackRock‘s holding reveals a strong preference for Bitcoin in terms of value. Data from Lookonchain reveals that BlackRock holds approximately 369,640 BTC, valued at an impressive $23.02 billion. In comparison, the investment giant Ethereum’s holdings amount to 414,168 ETH, with a value of around $1.01 billion, highlighting a stark difference in the allocation between the two leading cryptocurrencies. Numerous analysts in the crypto market are expressing optimism about the highly anticipated altcoin season. A popular Bitcoin and crypto analyst identified as ‘Moustache’ on X has disclosed that the altcoins season index has been forming a particularly bullish pattern for the past 3.5 years, suggesting that altcoins could be on the verge of a significant price increase. He disclosed that this technical analysis pattern is known as the “Inverse Head and Shoulder,” which often indicates a potential shift from a downtrend to an uptrend. The analyst is optimistic that the present market downturn will soon be replaced by strong growth in the altcoin market, anticipating an extended period of price gains.

Title: The New Gods Among Us...
URL: https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/4270509/posts
Time Published: 2024-10-12T15:50:58Z

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/12/2024 8:50:58 AM PDT by Starman417 In ancient Egypt pharaohs were considered gods. They believed that when a pharaoh died, he would continue to lead them from the beyond, which partially explains why they had such ornate tombs. At roughly the same time, Japanese emperors were similarly thought to be gods, a practice that continued until 1945, when, after the war the emperor was required to explain to his people that he, in fact, was not a god. In the Roman Empire, while emperors were not considered gods while living, most were deified upon death. While living however they were thought to have authority that had been divinely endowed. Later, through much of European history, monarchs were often thought to be divinely inspired. There existed a concept called the Divine Right of Kings which suggested that kings were anointed by God and ruled by his grace. As such, they did not have to answer to anyone on this earthly plain, whether the Pope, parliament, nobles or anyone else. Of course ruling via God’s grace didn’t always protect kings from earthly dangers – in the form of assassinations or wars between two simultaneously divinely inspired enemies or your run of the mill usurper – but it was a great gig, if you could keep it. As regal and majestic as all of this sounds, in reality, divine rule was nothing more than a tool to help establish legitimacy and maintain power for the ruling elites. Who could be a more powerful ally in demonstrating that an individual or a group should have power than God? Using armies and weapons to keep subjects from questioning authority or revolting could be expensive. It was cheaper to do so through or with the assistance of religious beliefs. If one could convince a man that his king was acting in the stead of God, the threshold of abuse he would accept before revolting would be much higher than if the king were just a man. While the United States has never had a king – divine or otherwise as George Washington quashed that when offered the crown and turned it down – our Declaration of Independence, the document that established our nation, looks to God for inspiration. That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition.

They believed that when a pharaoh died, he would continue to lead them from the beyond, which partially explains why they had such ornate tombs. At roughly the same time, Japanese emperors were similarly thought to be gods, a practice that continued until 1945, when, after the war the emperor was required to explain to his people that he, in fact, was not a god. In the Roman Empire, while emperors were not considered gods while living, most were deified upon death. While living however they were thought to have authority that had been divinely endowed. Later, through much of European history, monarchs were often thought to be divinely inspired. There existed a concept called the Divine Right of Kings which suggested that kings were anointed by God and ruled by his grace. As such, they did not have to answer to anyone on this earthly plain, whether the Pope, parliament, nobles or anyone else. Of course ruling via God’s grace didn’t always protect kings from earthly dangers – in the form of assassinations or wars between two simultaneously divinely inspired enemies or your run of the mill usurper – but it was a great gig, if you could keep it. As regal and majestic as all of this sounds, in reality, divine rule was nothing more than a tool to help establish legitimacy and maintain power for the ruling elites. Who could be a more powerful ally in demonstrating that an individual or a group should have power than God? Using armies and weapons to keep subjects from questioning authority or revolting could be expensive. It was cheaper to do so through or with the assistance of religious beliefs. If one could convince a man that his king was acting in the stead of God, the threshold of abuse he would accept before revolting would be much higher than if the king were just a man. While the United States has never had a king – divine or otherwise as George Washington quashed that when offered the crown and turned it down – our Declaration of Independence, the document that established our nation, looks to God for inspiration. That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition.

That doesn’t mean we aren’t ruled by gods, however. I’ve always wondered why some of America’s richest people, particularly tech and finance types lean to the left. How could someone who has benefited so extraordinarily from the American system support ideas that are so anathema to its very existence? The things they support generally include bigger government, higher taxes, limitations on freedoms of speech and the right to bear arms among others. The first is bigger government. Many corporations see increasing regulations as a means to limit competition. By supporting minimum wage hikes or increased reporting regulations or mandates, large companies – many of whom are controlled or owned by billionaires – can and do use the government to impose costs that cripple small competitors while they themselves have the resources to easily comply. Coincidentally, concurrently, the elites, particularly those in tech and on Wall Street, have little connection to the real world most Americans inhabit. From farms to restaurants to retail stores to truck drivers, the elites, in their remote offices and relatively low regulatory environments aren’t much impacted when OSHA or the DOT or EPA issue new regulations that handicap small business owners. While Wall Street may be heavily regulated as it relates to advertising and fiduciary responsibilities, the actual buying and selling is relatively unregulated when compared to the red tape blue collar industries face. When it comes to higher taxes, this is usually a red herring for America’s barons. Many of America’s wealthiest leftists call for higher income taxes, one most of them don’t actually pay. Most billionaires don’t pay themselves much of a taxable salary and they earn most of their incomes from stock sales or dividends, which are typically taxed at a lower rate. Regardless, even if capital gains taxes were increased, they find opaque tax avoidance schemes that often reduce their taxes to zero or less, options that are rarely available to the average millionaire, nevermind the average Joe. Free speech is another element of American culture that elites seem to have little appreciation for. Leftists of all income ranges favor curtailing conservative speech, with violence a common tactic on college campuses. The elites don’t dirty their hands with violence, of course, rather seeking to act through their control over social and traditional media, or via DEI coercion tactics of firms like BlackRock and Citadel.

Blackrock manages over 11 Trillion dollars in assets. If you own indexed fund stocks you are basically turning your voting rights over to Blackrock and Vanguard. Don’t forget Kamala Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, who owns a huge amount of shares in Albermarle mining and bear in mind that Kamala Harris will be the one to sign off on the mining permits IF she steals the 2024 election.2ND husband has his fingers in Pharma too. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kamala-harriss-investment-portfolio-stocks-140010087.html Oh yeah!?!

(Bloomberg) -- Earnings season is here, and the US stock market’s furious $9 trillion 2024 rally is facing perhaps its biggest test of the year. Most Read from Bloomberg The Master Plan That Shaped Pakistan’s Capital Is No Longer Working The Cablebus Transformed Commutes in Mexico City’s Populous Outskirts Dubai’s Allure to Expats Is Weighing on City’s Infrastructure As Brussels Booms, an Old Boogeyman Returns: Brusselization Chicago Marathon to Honor Kenyan Who Died After His World Record Strategists are predicting that companies in the S&P 500 Index will post their weakest results in the past four quarters, with just a 4.3% increase in third-quarter profits compared with a year ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. In mid-June, projections were for an 8.4% rise, and in the second quarter growth soared to 14%. Despite the shrunken expectations, the S&P 500 hit another record high on Friday and is up 22% in 2024, its best start to a year since 1997. Investors who keep bidding up stock prices may be onto something, because there appears to be room for an upside earnings surprise if those reduced forecasts turn out to be overly gloomy. It happened in the first quarter, when expectations were for 3.8% growth and it turned out to be 7.9%. “Analysts lowered EPS estimates more than is typical heading into reporting, which could lead to an elevated beat rate and better equity performance across the quarter,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird. Earnings season unofficially kicked off on Friday, led by financial bellwethers JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and BlackRock Inc. More key companies will deliver results next week, including Citigroup Inc., Netflix Inc. and JB Hunt Transport Services Inc. Here’s a look at five key themes to watch as the results roll in: AI Slows Down The bulk of the growth in S&P 500 earnings continues to come from the big-technology companies that are seen as major beneficiaries from the development of artificial intelligence. The so-called Magnificent Seven firms — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Nvidia Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — are expected to post an 18% rise in profits in the third quarter. Their issue is the rate of increase is slowing, down from more than 30% in 2023, according to BI. For the rest of the S&P 500, profits are expected to climb 1.8% in the July-September period, which would be their second straight quarterly increase, albeit barely, BI data show. They posted 9.1% growth in the second quarter. That said, profits for the S&P’s “other 493” firms are projected to accelerate substantially from here, with double-digit gains anticipated in the first quarter of 2025, according to data compiled by BI. ‘Stock Picker’s Paradise’ Investors should expect some major swings in individual stocks that don’t show up in the broader index. The options market is pricing in the biggest average post-results implied move at the single-stock level since 2021, when Bank of America Corp. started collecting the data. But implied volatility at the index level is relatively muted, a sign that this earnings season could be a “stock picker’s paradise,” the firm’s strategists including Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Three of the 11 S&P 500 sectors — technology, communication services and health care — are expected to post profit expansions of more than 10%. The energy group, on the other hand, is expected to report a decline of more than 20%. The sector saw the biggest decline in profit estimates among 11 industry groups as crude prices plunged last quarter, according to BI chief equity strategist Gina Martin Adams. All About Margins Wall Street pros will be closely watching profit margins, which is a key measure of how effective companies have been at squeezing earnings out of their sales. Net-income margins are expected to slip to about 12.9%, less than the 13.1% reported in the second quarter but slightly higher than 12.8% in the third quarter of 2023, data compiled by BI show. The mild dip reflects the challenges some firms face in passing on input costs to costumers as wage pressures remain sticky in several low-productivity industries that are difficult to automate. Profit margins are going to be the weakest for energy and real estate stocks, BI data show. But looking more broadly, they’re expected to rebound in the coming quarters. Choppy European Markets In Europe, this earnings season could mark a turning point for the Stoxx 600 Index, which is hovering near record highs. Analysts cut profit estimates going into the third quarter, with a Citigroup index showing downgrades outnumbering upgrades since mid-June. Meanwhile, regional economies are seeing anemic growth, and manufacturing powerhouse Germany has forecast a contraction for a second year. While the reduced earnings estimates lower the bar for companies to beat expectations, forecasts for 2025 remain high and any guidance on weakening consumer demand would force them to come down, which would spill over into stock prices. A slew of high-profile companies, including Swedish clothing retailer Hennes & Mauritz AB and Volkswagen AG, have issued profit warnings in recent weeks. And a stunted recovery in China is likely to weigh on earnings at luxury goods makers such as LVMH. Election Focus With the US presidential election only weeks away, investors will be listening for mentions of economic and trade policy risks and other political issues from corporate executives. About 110 companies mentioned the word “election“ in their second-quarter earnings calls, up 62% from four years ago, BofA data show. History suggests that corporate investment activity accelerates after US presidential elections, which may be a catalyst for companies to unleash capital in the quarters ahead, particularly given lower interest rates, according to BofA’s Kwon. But it also may be delaying some expansion plans and other expenditures. “So much of the capital investment these days is AI related, and the election is not likely to curb that much, if at all,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. “However, now that we’re so close to the election, some of the more traditional capital commitments are likely to be delayed due to the political uncertainty.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jamie Dimon for Treasury Secretary: The Idea That Never Fades Lina Khan Is Just Getting Started (She Hopes) Inside the Companies That Set Sports Gambling Odds The Robotaxi Verdict Is In—And Wall Street Is Taking the Train Why Is It So Hard for Clothing Resale Platforms to Make Money? ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Mutual fund houses are rushing to load their armoury with passive funds before the pure play passive fund focused Jio Financial-Blackrock combine launch its business soon. In last nine months, 87 passive schemes were launched against 51 in the whole of last year. Mop-up through passive funds have more than doubled to ₹7,472 crore in September quarter against ₹3,415 crore in the previous two quarters (March and June) put together, according to AMFI data. The number of issuance was also substantially higher at 39 in September quarter against 18 NFOs in June quarter and 30 in March quarter. Capital market regulator SEBI gave in-principal approval to the new player launch mutual fund business subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and also notified MF Lite regulations. After promising to deliver alpha in actively managed funds, MFs are wooing investors with innovative smart beta passive funds instead of index tracking plain vanilla funds. Passive funds launched by large fund houses such as HDFC MF, Nippon MF, Birla MF and Tata MF have become an instant hit with investors. The fund houses either pick up top 10 or 30 stocks of a popular index to deliver smart beta. Tata MF has launched one of its kind Tata Nifty Capital Markets Index Funds. The newly introduced Nifty Capital Market index will consist of 20 companies from Nifty 500 index. Nippon Life India Asset Management recently launched Nifty 500 Equal Weight Index Fund and Nifty 500 Momentum 50 Index Fund. Tata MF launched a passive tourism fund, while DSP MF came out with a fund that invests only in top-10 companies of Nifty index. Investing in concentrated index funds will carry higher risk though it can deliver better return in a bull market. Anand Vardarajan, Chief Business Officer, Tata Asset Management said the country is witnessing a shift particularly among new generation who are not going to yesteryear savings vehicles but considering financial markets for investment. Investors should not be perturbed by the recent fall in market when they are investing for next five years as it is very natural for markets to move up or come down a bit, he added. Anil Ghelani, CFA, Head of Passive Investments, DSP MF said, investor interest is steadily increasing and financial advisors are also finding it useful to include passive funds in their recommendations. “Passive fund carries the risk of the underlying index it aims to track and the risks associated with broader equity markets,” he said.

Title: Scotiabank Initiates Outperform Rating for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Predicts Growth Driven by AI Innovations

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 308 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) operates as a technology conglomerate with core interests in the ecommerce business. Scotiabank analyst Nat Schindler recently initiated coverage of the stock with an Outperform rating and $245 price target. The advisory has a high level of confidence that consumers will use Amazon's services more in the future. It is also positive on the company's ability to monetize its artificial intelligence investments. The investment firm expects corporate uses, streamlining customer interactions, speeding code development, storing and contextualizing unstructured data, and other business efficiencies to be the most substantial near- to medium-term opportunities. Overall AMZN ranks 1st among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

October 12, 2024 6:30am by Barry Ritholtz The weekend is here! Pour yourself a mug of Los Brasiles coffee, grab a seat outside, and get ready for our longer-form weekend reads: • Mossad’s pager operation: Inside Israel’s penetration of Hezbollah: New details emerge of Israel’s elaborate plan to sabotage Hezbollah communications devices to kill or maim thousands of its operatives. (Washington Post) • How to win a Nobel prize: What subjects have past winners studied? What age were they when they won? Where do they live? Nature crunched the data on every science prizewinner to find out. (Nature) see also ‘You mean I have to stop my experiment?’ Not all Nobel laureates react the way you might expect: Adam Smith has spent 18 years recording the moments after the world’s brightest minds receive a life-changing call from the Nobel Prize committee. They might still be in bed when the call comes. But all Nobel Prize winners receive a phone call to break the big news to them. Then, moments after they hang up, their phone rings again. The man on the other end of the line is Adam Smith. (BBC) • Do Vanguard, Blackrock, and State Street Run the World? (Spoiler: No) In this blog post, I will explain why Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street’s “ownership” of the stock market is not an elaborate scheme to control the world. However, I will also discuss why their ownership may still be concerning for other reasons. To begin, let’s explain why Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street’s ownership of U.S. stocks is not the true definition of ownership. (Of Dollars and Data) • McDonald’s Macarons: How U.S. fast food took over the world — and then went local. (The Dial) • How Everyone Got Lost in Netflix’s Endless Library: Ten years after Silicon Valley remade TV, it’s become clear how the streaming revolution distorted our collective viewing habits — and sense of the culture. (New York Times) • The Most Sought-After Travel Guide Is a Google Doc: Although Google Docs and Maps are simple to share, the creators who spend years perfecting their magnum opus docs are often selective about who gets access. (Thrillist) • Age of Invention: The Coal Conquest: It’s long bothered me as to why coal became so important in Britain. It had sat in the ground for millennia, often near the surface. Near Newcastle and Sunderland it was often even strewn out on the beaches. Yet coal had largely only been used for some very specific, small-scale uses. It was fired in layers with limestone to produce lime, largely used in mortar for stone and brick buildings. And it had long been popular among blacksmiths, heating iron or steel in a forge before shaping it into weapons or tools. (Age of Invention) • Russia’s First Secret Influence Campaign: Convincing the U.S. to Buy Alaska: Russia has been peddling influence for a long time, using a playbook that it still uses today. (Politico) • Ant geopolitics: Over the past four centuries quadrillions of ants have created a strange and turbulent global society that shadows our own. (Aeon) • A Rodeo Doctor Fixes Much More Than Broken Bones: Injuries are inevitable in the world of bull riding. Enter Tandy Freeman, the only physician some cowboys ever see.

Title: Miriam Lord’s week: ‘More haste, less speed’ makes for an apt slogan as election fever symptoms erupt

Evidence pointing to a late November election continues to pile up, despite the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste’s increasingly wan insistence that it will be happening next year. If the fervent wishes of all those in Leinster House were enough to influence a decision, it would be called tomorrow. RTÉ’s Fiachra Ó Cionnaith’s tweeted a telltale photo this week of pallets of Fianna Fáil election posters shrink-wrapped with hundreds of smiling Micheál Martins and a slogan on the front plaintively whispering “Moving Forward Together” and “With Whoever Will Have Us” on the reverse. And as the parties attempt to stuff as much money into the coffers as possible before the election is called, Fine Gael supporters are noting with interest that the date of its Superdraw money-raising lottery has been brought forward from December 5th. There is major deck-clearing going on in Government Buildings. Sinn Féin is currently banjaxed. Jennifer Bray reports elsewhere on its latest catastrophe where they’re tearing the party to shreds in Kildare. Oh, and here’s what some see as the clincher. The Late Late Toy Show airs this year on December 6th, with “insiders” swearing that programme planners in Montrose moved it back from its traditional slot at the end of November to avoid a possible clash with general election coverage. And all those Fine Gael posters and billboards appearing like a rash on gable walls and bus shelters throughout the land. Like the billboard promising “A new energy for Kildare South” with candidates Joe Neville, Evie Sammon and Bernard Durkan alongside high-wattage Simon Harris beaming down on the masses. FG’s runners in Kildare South must have been shocked to see it. The aforementioned candidates are actually standing in Kildare North. The sense of indecent haste continues with Cllr John Paul O’Shea, the party’s candidate in Cork North West, ending up on the side of a bus shelter in Listowel, birthplace of Billy O’Shea, Fine Gael’s actual candidate in Kerry. And hats off to Minister for Higher Education Patrick O’Donovan, spectacularly ignoring his Government’s line that the election will be next year with huge billboards in Limerick. Featuring one huge photo of Patrick’s smiley phizog, it bears a simple message, writ large: “Patrick O’Donovan TD. Your Cabinet Minister for Limerick.” Nah. It’ll be in February. With TDs and senators all of a dither this week over claims that one of their own is a Russian secret agent, we were surprised not to hear the stentorian tones of former soldier Senator Gerard Craughwell holding forth on this critical issue of national security. Members of the Upper House have seemed far more exercised on this matter than their Dáil counterparts. Rear-Admiral Craughwell, who recently put the wind up Putin by threatening to send out a flotilla of finger-wagging Irish parliamentarians to monitor Russian naval manoeuvres in Irish waters, takes a keen interest in defence matters and his observations on the unfolding espionage crisis were much anticipated. Gerard, however, has been deeply involved in manoeuvres of a different kind. He is busy ensuring his re-election to the Seanad. A member of the Seanad’s independent group of senators, he was first elected in 2014, unexpectedly winning a by-election on the Cultural and Education panel after Fine Gael’s shoo-in candidate became embroiled in a row over government stroke politics and withdrew from the race. Despite it being incredibly tough for an independent to win in a contest where elected local politicians control the vote, he has managed to keep his seat by keeping the councillors sweet. This year, he splashed out on over 940 lapel badges and posted one to every councillor in the country. The pins, produced by Abbey Badges in Blackrock, are attractive items and have been “well received” says Senator Craughwell. “You will note the pins are unique with the name of the council on top, the council coat of arms and ‘elected June 2024′ at the bottom,” he tells us. “They are a mark of recognition and a collector’s item.” Each pin comes with a card from Gerard congratulating them on their success. “Wear it with pride for all that you have accomplished. Keep up the good work!” He also encloses full details of his particulars in case anyone wants to take them down. The race for the next Seanad may not have officially started, but it’s already in full swing. “Be sure I will run!” parps the bullish Craughwell. Of the many tributes paid to Mary O’Rourke since her death just over a week ago, one of the more interesting ones came from Ivan Yates, who was Fine Gael spokesman on public enterprise when Mary ran the department. Speaking on his weekly podcast with Matt Cooper, Ivan was full of praise for the political acumen of his erstwhile sparring partner – but he didn’t rate her at all as a minister. He was very firmly on the side of Brian Joyce, the former chairman of CIÉ who resigned on her ministerial watch citing “interference”, among other things. After the bombshell broke, Mary was shocked, breathlessly telling Morning Ireland how she heard the news. Ivan spoke vaguely of the way “this pressure came up”, which led to Mary revealing to the nation that she was “in the bath listening to the totally unannounced, unexpected resignation of Mr Joyce”. He regaled himself with details of his heroic part in this affair – how he played a blinder on the same programme a short time later, noting that after she went on about her bath “she proceeded to completely drop the towel and put the knife into Mr Joyce in a quite outrageous way”. Then they clashed on Prime Time, where she continued “savaging” Joyce while “letting on she didn’t know anything about it [the resignation] but she absolutely garrotted him”. Mary O’Rourke may not be around now to contradict him, but Richard Moore, her media adviser at the time, offers a more detailed timeline of what happened all those ago. It’s a tale full of drama and intrigue and he has never spoken about it before. That memorable bath and resignation episode happened on a Tuesday morning in the year 2000. On the previous day, Monday, March 6th, Mary was due to appear on RTÉ's Questions and Answers. There would, doubtless, be a question on the ongoing rows between her and her CIÉ chairman over how the organisation and, in particular, the rail system was funded and run. Joyce was appointed by Fine Gael in 1995 and had been due to retire in November 2000. Relations between them were always poor and Mary had been demanding a meeting with CIÉ’s chief executive later that week to discuss the company’s performance. Sadly, in a heartbreaking turn of events, the programme was cancelled due to the unexpected death of the presenter’s son. On Tuesday morning, The Irish Times splashed with a front page exclusive by Arthur Beesley. The story, with its leaked details, was filed on Monday night. Brian Joyce had resigned because of Mary O’Rourke’s “interference”. This came as a bolt from the blue to the Department. The usual practice if the chair of a semi-state was going to resign (or write a stern rebuke) was to call the Minister’s office first to let them know to expect a very important letter. That never happened in this case, recalls Richard Moore. Instead, Joyce’s resignation letter was hand-delivered to the minister’s office in Kildare Street after 8pm on Monday evening when she would have been in RTÉ, had circumstances not intervened. It was accepted by the security/service officer on duty and the unknown individual who delivered it said nothing about alerting the Minister or the Department to its importance. It was eventually opened on Tuesday, well after its contents had been revealed by The Irish Times. And well after RTÉ led its 7am radio bulletin with a report based on Beesley’s scoop. When she heard it, a stunned Mary immediately rang her media adviser. He headed straight into the office, getting in at 7.30am to find her already at her desk. She spoke to Morning Ireland after the 8am bulletin, famously declaring where she was when she heard the shock news. Afterwards, some commentators described the sharing of this detail as a masterstroke. All anyone could remember was that she was in the bath when somebody resigned and the story quickly faded. But back to RTÉ, where the plot thickens. Had Q&A not been cancelled at the last minute, Mary would have been on the panel with Fine Gael’s Jim Mitchell. A view quickly formed in Fianna Fáil circles – one shared by Moore – that the Minister escaped an ambush that night. Inevitably, she would have been asked about her troubled relationship with CIÉ and answered it with her usual confidence, only for someone – possibly the late Mr Mitchell – to remark if she was such a great minister, how come her chairman had resigned? Cue bafflement, consternation ... carnage. There is a delicious final twist. Much later on that fateful Tuesday, the then minister of state Mary Hanafin contacted O’Rourke about a strange voice message someone had left on her mobile phone. Richard Moore says it went something like: “Hello Ivan, I think matters have worked out well; let me know what else I can do.” In those days, TDs were allocated phones with sequenced numbers. There was (and still is) a one-digit difference between the phone numbers of Ivan Yates and Mary Hanafin. Back then, she was used to people leaving messages placing bets on horses. Yates was a bookie as well as an ambitious politician. O’Rourke believed she had her “gotcha!” moment. Her team downloaded Hanafin’s recording on to cassette tapes with a view to releasing it to the media at a snap press conference. It would have been sensational, particularly as the man who thought he was ringing Ivan Yates (and who did not get on with O’Rourke) gave his first name. But in the end they decided against it. Moore, who went on to set up a successful communications consultancy, felt this would complicate the unfolding resignation commentary – which was going well for his minister, while it might be best not to remind people of Fianna Fáil’s past history with recording phone calls. It took a lot of persuading, but Mary agreed to say nothing. A hard ask for the woman concerned, but she kept her part of the bargain. Our politics team’s behind-the-scenes take on events of the day.

Title: We have a problem with squirrels in our garden. What can we do to keep them at bay?

Q: We have a problem with grey squirrels in our city garden. They are digging in the beds and causing damage to some of the plants. Any tips on how to keep them at bay? RL, Blackrock, Dublin A: As charming as their arboreal acrobatics might be to watch, grey squirrels can be a real problem in Irish gardens, stripping bark from broad-leaf trees, raiding birds’ nests, burrowing into lawns and digging up flower bulbs. They also feed on seeds, nuts, fruits, tender shoots and flower buds and act as a vector for diseases such as squirrel pox virus which can kill the smaller native red squirrel in a matter of weeks. They are also known to sometimes overwinter in the attics of houses where they can cause considerable damage by chewing through wires and pipework and ripping up insulation as well as contaminating water tanks. Classed as an invasive species, they were first introduced into Ireland in 1911. Thankfully the spread of their natural predator the pine marten in recent years has acted as a curb on numbers. But in urban areas where the pine marten hasn’t gained much of a foothold, grey squirrels are still common. How to best manage them? I know of one Dublin gardener who tried trapping them in a baited cage before releasing them into the wild. But this is not recommended, not least because they breed so prolifically that it would barely put a dent in their numbers but also because it could potentially threaten red squirrel populations. Bird feeders are an obvious draw, so make sure to use squirrel-proof models that prevent them from easily raiding them for food. Recently planted flower bulbs are another, for which reason seasoned gardeners often like to plant theirs under a protective layer of fine mesh chicken wire concealed beneath the surface of the soil of compost. Alternatively, they can be planted into an aquatic basket (the kind used for pond plants) covered with a layer of chicken wire and then planted into the ground. It’s also a good idea to regularly check your home for any small gaps in the eaves and/or soffit boards that could allow them entry, especially at this time of year when they are searching for a sheltered place in which to overwinter. These should be blocked up with a fine-gauge wire mesh (16 gauge, no more than 25mm size). But even with these measures, I’m afraid that they are likely to continue to be a problem.

Title: Mizuho Raises Equinix, Inc. (EQIX) Price Target to $971, Maintains Outperform Rating Amid Positive Outlook for Cab Billing Growth and xScale Demand

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) stands against the other trending AI stocks. Two years after the public debut of ChatGPT, the generative AI landscape has evolved rapidly, igniting substantial investments in artificial intelligence and lifting valuations for startups and major tech companies alike. This surge in interest has primarily centered on cloud-based AI, where services like OpenAI's models operate on extensive data infrastructures. However, as these models grow in complexity, the demand for larger and more advanced data centers intensifies, leading to a race among companies to construct expansive facilities. Significant investments are projected, with estimates suggesting that major players will collectively spend around $160 billion in capital expenditures next year, primarily for acquiring powerful GPUs and related infrastructure necessary for training AI models. Top executives have even forecasted that global data center investments could double to $2 trillion within the next few years. Nevertheless, the sustainability of this spending spree raises questions about whether the revenue generated from AI applications can match the high costs of development and infrastructure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Amid these challenges, a new trend in edge AI is emerging. This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

Our Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of IT professionals working on a digital platform, indicating the company's agile digital services. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56 Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) is a California-based real estate trust that operates data centers and other technology assets. Mizuho recently raised the price target on the stock to $971 from $873 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after speaking with management. The company's cab's billing growth will improve in the second half of 2024 and when combined with strong pricing power, there is upside to monthly recurring revenue, the advisory told investors in a research note. The investment firm sees multiple levers of earnings and sales growth for Equinix. While still a small part of the business, the company suggested a very robust demand pipeline for its xScale portfolio, added Mizuho. Overall EQIX ranks 16th among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of EQIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EQIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Arm Holdings stock hits all the right notes for AI investors. It has a high historical revenue growth rate of 18% and analysts expect this growth to accelerate moving forward to 22% annually. These numbers are supported by strong license and royalty revenue, as well as increasing adoption of the chip architecture of the firm that competes on cost and energy efficiency. Daiwa recently upgraded the stock to Outperform from Neutral with a $130 price target, noting that following a few interesting and volatile quarters, the bad news of a possible recession was out, and tech was settling post the big recent selloff, though AI expectations were still strong. The advisory expected Arm shares to trend further upwards in the next few months. Overall ARM ranks 22nd among the AI stocks that are trending right now.

This concept involves running AI algorithms directly on personal devices like smartphones and computers rather than relying on centralized cloud servers. Edge AI offers numerous benefits, including real-time response capabilities without requiring a high-speed internet connection and enhanced privacy since user data remains on personal devices. Analysts project that nearly 50% of smartphones will have generative AI capabilities by 2027, a significant increase from the current 4%. However, implementing edge AI presents technical hurdles, primarily due to existing devices lacking the necessary computing power and memory to support large AI models. For instance, running OpenAI's GPT-4 model, which contains approximately 1.8 trillion parameters, is not feasible on typical smartphones today. Nevertheless, smaller, task-specific AI models are gaining traction, as they require less training data and can outperform larger, more generalized models in certain applications. These lightweight models are often open-source and designed for specific functions, making them easier to implement on consumer devices. As semiconductor companies continue to innovate by increasing processing power and memory in smartphones and PCs, the capacity for running AI models on these devices is expected to grow. Research indicates that the proportion of smartphones capable of supporting large AI models could rise significantly within the next few years. Major chip manufacturers are advancing technologies such as chipset designs, allowing them to create more powerful processors without needing to shrink the circuitry. For investors, the rise of edge AI could lead to new opportunities and growth within the consumer electronics market, as users are likely to upgrade their devices to take advantage of enhanced AI functionalities. UBS analysts project that combined sales of smartphones and PCs could exceed $700 billion by 2027. Ultimately, the success of edge AI hinges on the development of compelling applications that consumers find valuable enough to invest in.

(NASDAQ:EVLV) provides artificial intelligence-based weapons detection solutions for security screening in the United States and internationally. The shares of the firm are on a downward spiral after reports in the US media, published by New York Daily News, indicated that the New York Department of Investigation was probing allegations of improper deployment of a weapons detection system in the New York City subway system by Mayor Eric Adams. The weapons detection system in question is made by Evolv. The firm claims that with the help of advanced sensor technology and AI, the system can detect weapons much faster than traditional metal detectors. The company has been testing this system in New York over the past few months, with mixed results. Overall EVLV ranks 31st among the AI stocks that are trending right now. While we acknowledge the potential of EVLV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Letters: Key workers in our capital should get first dibs on any below market-cost rentals

Gardaí are among the key workers facing soaring rents in Dublin. Photo: Getty John Coleman, CEO of the Land Development Agency will appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) next week to confirm the building of 17,000 new homes in the coming years. These homes will be rented at €1,000 below market rent. Wonderful and welcome news, as we all have a responsibility to look after the least well-off. Unfortunately, there was not one word about how our key workers can no longer afford to live in Dublin. Dublin is one of the few developed capital cities in the world that does not pay “weighting allowances” to retain key workers. We are educating them in the thousands to emigrate. No city can function properly without key workers, and if this problem is not addressed then Dublin and Ireland will suffer both socially and economically in the future. Many will argue that the rot has already set in and point to the scarcity of gardaí, teachers and nurses. Will any member of the PAC have the courage to ask Mr Coleman if the billions being spent on housing by the Government do anything to solve the rental crisis for key workers in Dublin? We need key workers more than they need us. Paschal Taggart, Rathgar, Dublin 6 One notes that Trinity College Dublin has renamed the Berkeley Library after the Irish poet Eavan Boland. This has come about after years of campaigning from students and staff as a way of celebrating those who use these buildings. It’s important to remember that George Berkeley – Anglo-Irish philosopher, bishop and cannabis user – was a slave owner as well as being a vocal proponent of this egregious trade. I found it incredulous that Ireland’s most celebrated philosopher was extremely flawed and fallible. Trinity College never had any buildings named after women until now. This indicates to me a college that is modernising itself in meeting with the challenges of today. It would be true to say progress is slow, but the arc of history always bends towards justice. I am delighted this renaming has occurred, as it is important that we always acknowledge the students who use these buildings. What the renaming brings up for me is that there is no tradition too sacred to question. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary This week has underscored the devastating impact of our current economic model on nature. The World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report reveals a calamitous decline in wildlife populations since 1970, with ecosystems like the Amazon and coral reefs nearing collapse (‘Tipping point near as wildlife populations down 73pc in 50 years’, Irish Independent, October 10). These ecosystems are vital for our climate, but also our food and health. At the same time, the report warned of potential “social collapse” from climate change, with regions becoming uninhabitable and millions at risk. Yet there is hope. Both reports stress that reversing this damage is still possible with radical, urgent changes in our economics, politics, behaviour and assumptions. Change starts with each of us. By acting locally, uniting with others and demanding accountability from the powerful, we can spark the wider transformation needed to protect the planet. Hans Zomer, Global Action Plan As a tillage farmer reaching Irish climate change targetsyears earlier than the target set by our Government, I do have to ask how is that we have to use Irish cream from Irish cows to make Irish cream liquors, yet there is no mention where the grain has to come from to make our world-famous Irish whiskeys? The technical file covering both liquors and whiskey was drafted by our Department of Agriculture and I have to ask why is the imbalance in the two agricultural sectors – tillage and dairy – in favour of dairy? Why not protect the tillage sector in an equal fashion? In a world of climate change, where I believe I produce a near net-zero carbon footprint product, where is the support from the Government for me and my fellow tillage farmers? The Irish tillage sector has by far the lowest greenhouse gas emissions compared to other agricultural sectors, according to state body Teagasc. Bobby Miller, Stradbally, Co Laois I must disagree with Larry Dunne that “banning mobile phones in schools is just another excuse for teachers to assert control” (Letters, Irish Independent, October 10). Teachers do need to have control in their classrooms and I don’t believe any excuses are needed. A smartphone is not just a phone, it is also a camera, a calculator and a computer. Schools are well equipped with calculators and computers, so there is no need for smartphones in classrooms. A camera is not necessary in classrooms, either, and in my opinion smartphones should not be allowed in schools at all, as they can be used as tools of intimidation and bullying of both students and teachers. Most of all, phones are a distraction to students who can hear message alerts if they have them in their schoolbags. Marion Dermody, Co Kildare Ciara Kelly’s excellent comment article (‘Acts of abuse by trusted educators have devastating impacts reaching far beyond the boys who were the actual victims of these vile men’, Irish Independent, October 7) brought back some very unpleasant buried memories of my eight years boarding in Willow Park and Blackrock College in the 1960s. One such memory was the priest who chased us around the fields of Willow Park trying to hit us on the bum with his biffer – a short, thick leather strap. I actually remember running so hard as I knew being hit by this vile object was extremely painful. ​ Brian Mc Devitt, Glenties, Co Donegal Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: BlackRock’s AUM Soars to $11.5 Trillion with Q3 Gains of $160 Billion

The world’s largest asset manager BlackRock has seen its asset under management (AUM) surge by a whopping $160 billion during the third quarter of the year, to now have a record-breaking $11.5 trillion in AUM. According to a recent Bloomberg report, investors were particularly drawn to BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) offerings – which include a spot Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) – investing $97 billion in these funds. Additionally, fixed-income investments saw a significant influx of $63 billion, leading the company’s year-to-date inflows to $360 billion, a figure that surpasses its total net flows seen in both 2022 and 2023. BlackRock has garnered an impressive $360 billion in net inflows year-to-date, surpassing its total net flows for both 2022 and 2023. BlackRock has further solidified its position as a one-stop shop for investments by completing the acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. The deal added $116 billion in private market assets to BlackRock’s portfolio, which has also seen strong demand for cash management and money-market funds, attracting $61 billion in net flows during the quarter. The firm’s growth has been fueled by a favorable market environment, with a surge in stocks and increasing investor interest in fixed-income and private funds. The S&P 500 Index’s ‘unstoppable’ rise so far this year and expectations for a less aggressive Federal Reserve rate hike have contributed to this positive trend. BlackRock’s financial performance saw its adjusted net income per share rise 5% to $11.46 and revenue 15% to $5.2 billion. Its market-leading spot Bitcoin ETF, according to CoinGlass data, currently has around $17.2 billion of assets under management, far above its closest competitors, Grayscale’s GBTC and Fidelity’s FBTC, which have $13.1 billion and $9.9 billion in AUM, respectively.

Financial powerhouses including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and BlackRock reported strong earnings on Friday, sending shares soaring and Wall Street into new record territory. U.S.: Tesla keeps Nasdaq in check while Dow and S&P set recordsThe S&P 500 set another new record, its second this week, climbing 0.61% Friday on positive earnings and producer price index data. Same goes for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which climbed 0.97% to close at another all-time high. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had to contend with Tesla shares tumbling after the launch of the Cybercab. Europe: U.S. data has ripple effect, sending stocks upEuropean stocks hovered early Friday but closed up, with the UK’s FTSE 100 climbing 0.19% and the STOXX Europe 600 at 0.55% on positive earnings reports from big banks on Wall Street. The markets had a lot to digest Friday, including a stimulus briefing planned in Beijing and France’s new draft budget. China: Shares slip ahead of stimulus briefingA day after China shares rebounded on stimulus optimism, Shanghai’s SSE Composite slid 2.5%. Markets are cautious ahead of Beijing’s Saturday briefing, at which investors are hoping for more measures to boost the economy. Hong Kong markets were closed for a public holiday. Japan: Nikkei posts small rise on the back of banks and Uniqlo The Nikkei 225 notched a 0.57% rise as it headed into the weekend, led by the financial sector and a 6.09% jump in Uniqlo-owner Fast Retailing, which hit an all-time high after reporting stronger-than-expected revenue and profits for the year. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

US stocks rose to records Friday as big banks rallied following a run of reassuring profit reports. The Dow rose 409.74 points, or 1%, to 42,863.86, a record. The S&P 500 rose 34.98 points, or 0.6%, to 5,815.03, topping its all-time high set earlier in the week. The Nasdaq rose 60.89 points, or 0.3%, to 18,342.94, held down by Tesla's slide. Wells Fargo rose 5.6% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, the AP reports. It benefited from better results from its venture-capital investments and higher fees for investment-banking services, among other factors. Banks and other financial giants traditionally kick off each earnings reporting season, and JPMorgan Chase climbed 4.4% after reporting a milder drop in profit than analysts feared. That was the strongest single force pushing upward on the S&P 500. CEO Jamie Dimon said the nation's largest bank is also still buying back shares of its stock to send cash to investors, though the pace is modest "given that market levels are at least slightly inflated." BlackRock rose 3.6% after likewise delivering better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The investment giant ended September managing a record $11.5 trillion in total assets for its customers. The gains for banks helped make up for the drag of Tesla, which tumbled 8.8% and was the heaviest weight on the market. The electric-vehicle maker unveiled its long-awaited robotaxi on Thursday night, but critics highlighted a lack of details about its planned rollout. Following the unveiling of the "Cybercab," potential rival Uber Technologies jumped 10.8% and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Lyft rose 9.6%. (More Wall Street stories.)

U.Today - American multinational investment giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has extended its lead as the world’s dominant asset manager with an $11.5 trillion Asset Under Management (AUM) milestone. As revealed in its third-quarter earnings report, the company said its AUM jumped $2.4 trillion year-over-year, driven by net inflows of $456 billion and positive market movements. This product marked a complete pivot for BlackRock, a traditionally conservative firm. In line with its adoption of Bitcoin, CEO Larry Fink is now one of the major advocates of the digital currency. With the AUM boost, it remains unclear what the firm plans for its iShares Bitcoin Trust product overall. While the Bitcoin ETF is BlackRock's flagship and most popular crypto product, BlackRock is also fully invested in iShares Ethereum Trust, the ETH ETF. Despite the generally poorer performance of Ethereum ETF products, BlackRock remains in the lead among issuers overall. With the massive uptick in BlackRock AUM, it may be inferred that Bitcoin and Ethereum contributed significantly to this new milestone. As a regulated investment outfit, BlackRock is combining a conservative approach with new tech adoption. As such, its current capital base might encourage it to take more calculated risks in the coin moving forward. Despite BlackRock's stance, not all rivals share its vision for Bitcoin. Firms like Vanguard have specifically issued a highly publicized disclaimer that it will not get involved with Bitcoin, or crypto in general. This article was originally published on U.Today

Shares of BlackRock (BLK) hit an all-time high Friday after the investment firm easily topped financial estimates and posted records for assets and inflows. The company reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $11.46, with revenue increasing 14.9% year-over-year to $5.20 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $10.38 and $5.02 billion, respectively. BlackRock's assets under management (AUM) rose $2.4 trillion to $11.5 trillion, and net inflows came in at $221 billion, both all-time highs. The company explained that the big jump in revenue came from "the positive impact of markets on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and higher performance fees." Chief Executive Officer CEO Larry Fink said, "Our strategy is ambitious, and our strategy is working." He noted that the firm was driving "access to the enormous investment potential of infrastructure, especially to support AI innovation." Fink added that "the opportunities ahead of us have never been greater." BlackRock shares recently rose 3% to $983.28 after earlier touching a record $995.99. They are up more than 20% year-to-date.

Title: Child going abroad for scoliosis surgery can travel business class with one parent, says CHI

Children with scoliosis who are going abroad for treatment under a new scheme can travel business class on a plane with one parent, while the other will be booked in economy, it emerged today. The travel package for children was detailed as it emerged up to 38 children have had their spinal surgery outsourced from Dublin children’s hospital to another hospital, including hospitals in the UK and the United States, according to September waiting list figures. The travel package states for comfort and flexibility, families will be booked into either a three-star hotel or a serviced apartment, close to the hospital abroad. Families will be provided with these details directly before their travel date, it added. Families will be provided with a daily stipend for meals and expenses while they are away. Before the trip, parents will receive a prepaid currency card. More information about this will be discussed directly with families when their surgery date is confirmed, said CHI. It will include travel insurance, an issue which some parents were worried about. Under an initiative to reduce waiting list for children with scoliosis needing spinal surgery it was announced during the summer that suitable patients could have their surgeries in other designated hospitals. Overall, the waiting list or spinal surgery in September stood at 248 compared to 258 the month previously. The children whose care are outsourced come under the suspended list. Children’s Health Ireland (CHI), which oversees the three children's hospitals, announced during the summer that it was engaging with other hospitals and organisations, both in Ireland and abroad, regarding spinal surgeries and patient care agreements. At that stage a number of patients had been assessed and deemed suitable for spinal surgery abroad. The hospitals include New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital and the Portland Hospital in London There is an ongoing agreement with Blackrock Clinic in Dublin to continue to work together to expand out-sourcing for adolescents who require spinal fusion surgery. For the first time CHI has published dedicated phone numbers and the names of staff who will take calls from parents on clinical questions.There are also personal emails for questions around surgery abroad and an email for a spinal patient advocate liaison coordinator. Advocacy groups representing parents of children on the waiting list have remained critical of the service and poor communication with reports of parents trying to get an update on their child and failing to get information. Waiting list figures show that nationally 87,022 patients were waiting for an appointment for their inpatient or day case treatment in September. While 23,883 patients were waiting to receive an appointment for their gastrointestinal endoscopy and 595,575 patients are waiting for a first hospital outpatient consultation. The Department of Health said today the hospital waiting list for hospitals across the country demonstrate the progress achieved through the multi-annual action plan approach implemented by the Government to address long wait times for care. The latest hospital activity report, published by the Health Service Executive (HSE), shows increased levels of activity in the delivery of scheduled and unscheduled care. The figures show significant positive progress being achieved in terms of patients waiting longest. There has been a .17pc reduction in the total number of patients waiting over 12 months since this time last year, and a corresponding reduction of .27pc in the number waiting over 18 months.

Title: Inside Track On The Wall Street Embrace Of Bitcoin And Digital Assets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/11/inside-track-on-the-wall-street-embrace-of-bitcoin-and-digital-assets/

BUDAPEST, HUNGARY - SEPTEMBER 22: A statue of Satoshi Nakamoto, a presumed pseudonym used by the ... [+] inventor of Bitcoin, is displayed in Graphisoft Park on September 22, 2021 in Budapest, Hungary. The statue's creators, Reka Gergely and Tamas Gilly, used anonymized facial features, as Nakamoto's true identify remains unconfirmed. (Photo by Janos Kummer/Getty Images) There should no longer be a question in anyone’s mind that bitcoin is here to stay. What may be a little less clear is, why? The answer is fairly simple: Wall Street found the money. The last sentence should be amusing to those who are supporters of bitcoin or are immersed in the digital asset class. Bitcoin Bitcoin , after all, was created to be money. On October 31, 2008, the mysterious unknown developer of bitcoin who goes under the what is widely believed to be a pseudonymous name, Satoshi Nakamoto, described a digital cryptocurrency in a white paper titled, “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” It is entirely plausible that the leaders of global financial institutions read the white paper, studied the behavior of bitcoin throughout the fifteen plus years of existence, and converted to the belief system that bitcoin is going to have a fundamental impact on the global financial system. There is no reason to believe this did not happen. Chairman and CEO of BlackRock Larry Fink (Photo by Mat Szwajkos/Getty Images) This is, in fact, fairly close to what Larry Fink, the chief executive of Blackrock, believed to be the world’s largest asset manager, said during an interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC. Larry Fink said, “I was a proud skeptic. I studied it. Learned about it, and I came away saying okay, my opinion five years ago was wrong, here is my opinion today, I believe the opportunity today. I believe bitcoin is legitimate…it is a legitimate financial instrument that allows you to have uncorrelated, non-correlated type of returns.” There is an alternative explanation, however, that is equally plausible: the global financial institutions simply listened to their customers. In the month of October 2024, bitcoin has a market cap of over $1.2 trillion. There may be reasons to be skeptical of bitcoin, and far more reasons when considering the broader cryptocurrency universe, but it is impossible to deny that an asset with a value of over one trillion dollars is not real or meaningful. Young traders are taught that markets have momentum, and that momentum and market sentiment can be more important than fundamentals. Experienced financial market participants know that the markets can be like trains, and one should never stand in the way of a freight train under the misguided belief that you know exactly where it is going to stop. Bitcoin is a train in motion. Skeptics should be careful. Customers across the entire spectrum, from retail to institutional, have expressed interest in bitcoin. More importantly, these customers have asked financial service institutions to provide access to bitcoin in a manner consistent with other established financial assets. LevelField Financial, my firm, is in the process of acquiring a U.S. chartered bank because we heard those customers, and we wish to provide a safe, simple, and secure experience for customers who wish to participate in the digital asset class. Financial institutions – particularly the large Wall Street firms – exist to serve customers. If they do not offer the products and services requested by their customers, then it is entirely probable that those customers will migrate to other firms that offer the desired products. For financial institutions, meeting the needs of customers is how they generate revenue. All products and services sold to customers generate value for the firm, one way or another. Put another way, financial institutions make money by selling products to customers that the customers want to buy. Customers have said they wanted access to bitcoin products. For institutions they face a choice: not delivering such products could potentially risk the customer relationship, while providing the customers the products they want will generate revenue for the firm. It may be the case that the titans of Wall Street are converts to the future of cryptocurrency based upon extensive study and a belief that this asset class represents a considerable improvement over the status quo. Alternatively, a simple explanation for why so many firms are supporting bitcoin may be that they are simply reacting to overwhelming demand from their customers. After all, strong demand for products can lead to lucrative profits. Occam’s razor suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. Financial institutions responding to their customers and making money while doing so is how markets are supposed to work. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Why are we seeing the Northern Lights more frequently in Ireland?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/environment/2024/10/11/why-are-we-seeing-the-northern-lights-more-frequently-in-ireland/
Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:32Z
Full Content:
The Northern Lights, also known as aurora borealis, are the results of collisions between gas particles in our atmosphere and charged particles ejected from the sun’s atmosphere. The colour of the Northern Lights change due to the type of gas particles that are colliding. Oxygen molecules at approximately 100km above the earth produce a greenish-yellow colour, while a red aurora can be seen when high-level oxygen molecules are involved. Blue or purple auroras indicate the presence of nitrogen molecules. Frances McCarthy, education officer at MTU’s Blackrock Castle Observatory in Cork, said it was predicted based on images of the sun that showed a “coronal mass ejection”, where a large amount of the outer part of the sun’s atmosphere was ejected into space. “When the charged material from the sun arrived yesterday, it affected the upper atmosphere near the poles and made the glow of the aurora,” she said. “We saw red light in Cork, due to oxygen at the upper levels glowing. Red aurora are rare. The green light was from lower level atmospheric gases, and are more common. Prior to this, I had only ever seen green aurora.” The UK’s Met Office had also reported that sightings of the Northern Lights were likely on Thursday night and the early hours of Friday across northern areas of the UK. Solar activity changes in an 11-year cycle and we are currently near the top of the cycle of most activity, so eruptions such as coronal mass ejections and sunspots are more common. Ms McCarthy added that the sun was “last this active in 1989” while aurora are more common near the north and south magnetic poles so only very strong space weather events will affect us or be visible to us as aurora. The Northern Lights are best observed in locations with very small amounts of light pollution and clear skies in terms of ideal weather conditions. Parts of the west and north coast offer the greatest chance of seeing the display, according to Met Éireann. It points out there are a number of forecast services for the Northern Lights; including one which comes from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that provides a 30-minute forecast for the aurora. People can also check out spaceweather.com. Unfortunately no, we are not likely to see the Northern Lights again on Friday night as the geomagnetic storm is subsiding. Ms McCarthy added there would be chances again in the future to see the Northern Lights but probably not this weekend. Sarah Burns is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Catch up on the latest World of Warcraft news with This Week in WoW (TWiW)! Join the celebration as World of Warcraft celebrates its 20th Anniversary with new activities and myriad ways to earn currency. When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Grab all the celebration details from our World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Celebration article. The WoW 20th Anniversary introduces a variety of new activities and ways to earn currency during the event, which can be used to purchase myriad items including iconic Tier 2 transmog appearance sets. We’ve consulted top goblins and tallied it all up so that you know how to earn these currencies and where you can spend them. Players will also automatically be granted a 10% experience and reputation buff during the Anniversary and can add an additional 10% experience and reputation buff by completing the repeatable “Celebrate Good Fun” quest with Yllana. This buff will not countdown while offline and will be offered to you again once per day when it expires. Developer Insights: For the Anniversary event, we want these epic new rewards to feel both special to players and well-earned. To that end, we have worked to create a rewarding system that should help players earn their first Tier 2 set in the first 2-3 weeks, depending upon their play style. We know that there are a lot of people who are excited to earn more sets if not all of them. To accommodate this, we have both discounts and increased abilities to earn currency that kick in after those early weeks (detailed further below). This should allow players who play through the event regularly to have the ability to earn all thirteen of these Tier Sets and many, if not all of the other new cosmetic rewards tied to the anniversary. If you run out of time this year, don’t worry; we will have the sets available from the anniversary event in future years. Learn all the details about currency types, anniversary vendors, Tier 2 armor appearances, and more from our previously published article. Calling defenders of Azeroth to brave the inferno and push back against Ragnaros and his wayward loyalists—the Rage of the Firelands update arrives on October 29, followed by the Firelands Raid on November 7. The Rage of the Firelands content update will burn an indelible mark in Azeroth's history. Take on the new Elemental Bonds questline, and increase the challenges for powerful rewards with the new Elemental Rune Dungeons: Protocol Inferno difficulty option. Then, soon after the update, the legendary Firelands Raid arrives with its Raid tier armor and weapons, two new mounts, Achievements, and seven unique boss encounters. This will also be the stop for Druid, Mage, Priest, Shaman, or Warlock in their quest to build the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, a weapon of unsurpassed quality that requires a spectacular effort to construct. Like the Shadowmourne questline in Wrath of the Lich King Classic, adjustments have been made to make Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest, faster to acquire on both 10 and 25-player raid sizes. More details await you in our previously published article. The time to strike at Ragnaros the Firelord draws near. For all champions daring to begin a new adventure or continue their odyssey in Azeroth, you can prepare for the heat when you take advantage of the Joyous Journeys experience buff*, which increases experience gains by 50% for all players up to level 85! Finish leveling a character, create a new one, or invite friends to join you in Cataclysm Classic. The buff is active by default, but you can visit any innkeeper in the capital cities and Dalaran to turn it off or on again. Take advantage of the Joyous Journey’s experience buff now. It’s an excellent opportunity for new and returning players to level up and join the defenders of Hyjal as they fight to create a foothold in the Firelands at the Molten Front before the Ragnaros makes his grand entrance in the Rage of the Firelands content update. Carve ghoulish gourds and sinister-looking squash when you take an auditory adventure through the eeriest soundscapes of Azeroth: 00:00:00 – Crypt by Russell Brower 00:01:38 – Haunted by Russell Brower, Jason Hayes 00:07:03 – Cursed by Derek Duke 00:19:02 – Scarlet Monastery by Jeremy Soule 00:23:00 – Azj-Kahet by Jake Lefkowitz, Leo Kaliski 00:33:17 – Nathria by Grant Kirkhope, Jake Lefkowitz 00:45:00 – Karazhan by Russell Brower 01:30:30 – “Scholomance” by Jeremy Soule Follow along on the official World of Warcraft news site for all the latest developments as we journey through the week together.

Title: Altice Offers Creditors 15% Stake in Return for Haircut
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/altice-offers-creditors-15-stake-in-return-for-haircut-11728664364432.html
Time Published: 2024-10-11T16:32:43Z
Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Altice France is floating a proposal to give secured creditors a stake in the company to get them to agree to a haircut on their holdings, as the embattled telecommunications giant seeks to whittle away at its €24.4 billion ($26.7 billion) of debt. Under this informal proposal, debtholders would get an equity stake of between 10% and 15% in exchange for writing off the same amount of their principal, according to people familiar with the matter. Other features of the plan include the extension of the maturities by a certain number of years with a lower interest rate than the existing debt, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. The proposal, which was put forward to advisers of its secured creditors, doesn’t envisage new funds from billionaire owner Patrick Drahi, who would remain in charge, the people added. While this was not a formal offer, the company asked the steering committee if the creditors would be willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement to negotiate on this basis, the people said. BlackRock Inc., Elliott Investment Management and Pacific Investment Management Co. are among the investors in the steering committee, Bloomberg reported earlier. Spokespeople for Altice and the secured group of creditors declined to comment. Altice France’s €800 million secured bond due in October 2029 rose about 3.5 cents on the euro to 75.7 cents on Friday, the highest since March, according to pricing compiled by Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Altice France Holding’s €1.3 billion unsecured bond due in May 2027 fell 1.6 cents on the euro to about 30 cents, the biggest drop since April. While the plan in some ways represents a more attractive option for creditors than an earlier offer proposing a 20% haircut, the latest suggestion is still a long way away from the idea put forward by the lenders themselves, under which Drahi would have potentially lost control of the company. The latest proposal would still fall short of achieving a sustainable capital structure, some of the people familiar added. Altice is in talks with its creditors to cut its debt to reach a leverage target of below 4 times its earnings, from 6.7 times. Sentiment in the leveraged finance market is fairly positive on the back of recent interest rate cuts. A lack of supply has also seen investors reach for yield on a technical basis. That means borrowers have been able to get fairly aggressive deals accepted by buysiders, something that could potentially benefit Altice. Investor appetite is certainly stronger than it was when the company first told creditors in March that they would need to take losses. A group of creditors holding about 90% of Altice’s secured debt recently agreed to extend a cooperation agreement that binds them in negotiations on restructuring the company’s balance sheet by a year until February 2026. Separate to the discussions with creditors, the company has also held talks with funds including Apollo Global Management about raising new debt to repay looming maturities, potentially hurting existing creditors down the line, Bloomberg reported earlier. --With assistance from Eleanor Duncan.

The Dow and S&P 500 scored record closing highs on Friday, with the big boosts from financial stocks after banks reported strong quarterly results while the latest inflation data fueled expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 409.74 points, or 0.8%, to 42,863.86, eclipsing its Wednesday record close of 42,512. The blue-chip touched an intraday record high of 42,899.75. The S&P 500 gained 0.6% and closed above 5,800 for the first time. The Nasdaq was up 0.3%. For the week, the S&P 500 added 1.1% while the Dow climbed 1.2% and the Nasdaq added 1.1% with all three notching their fifth weekly gain in a row. Major financial companies kicked off earnings season with JPMorgan Chase finishing the session up 4.4% after the lender reported higher-than-expected third-quarter profit and raised its annual interest income forecast. Shares in Wells Fargo rallied 5.6% after its profit also beat analysts’ expectations. BlackRock stock gained 3.6% after the asset manager reported that its assets under management had hit a record high for the third straight quarter. Other stocks in the industry rose broadly, making the S&P 500 Financials index the biggest index points boost for the benchmark. “We’d some good earnings reports from some leading financial companies. That’s a good start to earnings season,” said Evan Brown, Portfolio Manager and Head of Multi-Asset Strategy, UBS Asset Management, adding that it bodes well for the economy. “When financials do well, this is what a soft landing looks like. It’s a positive overall sign for the economy and sets a positive tone for earnings releases in other industries in the next few weeks.” Earlier in the day, data from the Department of Labor showed the Producer Price Index (PPI) for final demand was unchanged on a monthly basis in September, compared to the 0.1% rise expected by economists polled by Reuters. Friday’s PPI data follows Thursday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) reading, which was slightly higher than forecast, although weekly jobless claims rose more than expected.

Never miss a story. “The market’s pretty convinced that we’re going to have a soft landing and that inflation, even with CPI being a little bit higher than expected yesterday, is going to be moderate,” said Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “If you look at today’s PPI data, the core and final demand were both a little lower than expected … Inflation’s certainly been moderating and that’s a positive that the market paid attention to.” Meanwhile, a preliminary reading of the University of Michigan’s October consumer sentiment index stood at 68.9, compared with analysts’ estimate of 70.8. With the week’s data under their belts, traders kept bets steady for a roughly 88% probability the Fed would cut rates by 25 basis points at its November meeting, and a 12% chance it will leave rates unchanged, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. During the session the consumer discretionary index was under pressure from an 8.8% slump in shares of Tesla after the EV maker unveiled its long awaited robotaxi, but did not provide details on how fast it could ramp up production or deal with potential regulatory hurdles.

Title: BlackRock brought in more money last quarter than ever before. Here's where the $11.5 trillion asset manager hopes to become the industry leader next.

BlackRock became the world's largest asset manager because it made cheap funds for the masses. Now, the $11.5 trillion behemoth wants to put high-fee private market strategies in your portfolio. The firm brought in more assets last quarter — $221 billion — than ever before, but on its earnings call, the firm's leaders focused more on integrating strategies from the recent acquisition of Global Infrastructure Partners into model portfolios than on its ballooning ETF franchise. "This is a revenue growth story," said BlackRock's chief financial officer Martin Small Friday morning. GIP, the infrastructure asset manager that BlackRock paid $12.5 billion for, is expected to add $250 million in management fees to BlackRock's bottom line in the fourth quarter alone. "This is a meaningful accelerant to our private markets capabilities," he said. A quarter century after BlackRock went public — the firm IPOed on October 1, 1999 — the firm hopes to blend its private market strategies into its model portfolios for wealth managers. Private equity and private credit strategies have the potential to bring on higher returns but are also less liquid and more expensive investments than mutual funds or ETFs. The manager is hoping to be the builder of next-generation technology, whether that's data centers needed for artificial intelligence or infrastructure needed for decarbonization. "We're not going to say they're alternatives because they'll just be part of the market," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, about private strategies, which have long been touted in industry lingo as "alternatives" to the public market. Fink said risk will be measured by the liquidity of these blended portfolios. The firm's $3.2 billion acquisition of data giant Preqin will help bring these more complex strategies to a broader audience. The acquisition is set to close at the end of the year. "It's going to happen with the expansion of data and analytics," Fink said. The firm's focus may be shifting because there aren't many more levers to pull for increased growth in its iShares franchise, which crossed $1 trillion in total assets last quarter. The firm's leaders said the fourth quarter is traditionally a strong one for this segment of their business, and the franchise has also seen serious inflows following political events and central bank decisions. Comparatively, retail allocation to the private markets is in the "low-single digits," according to Small, giving BlackRock another territory to expand into. "The opportunities ahead of us have never been better than they are now," Fink said. Private credit, for example, could pick up billions of dollars from the firm's insurance clients, which have $700 billion invested with BlackRock. "We've never shied away from taking big bets," Fink said, and private market strategies are the latest roll of the dice. Jump to

Title: Stock market today: US stocks edge up after wholesale inflation comes in cool

US stocks edged higher on Friday after Producer Price Index data for September came in lower than expected, signaling a continued cooling of wholesale inflation. The producer price index was flat month-over-month, below economist estimates of a 0.1% rise. Meanwhile, Core PPI rose 0.1% in September, compared to an expected rise of 0.2%. TradeStation strategist David Russell told Business Insider the data supports another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve. "CPI might have seemed hot, but PPI was not. Overall, these numbers are getting less impactful as inflation moderates. The Fed could still be on track for 25 basis points at the next two meetings. Yields have surged lately, but it's not clear they have much more reason for continued upside," Russell said. Investors are also digesting earnings results from JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock. All three stocks moved higher after the results, which beat analyst estimates on most fronts. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon praised his bank's performance in the earnings release, but warned that geopolitical conditions are "treacherous and getting worse." Apart from earnings results, retail sales data, set to be released on October 17, is the next big data release for investors to watch. Bank of America analysts expect September retail sales data to show a 0.8% surge, while consensus estimates expect just 0.2% growth.
