Pete Hegseth said Chinese control of ports lets Beijing conduct surveillance activities. By Taejun Kang for RFA 2025.04.09 TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China's control of Panama Canal ports is an unacceptable threat to U.S. security, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said during a visit to the central American nation, underlining U.S. efforts to bolster its influence in the Western hemisphere. The Panama Canal has become a focal point of geopolitical tension, as China's involvement in its ports raises U.S. concerns over control and influence in a key global trade route. U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly said that the United States is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations. Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new U.S.-funded dock at the Vasco NuÃ±ez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama's President JosÃ© RaÃºl Mulino, Hegseth said the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal's operations. "To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defence and security cooperation than we have in decades," he said. China-based companies, Hegseth said, continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area. "That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable." In response to Hegseth's remarks, the Chinese embassy in Panama slammed the U.S. government in a statement on X. It said the U.S. has used "blackmail" to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a "sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn't have the right to interfere in." "The US has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the 'theoretical Chinese threat' in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United States' own geopolitical interests," the embassy said. There have been growing calls in Washington for action to loosen Beijing's influence stemming from Chinese and Hong Kong companies' control over ports in Panama and elsewhere in the Western hemisphere. China and the U.S. are also waging a tit-for-tat trade battle, which threatens to stunt the global economy. The U.S. now imposes a 104% tariff on Chinese imports after a series of tariff hikes this year. On Feb. 3, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio threatened the Panamanian leader with potential American retaliation if his country didn't immediately reduce Chinese influence over the canal. The Panamanian government said that it was auditing the lease held by the Hong Kong consortium, which operates ports at both ends of the canal, and late on Monday concluded that there were irregularities. The Hong Kong consortium, however, had already announced that CK Hutchison Holdings would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. âCK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, has operated the Balboa and CristÃ³bal ports at the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the Panama Canal through its subsidiary, Panama Ports Company, since the late 1990s. In March 2025, CK Hutchison agreed to sell a 90% stake in Panama Ports Company to a consortium led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc., as part of a US$22.8 billion deal that includes control over 43 ports in 23 countries. At that time, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee said concerns about the deal "deserve serious attention," possibly hinting at some form of legal action. "We oppose the abusive use of coercion or bullying tactics in international, economic and trade relations," Lee told journalists in Hong Kong. The Chinese territory would handle any commercial transaction "according to the law," he said. "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government urges foreign governments to provide a fair and just environment for enterprises, including enterprises from Hong Kong," Lee said.

Title: Hegseth Says China Threatens the Panama Canal, Drawing Fiery Response From Beijing

AP AP PANAMA CITY — U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday the Panama Canal faces ongoing threats from China but that together the United States and Panama will keep it secure. Hegseth’s remarks triggered a fiery response from the Chinese government, which said: “Who represents the real threat to the Canal? People will make their own judgement.” Speaking at a ribbon cutting for a new U.S.-financed dock at the Vasco Nuñez de Balboa Naval Base after a meeting with Panama President José Raúl Mulino, Hegseth said the U.S. will not allow China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation. Advertisement Advertisement “To this end, the United States and Panama have done more in recent weeks to strengthen our defense and security cooperation than we have in decades,” he said. Hegseth alluded to ports at either end of the canal that are controlled by a Hong Kong consortium, which is in the process of selling its controlling stake to another consortium including BlackRock Inc. “China-based companies continue to control critical infrastructure in the canal area,” Hegseth said. “That gives China the potential to conduct surveillance activities across Panama. This makes Panama and the United States less secure, less prosperous and less sovereign. And as President Donald Trump has pointed out, that situation is not acceptable.” Hegseth met with Mulino for two hours Tuesday morning before heading to the naval base that previously had been the U.S. Rodman Naval Station. On the way, Hegseth posted a photo on X of the two men laughing and said it was an honor speaking with Mulino. “You and your country’s hard work is making a difference. Increased security cooperation will make both our nations safer, stronger and more prosperous,” he wrote. Late Tuesday, Mulino and Hegseth released a joint statement. A vaguely worded portion of the statement suggested the two had discussed the tolls the United States pays for its ships crossing the canal. It said that within the canal’s framework, “the Republic of Panama and the United States of America will work, as established, on a mechanism to compensate for the payment of tolls and charges.” Panama’s Foreign Relations Ministry did not immediately answer a request for clarification. But the Spanish and English versions had at least one significant discrepancy. The Spanish version included that “Secretary Hegseth recognized the leadership and inalienable sovereignty of Panama over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas.” That sentence appeared nowhere in the English version. The visit comes amid tensions over Trump’s repeated assertions that the U.S. is being overcharged to use the Panama Canal and that China has influence over its operations—allegations that Panama has denied. Shortly after the meeting, the Chinese Embassy in Panama slammed the American government in a statement on X, saying the U.S. has used “blackmail” to further its own interests and that who Panama carries out business with is a “sovereign decision of Panama ... and something the U.S. doesn’t have the right to interfere in.” “The U.S. has carried out a sensationalistic campaign about the ‘theoretical Chinese threat’ in an attempt to sabotage Chinese-Panamanian cooperation, which is all just rooted in the United State’s own geopolitical interests,” the embassy wrote. After Hegseth and Mulino spoke by phone in February, the U.S. State Department said that an agreement had been reached to not charge U.S. warships to pass through the canal. Mulino publicly denied there was any such deal. Trump has gone so far as to suggest the U.S. never should have turned the canal over to Panama and that maybe that it should take the canal back. The China concern was provoked by the Hong Kong consortium holding a 25-year lease on ports at either end of the canal. The Panamanian government announced that lease was being audited and late Monday concluded that there were irregularities. The Hong Kong consortium, however, has already announced that CK Hutchison would be selling its controlling stake in the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control once the sale is complete. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Mulino during a visit in February that Trump believes China’s presence in the canal area may violate a treaty that led the U.S. to turn the waterway over to Panama in 1999. That treaty calls for the permanent neutrality of the American-built canal. Mulino has denied that China has any influence in the operations of the canal. In February, he expressed frustration at the persistence of the narrative. “We aren’t going to speak about what is not reality, but rather those issues that interest both countries,” he said. The U.S. built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. “I want to be very clear, China did not build this canal,” Hegseth said Tuesday. “China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations through the deterrent power of the strongest, most effective and most lethal fighting force in the world.” © 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

Title: How the US-China tussle over the Panama Canal is impacting ordinary citizens

East Asia United States President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for America to “reclaim” the Panama Canal from what he termed “China control”. Panamanian Moises Castillo (L) in Beijing, and Chinese national Zhou Mei in her office in Panama overlooking the Pacific Ocean. This audio is generated by an AI tool. BEIJING: Shipping business owner Zhou Mei’s videos on Chinese social media application WeChat have been getting more attention lately. The 49-year-old Chinese national regularly posts snippets of her work and family life in Panama, including views from her office of ships waiting to pass through the Panama Canal. In recent weeks, the vital waterway – through which 5 per cent of all global shipping passes – has made headlines and, in turn, drawn viewers to Zhou. Shortly before United States President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, he announced his intention to “take back” the Panama Canal from what he termed “China control”. Since then, he has ramped up calls for the US to “reclaim” it. During a visit to Panama on Tuesday (Apr 8), US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that America will not allow China and other nations to "threaten the canal's operation or integrity". Amid this ongoing tussle between Beijing and Washington over the strategic trade route, Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing became the latest to be caught in the middle. Li’s logistics conglomerate CK Hutchison said last month that it planned to sell dozens of its ports, including two located at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by American investment firm BlackRock. The deal – worth more than US$19 billion in cash – triggered an angry reaction from Beijing, which claimed the company “betrayed” China. All this has put the tiny country of Panama with a population of 4.5 million people on the map. The fight over the strategic trade route has not just impacted big businesses – it has also affected those like Zhou, as well as young Panamanians studying in China. Married to a Panamanian, Zhou told CNA that she expanded her shipping business in Shanghai to the Latin American nation in 2004. This was way before Chinese presence at the Panama Canal surged and before Panama switched diplomatic ties from Taiwan to Beijing in 2017. Zhou said Trump gave Panama “free advertisement all over the world”. “For China, we have so many shipping companies that have a lot of business dealings with Panama. Your logistics, your shipping service and your fleets have to go through the Panama Canal - the channel to Latin America,” she noted. Her online videos have also been her way of staying in touch with loved ones, especially when she was unable to return to China for four years during the COVID-19 pandemic. “I really want to use this (social media) channel, not only to let my family but also to let my many shipping customers know about Panama, including many of my good friends,” she added. “They don't know about Panama's tourism resources, so for me, it is a very good opportunity.” On the other hand, Panamanian undergraduate Moises Castillo has not found a reason to celebrate his country’s newfound fame. The 23-year-old, who is in his second year of university in Beijing, is among many young Panamanians granted a Chinese government scholarship to study in China. While he had offers from schools in other countries, including the US, he said he chose to study civil engineering in China due to its affordability and potential opportunities. Job offers have already landed at his doorstep from Chinese companies operating in Panama. “Panama is a developing country, so we need a lot of infrastructure like bridges (and) railways. I was thinking it’s a good opportunity and at that time, China was also investing a lot in Latin America with infrastructure projects, so I was thinking I could work in some of these in the future,” he added. But Castillo said he grew concerned when he first heard the news that Panama was pulling out of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). The trillion-dollar infrastructure programme operates in more than 100 countries. "I was kind of sad, frustrated and a little bit worried,” he added. “If the relationship between China and Panama is difficult, how is that going to affect my future? … How is that going to affect me having a scholarship here?” It was against this backdrop that China reacted strongly to Hong-Kong listed CK Hutchison's sale of its Panama port operations to BlackRock. Panama lies more than 14,000km away from Beijing, across the Pacific Ocean, and has been called the gateway to South America for its key geographic role in terms of connectivity and trade. China is Panama’s largest trading partner and is keen to deepen connections there, in its bid for resources like lithium and other agricultural products like soybean and corn. Beijing is also the second-biggest customer of the Panama Canal after Washington, with about a fifth of the cargo that passes through the waterway belonging to China. CK Hutchinson’s deal with BlackRock was ultimately not signed last week as planned, after China announced an antitrust review of the agreement. Analysts said Beijing’s diplomatic victory over the Panama Canal will likely motivate the Trump administration to repeat the stunt. Meanwhile, one expert predicted that 20 to 30 countries could follow Panama in dropping out of the Belt and Road Initiative within the next year. "What's important are the politics and the optics,” said Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project. “One cannot overstate how important this is - that forcing a country to withdraw from BRI, and seeing the reaction that Trump and (US Secretary of State) Marco Rubio got in the United States among their base, is going to motivate them to (force) dozens of other countries (to also withdraw from BRI).” Olander added that “vulnerable countries” will have to decide whether to be in China’s or America’s “sphere of influence”. Still, he said this would not detract from the BRI’s longer-term strategy. “It just means they have to recalibrate in a much more contentious environment. The first and foremost priority for (Chinese President) Xi Jinping today is protecting the domestic economy,” he noted. “He’s got to keep that domestic economy moving forward, and so I think the US-China relationship is more important than the China-Panama relationship. So, they're kind of going to let Panama go.” Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

Title: Levi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass says any price hikes related to tariffs will be ‘surgical’

Levi Strauss & Co. CEO Michelle Gass said that any price hikes the company makes due to President Donald Trump’s tariffs would be “surgical.” Gass, on an earnings call Monday, told analysts that the situation around tariffs is “very new” and “fluid” and that the company is just “getting our arms around it.” She stopped short of specifying what those price increases would look like, saying “as we look at pricing, we do believe that the brand, especially given the health of the brand, that there is pricing power there. But if we do anything, it will be very surgical,” Gass said during the call. Gass took over the helm in 2024 as the struggling retailer announced a multiyear global productivity initiative to turn around the business and boost profitability. Under the initiative, called Project Fuel, the retailer plans to optimize its operating model and structure, redesign business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs while simplifying processes across the organization. It has since laid off dozens of workers out of its California office, and warned that more could come. With tariffs adding to its woes, Gass told analysts Monday that the company has assembled a task force to assess “the various scenarios and identifying what levers we have to mitigate,” which could include “structural changes.” The company sources from 28 countries, 20 of which are imported into the U.S. However, Gass said the company’s supply chain “is more agile today than it ever has been” and that it “pivots” all the time. “We will continue to do so as we look to address the issues both in the short, medium and long-term,” Gass said. Business executives have warned of the potential impact tariffs could have on the U.S. economy. These high-waisted jeans will take you from day to night all spring and summer long. Dark wash, quality denim for less than $150? We’re in! Stock up on an elite pair of denim shorts before the weather gets warm. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Monday that the stock market could see declines deepen due to uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs and that CEOs are telling him they think the U.S. economy is likely already in a recession. Also on Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders that the levies are likely to “increase inflation” on both foreign and domestic goods, and raised concerns over what their impact will be on America’s economic alliances.

Gomez made the announcement after Panama's comptroller general criticized the contract, renewed in 2021, earlier this week. Comptroller Anel Flores said Panama "left $1.3 billion on the table," referring to tax incentives and benefits granted by the government to CK Hutchison. Trump says US will take back Panama Canal "This prosecutor's office is conducting an investigation initiated 'ex officio' for the alleged commission of a crime against public administration and other crimes against the State," Gomez said in a letter sent to Flores on Tuesday. The 25-year contract awarded to Panama Ports Company, in which CK Hutchison has a 90% stake, for the concession of the Balboa and Cristobal ports has been under audit since January. The audit is nearing completion, Flores said on Monday, adding that a lawsuit would be filed against government officials who authorized the contract. Since February, Panama's Supreme Court has also discussed the concession. BlackRock’s $23-billion deal to strengthen US control over Panama Canal Ports, global trade sees rising American presence in other strategic assets The contract reviews are seen as possible roadblocks in a key $22.8 billion deal announced in March by a group led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock to get access to CK Hutchison's port business in 23 countries, including the two ports in Panama. CK Hutchison and BlackRock did not immediately reply to requests for comment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, speaking earlier this week at a conference in New York, said the deal was not made for geopolitical reasons, but the company was aware that China would review it as much as other jurisdictions. Regulatory review of the deal could take nine more months, Fink said, adding he was optimistic it would be approved. China's embassy in Panama said on Tuesday in a social media post that it has and will continue respecting Panama's sovereignty, and added that the relationship between the U.S. and Panama should not be "excluding." If irregularities in the concession renewal are confirmed by Panama's government or the Supreme Court declares the contract to be unconstitutional, the concession could be revoked, lawyers and experts have said.

New Delhi: India is mapping a course to become a shipbuilding powerhouse, forging strategic joint ventures between its state-owned enterprises and maritime giants from South Korea and Japan. State-run enterprises are engaging companies including Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hanwha of South Korea and Mitsui of Japan, two people aware of the plans said, in an ambitious bid to secure a larger share of the global demand and reduce India's reliance on overstretched Asian shipyards. State-owned Cochin Shipyard Ltd (CSL) may join hands with Hyundai Heavy Industries for a new facility in Kochi, the people said on the condition of anonymity. Cochin Shipyard confirmed the talks, but did not identify the future partner. A Hyundai team had visited India early this year for a preliminary survey for investing in Indian shipbuilding. “We are close to signing a deal with an overseas shipbuilder from Korea or Japan that would be making hulls for large ships," said Madhu S. Nair, chairman and managing director, Cochin Shipyard. "We already have a large 310 m dry dock that can also be used by the new joint venture for making ships of different sizes up to 300 m in length. A foreign partnership will help in bringing technology and scale required for making large ship hulls using tonnes of steel. The new facility should roll out ships in double-digits to meet both domestic and overseas demand," Nair added. New facilityLand for the new facility will be provided by the government-owned Cochin Port Trust, close to Cochin Shipyard's existing facility in Kochi, one of the two people said. The new facility will build cargo ships, container vessels, tankers, dry bulk cargo ships and multi-purpose vessels. It would, however, not make very large crude carriers (VLCCs) due to infrastructural shortcomings, but may consider it later depending on market conditions.

The company may consider a shipbuilding facility planned near Gujarat's Kandla Port, a Union government-owned port with ample land and basic infrastructure for shipbuilding and repairs. Also, a team from Japanese ship maker Mitsui OSK Shipping is expected in India around June, the people said. Among the main tasks for the group would be to seek local partnerships. “The first deal for a large shipbuilding facility may be reached in the next couple of months, with a few other deals expected before the end of the current year. Ship manufacturing in India will help the country become a major hub for ships after Korea, Japan and China," said the second person.

Mint had reported in September that India is looking for investments from Korea and Japan for its shipbuilding ambitions. Shipping boostIndia is not alone in trying to breathe life into its shipbuilding industry. In February, US President Donald Trump slapped fees of up to $1.5 million on Chinese-built ships entering the US, with charges of up to $1 million on both fleets that have ordered new Chinese ships and non-Chinese vessels in fleets with Chinese ships. The move aims to rebuild American shipyards. The global shipbuilding industry is currently dominated by massive shipyards in China, South Korea and Japan; however, these facilities are overbooked, with waiting periods running from three to five years. “Investments and technology transfers from countries like South Korea and Japan are being sought by the Indian government," said Pushpank Kaushik, CEO of Jassper Shipping, a Hyderabad-based shipping and logistics company. "Support has been expressed by states like Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Odisha for setting up maritime clusters. A detailed briefing on advanced and eco-friendly shipbuilding was also received from South Korea. Large commercial shipbuilding in India remains limited, even though 28 shipyards exist. Most ship repairs are handled overseas. However, with foreign support and partnerships, domestic capabilities are expected to improve, and larger ships may be constructed," Kaushik added. Global hubIndia is trying to become a global hub for ships, and push up local ship ownership by scaling Indian-built and Indian-owned and flagged cargo ships. The country’s share in global shipbuilding remains below 1%. The government’s projection is raise the share of Indian built ships in India’s fleet from 5% at present to 7% by 2030 and 69% by 2047 under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative. The plan is to set four mega shipbuilding parks, two each on the east and west coasts. Shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal has said that two shipbuilding parks would be made operational by 2030, eyeing a share of the $100 billion global shipbuilding market. Also read | How charging Chinese ships could ripple through the economy Cochin Shipyard's Nair said that while the investment details and the nature of equity partnership of its new venture are being worked out, such a facility would require investments in thousands of crores of rupees and create employment for over 2,000 people. A modern shipbuilding facility typically costs $5-6 billion for construction, port infrastructure and ancillary services. Since a dry dock facility is already available in Kochi, the new facility may require less. In July last year, Mint reported that to create a market for domestic shipbuilding, the shipping ministry has proposed a joint venture of the state-run Shipping Corp. of India (SCI) with public sector oil marketing companies to build VLCCs. This venture may also rope in a foreign technology partner. Shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal told Mint in September that the government has launched a mega ship-building mission to develop mega shipbuilding parks along both coasts, and ministerial teams had visited South Korea and Japan to seek their investment in parks, and at least three state governments have agreed to provide land. Maritime fundEarlier this year, the FY26 budget proposed a ₹25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund, a government-industry partnership to help develop manufacturing clusters with a focus on shipbuilding and breaking. The budget also proposed revamping the existing Shipbuilding Financial Assistance (SBF) policy to address cost disadvantages, while also providing credit notes for shipbreaking to help purchase indigenously-built ships. The budget also included large ships in the infrastructure harmonized master list (HML) allowing purchase of ships on easier terms while providing basic customs duty exemption on raw materials, components, consumables or parts for the manufacture of ships extended for another 10 years. Also read | For Cochin Shipyard, new capacity commissioning, orders to ensure smooth sailing Under the Maritime Vision 2030 and Vision 2047 plan, the government is targeting to make India one of the top 10 and among top five shipbuilding and shipowning country’s worldwide respectively. The shipbuilding initiative would also address a concern of the trade about the uncertainty and variability (escalation) of shipping cost impacting their market competitiveness. With better availability of domestic shipping lines at affordable prices, the freight rate volatility due to Black Swan events like the covid pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Red Sea crisis could also be checked.

Skip to comments. Posted on 04/08/2025 4:22:03 PM PDT by george76 Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock Inc., warned policymakers in New York City on Monday that crime, cleanliness and a shortage of quality schools have significantly undermined the city’s attractiveness to businesses. “The city is on the verge of losing a lot of companies,” the 72-year-old Fink said during a candid conversation hosted by the Economic Club of New York on Monday. “I don’t believe the city has the vitality that it did before.” ... Fink, who first arrived in New York during the rough-and-tumble 1970s when it was plagued by an economic crisis and widespread urban decay, expressed deep frustration, saying: “I believed that my taxes were used to help build out the city. I don’t feel that way anymore.” His investment firm, BlackRock, oversees assets totaling approximately $11.6 trillion and is headquartered in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards .... Since late 2019, approximately 160 Wall Street firms, collectively managing nearly $1 trillion in assets, have moved their headquarters out of New York. ... The city has seen a significant reduction in drugstores, losing nearly 40% over the past decade, with 10% of closures occurring in 2024 alone. Major chains like Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid have reduced their presence, citing factors such as rampant shoplifting and other crimes. ... Major felony crimes have increased by 32.0%, including serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, and auto theft. Petty thefts at drugstores have increased by 37.4%, while quality-of-life offenses resulting in summonses, including public drinking and urination, have jumped by 37.7% (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

Join the leading maritime news network FILE PHOTO: A ship sails near the Balboa Port after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd 0001.HK agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo By Michael McDonald (Bloomberg) — Panama’s top auditor accused port operator CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. of wrongdoing, providing a potential pathway for the Central American country to wrest control of canal facilities caught up in a diplomatic tug-of-war between the US and China. Panama Ports Co., part of Hong Kong-based Hutchison’s far-flung operations, failed to obtain required approvals for a contract extension in 2021, and owed millions in dues, Comptroller General Anel Flores told reporters Monday following an audit. Flores plans to file a criminal complaint with Panama’s attorney general’s office on Tuesday against the maritime authorities who granted the 2021 contract renewal and against executives of Panama Ports, he said. Ultimately, Panama’s Maritime Authority will need to decide whether to rescind the contract, he said. CK Hutchison didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The move ratchets up pressure on CK Hutchison, founded by Li Ka-Shing, to give up control of two Panama Canal ports, after US President Donald Trump began pushing to rid the canal of Chinese influence. The audit was launched shortly after Trump returned to office in January; Hutchison then agreed to sell operations including the two facilities to a BlackRock Inc.-led consortium. But Chinese authorities have put pressure on the conglomerate to scuttle the BlackRock deal, which would net Hutchison more than $19 billion in cash should the transaction go through. Before the audit results were announced, BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he anticipates nine months of regulatory review, including from China, before a final decision is made on the deal. “I’m actually pretty optimistic that we will find a solution because, if you look at it, everything was done in the right order,” Fink said in an interview Monday at the Economic Club of New York. “I think it’s going to be a very interesting thing to watch for geopolitical purposes.” The audit’s outcome makes it clear that Panama’s government, which has close ties to the US, can attempt to remove Hutchison even if the BlackRock deal doesn’t go through. Flores said that in addition to the lapses in required approvals, his audit found that Panama Ports used a series of tax-exempt subcontractors to lower the amount it pays to the government. The company used tax breaks to save $850 million of at least $1.3 billion it owed in payments to the republic in the first 25 years of the contract period, Flores said, adding that it currently owes $300 million. The company also breached its agreement to share 10% of net income with Panama’s government, Flores said. “There are two people in a transaction, but they need to know what they are selling and that what they are buying might not be what they were told,” Flores said, referring to the BlackRock deal. “There are breaches, nonpayments and countless things that were wrongly calculated.” The Balboa and Cristobal ports on either side of the 51-mile (82-kilometer) Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, form a key part of the deal involving a total of 43 CK Hutchison facilities. While CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory with its own borders, currency and legal system, Beijing has tightened its grip on the former British colony since 2020 when it imposed a broad national security law that’s paved the way for a crackdown on dissent. A consortium backed by BlackRock agreed last month to buy a majority of Panama Ports and other Hutchison assets. But the parties are yet to sign the deal while it’s being scrutinized by Chinese authorities. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: U.S. to take back Panama Canal from Chinese influence, visiting Pentagon chief says

JapanToday Sotokanda S Bldg. 4F 5-2-1 Sotokanda Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 101-0021 Japan Tel: +81 3 5829 5900 Fax: +81 3 5829 5919 Email: editor@japantoday.com ©2025 GPlusMedia Inc. The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation. Hegseth, following talks with Panama's government, vowed to deepen security cooperation with Panama's forces and said China would not be allowed to "weaponize" the canal by using Chinese firms' commercial relationships for espionage. "Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence," Hegseth said, speaking at a pier renovated with U.S. assistance in Panama City. "China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations." More than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion a year, goes through the Panama Canal, accounting for more than two-thirds of vessels passing each day through the world's second-busiest interoceanic waterway. Hegseth got a close-up look at the Panama Canal on Tuesday, the first full day of a rare visit to a nation still unsettled by Trump's threats to take back the canal. While Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence, Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Hegseth is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit in decades, and his trip follows reports that the Trump administration has requested options from the U.S. military to ensure access to the canal, which the United States built more than a century ago and handed over to Panama in 1999. Trump has complained that was a bad deal for the United States. Hegseth was greeted by Panama Public Security Minister Frank Abrego and held closed-door meetings with President Jose Raul Mulino and other officials. Given Trump's tough rhetoric, the stakes are high for Hegseth's visit. "On the whole, this hasn't been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama," said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, current and former U.S. officials and experts say the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Mulino. In February, Mulino announced Panama's formal move to exit China's Belt and Road Initiative and he has aided Trump's crackdown on migrants. He has accepted deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to stem migration from South America by those crossing through his country's dangerous Darien jungle. Hegseth praised Mulino, saying his government understood the threat from China, and his remarks about Panama being in the lead on addressing the canal's security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. Hegseth, a U.S. military veteran and former Fox News host, has enthusiastically backed Trump's southern-focused security agenda, by means such as dispatching U.S. troops to the U.S. border with Mexico and offering military aircraft for deportation flights. U.S. SECURITY CONCERNS Trump has falsely claimed that China is operating the canal, something even Hegseth said was not true on Tuesday, and that Chinese soldiers are present. But experts acknowledge U.S. security concerns, particularly regarding espionage, with an expansive Chinese commercial presence in Panama that also includes plans by Chinese firms to build a bridge over the canal. Last month, Trump celebrated a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. Trump said the purchase was an example of how the United States was "reclaiming" the canal. But China has criticized it, with the market regulator saying it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Current and former U.S. officials say the Panama Canal would be critical for the passage of U.S. warships during any future conflict in Asia, since Navy vessels would transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support the war effort. Even without blocking the canal, China could have an enormous advantage by being able to surveil vessels passing through it. Still, John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 to 2018, disputed the Trump administration's assertion that China's presence in Panama was a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty. "What's not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he's used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn't been," Feeley said. Mulino has defended Panama's administration of the canal, saying it has been handled responsibly for world trade, including that of the United States, and that it "is, and will continue to be, Panamanian."

The last thing the US needs is rapist liar threatening somebody with empty threat Doesn't matter, the Panama Canal is vital to US National Security interests and should have never been in the hands of the Chinese, now reverse it, you think on your life the Chinese would ALLOW the US to hold it if it were the gateway into their country or violating their territorial sovereignty? They won't even allow you to open up businesses and invest in property or land in their country, but we have to? Not your country, not your canal.. Get your dirty hands off Panama !!. Doesn't matter, the Panama Canal is vital to US National Security interests and should have never been in the hands of the Chinese, now reverse it, you think on your life the Chinese would ALLOW the US to hold it if it were the gateway into their country or violating their territorial sovereignty? They won't even allow you to open up businesses and invest in property or land in their country, but we have to? It is not US territory. The US has no legitimate claim to that canal any more. Period. Full stop. It is the territory of a sovereign nation. What you and many like you can't seem to get through your testadura is that Panama owns the canal. Panama, not China. A Chinese company operates two container ports on either end of the canal. That company gained those leases in 1997 when the canal was still operated by the US. The US granted Hutchison the long term leases on those two container ports, not Panama. Even still, they are leases for container ports. They are separate from the canal. The right is telling lie after lie on this matter trying to drum up a reason to go to war over the canal. And people like you who claim to be ardent to end wars and stop the fighting in Ukraine flip and cheer lead the US to seize the Panama Canal. Max hypocrisy. It is not US territory. The US has no legitimate claim to that canal any more. Period. Full stop. It is the territory of a sovereign nation. We do have a claim Treaty with Panama (1903 – Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty) After helping Panama gain independence from Colombia in 1903, the U.S. signed a treaty with the newly formed Panamanian government. The treaty gave the U.S.: *Control of the Panama Canal Zone** (a 10-mile-wide strip of land)* The right to build, operate, and protect the canal “in perpetuity” In exchange, Panama got a payment and an annual lease fee *This treaty is what gave the U.S. a legal claim to build and run the canal.* I think the lawyers and constitutionalists know more than you, I'll give them the props for pushing this legally. Treaty with Panama (1903 – Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty) ROFL Trump is not interested in international treaties that the US is signature to so why this one? It is dead in the water. "The Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which granted the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone, no longer applies as it was superseded by the Torrijos–Carter Treaties in 1977, which led to the full transfer of control of the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999. " Fixed for you. I blame the lower education standard of summer schools. Like the Trump University ask for your money back. Trump is not interested in international treaties that the US is signature to so why this one? It is dead in the water. Yeah, he won't win the Presidency, he won't get the Senate, he will lose the House and he won't get to send illegals back. DOGE won't be able to continue and get access to sensitive info. you guys need to stop saying things you guys fully no well will not come through for you, This is another one, not even remotely close to being dead in the water, it's just getting started. "The Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty of 1903, which granted the United States control of the Panama Canal Zone, no longer applies as it was superseded by the Torrijos–Carter Treaties in 1977, which led to the full transfer of control of the canal to Panama on December 31, 1999. " Fixed for you. Really? The U.S. had a legal right to build and operate the Panama Canal based on a 1903 treaty, but that claim became controversial due to how the treaty was made, even though it was returned to Panama, so again LEGAL RIGHT, makes all the difference in the world I blame the lower education standard of summer schools.

search 6,500 sf house has 100 ft of waterfront, hit market for $17M in July SHARE THIS ARTICLE FONT SIZE Kenneth Grunley, CEO of Grunley Construction, bought a waterfront home in Jupiter’s gated Admirals Cove community for $15.3 million. Records show Grunley bought the house at 112 Quayside Drive from Russell and Patricia Stern. Michele and Fredrick Locke with Fine Living Realty of the Palm Beaches had the listing, and Janis Lax with Waterfront Properties & Club Communities brought the buyer. Grunley heads his namesake Rockville, Maryland-based construction firm. It is one of the largest general contractors in the Washington, D.C. area, and specializes in government, commercial and institutional buildings. Grunley has performed renovation and modernization work on some of D.C.’s most iconic structures: the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the Washington Monument, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial, the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the Watergate Hotel, to name a few. Russell Stern heads The Alternative Board (TAB) Jupiter, a business coaching firm. He was previously CEO of Solarflare Communications, a semiconductor developer that Santa Clara-based AMD (formerly Xilinx) bought for $400 million in 2019, according to published reports. The Sterns bought the 0.4-acre waterfront Admirals Cove property for $2.2 million in 2019, according to property records. The home was built in 2021, and spans 6,500 square feet with five bedrooms, five bathrooms, two half-bathrooms, a pool and 100 feet of waterfront with a dock, records and the listing show. It hit the market in July for $17 million, according to Zillow. Admirals Cove is a gated luxury community that has attracted high-profile buyers over the years. Donald Trump Jr. and his now ex-fiancée Kimberly Guilfoyle bought a $9.7 million mansion in 2021. Blue Jays pitcher Max Scherzer owns two homes in the community; he spent a combined $24.7 million acquiring them. Last year, BlackRock executive Rick Rieder sold his Admirals Cove mansion for $14 million. In November, seed magnate Ronald Holden sold his 1.1-acre estate for $34 million, then a record price for Jupiter. Edward Brown, retired CEO of Patrón Spirits, sold his Bears Club mansion for $48 million in February, making it the most expensive home ever sold in Jupiter and inland Palm Beach County.

Title: "We Will Take Back Panama Canal...": Pentagon Chief Meets Panama President
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/we-will-take-back-panama-canal-pentagon-chief-pete-hegseth-meets-panama-president-jose-raul-mulino-8120006
Time Published: 2025-04-08T20:29:36Z
Full Content:
The US will take back the Panama Canal, ending China's influence in one of the world's most important waterways, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said today after a rare visit to the Central American nation. Marking the first visit by a US defence secretary to Panama in decades, Mr Hegseth held a closed-door meeting with Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. He also got a close-up look of the canal as Washington reiterated its deep concern over China's investments and involvement in and around the crucial waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Following talks with Panama's government, the Pentagon chief vowed to deepen the US military's security cooperation with Panamanian forces. China, he said, would "not be allowed to weaponize" the canal by using Chinese firms' commercial relationships as a guise for espionage. "Together, we (Panama and the US) will take back the Panama Canal from China's influence," Secretary Hegseth said in Panama City. Given Donald Trump's tough rhetoric, the stakes were high for Secretary Hegseth's visit. The new arrangement with Panama, a first since 1999, will effectively end China's influence in the Panama Canal, he suggested. "China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations," he said. The Pentagon chief also praised President Mulino, saying his government understood "the threat from China". His remarks about Panama being in the "lead" on addressing the canal's security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. While Secretary Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence from Panama, President Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Even before Mr Hegseth reached Panama, the Trump Administration had reportedly requested options from the US military to ensure access to the Panama Canal. The United States had built the Panama Canal more than a century ago and handed its complete operations over to Panama in 1999. Today's development changes that dynamic with the US military likely to start patrolling and accessing the canal frequently, and in coordination with Panama's security agencies. According to news agency Reuters, several current and former US officials and strategic experts say that the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. In February, President Mulino had announced Panama's formal move to exit China's Belt and Road Initiative. He has also aided Donald Trump's crackdown on migrants in the United States. He did so by accepting US' deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to curb migration from South America by those crossing illegally through his country's dangerous Darien jungle. In a significant move last month, US firm BlackRock led a deal to buy out most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. At the time President Trump celebrated the deal, saying that the purchase was an example of how the United States was "reclaiming the Panama Canal". China however, had slammed the deal. The markets regulator has said that it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Military experts have pointed out that in the event of a war in Asia, the Panama Canal plays a critical role as US naval ships cross from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support war efforts. With China's vast presence in and around the canal, it could hinder the passage of ships, they said, adding that even if Beijing would not be able to stop American naval vessels in such a scenario, it would be in an advantageous position by being able to surveil vessels passing through it.

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Photo Caption: Delta is set to report first quarter earnings before market open on Wednesday. Vincenzo Pace Vincenzo Pace Airlines’ post-pandemic growth will be tested as tariffs, mass layoffs within the federal government, and weakened international demand continue to create economic uncertainty. Select a question above or ask something else The post-pandemic boom for the airline industry could come to an end as tariffs, a sinking stock market, and declining consumer confidence weaken travel demand. At the start of the year, analysts expected strong results — premium and international travel would continue to be healthy, corporate travel was slowly bouncing back, and even domestic travel was starting to make a comeback. But now, the latest round of sweeping tariffs from the Trump administration has sparked fears of a potential recession. Some Wall Street leaders have already declared the U.S. is in a recession. “One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine — canary in the coal mine — and I was told that the canary is sick already,” said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the Economic Club of New York on Tuesday, according to CNBC. Government travel has declined significantly following mass layoffs. And international demand from Canada, Mexico, and Europe is starting to weaken. Data compiled from Cirium found that advance bookings between the U.S. and Europe were down 12.6% compared to last year, but it cautioned that its data was primarily from online travel agencies. An open question is whether a falling stock prices will lead to lower spending by high-income flyers. Airlines have invested heavily in premium offerings as they’ve become a major profitability driver. “There’s never been a downturn where the industry has been less dependent on corporate demand, the category usually hit the hardest,” an investor note from JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker read. “On the other hand, there’s never been a downturn where the industry has been more dependent on the premium category, which has yet to be tested by a US recession.” Delta Air Lines is set to report its first-quarter earnings Wednesday morning, and analysts are expecting U.S. airlines to cut their outlooks for 2025. Delta already lowered its first quarter outlook, saying in a regulatory filing that it had seen softer demand for corporate and leisure travel. “We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist US to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines and ground the multiples back in the penalty box over the near-term,” wrote TD Cowen analyst Tom Fitzgerald in a note to investors on April 4. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also cut their first quarter outlooks, citing the current economic environment as a reason. Fitzgerald said in the note that he expected legacy carriers to fare better during an economic downturn compared to ultra-low-cost carriers. “While we do expect some consumers to trade down, we believe there is greater likelihood that consumers trade down within the same carrier's cabin (e.g., moving from Premium Economy to Standard Economy) than they pivot to a low-cost carrier,” he said in the note. Melius Research analyst Conor Cunningham said he expected airlines to make some capacity cuts. “2025 is clearly not the year airlines had hoped for with consumer and business confidence rattled by the Trump administration’s approach to policy in turn creating uncertainty,” the note read. Corporate demand, which was continuing to strengthen as companies changed their in-office policies, is also now in flux. Deutsche Bank noted it was seeing weaker demand for corporate transatlantic routes, most notably at London Heathrow, the largest corporate transatlantic market. However, an investor note from Raymond James noted that low fuel prices could offer airlines some reprieve. “While we expect the current policy rollercoaster ride to continue over the next year (a challenging scenario for corporate and consumer travel demand), we are modeling some improvement (albeit not full recovery) in 2H25,” the note read. What am I looking at? The performance of airline sector stocks within the ST200.

Title: Recession and Tariff Fears Could Overshadow Big Bank Earnings

This week, America’s biggest banks are set to report their quarterly earnings. But as Reuters reported Tuesday (April 8), investors are less likely to be focused on profits than on the banks’ view of the economy amid steep U.S. tariffs. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo said the biggest impact of the tariffs in the quarters to come “will be higher reserves for loan losses as the odds of recession rise.” As Reuters notes, banks are likely to reserve billions for potential loan defaults in the quarters ahead. Loan losses will probably increase this year due to newly revised accounting rules that require banks to account for losses over the full terms of the loans. “Banks are a reflection of the economy — if the economy worsens, their results will follow,” said Stephen Biggar, director of financial institutions at Argus Research. In addition to more reserves to cover losses on existing loans, Biggar expects banks to scale back lending as they see higher risks. The report argues that banks are likely to face questions during earnings calls about the market selloff that has erased trillions of dollars from global stock indexes. Bank stocks were some of the hardest hit, after surging earlier in the year on optimism about a jump in dealmaking. This week will see Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase report their earnings, all happening on Friday (April 11). JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that the tariffs could have lasting negative consequences, such as inflation and recession. “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,” Dimon wrote in his annual shareholder letter. “In the short run, I see this as one large additional straw on the camel’s back.” As PYMNTS noted in a report Tuesday on the impact of the tariffs on the FinTech sector, some observers have an even more pessimistic view. For example, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink notes that many U.S. business leaders believe the country is already in a recession. “Where do FinTechs fit in the larger picture? Analysts remain cautious about FinTech growth prospects, citing economic uncertainty and regulatory pressures,” PYMNTS wrote. “Despite this, there is optimism about the sector’s long-term potential, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence and blockchain, as well as a robust employment market and receding inflation. However, that outlook is clouded by the current economic turmoil.” Recession and Tariff Fears Could Overshadow Big Bank Earnings Report: Justice Department to End ‘Regulation by Prosecution’ of Crypto-Related Activities Best Buy Launches Creator Program With Influencer Storefronts i2c Teams With Access Finance to Expand Credit Card in US We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Wall Street titans had been oddly silent about Trump tariffs—until they became real. Amid market turmoil brought on by the President’s “Liberation Day” tariffs, a growing trickle of prominent bank CEOs and investors are raising the alarm on how these levies could cause irreparable harm to the global economy. Even established Trump supporters, such as Citadel CEO Ken Griffin and Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman, are vocalizing concerns about the potential fallout. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Here’s a look at what Wall Street’s most prominent leaders are saying: Ken Griffin, a major Republican donor, called Trump’s tariffs a “huge policy mistake” while speaking at the University of Miami event yesterday (April 7). Griffin estimated that it could take 20 years for the tariffs to actually bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. “It’s not 20 weeks. It’s not two years. It’s decades,” he stressed. But before then, the levies will raise the cost of groceries, appliances and vehicles for middle- and lower-class families. The speech mark a departure from Griffin’s previous comments on Trump’s tariff policy, which he claimed wasn’t a particularly important business issue. “I am really afraid of us abdicating our role of leadership for the free world,” said Griffin yesterday. “That’s the path we’re on.” Economic fragmentation caused by the tariffs could be “disastrous in the long run,” said JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon in his latest annual letter to shareholders. He warned that the levies will increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession, and he urged for negotiations to take place sooner rather than later. “America First is fine, as long as it doesn’t end up being America alone,” Dimon wrote. Dimon reportedly supported Kamala Harris during the 2024 Presidential election, the banking CEO has previously defended Trump’s tariff policy. In January, he called tariffs as an effective negotiation tactic and advised people to “get over it.” Bill Ackman, head of the hedge fund Pershing Square and one of Wall Street’s loudest supporters of Trump, has changed his tune. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” said Ackman in a series of X posts over the weekend. He described the levies as akin to “launching a global economic war against the whole world at once.” The hedge fund manager today (April 8) said that some of his comments on tariffs have been “misinterpreted” and noted that he still supports tariffs as a tool for negotiation. But he reiterated his call for a pause of up to 90 days before the tariffs come into effect to allow for negotiation. According to Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (BLK), an economic downturn in the U.S. is already taking place and will only continue to escalate. “The economy is weakening as we speak,” said Fink yesterday while speaking at the Economic Club of New York. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” he added. Fink alluded to America’s economic uncertainty in his annual shareholder letter last week. “I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader—nearly every person—I talk to: They’re more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory,” he wrote. Much of the economic benefits reaped over the past eight decades can be attributed to the growth of global trade, said Howard Marks during a Bloomberg TV interview on April 4. Now, the state of the world “is completely in flux,” he said. “We’ve gone from free trade and world trade and globalization to this system, which implies significant restrictions on trade in every direction and a step toward isolation for the United States,” he added. Last October, Daniel Loeb praised Trump’s economic policy and said his tariffs would have a positive impact on the market. He isn’t so sure now. On April 5, he reposted an article on X from the conservative think-tank American Enterprise Institute that criticizes the formula the administration used to calculate the tariffs. “Thoughtful piece on potential conceptual as well as practical errors that went into the announced tariff policy,” said Loeb of the report. “It will be a test of the administration’s judgement versus ideology how they resolve this over the weekend or coming days.” While hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio agrees that the U.S. has a problem to fix when it comes to domestic manufacturing, he doesn’t believe tariffs are the answer. “I agree with the problem. I am very concerned about the solution, the practicality of the solution,” he told CNBC in an interview published today. The levies will see company costs rise and their revenue plunge, said the Bridgewater Associates founder. “This is going to create great sand in the gears of production worldwide,” he added. Stanley Druckenmiller, a longtime Republican, is turning against the levies. “I do not support tariffs exceeding 10 percent,” said the billionaire investor in an X post on April 6. Druckenmiller has close ties to the Trump administration, having acted as the boss of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent when the two worked at George Soros’ hedge fund.

Title: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Predicts Mag 7 Corporate Treasuries Begin Rapid Accumulation of Bitcoin – Here’s Why

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan says that corporate buying of Bitcoin (BTC) is most likely about to explode. In a new interview with Kyle Chasse on his YouTube channel, Hougan notes that while holding BTC in corporate treasuries is still relatively unorthodox, the same could be said about Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in their early days. Hougan says he sees a theme developing in the adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset that parallels the embrace of BTC ETFs. “Let me make an analogy to the ETF space… If you look at institutional asset managers in the crypto space, in the early days, it was only crypto native people. It was Grayscale, it was Bitwise, and there were a few others. And then you had financial institutions run not as public companies but as family-run businesses. Fidelity is run by a family, one person can make a decision – ‘I’m going into Bitcoin’ – and they did. VanEck is run by Jan Van Eck. He loved Bitcoin and they went into the space. But fast forward to today and its BlackRock and it’s Invesco, and it’s the largest institutions in the world coming into the space. You’re seeing the same thing in companies. It was Michael Saylor alone. Then it’s Michael Saylor and Metaplanet and a few others.

Title: Panama Files Criminal Charges Against Chinese-Linked Canal Port Owner for Breach of Contract

Comptroller General of Panama Anel Flores on Monday announced that he would file a criminal complaint against Panama Ports Company (PPC), a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based Hutchison Port Holdings, on accusations of breach of contract over the two ports it manages at the Panama Canal. Flores, during a press conference, stated that an audit of PPC launched by his office this year found that the company, which operates two ports at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, found evidence of breaches of contract that amount to more than $300 million losses to the Panamanian state. Flores further accused Panama’s Maritime Authority (AMP) of “misrepresenting” financial figures and will therefore file criminal lawsuits against the company’s board and the authorities responsible for the 25-year renewal of PPC’s concession. “There are important findings that show amounts of more than 300 million dollars owed to us due to noncompliance with the contract. We see a renewal that also did not comply with all the procedures of law, nor does it have the endorsement of the Comptroller’s Office,” Flores said. “I want to announce that in the next few days we will go to the Public Prosecutor’s Office to file the corresponding complaints so that the directors who handled this renewal, the board of directors and the officers of Panama Ports, who will obviously have to explain to the Panamanian people before the Public Prosecutor’s Office why so much magnanimity, why so much benevolence in a contract that has been unfair,” he continued. Panama Ports Company signed a contract with Panama in 1997 that granted PPC a 25-year concession to develop and administer two ports at opposite ends of the Panama Canal located in the provinces of Balboa and Cristóbal. Local authorities renewed the contract for an additional 25-year period in 2021 as per the terms of the original 1997 deal, which reportedly contained automatic-renewal provisions so long as PPC complied with the agreed terms. In February, Panama’s Attorney General Luis Carlos Gómez requested that the nation’s Supreme Court rule to declare the 1997 concession contract “unconstitutional” because it allegedly violated 15 articles of the Panamanian constitution. Gómez presented the request a month after the Comptroller General’s office began an audit of PPC. In March, Comptroller General Flores stated that, despite the growth in container traffic in the country, the economic benefits for Panama resulting from the PPC lease deal have been “minimal” and described them as a “colonial enclave that perpetuates economic inequalities.” PCC’s two Panama ports have been at the center of a debate initiated by President Donald Trump in December after he called for the United States to regain control of the Panama Canal and denounced China’s alleged growing influence and control of the interoceanic trade route. The two ports are among the list of facilities included in a $22.8 billion deal between Hutchison Port Holdings, the Hong-Kong conglomerate that owns PPC, and asset manager BlackRock. The deal was blocked by the Chinese communist regime last week. Flores clarified at the start of his press conference that the PPC audit proceedings were signed off on January 15 but that the auditing staff physically began its labor on January 20 — the same day as the United States’ Inauguration day — stressing that the date “has nothing to do” with what international media “may possibly say” about the proceedings being a response to the U.S. statements and that the audit is an autonomous action of Panama and his office. Flores said the financial damages to the Panamanian state can be estimated from “different angles” and explained that under the original terms of the 1997 contract, Panama was receiving a percentage of the company’s profits that increased every year, reaching $27 million in 2002. In that same year, Flores further detailed, the administration of former Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso modified the contract so that Panama would receive ten percent of net profits instead of ten percent of gross profits — which made the Central American nation go from receiving $27 million in 2002 to only $1.3 million in 2003. “If we had complied with the first contract in full, Panama should have received $1.337 billion during the concession period. And we only received $483 million, with a loss to the Republic of Panama of $853 million in the same period,” Flores said. “Now, that is not the company’s fault. It is the fault of many people, bad Panamanians, I tell you, who delivered what they did not have to deliver, they negotiated very badly.” “If we add this to the economic damage caused by the fact that we gave them so many tax exemptions, they did not pay the rent, this results in another $350 million more,” he continued. “In other words, the real damage for the Republic is in the order of 1.2 billion dollars at a rate of 55 approximately per year that we as a country stopped receiving.” Flores also explained that PPC used “concessionaires” to perform container transportation services, and detailed that the Panamanian State does not receive a percentage of the profits of these companies. Additionally, the Comptroller pointed out that even though the volume of containers increased, the reported profit of the company, “at least on paper,” remains practically the same. “The company where Panama has a 10 percent stake, which is Panama Ports, earns less every day with more TEUs [Twenty-foot Equivalent Unit]. I can assume that this is happening there, and so can everyone who is watching me,” Flores said. The Comptroller, who described the contract as “leonine,” stressed that PPC received $3.78 billion between 1997 and 2003 but only paid a total of $236 million to the Panamanian state, and said, “In other words, they gave us a tip.” Christian K.

WoW Classic Version 1.15.7 Patch Notes April 8, 2025 New Quest Content in Eastern Plaguelands Players who have completed the Phase 7 Eastern Plaguelands quest “Scarlet Activities” may speak with Leonid Bartholomew the Revered at Light’s Hope Chapel to accept the quest “Unrest at Tyr’s Hand”. This quest splits off into a few different questlines related to Scarlet Enclave content. New Area - New Avalon Go behind enemy lines in disguise as you infiltrate the town of New Avalon within the Scarlet Enclave, prior to the events that transpire within the raid. This is a small crafting-focused town with access to a few common city services, such as a bank, a neutral auction house, and an alchemy lab. New Raid Dungeon – The Scarlet Enclave Starting at 1:00 p.m. PDT on Thursday, April 10, the Scarlet Enclave raid will be available for players to enter. New Legendary Weapon Questline Raid groups progressing through The Scarlet Enclave may encounter a “Ruined Lightforge Blade” legendary quest item as a drop from a certain boss encounter. This item is the quest starter for the legendary weapon questline. Changes Classes Going into Phase 8, we want to make some changes to damage numbers coming out of Naxxramas, refine and align the durability profile of tanks, and create more room for healers to coexist. You’ll notice a lot of changes are to previous tier’s set bonuses. We wouldn’t normally touch these bonuses, but with access to these via shoulder enchants, and some Tier 3 bonuses doing a lot of the heavy lifting for some classes inside of Naxxramas,we felt these were the correct adjustments to make to ensure that gear upgrades going forward remain meaningful. Druid Hunter Mage Paladin Priest Rogue Shaman Warlock Developers’ notes: In the opposite vein as Shaman Tanks, Warlock tanks have had too high avoidance, too low durability, and this was felt by most guilds who used a Warlock main tank for something like Maexxna during Naxxramas progression. We shifted Tank Rogues away from avoidance cap in exchange for allowing them to actually take hits, and for Warlocks we plan to do the same thing by increasing their health pool in Metamorphosis, which was starting to look like it wouldn’t be able to keep up with the health pools of other tanks. DPS Tier 3 4piece damage changed to 33% of the DoT’s damage (was 75%). Pets now benefit from your Spell Haste and convert it into both Spell and Melee Haste. New effect: Metamorphosis grants 15% increased health. Dance of the Wicked now converts 70% of your critical strike chance into Dodge (was 100%). Damage dealt reduction in Metamorphosis changed to 10% reduction (was 15%). Threat increase in Metamorphosis changed to 50% (was 77%). Shadow Cleave now grants 4 spell power per defense (up from 2). Chaos Bolt changed to deal Chaos damage, which is Fire, Frost, Arcane, Shadow, and Nature damage (was just Fire) . Demonic Pact now only counts half of the spell power from Defender’s Resolve (so it is unchanged and does not benefit from the above buff). Warrior Developers’ notes: Warriors have been relying on using the active on the Tempered Interference-Negating Helmet from Gnomeregan to compete. We feel that is clunky and unintuitive to the average player, so we have removed the ability to use the gnomeregan helmets past level 59 and offset that change for Warriors with 10% attack speed for 2handed weapons, and 5% attack speed for 1handed weapons. Soul of the Titan damage increase to Heroic Strike, Slam, and Overpower changed to 10% (Was 25%). Soul of the Battle Forecaster changed to 5% crit, damage, and damage reduction when changing stances (was 10%). Soul of the Sanguinist damage changed to 15% (was 20%). Frenzied Assault changed to 40% attack speed (was 30%). Single-Minded Fury changed to 4% attack speed per stack (was 3%). Soul of the Aftershock reduces the cooldown of Shockwave by 25% (was 50%).

Title: Pentagon’s Hegseth to Visit Panama Canal After Trump Threats

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Photo: Panama Canal Authority By Phil Stewart PANAMA CITY, April 8 (Reuters) – The United States will take back the Panama Canal from Chinese influence, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Tuesday during a visit to the Central American nation. Hegseth, following talks with Panama’s government, vowed to deepen security cooperation with Panama’s forces and said China would not be allowed to “weaponize” the canal by using Chinese firms’ commercial relationships for espionage. “Together, we will take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence,” Hegseth said, speaking at a pier renovated with U.S. assistance in Panama City. “China did not build this canal. China does not operate this canal and China will not weaponize this canal. Together with Panama in the lead, we will keep the canal secure and available for all nations.” More than 40% of U.S. container traffic, valued at roughly $270 billion a year, goes through the Panama Canal, accounting for more than two-thirds of vessels passing each day through the world’s second-busiest interoceanic waterway. Hegseth is expected to get a close-up look at the Panama Canal later on Tuesday, the first full day of a rare visit to a nation still unsettled by Trump’s threats to take back the canal. While Hegseth spoke about removing Chinese influence, Trump has spoken in broader terms and not ruled out using military force, if necessary. Hegseth is the first U.S. defense secretary to visit in decades, and his trip follows reports that the Trump administration has requested options from the U.S. military to ensure access to the canal, which the United States built more than a century ago and handed over to Panama in 1999. Trump has complained that was a bad deal for the United States. Hegseth was greeted by Panama Public Security Minister Frank Abrego and held closed-door meetings with President Jose Raul Mulino and other officials. Given Trump’s tough rhetoric, the stakes are high for Hegseth’s visit. “On the whole, this hasn’t been a winning issue for the United States in terms of public diplomacy in Panama,” said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Still, current and former U.S. officials and experts say the United States has found a willing partner in tackling Chinese influence in Mulino. In February, Mulino announced Panama’s formal move to exit China’s Belt and Road Initiative and he has aided Trump’s crackdown on migrants. He has accepted deportation flights of non-Panamanians and worked to stem migration from South America by those crossing through his country’s dangerous Darien jungle. Hegseth praised Mulino, saying his government understood the threat from China, and his remarks about Panama being in the lead on addressing the canal’s security concerns appeared to be a nod to Panamanian sensitivities. Hegseth, a U.S. military veteran and former Fox News host, has enthusiastically backed Trump’s southern-focused security agenda, by means such as dispatching U.S. troops to the U.S. border with Mexico and offering military aircraft for deportation flights. Trump has falsely claimed that China is operating the canal, something even Hegseth said was not true on Tuesday, and that Chinese soldiers are present. But experts acknowledge U.S. security concerns, particularly regarding espionage, with an expansive Chinese commercial presence in Panama that also includes plans by Chinese firms to build a bridge over the canal. Last month, Trump celebrated a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison, including its ports on either end of the Panama Canal. Trump said the purchase was an example of how the United States was “reclaiming” the canal. But China has criticized it, with the market regulator saying it will carry out an antitrust review of the deal. Current and former U.S. officials say the Panama Canal would be critical for the passage of U.S. warships during any future conflict in Asia, since Navy vessels would transit from the Atlantic to the Pacific to support the war effort. Even without blocking the canal, China could have an enormous advantage by being able to surveil vessels passing through it. Still, John Feeley, who was U.S. ambassador to Panama from 2015 to 2018, disputed the Trump administration’s assertion that China’s presence in Panama was a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaty. “What’s not legitimate about the way Trump has gone about this is the bullying tactic that he’s used, which is to claim that there has been a violation of the neutrality treaty. There hasn’t been,” Feeley said. Mulino has defended Panama’s administration of the canal, saying it has been handled responsibly for world trade, including that of the United States, and that it “is, and will continue to be, Panamanian.” (Reporting by Phil Stewart; additional reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Clarence Fernandez, Rod Nickel and Alistair Bell) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2025.

Title: Billionaires—Including Elon Musk—Speak Out Against Trump’s Tariffs: ‘Huge Policy Mistake’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs took effect Wednesday over the concerns of many of the nation’s billionaires, as even some longtime supporters of the president—including Elon Musk—have expressed concern about the tariffs and their impact on the economy. Elon Musk arrives for the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump in the U.S. Capitol ... More Rotunda on January 20 in Washington, DC. Jamie Dimon: The JPMorganChase CEO told Fox Business on Wednesday he thinks a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s tariffs—though he said he’s right now taking a “calm view” of the financial situation, “But I think it could get worse if we don’t make some progress here”—after Dimon expressed concerns in his annual letter to shareholders Monday morning, saying they “will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.” Elon Musk: The Tesla CEO shared a video early Monday of economist Milton Friedman touting free trade and the benefits of importing goods and reportedly lobbied Trump personally not to impose the tariffs, The Washington Post reported Monday. He’s also been sparring with Trump’s top trade adviser Peter Navarro for praising tariffs—most recently saying Tuesday Navarro is a “moron” who’s “dumber than a sack of bricks”—and Musk’s brother (and Tesla board member) Kimbal Musk has criticized the tariffs as a “permanent tax” on Americans. Bill Ackman: The hedge fund manager is a longtime Trump supporter but has repeatedly spoken out against the president’s tariffs, calling Tuesday for the White House to issue a 30, 60 or 90-day pause on the tariffs “to enable negotiations to be completed without a major global economic disruption” and saying Wednesday morning the financial chaos Trump’s tariffs have sparked are “not the markers of successful policy” and “many small businesses will go bankrupt” if they’re not paused soon. Ken Griffin: The Citadel founder—and major Republican donor—said at an event Monday that Trump’s tariffs are a “huge policy mistake,” with Bloomberg reporting he urged audience members to lobby Trump to step back on the tariffs and said he’s “really afraid of [the U.S.] abdicating our role of leadership for the free world.” Daniel Loeb: While Loeb said in February he thought Trump’s initial tariffs on Mexico and Canada wouldn’t harm the stock market, the hedge fund manager has spoken out against Trump’s more sweeping policy, sharing a post Monday that noted the stock market chaos is “all in the head of 1 person. Who can change his mind at any time”—writing, “Exactly”—and sharing criticism of the tariffs by billionaire Ken Griffin and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Larry Fink: The BlackRock CEO suggested at the Economic Club of New York Monday that “the economy is weakening as we speak” and the market could fall another 20% from where it is now as a result of Trump’s tariffs, CNBC reports. Fink suggested the U.S. is “probably in a recession right now,” but he still expressed some optimism about the economy’s long-term outlook, saying, “In the long run, this is actually more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity” and “the vitality of the United States will persist.” Joe Lonsdale: The Palantir cofounder said on X he has some concerns about the tariffs even though he understands where “some” of the Trump administration’s thinking “is coming from,” and shared a post on tariffs from Viahart founder Molton Hart early Monday, saying Hart’s argument that the “tariffs are structured in the wrong way” by taxing finished products and components at the same rate “reflects a lot of my key concerns about how the tariffs could be done better.” Ken Langone: The Home Depot cofounder and GOP megadonor told the Financial Times he believes Trump has “been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation” and criticized how the tariffs were calculated—saying, “I don’t understand the goddamn formula”—telling the FT it would have been “more manageable and certainly more constructive” for the Trump administration to impose baseline 10% tariffs on foreign imports before starting negotiations. Ray Dalio: Dalio, who founded the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, Bridgewater Associates, wrote Monday the tariffs are based on a broader “breakdown of the major monetary, political, and geopolitical orders.” He’s still expressed concern about Trump’s tariffs and their “practicality,” however, telling CNBC on Tuesday that while he “agree[s] with the problem” the tariffs are aimed at fixing, “I am very concerned about the solution.” Stanley Druckenmiller: Longtime hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller expressed some optimism about tariffs in an interview with CNBC, referring to them as the “lesser of two evils” versus an income tax—though an unverified social media account believed to belong to Druckenmiller responded to a clip of his interview Sunday, arguing he “do[es] not support tariffs exceeding 10%.” Ken Fisher: The Fisher Investments chairman attacked Trump’s tariffs Monday, saying on X the tariff plan is “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools,” predicting it “will fade and fail.” Thomas Peterffy: Contrary to many other billionaires, the Interactive Brokers founder has fully embraced Trump’s tariffs, telling Forbes on Tuesday he “think[s] it gives an opportunity to many entrepreneurs to gear up for producing and inventing either the same things that foreign countries sell us at cheap prices, or proper substitutes for them,” and claiming any price hikes will affect “plastic sh-t from China that is not absolutely necessary for people to have.” More than $10 billion. That’s how much Trump’s top 10 billionaire donors lost in the stock market on Thursday alone, as stocks plunged in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement. That’s only a fraction of the $270 billion in total that was wiped off the net worths of the world’s billionaires on Thursday, Forbes calculated, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Musk among those who were the hardest hit. Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk called Trump “the most high tax American President in generations” on Monday. “Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,” the Tesla shareholder said on X. Peterffy criticized his fellow Trump-friendly billionaires who have spoken out against the president’s tariffs, telling Forbes, “I think that they are short term, greedy, looking after their own pockets.” Trump has dug his heels in on his tariffs and repeatedly doubled down in support of them, even as they’ve spurred chaos in the markets. “BE COOL! Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social after his tariffs took effect. The president staunchly defended his tariffs to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, saying they are “the only chance our country will have to reset the table” in terms of the U.S.’ trade with other countries, and that while other presidents wouldn’t be willing to impose such controversial tariffs, “I don’t mind going through it, because I see a beautiful picture at the end.” Trump’s tariffs have also garnered criticism from a number of non-billionaires who have typically been sympathetic to the president. Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy has suggested he’s lost up to 15% of his net worth as a result of the stock market plunge from Trump’s tariffs and said “everything’s in the s—-ter” because of the president’s policy—but also has continued to back the president, saying Trump is a “smart guy” even as he dubbed Monday’s stock market plunge “Orange Monday.” “I’m gonna roll with [Trump] Trump has suggested he’s open to negotiating with other countries on their tariffs, saying Monday that discussions with other countries would begin “immediately” and telling reporters he’s open to reaching “fair deals” with other countries that put “America first.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has also said Trump will negotiate with other countries—likely starting with Japan—but has suggested those negotiations may take a while, telling Fox Business on Monday that all the countries approaching the Trump administration about making deals means “it’s going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June.” The White House denied reports Monday suggesting the administration was considering a 90-day pause, however, decrying the rumor as “fake news,” and Trump said Monday he’s “not looking at” pausing the tariffs unilaterally. Congress could also undo Trump’s tariffs, and bipartisan legislation has been introduced that would require any tariffs the president wants to impose to be approved by Congress. That legislation remains a longshot to pass as of now and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has reportedly urged House Republicans to back Trump’s policy—though some GOP lawmakers are already backing the legislation, and more could follow suit if Trump’s tariffs continue to wreak economic havoc. A Florida-based stationery company is also challenging Trump’s authority to enact tariffs in court—with potentially another major legal challenge on the way this week from business groups—though it remains to be seen how those will play out. Trump announced his sweeping tariff policy during a “Liberation Day” event Wednesday, levying tariffs of 10% and up on imports from nearly all foreign countries—even uninhabited ones. The tariffs fulfill a longtime promise by the president to impose sweeping tariffs in order to restore manufacturing to the U.S. and punish other countries for purportedly unfair trade practices, which Trump has pushed despite economists long warning that doing so would raise prices for U.S. consumers and harm the economy. Billionaires’ criticism of Trump’s tariffs comes after dozens of them backed the president in the November election. More than 50 billionaires expressed support for Trump and billionaires funneled millions into his campaign, even as the now-president made sweeping tariffs a signature plank of his platform.

Title: Trump was touting his Panama victory. Then China stepped in.

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — A huge deal President Donald Trump touted as a victory in his campaign to “take back” the Panama Canal from China could be on the rocks amid pushback from Beijing. The $23 billion sale involving two ports run by CK Hutchison, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, to a consortium led by the U.S. investment firm BlackRock had been scheduled to be signed last week. But an agreement between the two has been delayed under pressure from China, whose market regulator launched a review of the deal as state-run newspapers attacked it as undermining China’s national interests. NBC News takes a look at the sale and what it may mean politically and economically for the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. In his inaugural speech in January, Trump claimed without providing evidence that China controlled the 50-mile canal and vowed that the United States will take back the waterway, which he said was “vital” to national security. The Panamanian government has administered the U.S.-built canal since the United States relinquished it to the Central American country in 1999. Trump did not rule out military action, and he has directed the Defense Department to draw up plans to send more troops to Panama to “reclaim” the canal, through which 40% of U.S. trade passes. Visiting Panama on Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth repeated Trump’s pledge to “take back the Panama Canal from China’s influence.” The U.S. “will not allow communist China or any other country to threaten the canal’s operation or integrity,” he said. China, which says it has never interfered in the operation of the canal, called Hegseth’s remarks “irresponsible.” “We advise the U.S. to reflect on its own bullying and plundering of developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Panama, and stop distorting and slandering China,” a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Panama said in a statement Wednesday. Panama also denies Trump’s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January it launched an audit of CK Hutchison’s Panama Ports Co. (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Cristóbal on the Atlantic side. On Monday, Panama’s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would sue officials involved in its renewal in 2021. CK Hutchison’s sale to BlackRock includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced March 4, the companies said definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2. Trump quickly declared victory. “To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal. The sale of the two Chinese-run ports is about more than just Panama, said Christopher Hernandez-Roy, senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. “It represents a major victory for the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,” he said, adding that is something China “would not want to happen.” Though CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal. China “firmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries’ legitimate rights and interests,” Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said last week. Chinese government offices in Hong Kong have reposted articles from pro-Beijing newspapers criticizing the sale as undermining China’s national interest. Beijing’s market regulator has also said the sale is subject to an antitrust review “to protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests.” The original signing date of April 2 came and went last week. While neither BlackRock nor CK Hutchison has publicly commented on the delay, analysts say that in light of the cumulative 54% tariff the United States imposed on China, the ports could be used as a bargaining chip for China to extract concessions from the United States. “What seems more important is China’s effort to gain leverage in negotiations with Trump,” said Angela Zhang, a professor of law at the University of Southern California and author of “Chinese Antitrust Exceptionalism.” While the deal does not involve Hutchison’s ports in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, CK Hutchison is publicly listed in Hong Kong, which, Zhang said, could mean China “may have jurisdiction,” even if the transaction “itself occurred offshore.” The review by Beijing’s market regulator is an example of China’s asserting its “long-arm jurisdiction over offshore transactions,” she added. BlackRock declined a request for comment. CK Hutchison did not respond to a request for comment. For Panama, the deal’s failure “would be seen as snatching defeat from the jaws of victory,” Hernandez-Roy said. “There would be tremendous pressure on Panama to cancel the concessions,” he said, referring to the port operation rights that Hutchison PPC won in 1997. Nevertheless, some analysts say CK Hutchison, which is not financially dependent on the Chinese government, is expected to press ahead with the deal. Li, CK Hutchison’s 96-year-old owner, has been known to draw Beijing’s ire. “Beijing is a bit skeptical about Li’s family. But the family still remains to be one of the most influential, if not the most influential, conglomerates in Hong Kong,” said Wilson Chan, co-founder and director of policy research at Hong Kong’s Pagoda Institute. “I think what they are actually doing is to diversify the risk, as Trump is getting more and more high-profile about the ports in Panama,” he said. “And during turmoil in the global economy, cash is king.” Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

A month ago on Mar. 6th, Trump established the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. So far, the value of the Bitcoin held in that reserve has declined by over 12%. Had the U.S. sold it and added to our gold reserve, not only would we have avoided that loss, but we would now have a 2% gain.

A digital asset trust bank is like a regular bank, but it’s allowed to hold cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, while Anchorage also specializes in staking, trading, and governance. The world’s largest asset manager may use several custody accounts at the San Francisco-based bank to maintain funds for its $45 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, or IBIT, and $1.8 billion iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, or ETHA, BlackRock stated in the filings. Anchorage’s arrangement with BlackRock underscores the asset manager’s “ongoing risk management approach” and “expanding presence in the digital asset space,” BlackRock stated. BlackRock had already tapped crypto exchange Coinbase as a custodian for its two crypto funds, alongside several other asset managers that launched new products for the industry’s two largest cryptocurrencies by market value last year. “We are excited by the opportunity to set a new standard for tailored access to the digital asset class,” Anchorage co-founder and CEO Nathan McCauley said in a statement. “We are helping BlackRock to meet client demand for today and tomorrow.” So far, Coinbase has been dominant in securing billions of dollars' worth of digital assets for the Wall Street products. Asset manager VanEck custodies its Bitcoin ETF with crypto exchange Gemini, while financial titan Fidelity self-custodies the BTC backing its Bitcoin fund. Anchorage entered into a custody arrangement with crypto asset manager 21Shares in September, safeguarding funds for its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The digital asset trust bank also began supporting tokens on layer-1 network Aptos, including BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), in December. BlackRock’s custodial arrangement with Coinbase will not be affected by the firm’s new deal with Anchorage, which received its federal charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in January 2021, the asset manager said. BlackRock isn’t planning on moving funds to Anchorage from Coinbase, but it can decide how funds are split between the two firms at its “sole discretion,” the asset manager stated.

Other altcoins have also significantly outperformed the overall crypto market in the past 24 hours. Cardano rose 6.3%, far outpacing the Bitcoin price rise of 4%. Meanwhile, Chainlink is up 8% in the same period, posting similar gains to Dogecoin and Avalanche. The vast majority of cryptocurrencies have registered notable price increases today, with the entire crypto market cap up by 1.8% to $2.62 trillion over the past day’s trading. Still, amid ongoing debate and concern about the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs, even the best-performing altcoins are down week-on-week and month-on-month. Many high-profile figures within the world of finance, such as hedge fund boss Ray Dalio, are predicting a longer-term slump in equities and the U.S. economy, which some believe could spill over into digital assets. Dogecoin's rise has left it still 9.8% lower than it was this time last week and DOGE is trailing its price from last month by 16.4%. It’s now down roughly 58% since its recent high of $0.36, around the time of Trump’s inauguration. Meanwhile, AVAX has slipped 9.3% since last week and 10.7% month-on-month. But regardless of the market’s recent boost today, institutional money does seem to have been retreating from crypto assets over the past week. According to data from Farside Investors, money has left the largest Bitcoin ETFs for the past three straight trading days—totaling $268 million. And net ETF flows have been negative for six of the past seven days. Volatility may be here to stay Some analysts are predicting these types of extreme price fluctuations, Dogecoin and otherwise, are likely to persist over the coming weeks and months. Sean Dawson, head of research at on-chain options platform Derive.xyz, told Decrypt he expects “this volatility to persist in the coming weeks as the global economy adjusts to a more turbulent environment.” Dawson put this down to “increasing pressure on the market as traders seek to reduce risk exposure amidst this growing volatility.” There is long-term optimism among some of the world’s largest investors, mixed in with expectations of short-term volatility. Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holders, didn’t rule out the possibility of the crypto market falling “another 20% from here” in a speech at the Economic Club of New York on Monday. But the CEO said that the market turbulence presented "more of a buying opportunity than a selling opportunity.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warns NYC to fix crime, filth and schools — or lose even more companies
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/04/08/business/nyc-needs-to-fix-crime-filth-for-companies-to-stay-larry-fink/
Time Published: 2025-04-08T13:49:07Z
Full Content:
Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock Inc., warned policymakers in New York City on Monday that crime, cleanliness and a shortage of quality schools have significantly undermined the city’s attractiveness to businesses. “The city is on the verge of losing a lot of companies,” the 72-year-old Fink said during a candid conversation hosted by the Economic Club of New York on Monday. “I don’t believe the city has the vitality that it did before.” Fink, who first arrived in New York during the rough-and-tumble 1970s when it was plagued by an economic crisis and widespread urban decay, expressed deep frustration, saying: “I believed that my taxes were used to help build out the city. I don’t feel that way anymore.” His investment firm, BlackRock, oversees assets totaling approximately $11.6 trillion and is headquartered in Manhattan’s Hudson Yards. Fink’s remarks were reported by Bloomberg News. Since late 2019, approximately 160 Wall Street firms, collectively managing nearly $1 trillion in assets, have moved their headquarters out of New York. The city has seen a significant reduction in drugstores, losing nearly 40% over the past decade, with 10% of closures occurring in 2024 alone. Major chains like Walgreens, CVS, and Rite Aid have reduced their presence, citing factors such as rampant shoplifting and other crimes. Companies like Foot Locker have announced plans to move their headquarters from New York City to other states, aiming to reduce costs. Particularly troubling to Fink is the city’s regulatory environment. He urged lawmakers to reconsider the stringent “pay to play” rules that limit political contributions from individuals and firms conducting business in the city. In New York City, “pay-to-play” rules are a set of campaign finance regulations designed to prevent corruption and ensure transparency in government by limiting political contributions from individuals or companies that do business with the city. “In New York, because we’re so dominated by the financial services area, we are not able to do anything related to helping shape the narrative of this city,” Fink said. “This is one of the reasons why I think the city has been so harmed.” Despite Fink’s criticisms, recent data from the New York Police Department paints a more complex picture of crime in the Big Apple. In fact, the first quarter of 2025 saw substantial decreases in violent crimes, with murders falling by 34.4%, down to 63 incidents from 96 during the same period last year. Shootings also dropped by 23.1% — with incidents decreasing from 182 to 140, according to the NYPD. Moreover, crime on the city’s subway system — a key source of anxiety for many New Yorkers — declined by 18.1%, including zero murders reported during this period for the first time in seven years. Law enforcement officials attributed these improvements to precision policing strategies, emphasizing officer deployment to Violence Reduction Zones, where major crimes have decreased by approximately 25% compared to the previous year. Yet not all statistics reflect improvements, particularly when it comes to quality-of-life concerns in the city compared to the pre-COVID era. Certain crime categories have grown notably, raising concerns among residents. Major felony crimes have increased by 32.0%, including serious offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, grand larceny, and auto theft. Petty thefts at drugstores have increased by 37.4%, while quality-of-life offenses resulting in summonses, including public drinking and urination, have jumped by 37.7%, according to an analysis by Bloomberg News. Rat sightings reported through the city’s 311 hotline have also surged by 48.7% compared to 2019, the news site found. Emergency services have faced their own challenges. Ambulance response times increased by 16%, reflecting delays for FDNY medics in reaching life-threatening situations. Similarly, the NYPD’s response times to active crimes have slowed dramatically by 55.1%, Bloomberg News found in its analysis. Perhaps the most alarming statistic involves public health: Deaths from unintentional drug overdoses have more than doubled, rising by 110.9%, highlighting a severe crisis requiring immediate attention from city leadership. The Post has sought comment from the mayor’s office. Advertisement

ByMichael Peregrine ByMichael Peregrine, Senior Contributor. Well written CEO letters can serve as a master class on practical leadership lessons. The best-written annual CEO letters typically offer value beyond the company’s investors, to senior leadership teams of companies across industry sectors. They provide information from financial results and projections, to important perspectives on the company’s mission, strategy, culture and decision-making process, among others. All of which can be fodder for consideration by officers and directors of other companies. Among the most popular of these letters have been those written annually by Warren Buffett (Berkshire/Hathaway); Larry Fink (Blackrock) and Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase). And it’s the 2025 version of Mr. Dimon’s annual letter that contains some particularly noteworthy musings on executive practices, under the letter’s heading, “Management Learnings”. They represent an edited version of a “master class” on management lessons he previously provided to his senior executive team, and comment on the need to nurture innovation, ambition and discipline while discouraging complacency, arrogance and bureaucracy: Complacency and Arrogance: Complacency (i.e., the arrogance of being slow to adjust) is cited as a leading cause of corporate failure. Caution is required when elements of complacency are identified, because complacency can lead to the negative developments “that kill companies”. Getting the Numbers Right: The value of proper accounting is cited as a key to corporate success; “to know your numbers: You need to get your numbers right, understand them, analyze them, work them, test them and don't be rote about it.” This includes using an actual budget as a barometer, comparing performance with the best companies, not the peer average, and pursuing a rigorous review of allocated expenses. Full and Constant Competitive Assessment: Great value can be gained from a full and constant assessment of the company’s competition, including organizations that are outside of the company’s immediate business sector. Much can be learned from competitors, customers and employees if leaders are open to recognizing the lessons. Example: Chick-fil-A using drones to figure out how to expedite the drive-thru line. Focus on Controls: Noting that “[H]onest numbers are critical to having great controls,” Mr. Dimon recommends making a practice of continually reviewing financial operational detail, project reporting and audit reports. He also encourages rigorous stress testing and risk management of new products, which “often tend to blow up.” Killing the Bureaucracy: Mr. Dimon describes bureaucracy as a weed that must be continuously gardened. Meetings are cited as a particular example; hold them only when necessary. There should be a purpose to every meeting, and they should conclude with a follow-up list. Avoid the risk of over-collaborating. Acknowledging Mistakes: Effective leaders will recognize that they don’t always get everything right-and when mistakes are made it’s important to acknowledge and learn from them. Among Mr. Dimon’s own, self-described mistakes: underestimating the importance of cloud technology; leaving the wrong person in a job for too long and failing to recognize certain early risk warnings. Defining Culture: Mr. Dimon cites “Ted Lasso” for offering lessons on the important contribution that recognition makes to effective corporate culture, “by recognizing people’s actions day in and day out ‒ not by serving up platitudes.” Recognition is a form of humility and acknowledgment that often directly aligns with corporate values. Team Leadership: Admonishing a colleague to “stay in your lane” can be the cause of major mistakes; i.e., what can occur when people identify something as a problem, but are reluctant to raise it in the right room, for fear of being provocative. “There's nothing wrong with disagreement. Ever.” Achieving Growth and Innovation: Companies that seek to foster growth through forward thinking will evaluate innovative ideas by testing and learning- not through rote analysis, which is often counterproductive to creativity. Management Tricks and Tools: this is essentially a “lighting round” of fascinating yet practical tools of the leadership trade: (i) treat everyone fairly and with respect-from clerks to CEOs; (ii) balance celebrating success with emphasizing negatives and the need for continuous improvement; (iii) write memos yourself-don’t let others write them for you; when you’re asked a question, make sure that you-not someone else-responds; (iv) always make follow-up lists (which, when you think about it, can be distinguished from “to-do” lists); (v) when you attend meetings, give them 100% of your attention; (vi) work smarter, not longer-don’t read the same email multiple times; and (vii) If you don't take care of yourself, it doesn't work. ***** Now that’s a lot of lessons. And to be sure, some may be more applicable to large companies in general, and to the financial services sector in particular, than to the broader commercial sector. But it’s hard not to take away some leadership nuggets from each of Mr. Dimon’s topics, regardless of the industry within someone works. It’s akin to the refrain we often hear from high school and college sports coaches, and how they’re able to apply the lessons they learn from their professional major league counterparts. Ultimately, it’s the same game, the same ball and the same playing field, no matter the level it’s played at. And the lessons are just as relevant.

April 08, 2025 09:38 ET | Source: WEEX Exchange WEEX Exchange SINGAPORE, April 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WEEX , a global digital asset trading platform, officially listed the AB/USDT trading pair on April 2, 2025. AB is a public blockchain infrastructure project committed to building a decentralized future. It provides efficient and secure foundational support for DApps and a wide range of digital assets. Its high-performance mainnet and cross-chain capabilities are key to enabling the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The project currently focuses on practical scenarios including DeFi, IoT, and enterprise services. Originally launched as Newton, AB completed its rebranding in February 2025, marking a strategic shift from early community economy exploration toward a new phase of blockchain infrastructure evolution. Real-world assets are rapidly becoming a key narrative within the global on-chain ecosystem. In late 2024, BlackRock launched BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. Treasury product, which has since become the largest of its kind by market capitalization. In early 2025, Circle announced the acquisition of RWA platform Hashnote and integrated it with its USDC-linked fund products, further advancing the convergence between stablecoins and real-world financial instruments. These developments reflect the accelerating global interest in on-chain RWAs. According to data from RWA.xyz, as of March 2025, the total value of RWAs locked on-chain has surpassed $18.6 billion, up nearly 20% since the beginning of the year. The listing of AB represents another strategic step in WEEX’s commitment to blockchain infrastructure development. The platform continues to focus on supporting high-quality projects that facilitate the tokenization of real-world assets and enable cross-chain interoperability. AB’s long-term dedication to RWA use cases and its adoption of heterogeneous blockchain architecture align closely with WEEX’s mission to bridge real-world value and on-chain participation, offering users broader access to diversified digital assets. To mark the listing, WEEX has launched a limited-time deposit and spot trading promotion. Users who complete the designated tasks will be eligible to share in a total prize pool of 10,000 USDT.

Title: Trump's Manly Tariffs

Tariffs Liz Wolfe | 4.8.2025 9:30 AM The manufactured pause: Yesterday, news spread that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause to its implementation of the most massive round of tariffs, currently set to go into effect tomorrow. The market started climbing back up as the news made the rounds and was relayed by CNBC and Reuters. The only trouble was that this was made up and amplified on X, with no bearing in reality. It looks like the posts came from an actual Fox News interview with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in which he was asked whether the president would "consider a 90-day pause in tariffs." Hassett replied: "The president is going to decide what the president is going to decide." ("I would urge everyone, especially Bill [Ackman], to ease off the rhetoric a little bit," he added. "It's the idea that it's going to be a 'nuclear winter' or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric.") Get your daily news roundup from Liz Wolfe and Reason. Δ An X post from "Hammer Capital" (handle: "yourfavorito") with about 1,000 followers appears to have originated the 90-day pause rumor circa 10:11 a.m. ET. "At about 10:12 a.m., CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich, who was on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, said that cheers had broken out, as stock indices—which were already recovering from early-morning lows—suddenly surged," reports CNN. "'Walter Bloomberg,' an account with a much larger following … copy-and-pasted the original rumor along with a siren emoji at 10:13 a.m." The recovery continued. CNBC and Reuters started circulating the news, having failed to corroborate. Meanwhile, Trump lackeys continued to make the rounds saying extraordinarily dumb things. Peter Navarro, senior White House trade adviser, guarantees no recession. Don't you feel so much better? Meanwhile, the Fox folks are having a blast with the chyrons and touting our return to manufacturing as the thing that will callus up the soft hands of American men, or whatever. Good thing the urban-core men stocked up on Carhartt; they'll need it on the assembly line. I give up. pic.twitter.com/F6TcH2ys0N — Scott Lincicome (@scottlincicome) April 7, 2025 Those inclined to give the administration the most possible credit, and to see 4D chess moves everywhere they look, have theorized that the Trump administration could be imposing such intense tariffs as a bargaining chip to actually bring about more free trade by persuading other countries to come to the negotiating table. This theory appears to be getting less believable by the day. Yesterday, the European Union said it would fully drop its tariffs on American cars and industrial goods if the U.S. would do the same; Navarro turned around and criticized the bloc for its value-added taxes and restrictions on American meat exports, saying "You steal from the American people every which way is possible." Then he turned to Vietnam, which he accused of intellectual property theft and killing the American shrimp industry. "When they come to us and say, we'll go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us, because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters," he added. So the theory that this is all a ploy to get way freer trade than before does not look likely at all. Supreme Court says there's a jurisdiction issue: Last night, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to send deportees to prison in El Salvador, but did overturn a lower court's ruling, allowing the administration to continue such deportations for now as the lawyers for the migrants "should have…filed in Texas, where the Venezuelans are being held, rather than a court in Washington," per The New York Times. Make no mistake: This is a very narrow ruling. It's likely more will come soon. "All nine justices agreed that the Venezuelan migrants detained in the United States must receive advance notice and the opportunity to challenge their deportation before they could be removed, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh wrote in a concurrence," per the Times. Trump is claiming the ruling as much more of a win than it is, loudly proclaiming that yesterday was "A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!" on Truth Social. Meanwhile, Chief Justice John Roberts issued an administrative stay, temporarily pausing a trial judge's attempt to force the administration to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to the United States. This too should not be interpreted as a bigger thing than it is: He appears to be buying and biding time. BREAKING: Chief Justice Roberts has indefinitely blocked the court order requiring Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return tonight. https://t.co/yoeNMJnL8m pic.twitter.com/vx7k4IXIMV — Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) April 7, 2025 Scenes from New York: "Adrienne Adams, the New York City Council speaker who is running for mayor, proposed on Monday a guaranteed basic income program that would be the largest of its kind in the United States," reports The New York Times. "It would aim to help more than 21,000 homeless children and young adults" giving "an initial one-time stipend of $2,500, followed by monthly payments over three years that start at $1,000 per month and then fall to $500 per month." This proposal would cost the city about $430 million over the course of two years. This isn't the first time Adams has tried this approach. On city council, she's spearheaded an effort to spend $1.5 million to support a nonprofit (the Bridge Project) that gives guaranteed income to new moms. But New York City already has a $4 billion budget for homelessness alleviation services; the problem really isn't lack of money. Peter Navarro said something quite revealing on CNBC today about BMW's factory in South Carolina: "That doesn't work for America. It's bad for our economics, it's bad for our national security." This piqued my interest. I grew up very close to that BMW facility -- the company's… pic.twitter.com/bDrjSzI3TV — John W Lettieri (@LettieriDC) April 7, 2025 The guy cheering on Trump's tariffs and telling stock investors to shut up about their losses is literally betting against Corporate America viz CDS. https://t.co/96iCUUQ5AP — Tracy Alloway (@tracyalloway) April 7, 2025 Start your day with Reason.

Title: BlackRock adds new Bitcoin custodian Anchorage Digital alongside Coinbase

BlackRock expands custodial framework for IBIT ETF with Anchorage Agreement. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has expanded the custodial structure of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), formalizing Anchorage Digital Bank N.A. as an additional Bitcoin custodian through a new Master Custody Service Agreement. The development, disclosed in a Form 8-K filing dated April 7, 2025, introduces a secondary custodian while Coinbase continues to serve as the primary holder of the trust’s Bitcoin reserves. The agreement establishes a dual-custodian model between BlackRock Fund Advisors, the trust’s administrative trustee, and Anchorage, a federally chartered digital asset bank. There will not be an immediate transfer of assets. Instead, Anchorage will remain on standby as a qualified custodian to support the trust’s risk mitigation protocols. Per the filing, Anchorage is required to utilize cold storage solutions for all private keys, maintain insurance coverage, and comply with provisions that address blockchain forks and indemnification responsibilities. This move is consistent with BlackRock’s positioning of the IBIT ETF as a scalable and resilient product. The presence of a second custodian does not alter the trust’s investment strategy or its underlying operational mechanics, but it introduces greater structural flexibility. The strategic addition of Anchorage may reflect BlackRock’s expectations of increased Bitcoin holdings within IBIT and the need for operational redundancy. Since its launch, IBIT has ranked among the top spot Bitcoin ETFs (and also ETFs overall) in terms of inflows, making risk diversification a logical extension of its custodial setup. Having Anchorage in reserve bolsters resilience against potential disruptions in custody services, whether operational, regulatory, or technical. The selection of Anchorage, a bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), further emphasizes a preference for institutions that meet federal banking standards. Anchorage is among the few crypto-native firms to receive a national trust bank charter, a factor that could enhance the trust’s compliance posture in a regulatory environment still shaping its treatment of digital asset custodians. While the addition of Anchorage introduces new operational options, no assets have yet been transferred. Coinbase remains fully responsible for current custodial functions, and the trust’s overall structure, fee arrangement, and investment objectives remain unchanged. The agreement’s role appears preparatory, building a custodial contingency plan without altering day-to-day fund administration. By preparing a framework for multi-custodian support, BlackRock signals a methodical approach to operational risk while positioning IBIT for long-term institutional participation. This development aligns with much of the community’s desire for diversification of custodial relationships as a baseline standard for fiduciary responsibility.

Title: 'They're not ready': Why BlackRock's Larry Fink is sticking around as CEO
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-fink-blackrock-ceo-succession-new-generation-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-08T13:24:57Z

Larry Fink is looking forward to the day he's no longer the CEO of BlackRock, but that's not happening just yet. Fink, the 72-year-old cofounder and the only CEO BlackRock has ever had, has long been answering questions about who will succeed him and Rob Kapito, the firm's president, at the $11.5 trillion asset management behemoth. "I look forward to the day when I'm not running it. I do not want to be somebody that's staying on longer than needed," Fink told the Economic Club of New York. The next generation team is in place, he said, but "they're not ready yet." He said that the firm's scale makes "the job harder" and that he "fundamentally believes" the team immediately below him and Kapito will take over in the future. The group of executives likely to succeed Fink includes Rob Goldstein, the firm's chief operating officer; Martin Small, the chief financial officer and global head of corporate strategy; Rachel Lord, the head of international; and Stephen Cohen, who was promoted to chief product officer last year. This lineup saw a shake-up earlier this year following the surprise exit of Mark Weidman, who, along with Goldstein, had been seen as a top contender to replace Fink. Weidman joined the Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial as its president on Monday. Salim Ramji, another executive considered a prospective successor, left BlackRock last January and joined Vanguard as its chief executive in July. Fink said he was proud of the BlackRock "diaspora," which has seen firm leaders take up CEO posts at other asset managers. Despite once opposing staying on as chairman — he said it would be a disaster in a 2017 interview — Fink said he's now open to staying close to help but likely not for long. Fink also touched on conditions in New York City, saying he used to believe working and living in the city was an honor and that his taxes were being put to good use, but because of crime, filth, and the declining quality of services, he said he "doesn't feel that way anymore." "You know, you're seeing more and more of your firm's population are asking, 'Can I move to other places?' because they're worried about the cost of housing here, the crime, the cost of education, all the things that are that are facing us." He said that BlackRock's New York employee base, with the exception of the acquisitions group, has remained at around 4,000 over the past seven years. He wants business leaders to "reclaim the glory of New York City." While he didn't name a mayoral candidate he was looking to back in the coming November election, Fink said he was a fan of Ritchie Torres, a congressman representing the Bronx who's expressed interest in a gubernatorial run. "He's not running for mayor, but he is one of the key members of Congress representing the Bronx who is really trying to make a difference," Fink said. Jump to
