Reading time 2 minutes While tech billionaire Elon MuskÂ argues that advances in AI and robotics will renderÂ saving for retirement irrelevant, claimingÂ that automation will lead to lower costs and abundance for everyone, another tech billionaire is pitching a very different, more believable future. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the AI boom will actually increase demand for tradespeople like plumbers and electricians, as well as steel and construction workers. Huang said these workers could make âsix-figure salariesâ thanks to what heâs dubbed the âlargest infrastructure build out in human history,â which he claims is already a few hundred billion dollars in. Huang made the comments today during a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos. At the conference, Fink pressed Huang on how he sees AI reshaping the economy and the labor market. To explain his thinking, Huang broke AI down into what he called a âfive-layer cake.â Applications sit at the top, followed by AI models, cloud services, chips, and energy at the bottom. According to Huang, the real economic gains from AI will come as industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and financial services adopt AI. But to get there, countries first need to build out the lower layers of that cake, which is where trade jobs come in. âAnd so we’re talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,â said Huang. âEverybody should be able to make a great living. You don’t need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.â For everyone else, Huang pushed back on fears that AI will rapidly wipe out white-collar professions. He pointed to radiology, a field seen as especially vulnerable because AI systems are good at analyzing images. Instead of replacing radiologists, Huang said AI has helped them become more productive, see more patients, and actually increase the number of radiologists. When asked how this applies to developing countries, Huang argued they should treat AI infrastructure the same way they treat roads and energy. âI really believe that every country should get involved to build AI infrastructure, build your own AI, take advantage of your fundamental natural resource, which is your language and culture,â Huang said. âDevelop your AI, continue to refine it, and have your national intelligence be part of your ecosystem.â That sentiment vaguely echoed comments made by Palantir CEO Alex Karp at Davos, who said that while AI will destroy jobs in the humanities, it will still leave plenty of work for people with vocational training. âThere will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,â Karp said. âI do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill.â Huang ultimately wrapped the conversation with a call for even more investment in AI. All of which is pretty convenient coming from someone whose wealth is tied to a company that powers one of the bottom layers of this AI cake.

Title: Red AI: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Plans Visit to China as Trade Tensions Simmer

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is preparing to travel to China in advance of the Lunar New Year holiday as the company works to expand access for its AI processors in the communist country. Bloomberg reports that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is preparing to travel to China later this month as the company works to regain access to one of its most important markets for AI processors. The visit comes at a critical juncture for the world’s most valuable technology company as it navigates complex geopolitical tensions between the United States and China. The Trump administration has approved sales of certain AI chips to China with restrictions. Huang will be in China to attend company celebrations ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays according to company sources. The executive is also expected to visit Beijing, though it remains uncertain whether he will meet with senior Chinese government officials. The source indicated that Huang’s schedule could still be modified depending on whether potential meetings are confirmed. This China visit represents a regular occurrence for Huang, who typically travels to the country during this time of year. However, the timing carries particular significance given recent developments in US-China trade relations concerning advanced semiconductor technology. The United States government is easing export restrictions on AI processors, which will allow Nvidia to sell its H200 model in China. Simultaneously, Chinese government officials are determining how many of these chips will be permitted into the country. China represents the largest market globally for semiconductors and is actively working to develop its domestic chip industry to reduce dependence on American products. Despite these efforts, local Chinese manufacturers currently cannot match the capabilities of Nvidia’s processors, which are essential for developing and operating artificial intelligence models. Although the H200 is one generation behind the Nvidia chips available in the United States market, it is still considered more powerful than competing Chinese offerings. Due to security considerations, the Chinese government claims it will prohibit the H200 chip from being used by the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure operations, and state-owned enterprises, according to people familiar with the situation. This approach mirrors similar restrictions that the Chinese government has previously implemented for foreign technology products, including devices manufactured by Apple and chips produced by Micron Technology. During a previous visit to China in July, Huang successfully secured meetings with Vice Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. In January 2025, he also celebrated the Lunar New Year holidays with his employees in China, choosing to skip the inauguration ceremony of United States President Donald Trump. On Wednesday of this week, Huang is scheduled to appear at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he will be interviewed by BlackRock Incorporated CEO Larry Fink. Breitbart News reported this week that Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has come out forcefully against Nvidia selling chips to China, comparing it to selling nuclear weapons to North Korea: Dario Amodei, Chief Executive Officer of Anthropic, delivered sharp criticism of recent United States policy changes that would allow the sale of sophisticated AI chips to China. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Amodei characterized the decision as having significant national security ramifications and warned against proceeding with such sales. In an interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, Amodei stated that permitting these chip sales would constitute a major error in judgment. “It would be a big mistake to ship these chips. I think this is crazy. It’s a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.” Read more at Bloomberg here.

Title: Six-figure plumbing and construction jobs are coming, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says—as AI data centers need to be built

The job market has been a tough sell for many Gen Z graduates, with tariffs, economic uncertainty, and artificial intelligence reshaping hiring plans across corporate America. But according to Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang, the next wave of six-figure opportunities won’t be found in a Wall Street cubicle or Silicon Valley Slack channel. Instead, high-paying careers will partially come by picking up a wrench—literally. As tech giants race to build sprawling data centers—totaling $7 trillion in global capital outlays by the end of the decade—Huang believes the world is on the cusp of what he calls the “largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” which will create “a lot of jobs.” “It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers,” he said in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The hands-on skills needed to construct what he described as chip, computer, and AI factories are already facing shortages—even though many roles pay over $100,000 without requiring a college degree. One McKinsey report estimated that between 2023 and 2030, there will be a need for an additional 130,000 trained electricians—as well as 240,000 construction laborers and 150,000 construction supervisors—in the U.S. alone. “Everybody should be able to make a great living,” Huang said. “You don’t need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.” This isn’t the first time Huang has expressed his optimistic outlook on new career paths emerging alongside AI. “The skilled craft segment of every economy is going to see a boom,” he told Channel 4 News in the U.K. last year. “You’re going to have to be doubling and doubling and doubling every single year.” That optimism stands in contrast to warnings from leaders like Ford CEO Jim Farley, who has repeatedly cautioned that AI is hollowing out traditional white-collar entry points—just as the education system continues to funnel students toward four-year degrees. “There’s more than one way to the American Dream, but our whole education system is focused on four-year [college] education,” Farley said at the Aspen Ideas Festival last year. “Hiring an entry worker at a tech company has fallen 50% since 2019. Is that really where we want all of our kids to go? Artificial intelligence is gonna replace literally half of all white-collar workers in the U.S.” At the same time, Farley has warned that the country lacks the blue-collar workforce needed to support a manufacturing and infrastructure revival. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” Farley told Axios in September. “How can we reshore all this stuff if we don’t have people to work there?” By last summer, Farley said the U.S. was already short 600,000 factory workers and 500,000 construction workers. BlackRock’s Larry Fink has echoed these concerns, singling out the electrical industry as a looming bottleneck. Electrician jobs are expected to grow 9% over the next decade, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink said to an audience at CERAWeek, an S&P Global energy conference hosted in Houston. “We just don’t have enough.” Have you given a skilled-trade career a second look thanks to the AI boom?

Title: Jensen Huang says AI bubble fears are dwarfed by ‘the largest infrastructure buildout in human history’

Pushing back against growing skepticism regarding the sustainability of artificial intelligence spending, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang argued against the mountain backdrop of Davos, Switzerland, that high capital expenditures are not a sign of a financial bubble, but rather evidence of “the largest infrastructure build-out in human history.” Speaking in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum, Huang detailed an industrial transformation that extends far beyond software code, reshaping global labor markets and driving unprecedented demand for skilled tradespeople. While much of the public debate focuses on the potential for AI to replace white-collar jobs, Huang pointed to an immediate boom in blue-collar employment required to physically construct the new computing economy. “It’s wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft, and we’re going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers,” Huang said. He noted the urgency to erect “AI factories,” chip plants, and data centers has radically altered the wage landscape for manual labor. “Salaries have gone up, nearly doubled, and so we’re talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories,” Huang said, emphasizing the industry is currently facing a “great shortage” of these workers. Ford CEO Jim Farley has been warning for months about the labor shortage in what he calls the “essential economy,” exactly the type of jobs mentioned by Huang at Davos. Earlier this month, Farley told Fortune these 95 million jobs are the “backbone of our country,” and that he was partnering with local retailer Carhartt to boost workforce development, community building, and “the tools required by the men and women who keep the American Dream alive.” It’s time we all reinvest in the people who make our world work with their hands,” Farley said. In October, at Ford’s Pro Accelerate conference, Farley shared that his own son was wrestling with whether to go to college or pursue a career in the trades. The Ford CEO has estimated the shortage at 600,000 in factories and nearly the same in construction. Fink brought up the bubble talk for a good reason: Fear of a popping bubble gripped markets for much of the back half of 2025, with luminaries such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, and just the previous day at Davos, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella warning about the potential for pain. Much of this originated in the underwhelming release of OpenAI’s GPT-5 in August, but also the MIT study that found 95% of generative AI pilots were failing to generate a return on investment. “Permabears” such as Albert Edwards, global strategist at Société Générale, have talked about how there’s likely a bubble brewing—but then again, they always think that. Huang, whose company became the face of the AI revolution when it blew past $4 trillion in market capitalization (a bar recently reached by Alphabet on the positive release of its Gemini update), tackled these fears in conversation with Fink, arguing the term misdiagnoses the situation. Critics often point to the massive sums being spent by hyperscalers and corporations as unsustainable, but Huang countered the appearance of a bubble happens because “the investments are large … and the investments are large because we have to build the infrastructure necessary for all of the layers of AI above it.” Huang went deep into a food metaphor, describing the AI industry as a “five-layer cake” requiring total industrial reinvention, with Nvidia’s chips a particularly crunchy part of the recipe. The bottom layer is energy, followed by chips, cloud infrastructure, and models, with applications sitting at the top. The current wave of spending is focused on the foundational layers—energy and chips—which creates tangible assets rather than speculative vapor. Far from a bubble, he described a new industry being built from the ground up. “There are trillions of dollars of infrastructure that needs to be built out,” Huang said, noting that the world is currently only “a few 100 billion dollars into it.” To prove the market is driven by real demand rather than speculation, Huang offered a practical “test” for the bubble theory: the rental price of computing power as seen in the price of Nvidia’s GPU chips. “If you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it’s so incredibly hard, and the spot price of GPU rentals is going up, not just the latest generation, but two-generation-old GPUs,” he said. This scarcity indicates established companies are shifting their research and development budgets—such as pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly moving funds from wet labs to AI supercomputing—rather than simply burning venture capital. Beyond construction and infrastructure, Huang addressed the broader anxiety regarding AI’s impact on human employment. He argued AI ultimately changes the “task” of a job rather than eliminating the “purpose” of the job. Citing radiology as an example, he noted that despite AI diffusing into every aspect of the field over the past decade, the number of radiologists has actually increased. Because AI handles the task of studying scans infinitely faster, doctors can focus on their core purpose: patient diagnosis and care, leading to higher hospital throughput and increased hiring. Fink reframed the issue, based on Huang’s pushback. “So what I’m hearing is, we’re far from an AI bubble. The question is, are we investing enough?” Fink asked, positing that current spending levels might actually be insufficient to broaden the global economy. Huang appeared to say: not really. “I think the opportunity is really quite extraordinary, and everybody ought to get involved. Everybody ought to get engaged. We need more energy,” he said, adding the industry needs more land, power, trade, scale, and workers. Huang said the U.S. has lost its workforce population in many ways over the past 20 to 30 years, “but it’s still incredibly strong,” and in Europe, looking around Switzerland, for example, he saw “an extraordinary opportunity to take advantage of.” He noted 2025 was the largest investment year in venture capital history, with $100 billion invested around the world, mostly on AI natives. Huang concluded by emphasizing this infrastructure build-out is global, urging developing nations and Europe to engage in “sovereign AI” by building their own domestic infrastructure. For Europe specifically, he highlighted a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to leverage its strong industrial base to lead in “physical AI” and robotics, effectively merging the new digital intelligence with traditional manufacturing. Far from a bubble, he seemed to be saying, this is just the beginning.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2026 7:40:23 AM PST by MtnClimber "Timing, not haste, drives what will happen next." —Thomas Sowell. Larry Fink of BlackRock and the World Economic Forum. Minneapolis, the sucking chest wound on America’s body politic, gets a break this week from Gawda’mighty, who is turning the heat down to subzero so that ICE-Watch nose-rings can hole-up in their Soros-paid motels, play League of Legends with their DoorDashed Chick-fil-A nuggets, and rest up for the next inning of their motley revolution. ICE itself might even have to lay off its daily round-up of rapists, cut-throats, and child-molesters, to wait out the cold-snap. Meanwhile, things elsewhere roughen up a little. For instance: Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) holds its annual jamboree of vampire squids. Klaus Schwab is out, by the way. He skulked off in a malodorous cloud of embezzlement and sexual irregularities, to be replaced by Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the hedge fund that owns everything in the USA and wants more. Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock! Larry Fink landed as interim head of the WEF largely because BlackRock has been espousing Klaus Schwab’s ideas about “Stakeholder Capitalism,” which allows global corporations to pretend that they have beneficent “societal purpose” while they go about ---raping the common folk of Western Civ. Climate change and green new deals top that agenda, along with diversity, equity, and inclusion and additional bull---- about “environment, social, and governance factors” (ESG) in its global strategies portfolio — meaning, mandates for exactly the kind of policies that are destroying Europe’s economies, de-industrialization foremost. Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. The Kraken breeches. . . .This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

Minneapolis, the sucking chest wound on America’s body politic, gets a break this week from Gawda’mighty, who is turning the heat down to subzero so that ICE-Watch nose-rings can hole-up in their Soros-paid motels, play League of Legends with their DoorDashed Chick-fil-A nuggets, and rest up for the next inning of their motley revolution. ICE itself might even have to lay off its daily round-up of rapists, cut-throats, and child-molesters, to wait out the cold-snap. Meanwhile, things elsewhere roughen up a little. For instance: Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) holds its annual jamboree of vampire squids. Klaus Schwab is out, by the way. He skulked off in a malodorous cloud of embezzlement and sexual irregularities, to be replaced by Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the hedge fund that owns everything in the USA and wants more. Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock! Larry Fink landed as interim head of the WEF largely because BlackRock has been espousing Klaus Schwab’s ideas about “Stakeholder Capitalism,” which allows global corporations to pretend that they have beneficent “societal purpose” while they go about ---raping the common folk of Western Civ. Climate change and green new deals top that agenda, along with diversity, equity, and inclusion and additional bull---- about “environment, social, and governance factors” (ESG) in its global strategies portfolio — meaning, mandates for exactly the kind of policies that are destroying Europe’s economies, de-industrialization foremost. Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. The Kraken breeches. . . .This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock!

Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. The Kraken breeches. . . .This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. The Kraken breeches. . . .This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

Title: Al Gore Heckles Trump Official in Davos Speech

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick faced a tough crowd at the World Economic Forum in Davos—and was heckled by a surprising, but familiar, former U.S. vice president. During an official dinner Tuesday night, Lutnick reportedly launched into a tirade criticizing Europe, inviting jeers from the forum’s major members, heads of state, and other dignitaries. “We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town,” Lutnick said, according to the Financial Times. Multiple people reportedly started heckling Lutnick’s speech—including former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who started booing the secretary, two executives told the Times. Amid the chaos, Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, walked out of the dinner. The hosting WEF chairman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, ended up calling off the event before desserts had been passed out, one source told Reuters. The U.S. Commerce Department claimed that Gore was the only one who booed. Speaking at the World Economic Forum Wednesday, Trump continued the American posturing as he tried to take credit for Europe’s existence in a winding, incoherent address. What are Donald Trump’s goals for 2026? They’re all over the place. The president was asked about his goals in regard to getting his agenda through Congress ahead of the midterms, and he gave a meandering answer about his own executive orders. “We passed so many executive orders. I have great executive orders that are really common sense and good. I mean, like water coming out of a sink. The water wouldn’t come out. They had all sorts of ridiculous restrictions. I took all of that off,” Trump said to Katie Pavlich on NewsNation Tuesday night. “Coming out of the shower head, you’d stand under the shower, there’s no water coming out, so I passed—so many things like that. “Straws. They don’t have to be paper anymore. They don’t have to melt in your mouth.… I’d like to have that all confirmed by Congress,” Trump continued, before adding that he got more important things accomplished through executive order, and would like to have all of his executive orders confirmed by Congress, estimating that 35 to 40 percent of his executive orders have already become law. “So you want your executive orders codified in law, so to speak,” Pavlich said. “Ideally, we get ’em codified and we get ’em codified soon, yes,” Trump replied. Q: What goals do you have for 2026 for Congress in terms of getting your agenda through?TRUMP: I have great executive orders. Like, water coming out of a sink. The water wouldn't come out. They had all sorts of ridiculous restrictions. I took them off. Straws. They don't have… pic.twitter.com/B1h2shfxoQ Trump is well known for rambling and meandering around reporter’s questions, even in friendly interviews. But the vagueness indicates he’s either fully checked out or he’s hiding his agenda, as Trump and his inner circle are unlikely to settle for simply turning his many damaging executive orders through Congress. Getting Trump’s agenda through Congress will be a tall order. The president could barely get his own budget through Congress last year, and ended up causing a lengthy government shutdown. Trump’s executive orders also would have to survive court challenges, and some of them may not even get through the right-wing Supreme Court. America’s presence at the World Economic Forum Wednesday was overshadowed by its leader’s latest obsession: obtaining Greenland—or, maybe, Iceland, depending on Donald Trump’s ability to remember his military aim. Thousands of influential figures, including prominent CEOs and world leaders, gathered in Davos ahead of the global conference. Trump was asked to deliver opening remarks Wednesday, but his speech went wildly off the rails as he began to hyperfixate on his rationale for staking an American flag in Greenland, a Danish-controlled territory. But over the course of an hour-long (and counting, at time of publication) speech, Trump repeatedly and erroneously mixed up Greenland with Iceland, a completely separate landmass and independent nation, raising alarm over just how educated Trump is on the focal point of his U.S. expansion. Before a host of European leaders—including some of America’s longest allies—Trump insisted that “there’s nothing wrong” with the potential acquisition, likening his desired annexation of the region to Europe’s colonial history. “Just as the European nations have,” Trump said. “All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Trump now confusing Greenland with Iceland multiple times pic.twitter.com/nDvufNVB6T Trump reiterated that the U.S. could take Greenland by the use of “excessive force” that would be “practically unstoppable.” The president has been locked into the idea of obtaining Greenland since at least 2019, when he told reporters that the arrangement could be handled as a “large real estate deal.” In recent weeks, the president’s threats have escalated in fervor and frequency. Earlier this month, Trump told The Atlantic that the U.S. “needs” Greenland “for defense.” But what exactly the White House stands to gain from controlling Greenland isn’t clear, particularly because myriad existing treaties already give the U.S. unfettered access to Greenland as a military base. Forcing the issue, however, could irreversibly damage America’s relations with some of its most significant allies. Over the long weekend, Trump announced a new wave of retaliatory tariffs against European countries that oppose his Greenland takeover, cautioning NATO allies against participation in a joint military exercise on the island. Late into Monday evening, Trump continued to provoke America’s allies by releasing private messages sent to him by French President Emmanuel Macron, as well as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. He also taunted world leaders by sharing images on Truth Social that included a photo of himself in the Oval Office beside a posterboard of the Western hemisphere—with Canada, Greenland, and Venezuela colored in with the American flag. “This would not be a threat to NATO,” Trump claimed before the global conference Wednesday, patting himself on the back for his lackluster support for the U.S.-backed military alliance. “This would greatly enhance the security of the whole alliance. The United States is treated very unfairly by NATO. When you think about it, nobody can dispute it. “You have a choice. You can say yes, and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no, and we will remember.” President Trump delivered yet another rambling, long-winded speech Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, using the massive world stage to rail against windmills, complain for the umpteenth time about how the 2020 election was rigged, reaffirm his desire to seize Greenland from Denmark, and take credit for every good thing in the world. The room was dead silent virtually the entire time. “Certain places in Europe are not even recognizable frankly, anymore. They’re not recognizable. And we can argue about it, but there’s no argument,” Trump said early in his speech to the room full of Europeans. “Friends come back from different places—I don’t wanna insult anybody—and say ‘I don’t recognize it.’ And that’s not in a positive way.… It’s not heading in the right direction.” The rhetoric aligned seamlessly with the deeply racist, anti-immigrant sentiments that the European right is pushing with his support. Trump also took the time to hit on one of his favorite punching bags: windmills. “There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place. And they are losers,” Trump said, seemingly talking about the windmills personally. “One thing I’ve noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses, and the worse that country is doing. China makes almost all of the windmills, and yet I haven’t been able to find any wind farms in China.” This is not true, China has multiple wind turbine farms. Trump: "There are windmills all over Europe. There are windmills all over the place. And they are losers. One thing I've noticed is that the more windmills a country has, the more money that country loses, and the worse that country is doing. China make almost all of the… pic.twitter.com/cylwZpyzSZ “Did you ever think of that? They put up a couple big wind farms, but they don’t use them, they just put them up to show people what they could look like,” he continued. “They don’t spin, they don’t do anything.” Trump then of course got to Greenland, accidentally mixing it up with Iceland for nearly the entire time he spoke about it. “Until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,” Trump said, meaning to say Greenland. “They called me daddy … very smart man said, ‘He’s our daddy.’” Trump on NATO: "Until the last few days when I told them about Iceland, they loved me. They called me daddy." (He means Greenland.) pic.twitter.com/9ruzKXQJ2V “So we want a piece of ice for world protection. And they won’t give it,” Trump continued. “We’ve never asked for anything else, and we could have kept that piece of land. And we didn’t. They have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember.” Trump: "So we want a piece of ice for world protection. And they won't give it. They have a choice. You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember." pic.twitter.com/Va3EmvJCrk It’s been a rough 36-ish hours for our fearless leader. On Tuesday, he made a guest appearance at White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s briefing only to read names and show pictures to the press corp for over an hour. And now, after his plane was initially diverted on its way to Davos last night, he’s doing more useless ranting. President Donald Trump appeared to have never heard of an American held captive by the Taliban for almost a year. During an exclusive interview Tuesday with News Nation, host Katie Pavlich touted Trump’s previous efforts to liberate hostages and asked the president about Dennis Coyle, a U.S. citizen who was reportedly kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan last January. “What is your administration doing to get him home?” Pavlich asked. “Well, if you give me the name,” Trump said, even though Pavlich had just told him. “Dennis Coyle,” she repeated. “Well, if you give me some information, I’ll take care of that,” Trump continued. “I know that your administration is working on it—” Pavlich said. “I know they are,” Trump said quickly. “But I could do some things on the internet that are pretty impactful.” Pavlich asked if Trump had a message for the Taliban, who had held Coyle “for no crime.” “Well I’m not happy about them holding anybody. And especially if he’s not guilty of anything. And it sounds—from what I’ve heard, and again I’m not that familiar with it like you are, but I will certainly take a very strong position on it,” Trump said. PAVLICH: Dennis Coyle has been taken hostage by the Taliban for almost a year. What are you doing to get him home?TRUMP: Well if you give me the name?PAVLICH: Dennis CoyleTRUMP: Ok. You give me some information, I can take care of that. I can do some things on the internet… pic.twitter.com/Nbsi1txmOI But Trump’s remarks made it seem that he’d had never even heard of Coyle at all, and the president’s brilliant plan to free him seemed simply to involve posting a “very strong position” he’d made up on the spot. A former White House attorney is ringing alarm bells over Donald Trump’s declining mental health. Ty Cobb, an employee of the first Trump administration and a now outspoken critic of the president, told The Beat on MS NOW Tuesday that the recent shift in Trump’s psychological condition was “palpable.” That day alone, Trump spent a 90-minute press briefing mumbling to himself over a stack of papers, alleging that “pirating ships” is the only thing that Somalis succeed at, claiming that “God is very proud” of his first year back in office, and alleging that a witness to Renee Nicole Good’s death in Minneapolis earlier this month was a “paid agitator.” Outside the press conference, he continued to damage relations with Europe over his obsession with acquiring Greenland. “Those are not the comments of a rational human being and certainly not presidential at all,” Cobb told MS NOW’s Ari Melber. “Likewise, yesterday you had the clear, deranged, demented, and insane note that he sent to the leaders of Norway, saying that because Norway, which has no control over the Nobel Peace Prize, hadn’t given it to him, that he was free to disregard peace and very interested in Greenland. I don’t think there’s anybody outside of the United States who believes that Trump is sane.” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told The Wall Street Journal Monday that he had attempted to negotiate with Trump against a new wave of tariffs on European countries after the U.S. leader suddenly turned sour on NATO countries participating in a joint military exercise in Greenland. Trump, according to Støre, responded that the world would not be safe until America had “Complete and Total Control of Greenland.” “Since you’ve worked for him in the White House, when you make that reference to ‘sane,’ do you mean problems with how he approaches things that have long been there, or are you referring to some decline?” Melber asked. “No, I think there’s been a significant decline,” Cobb said. “He’s always been driven by narcissism. But I think the dementia and the cognitive decline are palpable, as do many experts, including many physicians.” Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has stopped paying for immigrant detainees to receive health care—and isn’t planning on paying for months, independent journalist Judd Legum reported Tuesday. ICE Health Service Corps, the entity that provides immigrants in detention with health care, quietly posted last week that Acentra, the agency’s new third-party administrator for medical claims, would not begin processing claims until at least April 30. “Please continue to hold all claim submissions while IHSC works to bring the new system online in the interim,” the post read. ICE had previously paid the Veterans Association Financial Services Center to process claims for reimbursement—but abruptly ended that contract on October 3, 2025. According to government documents reviewed by Legum, ICE was left with “no mechanism to provide prescribed medication” and no way to “pay for medically necessary off-site care.” Immigrants in detention could no longer receive dialysis, prenatal care, oncology, or chemotherapy. To be clear, ICE is not simply not paying for detainees’ medical treatment: Multiple reports suggest they are not providing it at all, even though federal law requires them to do so. Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff released a report in October documenting at least “85 credible reports of medical neglect” at U.S. detention centers. Internal administration data obtained by Legum suggested that ICE has potentially accrued hundreds of millions of dollars of unpaid medical claims. In 2024, the VA processed $246.42 million in medical claims, but despite a significant increase in the detainee population, the VA processed only $157.2 million in claims in 2025. “Assuming the medical needs of a typical ICE detainee remain constant, the data suggests nearly a $300 million gap between needed care from third-party providers and what ICE paid,” Legum wrote. “This gap is a combination of unpaid bills since October 3 and ICE detainees who are simply being denied necessary medical treatment.” As ICE has upended health care access for immigrants in detention, national detentions have hit record levels, and the numbers of people dying in ICE custody have risen with them. Seven immigrants died in ICE custody in December, making it the deadliest month since Donald Trump returned to the White House. And 2025 was the deadliest year for immigrants in detention since 2004. So far, January is on track to be even worse: At least six people have already died in ICE custody this year, including one man who reportedly was choked to death by an ICE agent. At a Tuesday afternoon press conference, President Trump was asked just how far he’d be willing to go to acquire Greenland. His response: “You’ll find out.” His apparent threat only further reinforces what has been feared for weeks—that Trump will completely fracture U.S. diplomacy with the European Union, or worse, try to take over Greenland regardless of the risk or respect for sovereignty. Reporter: How far are you willing to go to acquire Greenland?Trump: You’ll find out pic.twitter.com/oPLJNc1vvM “If a consequence of your determination to take control of Greenland is the ultimate breakup of the NATO alliance, is that a price you’re willing to pay?” a reporter followed up later in the press conference. “I think something’s gonna happen that’s gonna be very good for everybody. Nobody’s done more for NATO than I have.... Getting them to go up to 5 percent of GDP was something that nobody thought was possible,” Trump replied. “I think that we will work something out where NATO’s gonna be very happy and we’re gonna be very happy. But we need it for security purposes.” Q: If a consequence of your determination to take control of Greenland is the ultimate breakup of the NATO alliance, is that a price you're willing to pay?TRUMP: That's very interesting. I think something's gonna happen that's going to be very good for everybody. Nobody has… pic.twitter.com/R3emyw2lAO That notion of happiness was quickly questioned, as well. “Mr. President, you said you’re confident something’s gonna get worked out in Greenland, but Greenlanders have made it clear they don’t wanna be part of the U.S. What gives the U.S. the right to take away that self determination—” “When I speak to them, I’m sure they’ll be thrilled.” Q: If a consequence of your determination to take control of Greenland is the ultimate breakup of the NATO alliance, is that a price you're willing to pay?TRUMP: That's very interesting. I think something's gonna happen that's going to be very good for everybody. Nobody has… pic.twitter.com/R3emyw2lAO While Democrats and even some Republicans are perplexed and alarmed by Trump’s imperialistic goals, others have thrown their full weight behind them. As Trump himself promised, it seems like only a matter of time before this situation escalates further. Two employees of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency may have been misusing Social Security data. The Social Security Administration referred two DOGE employees to the Justice Department for being in contact with an advocacy group that hopes to “overturn election results in certain states,” Politico reports, citing court documents. One of them allegedly signed an agreement that could have involved using Social Security data to match with state voter rolls. The SSA referred the two employees for violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from using their jobs for political purposes, according to DOJ official Elizabeth Shapiro. The court filings, disclosed Friday, were part of a list of “corrections” on testimony from SSA officials in the legal fight over DOGE gaining access to Social Security data. The disclosures also show that DOGE team members shared information on unauthorized third-party servers and could have accessed data prohibited by court orders at the time. Shapiro said that two employees referred to the DOJ were the only known members involved with the political group, which wasn’t identified in court papers. “At this time, there is no evidence that SSA employees outside of the involved members of the DOGE Team were aware of the communications with the advocacy group. Nor were they aware of the ‘Voter Data Agreement,’” Shapiro wrote, noting that it’s unclear whether the two DOGE employees actually shared data with the group. However, Shapiro said emails “suggest that DOGE Team members could have been asked to assist the advocacy group by accessing SSA data to match to the voter rolls.” The news seems to confirm some of the fears surrounding DOGE’s access to sensitive government information: that the data could be used for illegal and nefarious purposes. DOGE’s access went far beyond the SSA to different government agencies including the Department of Education, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department. Who knows if Musk and DOGE are also using that information illegally? It’s been exactly one year since Donald Trump returned to the nation’s highest office. To mark the occasion, the president secured quality time in front of some of America’s top journalists Tuesday to, apparently, do little other than to talk to himself. Trump joined the White House press briefing, sidling up alongside press secretary Karoline Leavitt with a large stack of papers that turned out to be more prop than speech. But it was the content of Trump’s remarks—or rather, lack thereof—that caused some onlookers to question whether the president was in a healthy state of mind. “Hm, I’m just looking at these charges, it’s just pretty incredible,” Trump said, rifling through the stack of papers, intermittently pausing to hold a page up to the camera. “Many murderers. Many, many murderers. People that murdered.” The president did not stop to name names, or to clarify which people he was targeting in his scrambled monologue, but the entries followed a general template that read at the top: “Minnesota: worst of worst.” Trump continued to read names and lists of charges, sometimes without even looking at the camera. Instead, it appeared he was simply reading brand-new information aloud to himself. folks, this is some really weird shit. the president is not well. pic.twitter.com/IQHcbM7mtl Mass protests have kicked off in Minnesota since ICE agents shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother and U.S. citizen, on January 7. Since then, federal officers have ripped people from their homes and families, pulled over school buses, attacked teachers and students at a Minneapolis high school, and even clashed with local law enforcement. In response, some protesters have opted to openly carry their firearms through the city, brandishing their Second Amendment right to bear arms. Locals have formed neighborhood watches to follow ICE vehicles, banging pots and pans and screaming to alert others when agents enter their residential neighborhoods. Local politicians—including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—have advised the federal agency to exit their cities and state, arguing that ICE and Border Patrol agents have done more harm than good. In 2025, before Good’s death, the agency killed 32 people—its deadliest year in more than two decades. But rather than heed the warning, the Trump administration has opted to up the ante, issuing grand jury subpoenas to Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, while placing 1,500 active-duty troops on standby for a potential invasion of Minnesota. “I’m going through this because I think we have plenty of time. I’m going to a place—beautiful place—in Switzerland, where I’m sure I’m very happily waited for,” Trump rambled. “In Switzerland they don’t know about this. They have other problems, but they don’t have this problem.” “Look,” Trump said, holding up another page. “Killed someone.”

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Andrew Porter and Robbie Henshaw will miss the start of Ireland's Guinness Six Nations campaign, after both players were left out of the 37-man squad by head coach Andy Farrell. The pair miss out due to injury, with Porter struggling with a calf issue, and Henshaw suffering a knee injury in Leinster's Investec Champions Cup win against Bayonne on Saturday. The IRFU have also confirmed that Leinster's Ryan Baird, Jimmy O'Brien, Jordan Larmour and Paddy McCarthy haven't been considered due to injury, as well as Ulster's Cormac Izuchukwu, Munster's Calvin Nash, and Connacht's Shayne Bolton and Mack Hansen.

BTC joined a broader risk-asset bounce near the Wall Street open, while Trump’s World Economic Forum comments revived expectations for US crypto market-structure reform. Cointelegraph in your social feed Bitcoin (BTC) sought a $90,000 reclaim around Wednesday’s Wall Street open as US President Donald Trump pledged to sign pro-crypto legislation. Key points: Trump breathes modest gains into BTC price action with his World Economic Forum speech. Pro-crypto legislation is back on the table in the US, but Japanese bond issues temper market enthusiasm. Bitcoin setting new 2026 lows may be “good” in the long term, according to analysis. Data from TradingView showed daily BTC price gains reaching 1.7% as Trump took to the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “To unleash innovation and savings and financing I’m also working to ensure America remains the crypto capital of the world, and to that end I signed the landmark Genius Act into law,” Trump said. Special Address by Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), President of the United States of America (@POTUS @whitehouse) with @borgebrende and Laurence D. Fink (@BlackRock) #WEF26 https://t.co/k0rVz5zK8J Trump also said that he would not use force to take over Greenland, a topic that stock markets welcomed, with the S&P 500 up 0.5% at the time of writing. “That stock market is going to be doubled,” he added about the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Trump’s words came as markets waited to see the full extent of EU trade retaliation over the Greenland issue. Across the world, Japanese bond markets, a topic to which crypto markets are traditionally sensitive, once more hit the headlines. “After decades of near-zero rates, 10-year Japanese bond yields have risen to around 2.29%, levels not seen since 1999,” trading company QCP Capital wrote on the topic in its latest Asia Color market update. “This shift is exposing deep fiscal vulnerabilities: government debt now exceeds ~240% of GDP, total debt stands near ¥1,342tn, and debt servicing is projected to absorb roughly a quarter of fiscal spending in 2026,” QPC Capital wrote, adding: Trading resource The Kobeissi Letter warned that Japanese government bond demand was “crashing.” “Japan's bond market crisis is deepening,” it wrote in an X post on the day. Earlier, Cointelegraph reported on round-trip BTC price action in January that took BTC/USD close to its 2026 starting position. Related: Bitcoin sharks scoop up BTC like it's 2013 despite 'perfect bull trap' In so doing, it closed a “gap” in CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market, leaving only gaps above price and a potential foundation for a sustained rebound. “$BTC has a solid buying wall. This shows that the support line is strong,” trader CW reported. Daan Crypto Trades advised monitoring the local lows, arguing that it would even be beneficial for BTC/USD to “wick below” the 2026 opening mark. $BTC Almost retested the yearly open on this flush lower.Still think that's a good area to watch closely. In my opinion, it would be good to have a bit of a wick below the yearly open so that it is at least taken out.Then from there we can see. https://t.co/YdmvnbZpio pic.twitter.com/tIFG3nWVdQ This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Title: Trump Seeks Immediate Negotiations for Greenland, Prosecutions for ‘Rigged’ 2020 Election in Davos Speech | Video

“What I’m asking for is a piece of ice, cold and poorly located, that can play a vital role in world peace and world protection. It’s a very small ask,” the president tells the World Economic Forum President Donald Trump reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland during his special address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, arguing the territory is vital for U.S. national security and vowing to build a Golden Dome missile defense shield on it. “All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland,” he said. “What I’m asking for is a piece of ice, cold and poorly located, that can play a vital role in world peace and world protection. It’s a very small ask compared to what we have given them for many, many decades. But the problem with NATO is that we’ll be there for them 100%, but I’m not sure that they’d be there for us if we gave them the call.” Trump’s long, rambling speech before world leaders and the global business elite hit on familiar gripes, like windmills and the “crooked” news media, and featured a flurry of boasts. But the most anticipated part of it revolved around Greenland given Trump’s stated ambitions for the U.S. to take over the semiautonomous Danish territory. (Trump also mentioned “Iceland” several times when he presumably meant Greenland.) “All we want from Denmark for national and international security and to keep our very energetic and dangerous potential enemies at bay is this land on which we’re going to build the greatest Golden Dome ever built. We’re building a Golden Dome that’s going to, just by its very nature, going to be defending Canada,” Trump added. “Canada gets a lot of freebies from us, by the way, they should be grateful also, but they’re not. I watched your Prime Minister yesterday, he wasn’t so grateful. They should be grateful to U.S., Canada. Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark [Carney], the next time you make your statements.” Trump’s reference to Carney follows the Canadian prime minister’s stirring speech one day earlier, in which he spoke of a global “rupture,” in which “the rules-based order is fading,” and “the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must.” Carney called for “the middle powers must act together because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu.” In Wednesday’s speech, Trump said he had “tremendous respect for both the people of Greenland and the people of Denmark,” but “every NATO ally has an obligation to be able to defend their own territory.” He suggested the U.S. is the only nation that can secure Greenland. “We’re a great power, much greater than people even understand. I think they found that out two weeks ago in Venezuela. We saw this in World War II, when Denmark fell to Germany after just six hours of fighting and was totally unable to defend either itself or Greenland,” he said. “So the United States was then compelled. We did it. We felt an obligation to do it, to send our own forces to hold the Greenland territory and hold it. We did at great cost and expense. They didn’t have a chance of getting on it, and they tried.” “So they have a choice: You can say yes and we will be very appreciative, or you can say no and we will remember,” Trump said. Elsewhere in his 80-minute speech, the president falsely claimed the 2020 election, which he lost decisively to Joe Biden, was “rigged” and promised prosecutions to come. “It was a rigged election. Everybody now knows that. They found out. People will soon be prosecuted for what they did. It’s probably breaking news, but it should be. It was a rigged election. Can’t have rigged elections. You need strong borders, strong elections and ideally a good press,” Trump said. But the news media, he said, is “terrible,” “very crooked” and “very biased.” He said that “some day it’ll straighten out because it’s losing all credibility.” After being introduced as “the most important leader in the world” by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, the United States president recapped the first year of his second term, complete with references to “Sleepy” Joe Biden, a failing Europe, the Radical Left, international tariffs, Chinese windmills, Los Angeles and Minnesota. At one point, he took a shot at Rep. Ilhan Omar, who he called a “fake Congressperson” from “a country that’s not a country.” Omar was born in war-torn Somalia and her family immigrated to the U.S. in the 1990s, eventually settling in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Trump also touted an executive order “banning large institutional investors from buying single family homes,” capping credit card interest rates at 10% and keeping AI advancement in the United States. “We should be paying the lowest interest rate of everybody. Without us, most of the countries don’t even work. And then you have the protection factor. Without our military, which is the greatest in the world by far, without our military, you have threats that you wouldn’t believe,” he stated. “You don’t have threats because of us. That’s because of NATO.” “Some of you are the greatest leaders anywhere in the world. You’re the greatest brains anywhere in the world,” he concluded. “The future is unlimited and to a large part, because of you, and we have to protect you and we have to cherish you. I always say we have to cherish our brilliant people, because there aren’t many of them.”

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2026 6:42:25 AM PST by MtnClimber A large U.S. delegation, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio are traveling with President Trump tonight to Davos. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and all of the key members of the cabinet are already there. According to the official WEF schedule, President Donald Trump’s address is in the mid‑afternoon Wednesday January 21, with the Davos session set for 2:30 to 3:15 p.m. local time (8:30 to 9:15 a.m. ET). The entire world will be watching this speech considering the geopolitical events of the past year, the current trajectory of global relationships that has been scrambled by President Trump, and anticipation of this moment being the inflection point in Western political history. On the tech side, all of the information bots under the control of Canada, the U.K, Australia and the global intelligence apparatus will be turned on to control and shape internet opinion of President Trump’s speech. The need for control is a reaction to fear. Do not discount the stakes at play; this is beyond the trillions – this is everything. For the opposition to President Trump this is a zero-sum conflict. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent held a press conference earlier today to absorb and address some of the key questions from the international media assembly [Bessent video at link]. Combined with feedback from Secretary Lutnick and USTR Greer, the speech content is being finalized on the flight between President Trump and Secretary Rubio. Trump’s Davos schedule, via the White House. Depart DC Tuesday evening Wednesday in Davos: 2:10 PM – 8:10 am ET – Greets WEF leadership 2:30 PM – 8:30 am ET – Delivers his Davos speech 3:45 PM – 9:45 am ET – Bilats and meetings 5:25 PM – 11:25 am ET – Business reception Thursday 10:30 AM – 4:30 am ET – Board of Peace Charter Announcement Then back home.

January 21, 2026 08:30 ET | Source: Deal Engine Deal Engine NEW YORK and LONDON, Jan. 21, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Filament Syfter, a pioneering, category-defining dealmaking data platform that empowers private market dealmakers to unify data and unleash AI, announced today it is rebranding to Deal Engine. Since 2016, the company has partnered with private equity and investment banking firms to overcome a perennial private markets challenge: UI fatigue from fragmented data across multiple sources that limits deal flow, insight, and action. This new corporate identity both nods to the company’s deep expertise in private markets Data Engineering and celebrates their productization of and rapid response to the industry’s demand for data engines. Private equity firms have spent the last decade adopting new workflows and introducing new data streams, but now struggle to unify the firm’s data ecosystem. The reality of today’s fast-paced dealmaking environment is that a firm requires access to world-class data sources from leading providers, the firm’s own CRM and document management data and intelligence, and unstructured public information from websites, external news, RSS feeds, social media, events, and other sources in a moment’s notice. Deal Engine’s platform not only brings all this data together, it enables AI to automatically locate and validate deal intelligence on the firm’s behalf, in accordance with all the investment theses across the platform and portfolio. Phil Westcott, CEO and Founder of Deal Engine, shared, “We saw early that private equity firms were struggling to harness AI for their deal sourcing and market coverage. The challenge typically comes down to data engineering—our forte. With 10 years of PE data engineering experience, we’ve productized the architecture and tooling that dramatically accelerates the build, training, and deployment of proprietary data engines in a fraction of the time taken for a self-build. Our new name, Deal Engine, is a bold statement of intent, announcing ourselves as the category pioneer, the market leader in PE data engines.” The firm was founded by Westcott, a former Director of IBM Watson, and a world-class team of data engineers, natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and large language model (LLM) professionals all dedicated to the challenges of private market data.​ At the heart of Deal Engine is its ability to: Deal Engine is helping firms source deals both on and off-market. The technology supports dealmakers to build conviction on a target while nurturing relationships and accelerating deal progression. Their top tier private equity clients are also benefiting from market monitoring of intermediaries, portfolio companies and LPs, enabling all private equity roles to gain a competitive advantage in the market. Deal Engine’s Recent MilestonesExcitement and interest in the company’s business model have grown, following a $4.8M Series A funding round led by FINTOP Capital last summer. The firm has quietly become an indispensable partner to a host of leading firms in the US, Europe and Asia. While some prefer to keep their underlying tech a secret to the market, notable named clients include Astorg, Inflexion, and Cavendish. The sense of mystery has led to some industry commentators describing Deal Engine as the "best kept secret in PE." As part of the firm’s enterprise growth, it has opened a New York office and hired two senior sales leads in North America - Alex Bajdechi as Global VP of Sales and Steve Kolatec, Senior Sales Executive, North America - both with extensive industry experience at firms such as Preqin, Intapp/DealCloud, Salesforce, and BlackRock to help it scale quickly with private equity firms and investment banks in North America. It is also investing in amplifying its product, research and development, marketing, and communications profile with paid media, print, video content development, webinars, and event sponsorships. About Deal Engine (formerly Filament Syfter)Deal Engine is the first and only leading dealmaking data engine provider, purpose-built for private markets dealmakers. This new technology enables firms to centralize, enrich, and institutionalize market, proprietary and public data. Increase dealmaker efficacy, improve resource allocation, enhance relationships, and originate the best-fit deals across platform investments and a firm’s portfolio with Deal Engine.

Title: Microsoft CEO says AI needs to have a wider impact or else it risks quickly losing ‘social permission’ — also says that the technology should benefit more people to avoid a bubble

Satya Nadella talked about how AI should benefit people and how it can avoid a bubble. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in an interview during the 2026 World Economic Forum annual meeting that artificial intelligence needs to have a wider impact or else it risks losing “social permission,” especially given the amount of energy and other resources that AI data centers consume. Nadella made this comment during his talk with Laurance D. Fink, CEO and chairperson of BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world, that has been shared on YouTube. The two company heads were talking about AI diffusion, with Fink asking, “Can you describe how this process of diffusion across economies, across companies, across people, and countries? How does that play out?” “The zeitgeist is a little bit about the admiration for AI in its abstract form or as technology. But I think we, as a global community, have to get to a point where we are using it to do something that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,” Nadella said. “Otherwise, I don’t think this makes much sense, right? In fact, I would say we will quickly lose even the social permission to actually take something like energy, which is a scarce resource, and use it to generate these tokens, if these tokens are not improving health outcomes, education outcomes, public sector efficiency, private sector competitiveness across all sectors, small and large. And that, to me, is ultimately the goal.” The rush to build AI infrastructure is putting a strain on many different resources. For example, we’re in the middle of a memory chip shortage because of the massive demand for HBM that AI GPUs require. It’s estimated that data centers will consume 70% of memory chips made this year, with the shortage going beyond RAM modules and SSDs and starting to affect other components and products like GPUs and smartphones. There’s also the increased demand for electricity, which is causing prices to spike by 36% in some states and wholesale prices to soar by up to 267% over the past 5 years. The high-performance AI processors in data centers also require a lot of water for cooling, with AI data centers reportedly using more water than the amount of bottled water people drank globally in one year. It has gotten to a point that U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle have taken notice, with Democratic Senators demanding an explanation from big tech companies about their energy usage and President Donald Trump telling AI tech companies to “pay their own way” when it comes to their electricity consumption. Microsoft is actually taking steps to make its AI data centers more palatable to its neighbors with its “Community-First AI Infrastructure” framework, and OpenAI has also followed suit. However, it is still an open question whether other hyperscalers will follow suit. Aside from talking about the impact of AI on people, the two industry leaders also covered the AI bubble. Many industry leaders and institutions are warning about an AI bubble, especially as tech companies are continually pouring money into its development while only seeing limited benefits. “For this not to be a bubble, by definition, it requires that the benefits of this [technology] are much more evenly spread. I mean, I think, a tell-tale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we’re talking about are the tech firms,” said the Microsoft chief. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side, then it’s just purely supply side.” He then gave an example of how AI tech is being used in the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs, wherein it was used to accelerate the clinical trial. Nadella even emphasized that AI wasn’t used to discover the “magical molecule” — instead, it was used for all the other things needed “to make something much more relevant.” Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. “That’s why I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, and bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world — not just economic growth driven by capital expenses.” Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News, or add us as a preferred source, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.

Posted on 01/21/2026 5:11:02 AM PST by Navy Patriot European opposition ⁠to President Donald Trump's bid to acquire Greenland and his proposed "Board of Peace" initiative has disrupted plans for an economic support package for postwar Ukraine, the Financial Times reported ‍on Wednesday. A planned announcement of an $800 billion prosperity ‍plan to be agreed between Ukraine, Europe, and the U.S. at the World Economic Forum ⁠in Davos this week has been delayed, the report said, citing six officials. Reuters could not immediately verify ​the report. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. "Nobody is in any mood to stage ‍a grand spectacle around an agreement with Trump right now," ⁠one official told the FT, adding that disputes over Greenland and the Board of Peace had overtaken an earlier focus on Ukraine at the Davos meeting. Tensions over Greenland disrupted ⁠negotiations on the prosperity ​plan text this ⁠week, the FT report said, adding that the U.S. did not send ‍a representative to a key meeting on Monday evening. The "prosperity plan" was not ‌being shelved indefinitely and could still be signed at a later date, the newspaper added. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy ⁠said on ​Tuesday that he would ‍travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a ‍prosperity plan were ready to be signed there.

That number is now about $18 billion. The EU promise of money has to cover that, with most of the rest of that committed promise earmarked for purchase of weapons from European firms, not American firms, assuming those European firms can actually build the weapons without access to neodymium magnets. The second somewhat surprising money event has to do with Russia moving all of its foreign reserves into gold. This happened over the course of 2025 so the advance in gold has generated substantial profit. As of December 2025 evaluation is on the order of 320 billion dollars in Russian gold reserves. This exceeds the assets currently frozen by European factions. 11 posted on 01/21/2026 5:39:57 AM PST by Owen [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: Navy Patriot; bert; tlozo As Trump said: Russia is losing soldiers at an unprecedented level, 17 to 1. Ukraine just got 90 billion from the EU. Therefore it can continue the war for many more years. RUssia is trapped in a quagmire of its own making and barely survives thanks to massive Chinese subsidies and thousands of Communist North Korean troops. Russia’s gold reserves are now being progressively sold. Its economy was supposed to steam at 4.5%.... but it’s down to 1.1% instead (growth) and it’s still going down into a stagflation or recession... we’ll know shortly. Ukraine is destroying Russia’s refinery infrastructure, blackouts in Moscow many times this last month. Ukraine know has Europe’s most potent army. Russia can only aim at civilians in Ukraine. It doesn’t seem capable of doing anything more... while its army gets decimated. 12 posted on 01/21/2026 5:48:13 AM PST by USA-FRANCE (Silence against evil isn't neutrality, it's complicity.

Ther are a multiplicity of factors (some foreign; some domestic) that can make treaties inoperable. 19 posted on 01/21/2026 6:15:16 AM PST by Ozymandias Ghost [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 15 | View Replies] To: USA-FRANCE Quite likely, Russia’s biggest problem is the direct sanctions Trump slapped on Russian oil companies, abetted by seizures of ships with improper registries, former dealings with Iran, etc. Plus, there’s the global oil glut, with many tankers, legit and not, being used for floating storage. Charter rates for tankers carrying Russian oil have gone through the roof, and if the ship is just sitting as storage somewhere, that’s disastrous. Russian oil exports (actual deliveries) were down to 3.6 million bpd last month (their figures) and the effective price (less transport costs) has dropped to near $35 / barrel. Not always recognized in the nominal figures one can look up online is that buyers have to pay the cost of the oil plus transport costs: If transport costs a fortune, the nominal oil price gets discounted at some point, so the total is still competitive. The charter companies are grinning ear to ear. If people think the defense companies are making a nice profit... Russia is still stealing gold out of Sudan, so they have some income there. Our USS Lincoln strike force, a couple days away from the ME, has itself gone dark — it seems increasingly likely Trump is going to whack Iran after all. I’d think that included in that will be pasting drone and missile facilities and storage, plus launchers, in addition to decapitation strikes. The Ukies will shed no tears. OTOH, Russia’s attempt to freeze out Kyiv and other major Ukie cities (meets the definition of genocide) has been somewhat effective. The Ukies have responded and caused blackouts scattered around in western Russia, but Ukraine does not have nearly enough capacity to create lengthy large scale outages, as Russia has. Ukraine badly needs about $15 billion in electric power generators to create a very widely dispersed source for electricity, to replace much of their grid. I’m a bit surprised that Ukraine’s supporters in the US House and Senate have not proposed a “matching supply” program for generators, with Europe. Ie., we match the amount of generation Europe donates. Trump would look really bad in the eyes of most US voters to veto such a bill. 20 posted on 01/21/2026 6:25:29 AM PST by Paul R.

That number is now about $18 billion. The EU promise of money has to cover that, with most of the rest of that committed promise earmarked for purchase of weapons from European firms, not American firms, assuming those European firms can actually build the weapons without access to neodymium magnets. The second somewhat surprising money event has to do with Russia moving all of its foreign reserves into gold. This happened over the course of 2025 so the advance in gold has generated substantial profit. As of December 2025 evaluation is on the order of 320 billion dollars in Russian gold reserves. This exceeds the assets currently frozen by European factions. 11 posted on 01/21/2026 5:39:57 AM PST by Owen [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: Navy Patriot; bert; tlozo As Trump said: Russia is losing soldiers at an unprecedented level, 17 to 1. Ukraine just got 90 billion from the EU. Therefore it can continue the war for many more years. RUssia is trapped in a quagmire of its own making and barely survives thanks to massive Chinese subsidies and thousands of Communist North Korean troops. Russia’s gold reserves are now being progressively sold. Its economy was supposed to steam at 4.5%.... but it’s down to 1.1% instead (growth) and it’s still going down into a stagflation or recession... we’ll know shortly. Ukraine is destroying Russia’s refinery infrastructure, blackouts in Moscow many times this last month. Ukraine know has Europe’s most potent army. Russia can only aim at civilians in Ukraine. It doesn’t seem capable of doing anything more... while its army gets decimated. 12 posted on 01/21/2026 5:48:13 AM PST by USA-FRANCE (Silence against evil isn't neutrality, it's complicity.

Charter rates for tankers carrying Russian oil have gone through the roof, and if the ship is just sitting as storage somewhere, that’s disastrous. Russian oil exports (actual deliveries) were down to 3.6 million bpd last month (their figures) and the effective price (less transport costs) has dropped to near $35 / barrel. Not always recognized in the nominal figures one can look up online is that buyers have to pay the cost of the oil plus transport costs: If transport costs a fortune, the nominal oil price gets discounted at some point, so the total is still competitive. The charter companies are grinning ear to ear. If people think the defense companies are making a nice profit... Russia is still stealing gold out of Sudan, so they have some income there. Our USS Lincoln strike force, a couple days away from the ME, has itself gone dark — it seems increasingly likely Trump is going to whack Iran after all. I’d think that included in that will be pasting drone and missile facilities and storage, plus launchers, in addition to decapitation strikes. The Ukies will shed no tears. OTOH, Russia’s attempt to freeze out Kyiv and other major Ukie cities (meets the definition of genocide) has been somewhat effective. The Ukies have responded and caused blackouts scattered around in western Russia, but Ukraine does not have nearly enough capacity to create lengthy large scale outages, as Russia has. Ukraine badly needs about $15 billion in electric power generators to create a very widely dispersed source for electricity, to replace much of their grid. I’m a bit surprised that Ukraine’s supporters in the US House and Senate have not proposed a “matching supply” program for generators, with Europe. Ie., we match the amount of generation Europe donates. Trump would look really bad in the eyes of most US voters to veto such a bill. 20 posted on 01/21/2026 6:25:29 AM PST by Paul R.

Title: “Largest Infrastructure Buildout In Human History”: Jensen Huang on AI’s “Five-Layer Cake” at Davos
URL: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/davos-wef-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-jensen-huang/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T12:50:16Z
Full Content:
From skilled trades to startups, AI’s rapid expansion is the beginning of the next massive computing platform shift, and for the world’s workforce, a move from tasks to purpose. At a packed mainstage session at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang described artificial intelligence as the foundation of what he called “the largest infrastructure buildout in human history,” driving job creation across the global economy. Speaking with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Huang framed AI not as a single technology but as a “a five-layer cake,” spanning energy, chips and computing infrastructure, cloud data centers, AI models and, ultimately, the application layer. Because every layer of AI’s five-layer stack must be built and operated, Huang said the platform shift is creating jobs across the economy — from energy and construction to advanced manufacturing, cloud operations and application development. The application layer might focus on integrating AI into financial services, healthcare or manufacturing. “This layer on top, ultimately, is where economic benefit will happen,” Huang said. From energy and power generation to chip manufacturing, data center construction and cloud operations, Huang said the AI buildout is already creating demand for skilled labor. He added that the largest economic benefit will come from the application layer, where AI is transforming industries such as healthcare, manufacturing and financial services — and changing the nature of work across the economy. Huang pointed to venture capital investment as a signal of how quickly AI is reshaping the global economy. He said 2025 was one of the largest years for VC funding on record, with most of that capital flowing to what he described as “AI-native companies.” These firms span healthcare, robotics, manufacturing and financial services — industries where, Huang said, “for the first time, the models are good enough to build on top of.” That investment, Huang said, is translating directly into jobs. He highlighted demand for plumbers, electricians, construction workers, steelworkers, network technicians and teams responsible for installing and operating advanced equipment. AI, Huang said, likely won’t destroy jobs. Instead, it’s increasing demand in fields such as radiology, and helping handle administrative work in fields impacted by labor shortages — such as nursing. AI has become a key tool in radiology, he said, yet there are now more radiologists than ever. “If you reason from first principles, not surprisingly, the number of radiologists has gone up,” Huang said. He explained that the purpose of a radiologist’s job is to diagnose disease and help patients, while studying scans is just one task. “The fact that they’re able to study scans now infinitely fast allows them to spend more time with patients,” he said, adding that AI enables greater interaction with patients and other clinicians. And because they can also see more patients, there’s a need for more radiologists. Huang said the same dynamic is playing out in nursing. The U.S. faces a shortage of roughly 5 million nurses, in part because nurses spend nearly half their time on charting and documentation. “Now they can use AI to do the charting and the transcription of patient visits,” he said, pointing to work being done by companies such as Abridge and its partners. As productivity improves, Huang said, outcomes improve as well. “Hospitals do better, and they hire more nurses,” he said. “Surprisingly — or not surprisingly — AI is increasing productivity and, as a result, hospitals want to hire more people.” To illustrate the broader point, Huang joked that if someone simply watched him and Fink doing their jobs, “you would probably think the two of us are typists.” Automating typing, he said, would not eliminate their jobs because that task is not their purpose. AI helps with tasks, enabling people to fulfill their purpose and become more productive, making workers more valuable. “So the question is, what is the purpose of your job?” Huang said. Huang framed AI as essential national infrastructure. “AI is infrastructure,” he said, arguing that every country should treat AI like electricity or roads. “You should have AI as part of your infrastructure.” He urged countries to build their own AI capabilities, drawing on local language and culture. “Develop your AI, continue to refine it and have your national intelligence be part of your ecosystem,” he said. Fink asked whether only the most educated people can use or benefit from AI. Huang countered that idea, emphasizing that AI’s rapid adoption stems from its accessibility. “AI is super easy to use — it’s the easiest software to use in history,” he said, noting that in just two to three years, AI tools have reached nearly a billion people. As a result, Huang said AI literacy is becoming essential. “It is very clear that it is essential to learn how to use AI — how to direct it, manage it, guardrail it, evaluate it,” he said, comparing those skills to leadership and people management. For developing countries, Huang said AI offers a chance to narrow long-standing technology gaps. “AI is likely to close the technology divide,” he said, citing its accessibility and abundance. Turning to Europe, Huang highlighted manufacturing and industrial strength as a major advantage. “You don’t write AI — you teach AI,” he said, urging countries to fuse industrial capability with artificial intelligence to unlock physical AI and robotics. “Robotics is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” he said, particularly for nations with strong industrial bases. Fink summarized the discussion by saying that what he heard suggested the world is far from an AI bubble. Instead, he posed a different question: Are we investing enough? Huang agreed, saying large investments are required because “we have to build the infrastructure necessary for all of the layers of AI above it.” The opportunity, he said, “is really quite extraordinary, and everybody ought to get involved.” He reiterated that 2025 was the largest year for global VC investment, with more than $100 billion deployed worldwide, most of it into AI-native startups. “These companies are building the application layer above,” Huang said, “and they’re going to need infrastructure — and investment — to build this future.” Fink added that broad participation in that growth is critical. “I actually believe it’s going to be a great investment for pension funds around the world to be a part of that, to grow with this AI world,” Fink said. “We need to make sure that the average pensioner and the average saver is part of that growth. If they’re just watching it from the sidelines, they’re going to feel left out.” Featured image courtesy of World Economic Forum.

Title: Could Dublin be the new Davos?

The great and good from the worlds of business and politics are meeting this week in the Swiss mountain top resort of Davos for the World Economic Forum. Donald Trump’s tough stance on Greenland, threatening tariffs on eight European countries has overshadowed the whole event and he is due to speak there in the late afternoon on Wednesday. If Larry Fink has his way, this might be one of the last times that Davos hosts the WEF jamboree, having been its home since its foundation in 1971. In a blog post that caught delegates off guard, Fink, BlackRock chair and interim co-chair of the WEF’s governing board, suggested moving the summit permanently from Davos or using venues on a rotational basis. And among the locations discussed was none other than Dublin. According to the Financial Times, Fink wants to reshape the forum, which has been widely criticised as too elitist and out of touch. The WEF should “start doing something new: showing up – and listening – in the places where the modern world is actually built”, Fink said in his blog post. [ Dublin in running as World Economic Forum weighs moving flagship event from DavosOpens in new window ] “Davos, yes. But also places like Detroit and Dublin – and cities like Jakarta and Buenos Aires.” The prospect of WEF coming to Dublin would have tourism chiefs and hospitality owners here rubbing their hands. It would be quite a coup for the city were it to happen, albeit it would come at a high cost. Could Dublin realistically host WEF? Davos is a small resort, with limited accommodation. Many of those attending WEF have to stay in neighbouring towns and cities and face long commutes each day. Web Summit quit our capital city a decade ago, citing infrastructure constraints among its reasons for decamping to Lisbon (there was, of course, also the small matter of huge financial incentives offered by the Portuguese authorities). Some 3,000 delegates attend Davos, including 120 political leaders. But that’s only the tip of the iceberg. About 5,000 Swiss army personnel are committed to the event, along with local and canton police officers. There is also a battalion of media, a large contingent of private security operatives, along with catering workers and others who staff the event. It’s a huge logistical operation. Easily 10,000-plus people across the week. On paper, Dublin could accommodate the event. There are about 25,000 hotel bedrooms in Dublin, which in January would have an occupancy level of around 70 per cent, according to hospitality sources. So that’s 7,500 spare rooms normally. According to its website, the Convention Centre Dublin can host just shy of 3,600 delegates theatre-style in its ground floor forum space and it has 22 rooms that could accommodate media, and various panels and break out sessions. However, that’s only part of the story. Davos essentially goes into lockdown for the duration of the event, with tight restrictions on access to the resort. Closing off one side of Dublin’s quays for a week would paralyse the city’s traffic and severely compromise access to the port. Then there’s the high-level security operation required for political leaders. The Swiss military is years ahead of Ireland in terms of its ability to manage such a vast operation. Ireland would also no doubt have to write a big cheque to secure Davos for Dublin. The WEF’s brand is tightly tied to Davos and the original rationale for hosting it high in the Alps was to get leaders out of their bubbles and away from the masses. That was an age before the internet and the extensive transport and telecoms connectivity that now exists in our always-on society. The Swiss will be loath to give it up. So the odds of in moving out of Davos, never mind relocating to Dublin, are low. But if Millstreet can host the Eurovision anything is possible.

Title: Nvidia's Jensen Huang says it's a good time to be a plumber — and not just because it's an AI-proof job

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Is AI coming for your job? If you work in construction or plumbing, that's perhaps not a question you need to worry about. Speaking at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said it was a great time to be a tradesperson because the AI boom is creating demand for manual labor to build data centers. "It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft and we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers," he said in a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in Davos, Switzerland. Huang described the AI boom as the "largest infrastructure buildout in human history" that would create "a lot of jobs." AI's impact on the labor market has been a hot topic at Davos this year. Huang has long argued that AI won't be the mass job killer some believe it will be. He has given radiology as an example: while AI has automated some of the tasks radiologists do, the number of jobs in the field has actually increased. AI "Godfather" Geoffrey Hinton previously said he also believes manual labor is safer from AI, though for a different reason: it will take longer for AI to have the dexterity to take on more physical jobs. At Davos on Wednesday, Huang said the US was seeing a "significant boom" in demand for manual jobs helping build AI infrastructure, with salaries nearly doubling in some cases. "So we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories, and we have a great shortage in that," said Huang. He added: "Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a Ph.D. in computer science to do so." Jump to

Title: Annual house price growth eases to 6.6% in November - CSO
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2026/0121/1554269-cso-residential-property-figures/
Time Published: 2026-01-21T11:12:46Z

Residential property prices increased by 6.6% in the 12 months to November, easing from 7.2% in October, new figures from the Central Statistics Office show today. The CSO said that monthly house price growth for November was 0.3%. The October growth rate was revised to 7.2% from 7.3%, it added. Today's CSO figures show that property prices outside of Dublin continued to see bigger price increases than recorded in the capital, with a rise of 7.9% compared to an increase of 5% in Dublin. The CSO said that house prices in Dublin rose by 4.8% while apartment prices increased by 5.6%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Dublin City at 5.7% while Fingal saw a rise of 3.7%. Outside of Dublin, house prices were up by 7.7% and apartment prices rose by 10.5%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) at 13.8%, while at the other end of the scale, the Mid-West (Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary) and the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and Wexford) both saw a rise of 6%. The median price of a home bought in the 12 months to November 2025 was €384,000. The CSO said the highest median price for a home was €677,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €190,000 in Donegal. The most expensive Eircode area was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €830,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the cheapest price of €150,000. Today's figures also show that 4,074 home purchases were filed in November with Revenue Commissioners at a total value of €1.8 billion. These purchases were made up of 3,166 existing homes and 908 new homes. Revenue data shows there were 1,589 first-time buyer purchases in November, the CSO added. The CSO said that property prices nationally have increased by 176.2% from their trough in early 2013. Dublin residential property prices have risen by 170.7% from their February 2012 low, while residential property prices in the rest of Ireland are 190.5% higher than at their trough in May 2013. Trevor Grant, chairperson of Irish Mortgage Advisors, said the biggest driver of house price inflation is the shortage of homes coupled with the pent-up demand for housing and an expanding population. Mr Grant said that while the Government has consistently failed to meet its housing targets, figures released by the Department of Housing last week show that there were twice as much housing starts in December compared to November. "The sharp increase in housing starts last month could be a sign that the country is finally turning a corner on the housing crisis - though it's important that the Government builds on this momentum, particularly given that the 16,412 housing starts recorded for last year is the lowest number since 2016," he said. He also said that today's figures show that house price inflation continues to rise steeply in many rural areas - often surpassing that of Dublin. "The extent of house price inflation in many rural areas has led to frustration and despair for many locals as they are being increasingly priced out of their home towns and villages. Steep house price inflation in commuter counties such as Wicklow, Westmeath and Carlow has forced those seeking to buy in the commuter belt further afield," he stated. © RTÉ 2026.

Title: Dublin could host World Economic Forum, co-chair suggests

BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink. Photo: Bloomberg “Davos” should come to Dublin, according to businessman Larry Fink, who is currently co-chair of the World Economic Forum. Speaking at the launch of its annual meeting this week, Mr Fink suggested it is time the elite gathering of chief executives and business leaders spread its wings from the Swiss ski resort and held events in cities such as Dublin. “For 56 years, the World Economic Forum has been synonymous with Davos. And that’s likely to remain true for a while,” he said. “But you should also see WEF start doing something new: showing up – and listening – in the places where the modern world is actually built. Davos, yes. But also places like Detroit and Dublin, and cities like Jakarta and Buenos Aires. “The mountain will come down to earth.” The forum is at a crossroads after its founder, Klaus Schwab, stepped down last April following allegations about governance problems and financial misconduct. He was later cleared of misconduct. It is now under interim management, with Mr Fink, who is the chairman and chief executive of the investment management company BlackRock, acting as interim co-chair. This year’s forum has the biggest participation in Davos’ 56-year history, with an estimated 1,000 chief executives and board chairs cramming into the small Swiss resort. They are being joined by about 65 heads of state and government, including the Taoiseach. US president Donald Trump arrives today, creating an even bigger security headache than is usually the case. Access is another problem, with Davos being miles from anywhere, which means many of the wealthy delegates move in and out by helicopter. Addressing the gathering on Tuesday, Mr Fink challenged delegates as to whether anyone outside the room even cared about what was being discussed. “Because if we’re being honest, for many people this meeting feels out of step with the moment: elites in an age of populism, an established institution in an era of deep institutional distrust,” he said. “And there’s truth in that critique.” If the WEF is going to be useful, it has to regain trust, and that includes widening the conversation, and being more transparent and engaged with people who don’t feel represented. The forum can’t remain an echo chamber, Mr Fink warned, and it shouldn’t want to have panels where everyone agrees 95pc of the time. “Many of the people most affected by what we talk about here will never come to this conference. That’s the central tension of this forum: Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone,” he said. Raising the possibility of events in other cities, including Dublin, he promised the WEF was going to do more listening. Senior executives at the forum are actively considering whether it needs to change location, fearing that it has outgrown Davos, according to a report in the Financial Times. It said Mr Fink has privately discussed options such as moving the WEF permanently from Davos or using venues on a rotational basis. Among the locations discussed are said to have been Detroit and Dublin.

Title: Dublin in running as World Economic Forum weighs moving flagship event from Davos

Senior executives at the World Economic Forum (WEF) are weighing whether the organisation’s flagship annual meeting needs to change location, fearing the event has outgrown its traditional Alpine venue in Davos. Larry Fink, BlackRock chair and interim co-chair of the WEF’s governing board, has privately discussed options including moving the summit permanently from Davos or using venues on a rotational basis. Among the locations discussed were Detroit and Dublin. Fink wants to reshape the forum, which has been widely criticised as too elitist and out of touch, saying access should extend beyond the political and business leaders who usually attend its events, according to four people familiar with the talks. [ Macron accuses US of trying to ‘subordinate’ EuropeOpens in new window ] The WEF should “start doing something new: showing up – and listening – in the places where the modern world is actually built”, Fink said in a blog post on Monday. “Davos, yes. But also places like Detroit and Dublin – and cities like Jakarta and Buenos Aires.” While the WEF’s leadership continues to reaffirm Davos, the Swiss ski resort that has hosted the annual meeting for nearly six decades, as the event’s spiritual and practical home, there had also been internal acknowledgment of the setting’s increasing logistical and strategic challenges, two of the people added. The WEF “has outgrown” its capacity, said one senior executive who waited in traffic for three-and-a-half hours to enter the small skiing village for this week’s shindig. The debate over the location of the global gathering comes as the forum has evolved far beyond its early identity as a club for European management elites. Now the five-day summit regularly attracts tens of thousands of participants – both official invitees, including heads of state and executives from business and civil society, as well as the informal “houses” hosted by governments, companies and lobbying groups along Davos’s promenade and side streets. “It has become a victim of its own success,” said one person familiar with the conversations. Accommodation shortages, security costs and the limited physical infrastructure – a record attendance has already been reported for the current event – have been acknowledged by WEF officials as problematic. US president Donald Trump’s arrival on Wednesday is expected to further complicate the logistical challenges surrounding the summit. “It is important to the Swiss government that the WEF retains strong ties to Switzerland,” one of the people said, who added that keeping it in Europe was a priority for many senior forum executives. The discussions coincide with senior leadership changes at the WEF, with Fink and Roche vice-chair André Hoffmann stepping in as interim chairs of the governing board in August. WEF founder Klaus Schwab stepped down in April amid whistleblower allegations about financial misconduct and other governance problems. Last year’s investigation cleared Schwab of misconduct, finding no material wrongdoing or criminal conduct but some “irregularities”. But the saga forced a new page in the forum’s history, which has prompted the interim management to consider its future plans amid criticism it has lost relevance and caters too much to the elite. It is not the first time relocating the forum’s annual meetings has been suggested, while Schwab had also looked extensively at relocating the forum’s headquarters to Dubai several years ago. Officially, the forum remains supportive of Davos. WEF directors have publicly stressed the historical significance of the Alpine location, which also brings in crucial tourism revenue and investment. The Swiss government and some of its leading companies would also be likely to resist any move to relocate. “The Swiss would be very against a relocation: that will create hurdles,” a WEF official said, adding that any move “is not definite”. BlackRock and WEF did not respond to requests for comment. --Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2026 From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: This is what BlackRock's Larry Fink said about the AI bubble in Davos

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is the latest to push back on the idea that the artificial-intelligence boom is destined to pop like past manias. "I think there will be big failures, but I don't think we are in a bubble," said Fink on Wednesday during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Fink placed the wave of AI investment within a wider global competitive landscape, particularly between major economies. "I think for the Western economies, if we don't cooperate, if we don't scale, China wins," he said. Fink said that China's population size and different privacy regime could translate into a major data advantage. That dynamic, Fink argued, makes collaboration among the US and its allies essential. "I would much rather say that we need to spend more money to make sure that we're competing properly against China," he said. Still, Fink warned that the AI boom could disappoint if its benefits remain concentrated among a small group of dominant firms. "The key to that is making sure that the demand only comes if technology is diffused for more applications, more utilizations," he said. "If technology is just the domain of the six hyperscalers, we will fail," he added. Fink's comments came amid a broader debate about whether massive investments in AI are sending the stock markets into a bubble. Some leaders, including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have cautioned about overexcitement in AI — even as they acknowledge the technology's game-changing potential. Meanwhile, Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates said in late October that AI was in a bubble. Jump to

Nearly 400 people who say they are "a person of wealth" signed an open letter calling for global leaders to increase taxes on the superrich. Signatories of the letter, which was addressed to leaders at the World Economic Forum's Davos conference this week, include actor Mark Ruffalo, film producer and activist Abigail Disney, and musician Brian Eno. The letter said that a few ultrawealthy people are negatively influencing nearly every aspect of society. "A handful of global oligarchs with extreme wealth have bought up our democracies; taken over our governments; gagged the freedom of our media; placed a stranglehold on technology and innovation; deepened poverty and social exclusion; and accelerated the breakdown of our planet," the letter read. They said that higher taxes, on people — including themselves — was the solution. Every time Shubhangi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

"As our elected representatives—whether it's those of you at Davos, local councillors, city mayors, or regional leaders—it's your duty to deliver it," it said. "So tax us. Tax the super rich." The annual WEF conference has gathered some of the world's richest and most powerful people in the Swiss mountain town. Business Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near Davos, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. They included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Jets from companies like Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma also arrived in the area. In April, President Donald Trump said he wouldn't mind paying more in taxes himself, but he's not convinced that he should raise taxes on millionaires. "I think it would be very disruptive, because a lot of the millionaires would leave the country," Trump said. "The old days, they left states. They go from one state to the other. Now with transportation so quick and so easy, they leave countries." Trump said the US would "lose a lot of money" if the country raised taxes on millionaires. Oxfam reported this week that a record number of billionaires were created last year, bringing the global total to more than 3,000 for the first time. Billionaire wealth has increased by 81% since 2020, the study found. The tax petition was organized by the nonprofits Patriotic Millionaires, Millionaires for Humanity, and development charity Oxfam.

Title: Satoshi Nakamoto’s BTC stash – 17 years later, how much is it worth?

Seventeen years of untouched Bitcoin outweighs any single week of tariffs, sell-offs, or headline-driven volatility. The cryptocurrency market is currently caught between short-term global shocks and the long-term confidence of Bitcoin’s earliest holders. At the time of writing, Bitcoin [BTC] was trading at $89,490, down over 3% in the last 24 hours. Its latest drop was triggered by rising global trade concerns after U.S President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on eight European countries. While short-term traders moved money into safer assets like gold, blockchain data revealed that long-term Bitcoin holders remain confident. According to Arkham Intelligence, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin, has now held their original Bitcoin holdings for 17 years without moving them. What started at $0 in 2009 grew to $4,500 in 2010, $317,000 in 2011, $5.5 million in 2012, $14.5 million in 2013, and $827 million in 2014. Through every boom, crash, and headline since, all that Bitcoin has remained untouched. Today, 17 years later, Satoshi’s holdings are worth around $100 billion. This contrast highlights the current mood in the market. Even though retail investors might be nervous, exchange data seemed to suggest that the latest sell-off was not random. In fact, it looked more like a planned move by large players. Over the last 24 hours alone, some of the biggest players in the crypto industry moved large amounts of Bitcoin to exchanges at the same time. Source: X In total, more than 64,000 BTC was added to the sell side. This sudden hike in supply made it harder for Bitcoin’s price to move higher. When large institutions and market makers sell at the same time, it often points to a planned move rather than panic. These actions are usually meant to push the price lower, while also triggering stop-loss orders and forcing highly leveraged retail traders out of the market. And yet, despite short-term price swings, Bitcoin’s ownership remains heavily concentrated among long-term holders. According to Arkham Intelligence’s latest blog post, while the list of Bitcoin’s largest holders has been changing, the top spot remains the same. Satoshi Nakamoto is still the largest holder, with 1,096,358 BTC, or about 5.5% of the total supply. Following Satoshi’s lead is Coinbase, which holds 884,675 BTC, worth about $82 billion, or 4.4% of the total supply. BlackRock is third, with its holdings valued at $72 billion or 3.9% of supply. Strategy and the U.S government come in at 4th and 5th, with their holdings amounting to $38 billion and $30 billion, respectively. For its part, Tether has 96,369 BTC, representing approximately 0.48% of Bitcoin’s total supply. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s Dominance was strong with a reading of 59.76%. However, other on-chain datasets suggested that retail investors may be becoming less active. In fact, the 7-day average of active Bitcoin addresses has been declining since October 2025’s price peak. Source: The Block In the past, this has usually meant that smaller investors were reducing activity due to fear or uncertainty. However, this trend often happens just before institutions take a bigger role. Finally, while the number of active users has been falling, total on-chain transaction volume climbed on the charts again. Source: The Block Such a pattern usually means that large holders are quietly buying while the prices are lower. To put it simply, Bitcoin has evolved from being worth nothing in 2009 to creating a $100 billion fortune for its creator. This is evidence of the fact that its long-term value is not shaped by a few days of negative headlines.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans China trip amid push to reopen key market — Check out his itinerary

Time Published: 2026-01-21T05:26:58Z
Full Content:
Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang is planning to travel to China in late January as he works to reopen a crucial market for his company’s artificial intelligence chips. Huang will be in the country to attend company parties ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, according to a person familiar with the matter. The executive is also expected to visit Beijing, though it’s unclear whether he will meet with senior Chinese officials, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. Huang’s itinerary could still change, depending on whether prospective meetings come through. The China visit — a trip that Huang regularly takes at this time of year — comes at a pivotal moment for the world’s most valuable company. The US is loosening export restrictions on AI processors, letting Nvidia sell its H200 model in the Asian nation. But on the Chinese side, government officials are deciding how many of the chips to let in. Beijing plans to approve imports of the products as soon as this quarter for certain uses, Bloomberg News has reported. A representative for Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia declined to comment. China, the largest market for semiconductors, is looking to build up its homegrown chip industry and decrease reliance on US products. For now, though, local producers can’t match the capabilities of Nvidia’s processors, which are used to develop and run AI models. Though the H200 is a generation behind the Nvidia chips available in the US, it’s still seen as more powerful than Chinese offerings. Due to security concerns, Beijing will bar the H200 chip from the military, sensitive government agencies, critical infrastructure and state-owned enterprises, people familiar with the matter have said. That mirrors similar measures that the Chinese government adopted for foreign products such as Apple Inc. devices and Micron Technology Inc. chips. During a China trip in July, Huang managed to secure meetings with Vice Premier He Lifeng and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao. He also celebrated the Lunar New Year holidays with his employees in China in January 2025, opting to skip US President Donald Trump’s inauguration ceremony. On Wednesday, Huang is scheduled to appear at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he’ll be interviewed by BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink. Meanwhile, the US is imposing a 25% tariff on certain advanced semiconductors ahead of their shipment to China, a move aimed at fulfilling Trump’s desire for a surcharge on the sales. Washington has also stipulated additional requirements for H200 licensing applications. Exporters have to certify that approved China shipments won’t create a shortage in the US market. And companies must ensure that production for Chinese customers won’t displace manufacturing capacity that could be used to make chips for American buyers. Even with those restrictions, letting China buy Nvidia AI chips remains controversial among US lawmakers. In a hearing last week, US Representative Brian Mast said that China “would likely overtake us in the AI arms race” if the country had free access to Nvidia processors. The Florida Republican, who chairs the House panel on foreign affairs, added that Nvidia chips are far better than anything China can make domestically. Mast went further on social media over the weekend, accusing Huang and his “paid minions” of “fighting to sell millions of advanced AI chips to Chinese military companies like Alibaba and Tencent.” In the same post on X, Mast challenged Huang to debate him on Fox News. The lawmaker is working to advance a draft bill that would introduce arms-style congressional oversight over the sale of advanced AI chips and give the legislative branch the ability to block H200 sales through a joint resolution. Huang has said that such power should remain with Trump and the Department of Commerce. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Time Published: 2026-01-21T02:10:29Z
Full Content:
Microsoft CEO and Chairman Satya Nadella on Tuesday issued a rare warning about the future of artificial intelligence (AI), saying that if it stays limited to big tech companies and wealthy economies, and does not spread to other areas, the ongoing AI boom may turn into a bubble. Speaking with BlackRock Chair and CEO Laurence D. Fink, at a session during the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella said that the long-term success of AI would depend on the fast-advancing technology being deployed across a broad range of industries, as well as through adoption by countries outside the developed world. “For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” Nadella said at the forum. It will be a "tell-tale" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focuses only on the supply side or on technology companies, rather than on adoption across sectors and the industry as a whole, he warned. Nadella stressed that he was confident AI would become more transformative across industries. “I am much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he said. He said the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate their trials. He said that an increasing amount of data from big tech companies, including Microsoft, has shown an unequal adoption rate of AI, implying that productivity benefits and work applications are restricted to wealthier countries and companies. Nadella called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. He noted how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and reshaping the way we work. “We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,” the Microsoft CEO said. Nadella added that the strongest challenge with AI is ensuring its rapid and equitable diffusion across the world. “I think when it comes to AI, the real question in front of all of us is how do you ensure that the diffusion of AI happens, and happens fast,” he said. Nadella also discussed the need for public-private cooperation to ensure that the AI revolution is supported by adequate energy infrastructure and examined data sovereignty and the risk of a so-called AI bubble.

Innovative index combines US equity and Bitcoin to meet evolving retirement planning needs. Powered by Gloria Delaware Life Insurance Company, which provides annuity-based retirement solutions through a nationwide network of financial advisors, is partnering with BlackRock to bring Bitcoin into its fixed indexed annuities via the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index. A fixed indexed annuity is a contract with an insurance company designed to offer growth potential tied to a market index while protecting the principal from losses. The annuity credits interest based on the performance of a specific index, with gains limited by caps or participation rates. The account grows tax-deferred, and many FIAs allow the accumulated balance to be converted into a guaranteed income stream during retirement. Under the partnership, Delaware Life has added the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index to three of its products, including Momentum Growth, Momentum Growth Plus, and DualTrack Income. “We’re proud to partner with BlackRock as the first insurance carrier to offer cryptocurrency exposure through a fixed index annuity,” said Colin Lake, President & CEO of Delaware Life Marketing. “As the retirement-planning landscape evolves, we’re continuously and thoughtfully innovating to meet the needs of financial professionals and their clients.” BlackRock’s benchmark blends US stocks and Bitcoin exposure into a single benchmark, using dynamic cash allocations to maintain a 12% volatility target. Bitcoin exposure is delivered through BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest Bitcoin ETF by assets under management and liquidity. According to Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s Global Head of Digital Assets, the launch responds to growing demand for IBIT and enables insurance clients to integrate Bitcoin exposure into a diversified annuity strategy. The index is designed to offer measured participation in digital assets while preserving the principal protection annuities provide, he stated.

Title: Palantir CEO says AI will eliminate the need for mass immigration
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2026/01/20/palantir-ceo-says-ai-will-eliminate-need-mass-immigration/

UPDATED 20:39 EST / JANUARY 20 2026 by James Farrell Palantir Technologies Inc. Chief Executive Officer Alex Karp said he believes that when the world hits peak artificial intelligence, there will be so many jobs on offer that mass immigration will be obsolete. “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” Karp (pictured) said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “I do think these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have large-scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill.” Karp, who Forbes says has a net worth of around $14.3 billion, used himself as an example of job displacement when he talked about his Ph.D. in philosophy. “Elite” white-collar workers like him, he said, will be the first to be affected by the great job disruption. Vocational workers, he believes, will hold on for longer. His 30-minute conversation with BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Larry Fink has already drawn criticism from the media, which was quick to point out that these titans of the military-industrial complex and surveillance industry may not have their feet firmly on the ground. Karp often has called himself as a “card-carrying progressive,” and not too long ago said his company’s surveillance technology would not be used to track immigrants in the U.S., according to a recent article in The Washington Post. Nonetheless, Palantir’s software has played a major role in helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement unearth undocumented immigrants and deport them in line with the current administration’s mass deportation campaign. Karp was once a critic of mass deportations, but he has more recently aligned himself with President Trump, describing his company’s technology as “anti-woke” and praising the immigration crackdowns. If his predictions hold, it won’t be long until crackdowns on undocumented workers become a thing of the past, along with liberal arts degrees, because, according to Karp, AI “will destroy humanities jobs.” Some executives attending the conference told Business Insider that they believe critical thinking skills will actually become a much sought-after commodity. Anthropic PBC Chief Executive Dario Amodei said the technicians that Karp values so highly are not in demand at his company, as software and coding roles decline.

White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios discusses the Trump administration’s push on AI, data center expansion and innovation on ‘Mornings with Maria.’ Palantir CEO Alex Karp suggested Tuesday that usage of artificial intelligence "bolsters civil liberties," while also warning Europe that its adoption of technology is falling behind the U.S. and China. In a wide-ranging conversation with Blackrock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Karp said his company powers "tons and tons of hospitals," but that they all have an "intake problem" and a "shortage of doctors and nurses." "They are working in a low-margin environment, but every single one has a different way of processing their patients, according to what their specialty is and the kind of patients they don't do well with, and how do you manage that? And so the intake flow and into your enterprise in a way that you can actually process these things 10, 15 times faster than you could before," Karp said. "It saves a lot of lives." "Despite what people may want to believe, it also bolsters civil liberties, because now you can see, well, I mean, just simple questions — Was someone processed based on economic considerations, or were they processed based on their background? Like those things are impossible to see, unless you have, like, there's a huge civil liberties betterment side of this that typically people don't believe we care about or, but it's actually exactly the opposite," he continued.

It's like we can granularly show why someone came in, why they were taken, why they were rejected, and we can do it in a way that makes business sense for the business itself," Karp said. When asked by Fink if AI is going to create a greater imbalance in the world in terms of growth, Karp said, "Well, I think the obvious first imbalance is, it seems like America and China understand versions of making this work, and they're different, but they both work, and they work at scale, and I think that is very likely to accelerate way beyond what most people believe is possible." "Like the discount rate, I think, not in the short term, but in the long term is way too high on what will be done and how this will impact every aspect of our society," Karp added. He also said: "The tech adoption in Europe is a serious and very, very structural problem, and what scares me the most is, I haven't seen any political leader just stand up and say we have a serious and structural problem that we are going to fix."

"But like technicians. If you are a vocational technician. Or, like, we're building batteries for a battery company and the people who are doing it in America are doing roughly the same job that Japanese engineers are doing, and they went to high school," he continued. "And now, they're very valuable, if not irreplaceable, because we can make them into something different than what they were, very rapidly. And those jobs are going to become more valuable."

Title: Bitcoin pulls back to $91K – Spot buyers quietly take control

Time Published: 2026-01-20T23:30:37Z

Bitcoin demand continues to build, supported by clear signs of underlying momentum rather than speculative excess. Bitcoin [BTC] has slipped back to the $91,000 zone after failing to sustain a move above the $95,000 level it defended for most of the previous week. While the pullback reflects short-term exhaustion, it has not meaningfully weakened broader market participation. Activity among Spot buyers and institutions suggests demand remains intact, providing a potential base for recovery as macro and crypto-specific developments unfold. Spot market sentiment has turned constructive for the first time in several weeks, with the Bitcoin Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Difference) flipping decisively positive. This metric tracks whether aggressive market activity over a defined period—typically 90 days—is dominated by buyers or sellers. A positive reading indicates that buyers are once again setting the tone. Source: CryptoQuant The shift signals a transfer of control from sellers to buyers, a development that often precedes more durable price action. Importantly, Spot-led demand points to organic accumulation rather than leverage-driven momentum, strengthening the case for medium-term upside. Exchange data reinforces this narrative. Spot exchange Netflow shows that $171.83 million worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from exchanges, reflecting sustained buying pressure. This marks a sharp reversal from the $203 million in net selling recorded in the week ending January 12. If this pace of accumulation holds, shrinking exchange balances could begin to tighten supply and support a price rebound. Institutional investors appear unfazed by recent volatility. CryptoQuant data tracking U.S.-based wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC shows steady accumulation over the past year. Over this period, institutions have absorbed approximately $53 billion worth of Bitcoin, equivalent to around 577,000 BTC. On a monthly basis, this translates to average purchases of $4.4 billion. Source: CryproQuant These inflows are largely driven by U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, backed by major asset managers including BlackRock and Fidelity. AMBCrypto’s review of ETF flows shows that $1.21 billion worth of Bitcoin has already been purchased in January. Based on historical averages, additional inflows of up to $3.19 billion remain possible before month-end. That said, these figures remain conditional. Institutional positioning will continue to hinge on broader risk sentiment and macroeconomic signals. Bitcoin’s long-term relationship with global liquidity continues to favor higher prices. Historically, Bitcoin has topped out when global M2 money supply growth exceeds 14.4 percent. At present, global M2 growth sits near 11 percent, suggesting liquidity conditions remain supportive and have not yet reached levels typically associated with cycle peaks. Source: Alphractal Still, macro risks remain in focus. Farzam Ehsani, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange VALR, warned that renewed U.S.-EU tariff tensions could pressure risk assets, including Bitcoin. Ehsani said in an email to AMBCrypto. “President Trump’s aggressive trade rhetoric is pushing markets back into a full de-risking phase.” He added that the tariff dispute has weighed on cryptocurrencies primarily because they are treated as risk assets rather than due to market-specific weakness. “While U.S.-EU trade concerns have weighed most heavily on sentiment, other risk assets such as the KOSPI are trading flat or higher. This points to crypto-specific caution, with capital rotating toward alternative risk markets,” he noted. For now, institutional accumulation and Spot demand provide constructive signals, but tariff developments remain a key variable that could shape near-term market direction.

Title: Did BlackRock Make A Billion-Dollar XRP Bet? Here’s The Real Tea
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-billion-dollar-xrp-bet/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T23:00:49Z
Full Content:
Rumors of a large-scale XRP purchase by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have captured the attention of the crypto world this week. Screenshots circulating on X suggest that the global investment company had invested over a billion dollars in the altcoin, sparking both bullish excitement and skepticism across the crypto community. The frenzy began when several popular crypto influencers, including The Crypto Bull, shared a post and portfolio screenshot claiming that BlackRock had added $1.85 billion worth of XRP to its already substantial crypto holdings. Given BlackRock’s significant influence in the crypto space, the idea that the asset manager had invested in XRP seemed like a major signal for institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. The rumors triggered a wave of speculation about the token, with some market participants viewing the alleged purchase as extremely bullish. A closer examination of BlackRock’s actual portfolio, however, shows that the reports were unfounded and lacked any evidence to support them. Data from Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain analytics company, revealed that, contrary to expectations, BlackRock holds just 5.267 XRP, valued at just $10.32—a far cry from the acclaimed $1.85 billion in holdings. The data also showed that the asset manager held the majority of its holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlackRock’s total crypto portfolio is estimated at $82.1 billion, including 784,424 BTC valued at $71.31 billion, 3.494 million ETH worth approximately $10.8 billion, and other assets. Investigations also revealed that the original screenshots, which showed BlackRock owning 911.76 million XRP, had been edited to exaggerate the asset manager’s holdings. This misrepresentation created a temporary buzz, but did not reflect any real investment in the altcoin by the firm. Despite the false alarm, the incident highlights how quickly misinformation can spread in the crypto space, especially when shared by crypto influencers with thousands of followers. The Crypto Bull’s post drew a variety of reactions from the community. Some questioned why XRP’s price had not moved if the reports were accurate, while others remained skeptical, and a few outrightly dismissed the claims. False rumors have become a recurrent theme in the crypto world, and the latest incident with XRP and BlackRock is just one example. This is alson’t the first time false claims have been made about the token. Earlier this month, rumours of a potential Ripple partnership with Amazon spread across the community, sparking speculation about how such a collaboration could positively impact XRP’s price. Similarly, overly optimistic price forecasts can also contribute to misinformation. Some analysts have predicted that XRP could surge to $50,000, fueling unrealistic expectations for investors. In a market predominantly driven by speculation and volatility, it’s important for investors to verify sources and avoid making decisions based on unproven claims.

Some economists and experts say that critical thinking and creativity will be more important than ever in the age of artificial intelligence, when a robot can do much of the heavy lifting in coding or research. Take Benjamin Shiller, the Brandeis economics professor who recently told Fortune that a “weirdness premium” will be valued in the labor market of the future. Alex Karp, the Palantir cofounder and CEO, isn’t one of these voices. “It will destroy humanities jobs,” Karp said when asked how AI will affect jobs in conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. “You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy—I’ll use myself as an example—hopefully, you have some other skill, that one is going to be hard to market.” Karp attended Haverford College, a small, elite liberal arts college outside his hometown of Philadelphia. He earned a JD from Stanford Law School and a PhD in philosophy from Goethe University in Germany. He spoke about his own experience getting his first job. Of his own career, Karp told Fink that he remembered thinking: “I’m not sure who’s going to give me my first job.” The answer echoed past comments Karp has made about certain types of elite college graduates who lack specialized skills. “If you are the kind of person that would’ve gone to Yale, classically high IQ, and you have generalized knowledge but it’s not specific, you’re effed,” Karp said in an interview with Axios in November. Not every CEO agrees with Karp’s assessment that humanities graduates are doomed. BlackRock COO Robert Goldstein told Fortune in 2024 that the company was recruiting graduates who studied “things that have nothing to do with finance or technology.” McKinsey global managing partner Bob Sternfels recently said in an interview with Harvard Business Review that the company is “looking more at liberal arts majors, whom we had deprioritized, as potential sources of creativity,” to break out of AI’s linear problem-solving. Karp has long been an advocate of vocational training over traditional college degrees. Last year, Palantir launched a Meritocracy Fellowship, offering high school students a paid internship with the chance to interview for a full-time position at the end of four months. The company criticized American universities for “indoctrinating” students and having “opaque” admissions that “displaced meritocracy and excellence,” in their announcement of the fellowship. “If you did not go to school, or you went to a school that’s not that great, or you went to Harvard or Princeton or Yale, once you come to Palantir, you’re a Palantirian—no one cares about the other stuff,” Karp said during a Q2 earnings call last year. “I think we need different ways of testing aptitude,” Karp told Fink. He pointed to the former police officer who attended a junior college, who now manages the U.S. Army’s Maven system, a Palantir-made AI tool that processes drone imagery and video. “In the past, the way we tested for aptitude would not have fully exposed how irreplaceable that person’s talents are,” he said. Karp also gave the example of technicians building batteries at a battery company, saying those workers are “very valuable if not irreplaceable because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly.” He said what he does all day at Palantir is “figuring out what is someone’s outlier aptitude. Then I’m putting them on that thing and trying to get them to stay on that thing and not on the five other things they think they’re great at.” Karp’s comments come as more employers report a gap between the skills applicants are offering and what employers are looking for in a tough labor market. The unemployment rate for young workers ages 16 to 24 hit 10.4% in December and is growing among college graduates. Karp isn’t too worried, though. “There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training,” he said.

The company is making that possible by adding the BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index as an option in its fixed index annuity, or FIA, portfolio. An FIA is a type of insurance contract designed to provide principal protection with the potential for limited upside growth. The principal is comprised of the payments made to an insurance company. In return, the insurer promises to protect that principal against market declines. And while the gains are linked to an index—usually something like the S&P 500—the policyholder isn't directly invested in the market. So that means returns are typically capped. And if the index goes down, then the policy holder's return for that period would typically be zero instead of negative. This means that the Bitcoin exposure for Delaware Life Insurance Company policyholders will be indirect, since it's access through an ETF inside the index. "As the retirement-planning landscape evolves, we're continuously and thoughtfully innovating to meet the needs of financial professionals and their clients" Colin Lake, president and CEO of Delaware Life marketing, said in a press release. The BlackRock U.S. Equity Bitcoin Balanced Risk 12% Index combines U.S. stocks and Bitcoin and targets 12% volatility. It uses cash adjustments to help offset Bitcoin's price swings. The Bitcoin component comes in with the iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT, which had amassed $74.5 billion worth of assets under management by the end of last week. The new index option will be available to policyholders for three of Delaware Life's products: Momentum Growth, Momentum Growth Plus, and DualTrack Income. Since Bitcoin ETFs launched in the U.S. two years ago, Wall Street has found lots of ways to incorporate them. Jefferies issued the first U.S. structured note tied to a Bitcoin ETF in July last year, and Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan have now sold more than $530 million in structured notes linked to IBIT. Life insurance companies have been slow to embrace Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs because of market volatility. Up until now, the interest has been more in using blockchain to streamline back office functions. For example, the Bank of China put 4 million insurance records on a private blockchain in 2019. But the rate of investment in crypto product from insurers took a while to catch on. By 2021, U.S. insurers had invested only $3 million in Grayscale's Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts—before either had been converted into spot ETFs. Late last year, Morgan Stanley broadened crypto exposure for its wealth clients, including those with retirement accounts.
