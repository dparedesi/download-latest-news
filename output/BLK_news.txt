All portfolio trades were executed with global reinsurance companies and top-tier Lloyd's of London syndicates, and were sourced through the top three global reinsurance brokers. MCM Fund I opens access to reinsurance income for a rapidly expanding capital base of new investors seeking diversified and uncorrelated investment alternatives with attractive yield and structured liquidity. The launch represents the growing importance of funds structuring their offerings to take advantage of the continuing convergence between traditional finance and digital assets. Backed by Solana, Aptos, and Cardano and supported by institutions like Coinbase, Archax, Apex Group, and Envelop Risk, MembersCap has selected the Solana, Aptos, Cardano, and Base protocols to provide access to qualified investors wishing to invest using eligible cryptocurrencies. MembersCap has been selected as the first fund in the real-world assets category on the Archax platform, sitting alongside tokenized offerings from other institutions like BlackRock, State Street, and Aberdeen. The reinsurance opportunity Being fundamentally uncorrelated with the financial markets, reinsurance has consistently outperformed most traditional alternatives over the past two decades. Despite being highly yield-generative, the sector has historically been reserved for pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional giants. Increasingly, both crypto-native investors and smaller traditional allocators are seeking refuge from market volatility by accessing reinsurance as a stable, diversified income stream to support a balanced portfolio and enhance overall returns. "Every generation is presented with new technologies that unlock economic opportunity. To us, tokenisation and the blockchain represent access to better asset management for a different class of investor," said Lloyd Wahed, Co-Founder and CEO of MembersCap. "We're excited to be one of the first institutional funds to emerge from this space." "Our investors– digital asset institutions, family offices, HNWIs —want to meet their goals of resiliency and long-term sustainable growth through new and more efficient means. With this novel approach, we're seeing these investors view reinsurance as a core part of their portfolio for the first time," said Patrick Barrett, Co-Founder and COO at MembersCap. "This launch proves that tokenisation can bring new capital to help address the growing insurance protection gap by lowering barriers and providing access to the private reinsurance market," said Dr. Benjamin Fox, Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer at MembersCap. "Our tokenised model enables a new cohort of investors to participate pari passu alongside large institutions in an uncorrelated asset class with a track record of reliable, attractive returns." Positioned as an alternative to private equity, venture capital, and fixed income strategies, MCM Fund I provides qualified investors with regulated and collateralised access to reinsurance via direct exposure to natural catastrophe and cyber reinsurance contracts sourced through blue-chip global partners. For Web3 treasuries, foundations, and institutions, the Fund delivers high-yield opportunities and structured liquidity, derived from high-quality, real-world reinsurance returns, without exposure to DeFi volatility and over-concentration in altcoins. MembersCap was founded in 2024 and is backed by a strong coalition of both institutional and blockchain-native partners. This blend of traditional underwriting expertise and on-chain architecture ensures institutional-grade standards while embracing next-generation accessibility. About Members Capital ManagementFounded in 2024, Members Capital Management ("MembersCap") is a licensed investment manager regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, bridging institutional finance and blockchain infrastructure. Backed by leading blockchain protocols including Cardano, Aptos, and Solana, and supported by institutional infrastructure from Archax, Coinbase, Apex Group and Envelop Risk, MembersCap delivers a new institutional blueprint: tokenised participation to the global reinsurance market, an asset class traditionally closed to most investors.

Title: SMCP Secures Singapore Court Victory in Battle Over Disputed Share Transfer

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily It is the latest decision in favor of the Sandro and Maje parent company. PARIS – SMCP will get its shares back. The Singapore High Court has ruled that Dynamic Treasure Group must return the 15.5 percent stake it holds to European TopSoho, the parent company of SMCP, which had been transferred illegally. The court ordered that Dynamic Treasure Group has one week to return the shares, or appeal the decision. In a statement, the company said it will “keep the market informed about the effective completion of the return of this stake.” Related Articles Celebrity News Princess Beatrice Brings Understated Flair in Striped Sandro Look to First Day of Wimbledon 2025 Financial SMCP Sales Gain 2.6% in Q1 Amid Strategic Shift Away From China This is the latest twist and turn in a case stemming from 2021, when 15.5 percent of the share capital of Sandro, Maje and Claudie Pierlot parent company SMCP “disappeared” from France and reappeared in the British Virgin Islands two-and-a-half months later. You May Also Like This follows a similar decision by the English High Court in July 2024, which canceled the sale of the shares to Dynamic Treasure Group. It’s also the second ruling in the case within a month as it winds through courts and regulators in multiple jurisdictions. In June, French regulatory body Autorieté des Marchés Financiers (AMF) fined the company and its shareholders for a series of irregularities. First, the regulatory body sanctioned former majority shareholder European TopSoho, director of European TopSoho Chenran Qiu and Dynamic Treasure Group, which received the shares, for disclosure violations and market manipulation. The shares were moved from Luxembourg to the British Virgin Islands without notifying the authorities. They effectively “went missing” until they reappeared in the accounts of Dynamic Treasure Group, also controlled by Qiu, weeks later. European TopSoho had sold them to DTG for a symbolic one-euro price. In the interim, European TopSoho also issued a press release denying Qiu was involved in Dynamic Treasure Group, misleading the market. As a result, the AMF issued a series of fines. Qiu was sanctioned with 1 million euros, European TopSoho 400,000 euros, and Dynamic Treasure Group 300,000 for a total of 1.7 million euros. Separately, the AMF fined SMCP 20,000 euros for an unrelated leak of their financial information in 2021, when it accidentally published quarterly results on its website before market close. The London-based GLAS is the trustee for European TopSoho creditors including BlackRock, Carlyle, Anchorage, Boussard and Gavaudan that united to save the group with the issuance of bonds, and effectively SMCP’s largest shareholder. They announced last year their intention to offload 37 percent of the group’s shares. That move could trigger a mandatory takeover action under French law if a single purchaser snaps them up. SMCP has been on the road to recovery as it seeks to replace the market share it lost in China by expanding into new regions in Asia, including the Philippines, Indonesia and India. It recruited former Loewe executive Kleine Tan to take up the role of chief executive officer of SMCP Asia in April, tasked with implementing the company’s “strategic road map in the region, notably our network optimization in China,” she said in a statement shared first with WWD at the time.

Title: World of Warcraft: What’s Up With the Collector’s Bounty?
URL: https://kotaku.com/world-of-warcraft-collectors-bounty-july-legacy-content-1851785640
Time Published: 2025-07-04T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
As part of the run-up to patch 11.2, Blizzard is closing out Season 2 of World of Warcraft: The War Within with a couple of special events. One of them is a buff called Collector’s Bounty which is aimed at transmog collectors and mount farmers. Here’s what you might want to know before you jump in. There’s been some confusion about how Collector’s Bounty works. It was implemented on July 1 after the weekly reset, but took a couple of hours to kick in. Its effects were initially invisible. Now every character who logs into a modern TWW server will receive Collector’s Bounty on entry into the world. While this buff persists, bosses in every dungeon and raid instance in “legacy content” (any expansion before Dragonflight), drops double the normal loot. In dungeons, this typically means four to six items, while raid bosses can drop up to 12 depending on the raid’s difficulty setting. Anecdotally, it also seems as if dungeon monsters have a greater chance to drop green- and blue-quality items. This is a great opportunity to hunt down any transmogrification items you’ve been missing. (Personally, I use the AllTheThings add-on to track my collection, which is why my tooltips are slightly longer than usual). Further, several specific items, such as rare mounts and legendary weapons, have a +5 percent chance to drop during Collector’s Bounty. This is 10 times their usual drop rate, and some obsessed players have been trying to get them for actual calendar years. Maybe now’s their chance. Specific items affected by Collector’s Bounty include: Note: While not specifically affected by Collector’s Bounty, SoO has a few secret transmogrification items as boss drops, such as the Kor’kron Dark Shaman set and Mannoroth’s Tusks, that should be easier to farm now. In addition, keep an eye out for two high-demand cosmetic weapon drops from Antorus. Aggramar’s flaming sword Taeshalach has been a popular transmogrification option since Legion came out, and Argus has a low chance to drop his scythe. While anyone in Champion-track TWW gear or better should blast through most BfA content like it isn’t there, this is also where raid encounter design can get a bit tricky. For example, the Stormwall Blockade encounter in Dazar’lor has an instant kill built into it if you don’t interrupt Catastrophic Tides in time. (If you’re a warlock, make sure your felhunter is out.) The entrance to Ny’alotha can appear in either Uldum or the Vale of Eternal Blossoms depending on where the Black Empire is attacking in a given week. You can solo N’Zoth these days without the old BfA legendary cloak, but at current TWW gear levels, you cannot simply burst N’Zoth hard enough to ignore his central mechanics. You’ll need to enter his Mindgates and reclaim your Severed Consciousness or you’ll simply drop dead. While there are a couple of ways to reach various parts of the Shadowlands without having to go through its introductory sequence, you’ll typically end up out of phase with most of the features and characters. To get into places like the Maw or Zereth Mortis on a new character, you’ll need to start their introductory quests by talking to the Knights of Ebon Blade in either Stormwind or Orgrimmar. Like BfA, there are a few different bosses in Shadowlands with instant-kill gimmicks, particularly in mythic raids. While none of them have the firepower to really bother a level 80 character, given the stat inflation between this expansion and TWW, a few have abilities that can seriously ruin a solo raider’s day. Particular offenders here include the Jailer’s mind control, Soulrender Dormazain’s Warmonger Shackles, and Artificer Xy’mox’s Stasis Traps. Keep an eye on your dungeon journal. At time of writing, So’leah is also difficult to beat solo, as her dungeon gimmick gives her a massive damage reduction bonus that you can’t dispel without a team. You can either autoattack her for 10 minutes, bring friends, or use a level 80 monk’s Touch of Death to bypass her shields and drop her in one hit. Collector’s Bounty in World of Warcraft is currently planned to last until July 28. .

Friday, July 4th, 2025 Trading activity was thin towards the end of this week as the United States celebrates Independence Day – with a record-breaking 72 million people traveling – but both ICE Brent and WTI edged slightly lower on expectations of OPEC+ hiking production targets again in August. Whilst OPEC+’s Saturday meeting seems to be a rather predictable affair, next week’s big price moves will be dictated by the July 9 tariff deadline as Asian countries try their luck with last-minute negotiations with President Trump. OPEC+ Moves Its July Meeting a Day Ahead. Sticking to its policy of trying to surprise market watchers, the group of eight OPEC+ producers unwinding production cuts decided to move their meeting initially planned for July 6 to Saturday, in anticipation of yet another 411,000 b/d monthly output hike. Trading Giant Tries Its Luck with Last-Minute Bid. A consortium led by privately-held trading giant Vitol submitted an eleventh-hour bid for Venezuela-owned US refiner Citgo Petroleum, offering more than 10 billion for Citgo’s 807,000 b/d capacity for three refineries, the highest known offer in the ongoing auction. India Wants to Expand Strategic Reserves. The government of India has started feasibility studies on the construction of three new strategic petroleum storage sites, more than doubling the current 40-million-barrel SPR stock, placing a special emphasis on salt caverns in the northern state of Rajasthan. Exxon Returns Unused Guyana Acreage to State. US oil major ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) has returned 2,534 km2 (equivalent to 978 sq miles) of the Stabroek block offshore Guyana to the South American country’s government, relinquishing it after it didn’t manage to explore or develop those territories. BlackRock Comes to the Rescue. With Saudi Arabia expected to take on more debt this year after a $15.6 billion deficit in Q1, US investment firm BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) has reportedly expressed interest in selling its stake in Saudi Aramco’s (TADAWUL:2222) natural gas pipeline network back to the NOC. China Eases Taxation on Embattled Teapots. The regional government of Shandong hiked fuel oil import tax rebates for independent refiners in the region, returning between 75% and 95% of payable consumption tax for gasoline and diesel as most ‘teapots’ barely survive at 50-55% utilization rates. Brazil Eyes More Exploration Money. Following a bumper revenue stream of 180 million from Brazil’s 5th Concession Offer bidding last month, the Latin American country now wants to hold an additional E&P auction to be organized in 2025 still for uncontracted pre-salt areas, eyeing higher budget revenue. Glencore Mulls Its Options with UK Refinery. Swiss-based global trading house Glencore (LON:GLEN) has been in talks with the UK government over the fate of the 113,000 b/d Lindsey refinery, caught in great turmoil after the insolvency of its operator Prax, as Glencore has been its exclusive crude supplier. Sanctions-Hit Venezuela Revisits China Dependence. Despite the Trump administration’s sanctions snapback on Venezuela, PDVSA’s exports of oil and refined products edged slightly higher in June to 844,000 b/d, however almost 90% of all flows are now moving towards China, a longtime ally. US Oil Drilling Wanes on Uncertain Outlook. According to the latest survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, oil and gas business activity in the US turned negative in Q2 2025 as the uncertainty index soared to 47.1, with almost half of companies expecting to drill fewer wells this year than initially expected. Japan Wants Fully-Fledged Carbon Trading by 2027. Japan launched discussions with domestic industry participants to kick-start its full-scale emissions trading system by 2027, mandating that all companies emitting more than 100,000 metric tonnes of CO2 participate in ETS trading, a step up from the current voluntary market. Ecuador Declares Force Majeure on Oil Production. Ecuador’s state oil company Petroecuador declared force majeure on all its operations after the 360,000 b/d SOTE and 450,000 b/d OCP pipelines carrying crude from the country’s inner regions to the coast were damaged by landslides and erosion. Trump Admin Lifts Restrictions on China-Bound Ethane. The US Commerce Department rescinded its mandate for US ethane exporters to seek export licenses for deliveries to China, with both Enterprise and Energy Transfer confirming flows from the Morgan’s Point and Nederland terminals have fully resumed.

Title: Is Elon Musk Really Behind the Bitcoin Buzz This Time?

Time Published: 2025-07-04T13:56:08Z

The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to volatility induced by Elon Musk. His tweets have historically caused major price swings. But as BTC flirts with fresh highs, the current rally is more data-driven—and the Tesla CEO’s role remains unconfirmed. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, has achieved a historic milestone by closing the second quarter at its highest level ever, reaching $107,149 on the Bitstamp exchange. This performance follows an 11.6% decline in the first quarter, but Bitcoin rebounded with a 30% gain in the second quarter. Social metrics from LunarCrush and Santiment show a spike in Bitcoin-related engagement following a cryptic tweet from Musk on June 29. The post included a rocket emoji and a dollar symbol—enough to prompt a flurry of interpretations from the crypto community. However, no direct reference to Bitcoin was made. Analysts at CryptoQuant and Kaiko note that while social sentiment surged after the tweet, no significant wallet activity linked to Musk or Tesla has been reported. Bloomberg estimates that BlackRock IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. Glassnode reports that Bitcoin’s 14-day RSI remains under 60, suggesting there’s room for more momentum. Price is holding above its 50-day ($105,970) and 200-day ($87,717) moving averages. Meanwhile, whale activity appears mixed. IntoTheBlock data shows a 45% drop in large BTC transactions over the past month, suggesting some cooling among high-net-worth traders. Still, BTC’s technical posture remains bullish. The network’s health and rising ETF demand suggest fundamental strength rather than hype-driven movement. While Elon Musk’s influence on the market remains a wildcard, current data suggests that his actions do not primarily drive Bitcoin’s momentum.

DeFi Technologies Inc. (the “Company” or “DeFi Technologies”) (Nasdaq: DEFT) (CBOE CA: DEFI) (GR: R9B), a financial technology company bridging the gap between traditional capital markets and decentralized finance (“DeFi”), has announced its expansion in the GCC and MENA region with the registration of DEFI DMCC (certification no DMCC199558) with offices in Jumeirah Lake Towers Dubai UAE. 0 04 July 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour, and Valour Digital Securities Limited (and, together with Valour Inc., “Valour”) a leading issuer of exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) has also opened a trading desk at DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Center) in UAE. The DeFi Technologies team and its subsidiary Valour, aim to support the increased institutional interest in digital assets in the GCC region and specifically in the UAE. This expansion into the Middle East is a key element of the strategy to increase product offerings and global footprint. As the first Nasdaq-listed digital asset manager of its kind, DeFi Technologies offers equity investors diversified exposure to the broader decentralized economy through its integrated and scalable business model. This includes Valour, which offers access to more than 65 of the world’s most innovative digital assets via regulated ETPs with plans to offer 100 by the end of 2025. With regulatory momentum, product velocity, and institutional credibility converging, DEFT is positioning itself as the BlackRock of Web3. Globally, institutional capital is pouring into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and in the Middle East and in the UAE in specific this is also becoming a trend. Recently, UAE sovereign wealth fund Mubadala announced it expanded its position in BlackRock’s bitcoin ETF showcasing the latest example of institutions increasingly turning to non-traditional exposures wrapped in an ETF. Bitcoin ETPs are facilitating greater exposure for investors who had been interested in crypto but want a familiar and efficient wrapper. Currently, total assets under management (“AUM”) in crypto ETPs have reached $176.3 billion. Andrew Forson, President of DeFi Technologies and Chief Growth Officer of Valour, stated, “ We believe the demand for digital asset ETPs will increase not only globally but in the GCC and Middle East. Investors whether sovereign wealth funds, institutional investors, family offices and even retail investors are interested in crypto but require familiar and efficient vehicles to get exposure.” He adds, “Wrapping digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in regulated financial instruments such as ETPs will increase the number of crypto investors and offer countries such as the UAE, Qatar, Oman, and Saudi Arabia access to international foreign investment. Local and international get exposure to these assets through trusted providers like the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange, Dubai Financial Markets, and others.” Already DeFi Technologies has expanded into Turkey through a collaboration with Misyon Bank, and Misyon Kripto to work to introduce ETPs. In Turkey currently over 50% of investor population are holding digital assets. In 2024, DeFi Technologies through its subsidiary Valour partnered with GulfCap Investment Bank (“GCIB”), a licensed investment bank as its key Transaction Advisor for the proposed cross-listing of Valour’s ETPs on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (“NSE”) in Kenya. The proposed cross-listing will allow Valour’s ETPs to be traded in Kenyan Shillings on the NSE and provide investors in East Africa with exposure to leading digital assets through regulated investment vehicles. In Europe DeFi Technologies subsidiary Valour currently offers 65+ fully hedged digital asset ETPs on leading European exchanges including Xetra, Spotlight, and Euronext.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has surged toward its all-time high in recent weeks, adding around 50% since dropping to its April lows as crypto changes the game for Elon Musk’s SpaceX and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, which is braced for a “big” month ahead after the White House crypto czar teased a major update, has climbed to give bitcoin a total market capitalization of more than $2 trillion, with bullish traders predicting a looming bitcoin price boom. Now, as traders eye “trillions and trillions” of dollars that remain on the sidelines, bitcoin and crypto-backing senator Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a bill to Congress she described as “groundbreaking.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump has declared himself the first "crypto president," helping the bitcoin ... More price soar. “This groundbreaking legislation is fully paid for, cuts through the bureaucratic red tape and establishes common-sense rules that reflect how digital technologies function in the real world,” Lummis said in a statement. The bill would see small crypto transactions of less than $300 exempt from taxes, as well as crypto lending, and defer taxes on income generated from crypto mining and staking until the coins are sold. It would also apply a typical 30-day wash rule to crypto, removing a loophole that has allowed crypto investors to sell at a loss only to buy back in again while still claiming a tax deduction. Lummis highlighted estimates from the congressional joint committee on taxation that estimated the bill would generate about $600 million through 2034. “We cannot allow our archaic tax policies to stifle American innovation, and my legislation ensures Americans can participate in the digital economy without inadvertent tax violations,” Lummis said. Lummis had tried to squeeze the crypto tax reforms into U.S. president Donald Trump’s so-called "one, big, beautiful" bill but ran out of time before the Senate sent it to the House. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, propelled by U.S. president Donald Trump's ... More return to the White House. Trump’s "one, big, beautiful bill," designed to overhaul the U.S. tax-and-spend landscape and power the country’s next phase of growth while adding an expected $3 trillion of debt and raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, has been passed by the House of Representatives. House Republicans have meanwhile declared the week beginning July 14 "crypto week," in which policymakers will focus on three major crypto bills—the stablecoin Genius Act, the market structure Clarity Act and the Anti-CBDC [central bank digital currency] Surveillance State Act. The Trump administration’s pro-bitcoin and crypto agenda has been named as a catalyst for a bitcoin price break out in coming months. “We expect bitcoin to print new all-time highs in the second half of the year, buoyed by growing ETF [exchange-traded fund] and corporate treasury flows, as well as U.S. policy and regulatory developments,” Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Bank, said in an emailed note. Spot bitcoin ETFs, led by the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, as well as so-called bitcoin treasury companies that have sprung up in the wake of Michael Saylor’s bitcoin-buying giant Strategy, have hoovered up more than $100 billion worth of bitcoin between them in the last few years.

Photo: Adrian Murrell/Getty Images Limerick rugby has always been different. For generations rugby was a middle-class, if not upper-class, pursuit, in Ireland. The vast majority of the rugby playing population began their careers in the most prestigious fee-paying schools in Ireland, like Clongowes and Blackrock College. This point was reflected in Brendan Behan’s observation: “I never heard rugby was a proper game for anyone except bank clerks. It was a game for the Protestant and the shop-keeping Catholic and I never thought it had anything to do with me.”

Title: Best golf courses in Co Louth: Bucket list courses and hidden gems from Baltray to Ardee

The drive from Drogheda along the River Boyne to the village of Baltray is one which heightens expectations of what awaits at the mouth of the river. County Louth Golf Club – a fine, traditional links – has earned its place among the top courses in the country. Originally designed in the 1890s by a Scottish professional with the wonderful name of Mr Snowball, the man most responsible for leaving his imprint on this seaside course – where Shane Lowry won the Irish Open as an amateur in 2009 – was the noted golf course architect Tom Simpson and his assistant Molly Gourlay. [ Fairways to Heaven - Ireland's Ultimate Golf GuideOpens in new window ] The links itself is a true test from start-to-finish, as it weaves its way in different directions but still consists of two loops. The most dramatic run of holes comes on the back nine, with the run from the 10th to 13th comprising arguably the best sequence of four successive par-fours anywhere. The 14th is the shortest of the par-fours but one of the best, playing from the elevated tee with the final destination of a green planted into the sand hills. In every sense, Baltray – the traditional home of the men’s East of Ireland championship – is a links that will reward and captivate, while being at all times challenging. Its clever design, utilising the terrain that is primarily flat before delving into the sand hills from the 12th to the 14th, entices and demands attention on every shot. As part of the bucket list, it is worth factoring in a round at the adjacent Seapoint links – designed by Des Smyth and Declan Branigan – which has matured wonderfully, especially the back nine which takes in views of the Irish Sea from a number of vantage points. The best is probably left to last at Seapoint. The 18th hole running along the coastline back to the clubhouse where the spirit of the 19th hole welcome is very much in play. Co Louth Golf Club, Baltray, Drogheda, Co Louth, A92 HK03; 041-9881530 Seapoint Golf Club, Termonfeckin, Co Louth; 041-9822333; email: ed@seapoint.ie Greenore is a long established course dating back to the 1890s but remains one of those hidden gems, primarily because its location on the Cooley peninsula overlooking Carlingford Lough ... but it is very much worth discovering as a fine test of golf in a wonderful setting with views across to the Mournes. Wind, given its location, is invariably a factor but the layout is open with the challenge set before the player off the tee with no hidden surprises. Although flat, the loughside course has its challenges with tidal water in play, most notably on the sixth and seventh holes. The tee to the Par 3 sixth is located on a disused railway line and plays downhill to the green, while it is followed by a demanding Par 4 with a tee shot over water. Greenore Golf Club, Greenore, Dundalk; 042-9373212 Dundalk Golf Club is a classic parkland course with a reputation for its wonderful greens. Located above the picturesque village of Blackrock, the treelined course has three distinct segments with an opening stretch of four tough Par 4s, then a stretch to the 12th that includes four Par 5s and a tough finishing run all the way to the 18th which is known as “Harrington’s Challenge,” in honour of three-time Major champion Pádraig Harrington who won the Dundalk Scratch Cup in 1995.

The stretch of holes from the 11th to the 14th is very demanding, with the short 13th that has water in play from tee to green showcasing the picturesque nature of the entire layout.

Title: What Wall Street’s rampaging run means for KiwiSaver investors - Stock Takes

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Wall Street's bull run has been a boon for KiwiSaver funds. Photo / File This week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit record highs, boosted by gains in technology stocks and a trade agreement between the United States and Vietnam. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is only a fraction short of its record close on December 4. Meanwhile, a better-than-expected US jobs report for June reinforced expectations that the US Federal Reserve would not cut official interest rates this year. US stocks have more than made up for the tariff-driven selloff, so what will that mean for KiwiSaver investors, many of whom will have some kind of exposure to Wall Street? As at the end of March, investment research firm Morningstar tracked about $121 billion of assets in KiwiSaver, of which $49b was invested in international stock markets. “The MSCI World Index is about 72% US-based, so we would estimate that there would be around $35b invested in the US equity markets,” the firm told Stock Takes. That’s welcome news for KiwiSaver investors, given the New Zealand sharemarket has underperformed, reflecting the weak economy. Mark Lister, investment director at Craigs Investment Partners, said diversification had been a big plus. “The fact that KiwiSaver investors have a healthy allocation of US shares has been a very good thing in recent years because many investors - if they were making their own investment decisions - might have tilted towards the local market, which has been an underperformer. “The fact that KiwiSaver funds have been very internationally focused [and with the US being the world’s biggest share market] has ensured that KiwiSaver members and investors have had some very good returns in recent years.” Lister noted that, while the US market was at record highs, it had suffered a big fall in April on the back of US President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement. The US market had recouped its losses, but the weaker US dollar offset some of those gains for Kiwis. Lister said international diversification in general had been a positive for KiwiSaver investors, not just because of Wall Street’s performance. He noted emerging markets had also been strong, along with Japan, Europe and the UK. “Europe, to me, is probably one of the standouts because the euro has also been strong. “For a New Zealand investor, you’ve got the double whammy of a strongly performing European market and a rising euro against the Kiwi dollar. “All in all, it hasn’t been too bad in the first six months of the year for investors, and it’s been that international exposure that will have helped them, despite the local share market and the housing market continuing to lag.” While US stock markets look to be in full recovery mode, somebody has forgotten the US dollar, which is having its worst start to the year since 1973. Trump’s trade and economic policies have prompted global investors to rethink their exposure to the US, but the greenback’s role as the world’s reserve currency looks to be safe. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, paints an optimistic outlook for US equities, despite the uncertainties posed by Trump’s policies. “As US policy reclaims centre stage, we think immutable economic laws will limit extremes, while tax cuts and deregulation could boost investor sentiment,” BlackRock said in a commentary. US policy developments were coming thick and fast. “As the end of the 90-day tariff pause looms, we think immutable economic laws will prevent a return to a maximal stance. “We are also seeing movement in US policies that could boost investor sentiment, including tax cuts and regulatory reforms like a federal stablecoin framework. “These reforms will take time, but support our US equities overweight [position]. “We stay underweight long-term Treasuries on sticky inflation and deficit concerns.” Trump’s pause on sweeping tariffs expires on Wednesday. In New Zealand’s case, exporters face a 10% tariff on exports to the US. But analysts say the risk lies not so much with tariffs on New Zealand goods but the impact that they will have on world growth. Kiwibank chief economist Jarrod Kerr noted the US dollar’s weakness and the questions being asked about its reserve status. “My opinion is that we have not seen a dumping of the US dollar at all. “We have seen a diversification, perhaps, but certainly not a dumping. “Yields on US Treasuries are not rising in a concerning way - in fact, they have fallen (4.24% for US 10-years).” The weak US dollar is good news for Trump, who has long called for a lower greenback to make US manufacturers more competitive. “Trump is pretty sensitive to the financial markets, but having the dollar drop in the way that it has will not concern him at all,” Kerr said. While the New Zealand share market remained sidelined, the one bright spot seemed to be the agricultural sector. “My worry is that, if these tariffs come in, they will start to slow the world economy down, which is what many forecast. “That’s a worry because we are exposed to that slowdown. “And the best-performing sectors of the economy are the most exposed to the global slowdown.” A Malaysian company may be interested in buying Fletcher Building’s construction unit, according to a report in The Australian. The newspaper’s “Dataroom” said Malaysia’s Gamuda had expressed an interest in buying the Fletcher Building construction arm. Gamuda is an engineering, property and infrastructure group and is one of the largest in Malaysia’s infrastructure sector. Early last month, Fletcher Building told the NZX that it had received inquiries from parties interested in its businesses, including its construction division, after the company’s announcement of a strategic review. “The company advises that no decisions have been made to sell any of its businesses,” it said then. Tucked away in NZX-listed Burger Fuel’s annual report was a comment on the number of young people leaving for Australia. The chain said there had been a “significant” exodus of “home-grown, hardcore” Burger Fuel customers to Australia and other overseas destinations. “These younger Burger Fuel customers are not being replaced by incoming migrants, who are unlikely to purchase from Burger Fuel for some years,” the company said. Trading in 2025 had been “one of the toughest on record” for the hospitality industry, the report said. “Although there is talk of economic improvement, we have not seen this translate to sales; the economy remains in recession. “The slow reduction of interest rates and general economic uncertainty has led to consumers keeping their wallets in their pockets. “People are spending less and most certainly eating out less.” “We do not anticipate significant positive changes in the economic environment over the next 12 months,” chairman Alan Gourdie and chief executive Josef Roberts said.

Tokenization platform Ondo Finance ONDO$0.7782 and digital asset investment firm Pantera Capital have teamed up to invest $250 million in real-world asset (RWA) projects as the red-hot tokenization trend is accelerating. The initiative, named Ondo Catalyst, aims to invest in protocols and infrastructure projects that enhance the development of tokenized finance and on-chain capital markets, according to a Thursday blog post by Ondo. The initiative will do a mix of equity and token investments, a representative of Ondo told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. "The financial system is undergoing a fundamental upgrade," Nathan Allman, founder and CEO of Ondo Finance, said in the blog post. "By supporting the infrastructure and applications that unlock real-world utility for tokenized assets, we're helping reshape how capital moves around the world." Tokenization is one of the fastest-growing crypto use cases and has captivated big banks, fintechs, asset managers and crypto native firms alike. The process aims to bring traditional financial instruments such as bonds, stocks and real estate, often dubbed RWAs, onto blockchain rails, promising more efficient operations, faster and around-the-clock settlements, broader investor access and programmable transactions. For example, Robinhood, Bybit, Kraken and Gemini have recently introduced trading with tokenized versions of U.S. stocks, while BlackRock and Franklin Templeton issue tokenized money market funds backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries. Ondo is one of the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury issuers, with its OUSG and USDY tokens having a combined market capitalization of nearly $1.4 billion, data by RWA.xyz shows. The firm is also developing a layer-1 blockchain network designed for tokenized RWAs. The news of the partnership was first reported by Axios.

Title: Considering A Career Move Or Pension In Crypto? Crypto’s Overdue Respect

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Young stock trader shows executive managers cryptocurrency and market correlation on wall TV. It is estimated that over 55 million Americans use cryptocurrencies, 20% of the adult population. Europe has an estimated 31 million cryptocurrency users, 25% of the adult population, and in the U.K. its 12% of the of the adult population, or 4 million adults. Africa has 38 million users, Latin America has 55 million users, and Asia, comprising 48 counties, has 263 million users. Crypto is moving into the mainstream globally and the broad acceptance of digital assets is accelerating. The U.S. Administration’s pro-crypto stance is certainly delivering greater regulatory clarity with the Genius Act for stablecoins and the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. SEC Chair Paul Atkins says the self-custody of crypto is a fundamental American right, linking it to personal freedom and property control. Under Chair Atkins, with the support of Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda, the SEC has dropped most of the crypto lawsuits filed during former chair Gary Gensler’s tenure. Greater regulatory clarity is welcome, and it is increasingly clear that there is a growing change of attitude towards cryptocurrencies among many global regulators driven by a range factors including the prospect of greater economic growth, financial inclusion and wealth creation opportunities for citizens. The markets have witnessed Circle’s eye watering IPO and share price which is helping to drive the path to IPO for crypto exchanges like Kraken, Gemini and Bullish. It is difficult to not conclude that cryptocurrencies and digital assets are becoming respectable. By many estimates, almost half of the professionals working in crypto and digital assets come from TradFi capital markets, top tier banks to asset managers. There has always been somewhat of career risk for TradFi talent working in crypto, especially enduring the hostility by some policymakers and regulators over the past few years. Institutional investment is now piling in crypto - it is estimated that institutions now hold 25% of the U.S. bitcoin ETF market - and this is making crypto more respectable and driving a requirement for TradFi talent that is willing to stake its career on working in the burgeoning digital assets industry. New research by leading European digital assets hedge fund Nickel Digital Asset Management shows that is changing. Nickel Digital itself was founded by an alumnus from Bankers Trust, Goldman Sachs, and JP Morgan. The research surveyed institutional investors and wealth managers in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Singapore, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates who collectively manage over $1 trillion in assets. More than half (53%) surveyed believe the career risk for executives in the crypto industry has fallen under the Trump Presidency with 17% saying it has significantly reduced. Around a third (33%) say the risk has increased with only 1% say it has significantly increased. Mitigating career risks depends largely on regulation of the sector. More than four out of five (83%) questioned said it is extremely or very important in reducing career risk when investing in digital assets with 30% saying it is extremely important. Anatoly Crachilov, ceo and founding partner at Nickel Digital, says, “The mainstream adoption of digital assets pioneered by firms such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Goldman, has been turbo-charged by the Trump presidency and the fear of career risk is receding, driving greater engagement by traditional allocators. “Robust regulation is central to the growth of the sector but there are more practical issues to be addressed including deeper liquidity and improvements to market infrastructure that will mitigate counterparty risks concerns.” Defined benefit and hybrid pension scheme specialist Cartwright has announced the first bitcoin allocation into the investment portfolio of an unnamed U.K. pension scheme. It described the investment as “a strategic move that, not only offers diversification, but also taps into an asset class with a unique asymmetric risk-return profile.” The Cartwright announcement was denounced as “deeply irresponsible” by some commentators, pointing to the cautionary tale of the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan writing down its $95 million investment in FTX following its bankruptcy. This criticism is misplaced as the FTX bankruptcy was down to the founders committing fraud on a grand scale, and is nothing to do with cryptocurrencies or new blockchain digital technologies. U.S. pension schemes however are not worried. Schemes in Wisconsin and Michigan are major investors in crypto ETFs which are regulated. Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Oklahoma are looking at establishing bitcoin reserves. Zodia Markets Ireland chair Michael Walsh estimates that 1% of crypto ETFs are being bought by U.S. pension funds which sounds small, and adds “1% of a $100 billion market might not seem significant but it represents over a billion dollars with substantial room for growth.” The growth potential in the crypto ETF market is obvious and the direction of travel seems to be up. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently bought $970 million Bitcoin in a day and now holds over $56 billion in assets. It is estimated to hold 3% of the total global supply of bitcoin. Blackrock’s IBIT is the one of the hottest ETF tickets in the market, overtaking its S&P 500 ETF in annual revenue. BlackRock ceo Larry Fink has talked about bitcoin replacing the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency due to potential concerns about rising U.S. Government debt, especially following the fresh passage of the new budget bill. With record U.S. debt, weak bond auctions, and the weakest dollar since the 1970s, the threat of the U.S. debt default is looming on the mind of foreign debt holders, with some foreign asset managers publicly stating they are now overweight in both U.S. debt and equity. The Nickel Digital research among firms already invested in digital assets shows growth in crypto markets is driving increased respectability. Markets can drift but as long as they are not crashing there is a continuing confidence that builds over the the longer-term. Nearly nine out of 10 (88%) questioned say they will increase their level of investment in digital assets this year, building on the 67% who said they increased investment in the last year. They expect major investor groups to follow suit. Around 70% predict pension funds will dramatically increase investment in digital assets over the next two years while 57% believe wealth managers will dramatically increase investment and 40% say the same about family offices. Most are increasingly positive about the outlook for digital assets as they increase their understanding of the industry with 90% positive on digital assets as an asset class and 13% saying they are very positive. None of the organisations surveyed were negative on the current market with 10% saying they were neutral. Part of the growing confidence is due to deeper engagement with the digital asset industry and a greater understanding of the investment benefits beyond investment returns. Nickel Digital’s research asked professional investors to rank the benefits of investing in the industry. The ability to trade 24/7 and the efficiency of the DeFi ecosystem are rated as the two major benefits of investing in the sector ahead of the prospect of better returns than other asset classes, which was rated third. Capital appreciation and the role of digital assets as a hedge against currency depreciation were ranked fourth and fifth ahead of yield opportunities and their role as a hedge against inflation. Arbitrage opportunities and low correlation to other asset classes were ranked eighth and ninth. Crachilov stresses the importance of regulation saying, "Regulators play a critical role in supporting the evolution of the digital asset sector. While no regulatory framework can eliminate all possible risks, investors appreciate value of global regulators' drive for transparency, accountability, while, at the same time, providing constructive approach to regulation in the crypto sector." The research found 88% believe the risk of another FTX-style scandal has been reduced with more than a third (35%) saying it has fallen sharply. A similar study in July 2024 by Nickel Digital found 75% believed the risk had dropped with 20% saying it had fallen sharply. Confidence in regulation and growing respectability is encouraging more firms to engage. 43% of institutional investors and wealth managers questioned believe there will be a dramatic increase in traditional financial firms launching crypto funds and investment solutions over the next two years. That increasing involvement by traditional institutions is good news for the sector with nearly one in five (18%) say the involvement of major firms is very positive for the sector and 74% saying it’s quite positive. Performance is key – investors questioned believe crypto will be one of their top five asset classes for risk-adjusted returns over the next five years. Private equity was the next most selected followed by emerging market (EM) equities – EMs have become popular destinations for those asset allocators overweight in U.S. equities. Crypto’s journey to respectability has been a long one. There will be bumps in the road ahead, though the threat of the next crypto winter in the short term appears a lower probability to most crypto analysts and pundits. Many TrandFi analysts and pundits are not as sure they can say same the same about traditional markets.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Canadian dessert chain La Diperie is sending some Arctic chill down to the West Village. The Montreal-based La Diperie, known for its customizable dipped ice cream and treats, has signed a 10-year lease for 1,200 square feet at Midwood Investment and Development’s 56 Seventh Avenue, according to tenant broker RJBRE. Asking rent was $150 per square foot. The deal represents the dessert chain’s first location in New York City, following 65 stores across Canada and a spot in St. Petersburg, Fla., according to its website. La Diperie’s new store between West 13th and West 14th streets will be operated by Kishan and Ashlesha Patel and is slated to open early next year, according to the New York Business Journal, which first reported the news. “This marks La Diperie’s first New York location, and a key step in their U.S. expansion,” RJBRE’s Abraham Smouha, who brokered the deal for the tenant along with Richard Bailey, said in a statement to Commercial Observer. “We’re excited to bring their unique soft-serve experience to one of New York City’s most dynamic corridors,” Smouha added. Capricorn Retail Advisors’ Andrew Schulman, Ryan Schimel and Audrey Hersch represented the landlord in the deal. Schulman and spokespeople for La Diperie and Midwood did not immediately respond to requests for comment. La Diperie’s West Village spot will be at the base of the 159-unit Candela Tower, which Midwood bought from BlackRock Realty Advisors in May 2022 for $102 million, property records show. Other retail tenants at 56 Seventh Avenue include coffee shop Birch Coffee and health food store Elm Wellness. Isabelle Durso can be reached at idurso@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Wall Street Moves on-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global
URL: http://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/2025/wall-street-moves-on-chain-as-tokenization-of-us-stocks-goes-global/

Highlights Major financial players like J.P. Morgan, Kraken and Robinhood are tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) — from carbon credits to U.S. equities. Tokenized assets, often offered through offshore entities, allow for fractional ownership, instant settlement and around-the-clock trading. Despite momentum, regulators in the U.S. and Europe have yet to clarify how tokenized securities fit into existing legal frameworks, raising concerns over investor protection, jurisdiction and systemic risk. One of the overarching themes of 2025, outside of its notable levels of uncertainty, is the convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto markets.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ That theme got a shot in the arm this week, with the news Wednesday (July 2) that J.P. Morgan is reportedly developing a new service to tokenize carbon credits, while on Monday (June 30), crypto exchange Kraken unveiled its long-anticipated platform allowing retail investors to buy tokenized versions of major U.S. equities. That same day, Robinhood also announced it was rolling out tokenized stocks to a select cohort of international users. Crucially, Kraken’s own offerings were similarly available only for eligible non-U.S. clients. While the initiatives may appear distinct, ranging from environmental credits to fractionalized equity exposure, the connective tissue is the same. Moving traditional financial services onto the blockchain. These moves represent a coordinated push by financial giants to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs), sidestep traditional clearing infrastructure, and begin transitioning toward 24/7, programmable trading markets. But these rapid developments also raise existential questions for market regulators and central intermediaries. Are tokenized securities complementary to, or competitive with, traditional capital markets? Can existing legal frameworks scale across these hybrid asset classes? And who bears responsibility when decentralized and centralized elements collide? Read more: The Digital Asset Primer: Why Equity Markets Are Being Tokenized Tokenization, long the buzzword of blockchain evangelists, has entered its next phase. While initial coin offerings (ICOs) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) dominated earlier narratives, the current wave of interest centers around tangible, regulated assets — stocks, bonds, commodities and now carbon credits. Even BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone on record alleging that all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” Kraken and Robinhood’s own tokenized equities operate through offshore subsidiaries to remain compliant with current U.S. laws. These tokenized shares are backed 1:1 by real stocks custodied by licensed brokerages. The twist? Instead of trading through traditional clearinghouses on a T+2 settlement basis, these assets can now be exchanged 24/7 on blockchain rails, with near-instant settlement and global reach. For retail investors, especially outside the U.S., this offers fractional ownership of American blue-chip stocks without intermediaries or time zone constraints. For institutions, it hints at a future where securities can be programmed with smart contracts, auto-execute dividends and facilitate compliance in real time. PYMNTS explored this topic earlier in the month in an interview with Brett McLain, head of payments and blockchain at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. “The tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto … making those real-world assets more accessible globally to consumers,” McLain said. “We want to see that grow into other things like real estate and other tangible assets.” See also: What Treasury Teams Can Learn From Central Banks’ Tokenization Projects Still, these launches come amid intensifying efforts by U.S. and European regulators to bring coherence to the digital asset ecosystem. And despite the momentum, the regulatory picture remains murky. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not offered formal guidance on tokenized versions of registered securities traded offshore. These assets are typically structured as derivatives or depositary receipts, akin to synthetic products like CFDs and are not true equities in the traditional sense. As with many innovations, there can be a fine line between democratizing access and weakening safeguards. “These ‘OpenAI tokens’ are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it. Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval—we did not approve any transfer. Please be careful,” tweeted OpenAI’s press account on X (formerly Twitter). Still, regulatory momentum is gathering in the U.S. and PYMNTS covered how Republican senators at the end of last month (June 24) unveiled a set of principles to serve as a framework for the development of legislation for digital assets and crypto markets. “Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin said in an interview with PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster published April 7. “Without a federal framework, it is incredibly difficult for financial services firms and international enterprises to really get comfortable.” Wall Street Moves on-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global European Commission Delays Release of AI Act’s Code of Practice Ford, JPMorgan, Amazon Executives Predict Deep Job Cuts as AI Advances Worldpay Launches Domestic Acquiring Capabilities in Thailand We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson.

Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) first ran for state office in 2019, her campaign was funded almost entirely by small-dollar donors. As Crockett increased in prominence, however, cryptocurrency moguls, corporations, union bosses, and even foreign governments have lined up to shower her with resources. Crockett, who got her start practicing law, ran to represent a portion of Austin in the Texas House of Representatives in 2020. Early on, her state-level campaign counted on local individuals giving at most a couple hundred dollars apiece to support her. However, as she picked up steam, organized labor and business interests began cutting checks to her political committee as well. Crockett’s biggest financial windfall came during the 2022 election season when super PACs linked to cryptocurrency industry leaders like the since-disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried pumped millions into supporting her bid to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson. Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

Recommended Stories Zohran Mamdani took money from groups that help illegal immigrants avoid deportation Trump threatens to sue New York Times and CNN over Iran strike coverage Google promoted content from hijacked local news website posting pro-China content Since winning election to the House, Crockett has continued to enjoy contributions from corporate and union PACs. Foreign governments have also jumped aboard, with India, the United Arab Emirates, and a nonprofit group linked to the Qatari government all paying for Crockett and her family to go on expensive trips abroad, according to congressional disclosures. Crockett has emerged as a Democratic firebrand, frequently going viral for her spats with Republicans. Most recently, she has caught criticism for referring to Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX), who is wheelchair-bound, as “Governor Hot Wheels.” Crockett later argued that the title was not related to the governor’s disability, a claim that was undercut after the Washington Free Beacon reported that she had “liked” content on Facebook making fun of Abbott’s paralysis. The sophomore congresswoman’s jab at Abbott is just one among her many controversial remarks, including criticizing Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) for being in an interracial marriage. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) speaks during the Democratic National Convention on Monday, Aug. 19, 2024, in Chicago. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast) When it comes to policy, Crockett identifies as a progressive. For instance, the congresswoman has repeatedly railed against “corporate greed” and praised her colleagues for standing up against “corporate interests.” Campaign finance records, however, show that Crockett has accepted over $370,000 in federal contributions from PACs representing corporations or business associations since 2022. Her donors include pharmaceutical giants such as AbbVie and Gilead Sciences, financial services firms such as BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, major defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and RTX, and household names such as McDonald’s, Home Depot, CVS, Verizon, and Toyota. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, along with other major unions, has also provided financial support to Crockett’s state and federal campaigns. Even before she took office, Protect our Future PAC and WEB3 Forward, two PACs funded by crypto moguls such as Bankman-Fried, Ben Horowitz, and Marc Andreessen, spent well over $2 million supporting Crockett’s campaign during a heated Democratic primary. Crockett’s stated disdain for corporate influence goes back to her time running for state office. In a July 10, 2020, tweet, Crockett claimed to have taken zero dollars from corporate PACs while her opposition had accepted nearly $200,000. A campaign finance disclosure covering the period between July 5 and Dec. 31, 2020, however, shows that Crockett accepted thousands in corporate PAC dollars. This means that her tweet was either inaccurate or she began accepting corporate cash shortly after attacking her opponent for doing so. While Crockett has long accepted contributions from corporate PACs, gifts from foreigners are new to her. Between Feb. 21 and 27, 2023, Crockett embarked on a trip to tour Doha, the capital of Qatar. The jaunt, which congressional records show cost over $17,000, was paid for by the United States-Qatar Business Council, a trade association with links to the Qatari government. Sheikha Mayes bint Hamad Al Thani, a member of Qatar’s royal family, is the Qatari managing director of the organization. Additionally, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council maintains a partnership with the Gulf Times, a Qatari state-run news outlet.

Over the course of the trip, the U.S.-Qatar Business Council arranged multiple meetings between Crockett and high-ranking members of the Qatari government. Four other members of Congress — three Republicans and a Democrat — were also invited on the trip.

Title: BlackRock Wants Bitcoin Higher—IBIT Now Out-Earns Their S&P 500 Fund
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-higher-ibit-out-earns-sp-500-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T13:30:01Z
Full Content:
BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has surpassed the firm’s long-established iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) in annual revenue generation. The development, first highlighted in a June 2 report by Bloomberg, marks a milestone moment for institutional adoption and exposes a growing financial incentive among traditional giants to see BTC’s price rise. Despite being a fraction of IVV’s size in terms of assets under management, IBIT has now overtaken it in fee revenue. IBIT currently manages approximately $75 billion in assets and charges a 0.25% fee, generating around $187.2 million in estimated annual fees. In contrast, IVV, BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 tracker, holds $624 billion but charges just 0.03%, netting about $187.1 million in fees. As Bloomberg’s Isabelle Lee put it, “a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund now generates more revenue than [BlackRock’s] signature tracker of the S&P 500 Index.” This revenue discrepancy, despite IVV’s immense asset base, stems from the sheer profitability of managing BTC exposure in an ETF wrapper, particularly given IBIT’s higher fee structure and the velocity of capital inflows it has witnessed. The fund has recorded inflows in all but one of the past 18 months and now holds over 55% of all US spot Bitcoin ETF assets. The explosive growth of IBIT is closely tied to the January 2024 decision by US regulators to approve spot ETFs, a watershed moment that brought Bitcoin further into the financial mainstream. This regulatory opening has unleashed a torrent of institutional capital, with hedge funds, pensions, family offices, and banks now actively allocating to Bitcoin in SEC-compliant vehicles. Market commentators were quick to highlight the implications. Anthony Pompliano noted succinctly on X: “BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF drives more revenue than its S&P 500 fund. Bitcoin has Wall Street’s full, undivided attention now.” Crypto analyst Jacob Canfield provided a more detailed financial interpretation, posting: “Blackrock makes more money the higher the price of Bitcoin goes, just an FYI. (not financial advice)” He elaborated further: “Some people don’t seem to understand my meaning. Blackrock makes 0.25% fees on their IBIT ETF. That currently translates to $184 million in annual revenue (just for custody) and it’s based on AUM (assets under management). That means if the price of Bitcoin goes to $1,000,000 (a 10X from here), they will make $1.84 billion per year in fees. This is why Blackrock is incentivized by higher prices in Bitcoin.” Canfield’s logic lays bare the core economic engine at work: BlackRock’s revenue from IBIT is a direct function of the BTC market price. Since ETF fees are derived as a percentage of AUM, any appreciation in price amplifies the dollar-denominated value of the assets under custody—and, by extension, BlackRock’s fee income. At current rates, each doubling of the BTC price could potentially yield nearly double the revenue for IBIT, assuming static inflows. The broader implication is profound: BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with nearly $10 trillion under management, is now structurally aligned with Bitcoin’s success. That alignment goes beyond product strategy or public messaging—it is embedded in fee economics. At press time, BTC traded at $109,240. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Solana’s first staking ETF outpaces XRP and ETH futures in opening day performance

SSK's debut day outshines contenders, ranking in top 1% of ETF launches with $33 million in trading volume. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Solana’s institutional appeal has surged, with data showing significant growth in both its staking Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and Solana CME futures markets. The impressive performance translated into a 5% rise in SOL’s value in the last 24 hours to $155 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, known as SSK, achieved an impressive debut on June 2, drawing $12 million in inflows and generating $33 million in trading volume. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted that SSK’s first-day performance ranked in the top 1% for new ETF launches. Balchunas noted that the SSK’s $33 million trading volume on its opening day was exceptional, far outpacing the Solana and XRP futures ETFs. While the volume was much lower than Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, the result still indicates a robust investor interest in Solana. The analyst speculated that if the fund maintains its strong momentum, it could reach $10 million in assets under management by close of play today. As the first spot Solana ETF and the first staking ETF in the US, SSK offers a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to Solana while benefiting from staking yields. The fund aims to stake at least half of its assets to provide consistent yields to investors. However, SSK differs from the Bitcoin ETFs managed by BlackRock and others. SSK uses an Investment Company Act of 1940 structure, keeping more than 40 % of assets in foreign SOL ETPs to satisfy diversification rules. That makes it slightly different from the 33-Act spot Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs, but the economic exposure is similar. VanEck, 21Shares, and others are still awaiting SEC approval on ‘true’ spot Solana ETFs, with analysts giving ~95 % odds they will clear by year-end. Meanwhile, the demand for Solana exposure is also evident in the performance of Solana CME futures. According to Coinglass data, open interest in these futures surged 13%, reaching an all-time high of $167 million. This marks a significant increase in institutional interest since Solana futures were first listed on the CME platform in March. The CME offers two types of Solana futures contracts, including the standard contracts (representing 500 SOL) and retail-friendly “micro” contracts (representing 25 SOL). These contracts are settled in cash rather than physical Solana, offering institutions a regulated method for gaining Solana exposure. The spike in open interest illustrates the rising institutional appetite for Solana-related financial products. However, this increased liquidity also brings the potential for greater volatility, as leveraged positions can lead to sharp price movements. The combination of a successful ETF launch and strong futures market activity is a clear signal of Solana’s growing institutional traction. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Antitrust enforcer Gail Slater on American innovation: ‘We can win the AI race against the Chinese without becoming like China’
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/03/business/doj-antitrust-chief-is-betting-american-tech-will-beat-china/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Gail Slater, Donald Trump’s head of antitrust, is tasked with a formidable agenda that requires precision: Foster a business-friendly environment that lets tech companies stay big enough to compete with China while ensuring they don’t become excessively dominant. “It’s about enforcing antitrust robustly in a way that works for all Americans … that’s my starting point,” Slater, 53, told me in her first interview since taking on her role as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice a little over 100 days ago. Slater took over a serious docket of cases that includes suits against Google, in regards to search and ad tech; Apple, for its smartphone market dominance; Visa, in relation to debit card payment processing; and Live Nation/Ticketmaster and its live entertainment business. While she won’t comment on the status of those cases, she’s been a key advisor urging Trump to stay the course on antitrust enforcement — despite tech companies’ efforts to sway him. (When I asked how frequently she discusses agenda with President Trump, she told me, “We get a lot of signals from the White House in the form of Executive Orders.”) Slater is deeply committed and believes aggressive antitrust enforcement can benefit consumers in countless ways — even on seemingly unrelated issues. “Speech and the censorship of speech can be downstream of [tech companies] market power,” she noted. Not everyone on the right agrees with her. Some Republicans, like Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), believe the US government should tread lightly with tech companies. They worry that too much regulation could unintentionally give China a dangerous advantage when it comes to artificial intelligence. But Slater feels antitrust efforts could actually give the US a leg-up. “Companies competing against one another innovate. That’s the free market at its finest,” she explained. “We can win the AI race against the Chinese without becoming like China… we will win the global race to AI the American way.” Bringing cases against massive companies can cost millions, making Slater’s job — at a time when everyone in the federal government is under the gun to cut costs — especially challenging. “The big tech cases alone are a huge, huge lift, both from a human resource standpoint, a scale standpoint when it comes to documents and experts and how we put those cases on a trial,” Slater said. This story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC’s power players (and those who aspire to be). Her efforts, she said, have to be “low resource, high return on investment things.” And even though she is focused on ending unfair monopolies, she’s also trying to implement as many pro-business policies as she can. On the front end, Slater is now allowing early terminations to the (previously) mandatory 30-day waiting period for mergers to close on deals the DOJ deems benign. Since taking the helm, she has granted 58 of 322 filings, worth $71 billion. “In particular, we are taking settlements in merger cases where the previous administration took none,” she said. At the back end of deals, she has embraced the use of consent decrees — allowing parties to resolve competitive overlaps by divesting assets to qualified buyers, a practice the prior administration largely avoided. “We listened hard to concerns that Wall Street and others had about the policy of the prior administration on deal flow,” she told me of efforts to simplify rules where she can. “We inherited a historic docket and we want to be responsible stewards of that, But we’re also setting [the agenda] by fixing the merger review process to make it more transparent, to make work better for deal makers.” Slater, who is soft-spoken, jokes “this is me raising my voice” when talking about the efforts they’ve already made to cut over-regulation. She has also teamed up with the Federal Trade Commission to eradicate what she describes as “useless” regulations. “We opened up a docket and we said to anybody interested with expertise in the area, tell us the regulations that you’re aware that are hindering competition — and the ways in which that could be fixed. Because we want to support free market competition,” Slater said. “That’s the goal here.” Another tool is using amicus briefs to strategically influence federal court cases, like they have done in Texas v. BlackRock — a high-profile antitrust lawsuit where states allege major investors like BlackRock colluded to reduce coal production, raising energy prices. She said it is a way of supporting American companies and administration policies with relatively inexpensive but high-impact interventions. Slater, who was born in Dublin and studied at Oxford, moved to the US in 2003 and worked as a trial attorney at the FTC for a decade. She held positions at the Internet Association, Fox Corporation, Roku and, during the first Trump administration, the National Economic Council, before advising JD Vance on antitrust issues while he was an Ohio senator. She’s excited moving beyond the cases left to her by her predecessor. “A priority for me is health care,” she told me. “We’re looking to set a positive agenda around drug pricing and health care more broadly.

Ethereum finds its footing, but is it enough for lift-off? As the broader market shifts back into bullish territory, short-sellers are being systematically flushed out across major assets. Ethereum [ETH] followed suit. A sharp 6.78% daily gain on the 2nd of July drove ETH back to the $2,600 level, liquidating nearly $90 million in short positions in the process. The real question now is whether ETH can convert this reclaimed level into a springboard for continuation. Risk appetite appears to be returning, elevating the stakes for Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum’s daily structure reveals a clear inflection point. On the 12th of June, Open Interest (OI) hit a record $41.75 billion, coinciding with ETH reclaiming the $2,800 level for the first time since February. However, beneath the surface, stress signals began to emerge. Despite steady spot demand, the number of whale wallets holding more than 10,000 ETH dropped to just 884, marking its lowest level since 2016. This sharp decline triggered aggressive deleveraging, with over $20 billion in OI unwound in under three weeks. The aftermath was a classic bull trap. While Bitcoin[BTC] corrected 10.8% over the following two weeks, ETH plunged 24.6% to $2,113. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Yet, a rebound that followed marked a key shift in price behavior. ETH rallied 8.28% the very next day and slipped into a tight holding pattern between $2,400 and $2,500 for ten straight sessions. This kind of sideways action after a major flush often hints at quiet accumulation. If that’s what’s playing out here, Ethereum’s clean reclaim of the $2,600 level could represent a strategic pivot, laying the foundation for a sustained breakout with real positioning behind it. As Ethereum pushes through a critical supply overhang, market structure enters a sensitive zone. At the time of writing, Binance’s Long/Short Ratio was locked at 50:50. That kind of balance rarely lasts, and if bears sense weakness or holding pressure, shorts could quickly take over. This makes order book behavior especially important to watch. On the 2nd of July alone, whales rotated over $3 billion in ETH liquidity: 45,155 ETH flowed out of Kraken, while 60,000 ETH moved from Arbitrum to Binance. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, BlackRock continues to accumulate quietly, having added ETH-related positions on 29 of the last thirty trading days. Structurally, Ethereum’s fundamentals are heating up too. Daily transactions have surged to 1.45 million, on par with 2021 bull cycle peaks, while DeFi lending is up 43% this quarter, reflecting renewed capital deployment. This backdrop reinforces that Ethereum’s breakout above $2,600 is structurally driven. If sustained, it sets the stage for another short squeeze, potentially targeting a move toward $2,800.

Title: First Solana ETF Goes Live, Hinting At A Potential Boom For Altcoin Funds

Time Published: 2025-07-03T09:00:10Z

The altcoin market is making significant inroads into traditional finance, with the recent launch of the first Solana ETF on the Cboe BZX stock exchange in Chicago. Named the REX-Osprey SOL and Staking ETF, this fund is designed for investors looking to gain exposure to Solana. In addition to tracking Solana’s price movements, the fund also offers a variable monthly dividend, currently set at 7.3%. Following this Solana ETF debut on Wednesday, SOL’s price surged by 2%, reaching around $152, while the investment vehicle attracted about $20 million in inflows by midday, as noted by Greg King, CEO of REX Financial. This launch marks a notable shift in how retail investors can access cryptocurrency assets, particularly at a time when many brokerages, such as Vanguard, do not facilitate direct purchases on crypto exchanges. The emergence of cryptocurrency ETFs, which serve as traditional market wrappers for digital assets, is increasingly appealing to both individual and institutional investors. Initially perceived as niche products, the introduction of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year have notably paved the way for broader acceptance of the crypto market, culminating in the arrival of Solana’s fund. These ETFs not only provide a means for new investors to enter the crypto space but also allow for portfolio diversification without the need to navigate the complexities of direct cryptocurrency purchases. For years, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stymied the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over potential market manipulation. However, a pivotal ruling in October 2023 deemed the SEC’s rejections of Grayscale’s application for a Bitcoin ETF “arbitrary and capricious,” leading to a wave of new products in early 2024. Major financial players, including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, entered the market with their own spot Bitcoin ETFs, contributing to an influx of nearly $50 billion into these investment vehicles. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock and other firms rolled out Ethereum ETFs in July 2024, prompting additional applications for various other cryptocurrencies such as XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Litecoin (LTC), with Solana included. King noted that under a more favorable regulatory environment with President Donald Trump’s approach toward digital assets, a significant increase in ETF approvals from the SEC could be expected, particularly as the financial landscape shifts with the current administration. As reported by Bitcoinist on Tuesday, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas have raised their projections for the approval of single-asset spot crypto ETFs, now estimating a 95% chance of approval by the end of 2025. Seyffart expressed optimism about a forthcoming wave of new exchange-traded funds in the latter half of 2025, signaling a transformative period for the integration of cryptocurrency into mainstream finance.

Title: UK bond rout draws Truss comparisons
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0703/1521608-uk-bond-rout-draws-truss-comparisons/

British government bonds tumbled sharply yesterday as a tearful appearance by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in parliament a day after the government backed down on its welfare reforms reignited concern over Britain's finances. Reeves was attending Prime Minister's Questions following the government's decision to sharply scale back plans to cut benefits. The sharp plunge in British assets immediately drew comparisons with Liz Truss' short-lived premiership nearly three years ago, which was derailed by a bond market selloff. Investors are monitoring Reeves' status after the UK government's reversal on welfare reforms meant the plans would no longer save taxpayers any money, shredding the margin Britain relies on to meet its fiscal rules. The welfare reform U-turn was "signalling that the Labour Party is a lot less concerned about what the gilt market thinks," said Gordon Shannon, portfolio manager, TwentyFour Asset Management. "I would have thought it was seared into politicians' memories what happened to Liz Truss," he added. The yield on the 10-year government bond, or gilt, rose as much as 22 basis points on the day at one point, to 4.681%, as investors ditched British debt. It then recovered somewhat to 4.60%. At its peak, the benchmark yield was set for its largest one-day jump since October 2022, the aftermath of Truss' chaotic package of large, unfunded tax cuts that scuttled her premiership. During the depths of the 2022 crisis, the yield on the 10-year gilt rose by 50 bps in a single day at one point. The selloff also hit very long dated gilts, and 30-year yields rose 17 basis points. "The latest headline would suggest more uncertainty with regards to the current government," said Simon Blundel, head of European fundamental fixed income investments at BlackRock.

Investors in bonds around the world are growing increasingly nervous about government deficits from Japan to the US, with Britain seen as among the more vulnerable. Earlier yesterday, British assets were trading slightly lower, but the selloff intensified rapidly after Reeves appeared alongside Prime Minister Kier Starmer during the weekly prime minister's questions looking exhausted and upset. Traders also focused on comments from Starmer seemingly not endorsing Reeves, though Starmer's press secretary later said Reeves has his full support, and she was upset because of "a personal matter". Reeves has repeatedly emphasised her commitment to self-imposed fiscal rules, limiting the amount Britain will borrow, and, analysts said, yesterday's market moves reflected fears that she would be replaced, creating even more uncertainty. Reeves has also been blamed by some Labour members of parliament for pushing for billions of pounds of savings that were described as cruel and targeting the most vulnerable. Sterling dropped around 1% against the dollar and also weakened sharply against the euro, which rose 0.8% to its highest on the pound in two months. Britain's domestically focused mid-cap index was down 1.3% on the day, sharply underperforming European stocks. "The deficit is going to have to be closed somehow, clearly the signal from yesterday is that can't come from substantial spending cuts, I don’t think it’s possible for the government to borrow the money, that leaves tax rises," Nick Rees, head of macro research at Monex Europe, said. "It's a pretty ugly outlook for sterling," he added. Accreditation: Reuters © RTÉ 2025. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Jio-Blackrock will expand Indian stock market, but not a threat to first-generation founders, says Zerodhas Nitin Kamath

New Delhi [India], : If any company can expand the current market, it is Jio-Blackrock with its huge distribution network, but it will not be a threat to first generation founders noted online brokerage platform Zerodha's Chief Executive Officer , Nithin Kamath, on the social media platform 'X'.Nithin Kamath via his post on 'X' expressed optimism regarding the same. He said, "Many people asked me about Jio-BlackRock getting a stockbroking license. Firstly, this is great news." Kamath further added that, "If anyone can expand the markets beyond the top 10 crore Indians, it's probably Jio with all its distribution might."However, he also raised concerns about the expansion of the Indian stock market. "The biggest issue for the Indian markets is a lack of breadth in participation. We're largely limited to the top 10 crore Indians," he said.Kamath also shared his opinion on what his thoughts are on broking. He believes that Zerodha is not something which is following 'vanity metrics' and the principle online brokerage platform is to 'stay to stay profitable.' "At the heart of our philosophy is to always do the right thing for customers," Nithin Kamath said. Kamath also emphasised that Zerodha's strategy is not to pressure consumers to trade and to make sure that there are no obtrusive notifications, dark patterns, etc., adding that customers who trade less have a better chance of long-term success. However, Nithin Kamath also reflected on the role of other financial services businesses in the sector, who are constantly seeking to grow their business at any cost. "And yeah, I still feel our real competition is going to be more from first-generation founders who are running, breathing, and always thinking about broking. I somehow don't feel it will really come from incumbents. This is not a business where having deep pockets means you have a large moat," said Nithin Kamath.

ByForbes Press Releases ByForbes Press Releases, Forbes Staff. Red Bull’s Chalerm Yoovidhya & family retain top spot SINGAPORE (July 3, 2025) – The combined wealth of tycoons on the 2025 Forbes list of Thailand’s 50 Richest rose more than 11% to US$170.5 billion, despite slower-than-expected economic growth amid trade tensions and mounting political uncertainty. The complete list can be found here, as well as in the July issue of Forbes Asia and the August issue of Forbes Thailand. Overall, the net worths of nearly half the listees were up with the biggest dollar jump—$8.5 billion—recorded by the Red Bull family, led by Chalerm Yoovidhya. In the No. 1 position for the second year in a row, their wealth skyrocketed to a record $44.5 billion as annual revenue of the energy drinks giant rose to €11.2 billion ($12.9 billion) in 2024 on worldwide sales of nearly 13 billion cans. The Chearavanont brothers of the Charoen Pokphand group retained their position as the country’s second-richest with their net worth up by 23% to $35.7 billion. The group is doubling down on digital infrastructure, investing $1 billion with BlackRock to build data centers. The group’s fintech unit Ascend Money recently got approval to set up a virtual bank. Energy-and-telecoms tycoon Sarath Ratanavadi climbed two spots to No. 3 for the first time with $12 billion, up from $9.2 billion last year. Completing the merger between his Gulf Energy Development and Intouch Holdings and listing the combined entity in April as Gulf Development powered his ascent. Taking the No. 4 spot is beverage tycoon Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi, whose net worth was relatively flat at $10.5 billion. In a key move, the patriarch transferred some holdings to his five children but being the group founder, the fortune continues to be listed under his name. Rounding out the top five on the list is the Central Group’s Chirathivat family, who saw their wealth decline 13% to $8.6 billion, as weak consumer sentiment impacted the retail sector. A total of 19 listees faced a downdraft. Coffee magnate Prayudh Mahagitsiri’s (No. 18, $1.4 billion) wealth took a hit as his PM Group’s long-standing joint venture with Nestle ended. Two patriarchs passed away since the last ranking: Vanich Chaiyawan, chairman emeritus of Thai Life; and Pongsak Viddayakorn, cofounder of Bangkok Dusit Medical Services, who went on to build a separate healthcare business under Principal Capital. Their fortunes are now listed under the Chaiyawan family (No. 6, $4.2 billion) and the Viddayakorn family (No. 30, $1.1 billion). Four people fell from the ranks, including renewable energy magnate Somphote Ahunai, whose Energy Absolute faced financial stress. The minimum net worth to qualify for the list dropped to $420 million from last year’s $550 million. The top 10 richest in Thailand are: This list was compiled using shareholding and financial information obtained from the families and individuals, stock exchanges and analysts, the Stock Exchange of Thailand and regulatory agencies. Unlike the Forbes World’s Billionaires list rankings, this list encompasses family fortunes, including those shared among extended families of multiple generations. Public fortunes were calculated based on stock prices and exchange rates as on June 13. Private companies were valued based on comparisons with similar companies that are publicly traded. The list can also include foreign citizens with business, residential or other ties to the country, or citizens who don’t reside in the country but have significant business or other ties to the country.
