Both platforms cover financial and business news as well as sport and… More Info The City minister has reaffirmed the government’s ambition for a green transition across the financial services sector, despite the industry pivoting on climate priorities. Speaking at City Week on Monday, Emma Reynolds said: “The UK has a world leading financial and related professional services ecosystem and the research that is needed to integrate sustainable finance.” Reynolds said the Treasury’s upcoming Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy – a key pillar in the government’s economic agenda – will help foster the UK’s push to “transition finance” through honing in on skills as one of five key areas. But this comes amid a widespread retreat from the financial services sector. The banking industry has been at the forefront of a green row back, with Barclays and Natwest dropping climate targets from their annual bonus schemes for senior executives. Meanwhile, Europe’s biggest lender HSBC slapped a 20-year delay on its net zero target. Energy secretary Ed Miliband has touted plans to “transform” the UK’s financial services sector “into a global hub for green investment”. Whilst London is a leader in the area, City AM reported earlier this year green finance ratings across financial sectors were dramatically reducing. Despite topping the 15th edition of Z/Yen Global Green Finance Index, London’s rating reduced 36 points to 598. The Treasury has said the financial services growth strategy, set to be published on July 15, will “shape the type of growth being pursued, and support net zero, regional growth, and economic security and resilience”. Reynolds, who is steering the Treasury’s plans, said the upcoming COP30 in Brazil will be crucial to green ambitions following last years agreement where governments pledged to scale up climate finance into developing countries to $1.3 trillion per year by 2035. “We think that in order to make this a success, the road map must ensure that it’s based on several principles. It must be inclusive, it must have stability, and it must have focus,” the City minister added. But top names across the sector have vocalised concerns efforts in green finance have stalled. Sandra Boss, the UK Chair at Blackrock, said during a at City Week panel whilst “the need” for investing in renewable energy was “undeniable,” the energy transition was progressing “slower than hoped”. The waning commitment to green finance is being witnessed on a global scale and many have pointed to President Donald Trump’s return to the White House as a key catalyst. One of Trump’s first executive orders following his inauguration in both 2017 and 2025 was to withdraw the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. The document encourages global co-operation to limit the causes of global warming. The World Bank – an international development organisation owned by 187 countries – softened its climate approach after the US took a chainsaw to climate programs.

Title: ETF Expert Says Ripple Closing This Chapter Clears The Way For XRP ETF, BlackRock To Join The Race?

Nate Geraci, the president of the ETF store, has weighed in on what Ripple’s decision to drop its cross appeal could mean for XRP ETFs. He also raised the possibility of BlackRock joining the ETF race now that the lawsuit is ending. In an X post, Nate Geraci stated that a closed chapter on the XRP lawsuit clears the way for a spot XRP ETF. His statement suggested that the SEC could now move to approve the applications for issuers to offer this fund. Geraci was reacting to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s announcement of his firm’s decision to drop its cross-appeal against the SEC. Bitcoinist reported that Garlinghouse stated that Ripple is dropping its cross-appeal and that the SEC is expected to drop its appeal, which will put an end to the XRP lawsuit. He added that they are closing this chapter and focusing on building the Internet of Value. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart had earlier in the year mentioned how the lawsuit impacts an XRP ETF. In an X post, Seyffart opined back then that there is unlikely to be an XRP ETF until the whole XRP lawsuit between the SEC and Ripple is settled. He added that the Commission needed to “untangle that mess” before it possibly proceeds to approve these ETFs. Indeed, the SEC has, up till now, continued to delay its decision on these funds and has yet to provide comments. This is unlike the Solana ETFs, which the Commission had asked issuers to amend, as it prepares to approve these funds. However, once the SEC drops its appeal and formally ends the XRP lawsuit, this could change, with the Commission communicating with XRP ETF issuers on the next steps. Nate Geraci also stated that the end of the XRP lawsuit also clears the way for the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, to file to offer an XRP ETF. Despite already offering Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the asset manager has yet to file for other crypto ETFs, including one for XRP. This is unlike other Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers, such as Bitwise, which has filed to offer ETFs for XRP, Solana, and Dogecoin, among others. However, as Geraci predicts, that could change soon enough, with BlackRock filing for an XRP ETF. The asset manager would be the eighth to do so if they file for this fund anytime soon. Bloomberg analysts Seyffart and Eric Blachunas predict a 95% chance that the SEC will approve these funds this year. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.19, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Lowe’s CEO warns young workers to stay away from the corner office: ‘AI isn’t going to fix a hole in your roof’

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. Anxiety about an AI job bloodbath is everywhere. As generative-AI tools like ChatGPT advance at lightning speed, even high-skilled roles like software engineering appear to be at risk. But according to Lowe’s CEO Marvin Ellison, the reality of AI’s impact on the workforce is far more grounded. “AI isn’t going to fix a hole in your roof,” Ellison, chief executive of the home-improvement retail giant, said at Business Roundtable’s CEO Workforce Forum earlier this month. “It’s not going to respond to an electrical issue in your home,” he said. “It’s not going to stop your water heater from leaking.” Particularly for Gen Z, who are facing an uphill battle thanks to slowed hiring among recent graduates, Ellison reassures them there are job opportunities—as long as you are willing to give up dreams of the corner office. “When young people come to me and they desire to work in the corporate office, my advice to them is, Stay as close to the cash register as you can,” he said. “Stay close to the customers because you will always have employment opportunities to grow.” And while his words may sound ironic considering how technology is the reason for self-checkout, Ellison is a believer that mastering the skills AI doesn’t have is a wise move. Ellison didn’t immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Ellison’s comments come at a time when there’s a fierce debate among business leaders about the impacts of AI, especially on young talent. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has warned the technology could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs, and Amazon recently announced it will soon cut its corporate workforce thanks to the technology. However, OpenAI chief operating officer Brad Lightcap is more optimistic. “We look at the problem and opportunity of deploying AI into every company on earth, and we have yet to see any evidence that people are kind of wholesale replacing entry-level jobs,” Lightcap said on the Hard Fork podcast. Some business leaders agree one growing pathway to success is the skilled trade industry. After all, construction, utilities, as well as oil, gas, and mining are the fastest-growing industries for new grads, according to LinkedIn’s 2025 Grad Guide. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said earlier this year electricians in particular are so desperately needed the U.S. could run out of them, thanks in part to growing demand and the deportation of skilled workers. “I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians, that we need to build out AI data centers,” Fink told an audience at CERAWeek, an S&P Global energy conference hosted in Houston. “We just don’t have enough.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, demand for plumbers (6%), roofers (6%), and electricians (11%) is expected to grow over the next decade—and each rate is faster than the national average of all occupations. However, a McKinsey report suggests the need for young people to pursue critical trade skills is even more dire due to the aging of existing skilled trade workers; in fact, hiring for critical skilled roles could be more than 20 times the projected annual increase in new jobs between 2022 and 2032. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Moonwell’s Founder Calls for Better Crypto UX: “Take the Hippocratic Oath to Your Users” | HackerNoon
URL: https://hackernoon.com/moonwells-founder-calls-for-better-crypto-ux-take-the-hippocratic-oath-to-your-users
Time Published: 2025-06-30T13:12:37Z
Full Content:
One of web3’s biggest challenges today is designing for people who don’t already speak its language, so I was excited to sit down with Luke Youngblood to explore what it takes to build systems that reach beyond the crypto bubble. From AWS to Coinbase and now leading Moonwell, Luke brings deep infrastructure expertise and a sharp focus on making blockchain easier, safer, and more accessible. In the early days of crypto, most people accessed it from a desktop computer on a fast internet connection. If you were early to Bitcoin or Ethereum, you were probably a developer like me—or a gamer—using it on your gaming PC. Either way, at that time, you needed some serious hardware and bandwidth just to run a wallet or interact with DeFi apps. In the last few years, decentralized finance (DeFi) apps have become usable on mobile web. That brought us a step closer to real accessibility; today, you can use most apps on chains like Ethereum or Base directly from your phone in a browser like Safari or Chrome. The next step, and one we’re already starting to see, is the use of native mobile apps. Zora, for example, now has an iOS app on Base. It’s a social and creative platform, and moving to native mobile is a big leap. That’s likely the direction we’ll take with Moonwell, too: building a great native experience on both iOS and Android. Of course, there are still other barriers to adoption—and language is a big one. Most early crypto apps simply assumed users spoke English. That might work in parts of the Americas or Europe, but it doesn’t hold in much of Latin America, Africa, or Asia, where English often isn’t the primary language. That’s why we’ve translated Moonwell into four additional languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, and Chinese. We have to keep making web3 more accessible, not just in terms of devices and apps, but in terms of language and context, too. Reaching beyond the small percentage of people who speak English as a second language is key to global adoption. At the core of an open financial system is self-custody. People should be able to own and control their assets directly—without relying on a third party. That’s always been important to early crypto users like me: being able to hold your own tokens and actually use them. The fundamentals are simple: freedom to custody and freedom to transact. What’s not simple, though, is onboarding the next billion in a way that makes those freedoms real. First come, wallets. If you’ve ever installed one, you know how painful it can be. App store, endless options, weird UX, seed phrase anxiety… For someone new to crypto, it’s a maze. That whole flow needs to go. We think passkey wallets are the answer; they’re built into most phones, secured by biometrics like Face ID, and don’t require downloading anything or managing a seed phrase. Telling someone to store twelve or twenty-four recovery words in a drawer and hope they never lose them really isn’t the way. Passkeys solve this, too. They back up automatically to iCloud or Google Cloud, so if you lose your phone, you can recover your wallet without panic or paperwork. Most people don’t use password managers—another problem—but at least modern browsers and OSs are making that easier. Still, access to the latest hardware isn’t universal. That’s a gap we can’t ignore. And then there’s transaction fees. Most onchain apps still expect users to buy ETH just to make a transaction, which adds unnecessary friction. At Moonwell, we solve this with Paymasters and sponsored transactions. First-time users can create a passkey wallet, enable cloud backup, and start using the app without ever buying ETH or worrying about fees. On Base, we use credits from Coinbase’s Gasless campaign to cover costs; on other networks, we sponsor transactions with USDC. The cost is low—just twenty dollars can cover thousands of transactions, making it easier for users to get started and for developers to scale. This way, we can onboard people without having to ask them to pay just to try an app—and it changes everything! Think about web2 apps like Instagram. It just works, it’s free. You never think about paying to post a photo. DeFi needs to feel that simple, too, if we want people to actually use it. One of the things I’ve noticed—after using the internet for decades since I was a kid—is how much it has evolved when it comes to networks. Back in the early days, if you wanted to connect with someone online, you had to think about which network you were on. I remember using university networks and dial-up bulletin board systems. You couldn’t just go anywhere; you had to log into a specific system to reach specific people. Everything was its own little walled garden. And honestly, that’s how crypto feels today. Ethereum, Base, other layer 1s, and layer 2s—there are bridges between them, but using apps across chains is still a hassle. If your wallet is connected to one network, you can’t easily interact with an app on another. You always have to think about where your tokens are and how to move them. So at Moonwell, we’ve been trying to solve this. We built a feature called Beam, already live in its early version, to make cross-chain UX feel like single-chain UX. Beam shows your total balance across chains—if you’ve got $50 on one chain, $25 on another, and $25 elsewhere, we just show you $100. When you hit “deposit” and sign the transaction, Beam gathers your tokens, bridges them if needed, and deposits them—all behind the scenes. To do that, we use a modular execution environment that picks the fastest and most cost-effective route. In many cases, that’s Across Protocol, which is great for bridging efficiently. The user stays in control the whole time—they’re still signing the transaction—but the complexity is abstracted away. It’s both faster and cheaper. Even when bridging from Ethereum mainnet, the process takes just a few minutes. We bundle transactions using an intents-based system, so your share of the gas might only be a penny or two. It's not like those big onchain operations that cost $15 or more. Under the hood, it's complex, but to the user, it feels simple and seamless. Too much of web3 expects users to think about the underlying infrastructure. What chain they are on, how to bridge assets, or whether an app is even compatible with their wallet. That’s not a good user experience—it’s just extra friction. The “Switch Network” prompt you see in many wallets is a great example. It’s really one of the clearest signs we haven’t abstracted the complexity away. If you look at messaging, be it via SMS or WhatsApp, you send a text, and it delivers. You’re not wondering what carrier the other person uses—it’s invisible to you. That’s what people expect from software. Web3 should be no different. Users shouldn’t be blocked from an app just because it runs on a different chain. With Beam, we’re pushing infrastructure into the background, where it belongs. My hope is that in a few years, no one will care whether they’re on Ethereum, Solana, Base, or BNB Chain. They’ll just open the app—whether it’s Moonwell, a game on Sonium, or something on World Chain—and it’ll just work. Before I went full-time into crypto, I worked in web2 tech—at Amazon Web Services (AWS). And in many ways, the adoption of cloud services mirrors what’s happening now with web3. In the early days, most companies didn’t take the cloud seriously. If you worked in tech back then, you were probably dealing with massive data centers and centralized systems like Oracle. When AWS launched EC2—the Elastic Compute Cloud—in the 2000s, big enterprises saw it as a toy. Something for startups or hobbyists, not real infrastructure. But now, most of the largest businesses in the world use cloud as their default. It’s faster, cheaper, and more flexible because you only pay for what you use. That’s very similar to what’s happening with web3 and financial apps today. Legacy banking infrastructure often takes days to settle transactions, while web3 enables instant cross-border settlements. We’re upgrading the financial system much like engineers upgraded from on-prem data centers to cloud services in the 2010s. By adopting new financial infrastructure—smart contracts and web3—banks, fintechs, and traditional finance companies will be able to offer far better services. Much of this will be powered by protocols like Moonwell, because we’ve spent years building decentralized infrastructure that’s self-custodial, permissionless, and gives people real control over their money. The GENIUS Act recently passed the U.S. Senate, marking the first step toward allowing banks to hold stablecoins on their balance sheets. It still needs to pass the House and be signed by the President, but if it does, the “crypto economy” may soon just be “the economy. Big banks—like Bank of America, Santander in Latin America, and Brazil’s BTG Pactual—will want to integrate stablecoin infrastructure into their core products. That means instant cross-border settlements and cheaper remittances, which is a big deal for people in places like Colombia who currently wait days and pay high fees to services like MoneyGram to receive money from abroad. It’s exciting to see the traditional finance system upgrading to support onchain finance and stablecoins, just like the cloud transformed data centers and opened up new possibilities for services that didn’t exist before. That’s a tough question. Large traditional finance players will always want to centralize control because they want to protect their existing business models. Decentralization threatens that, so there’s a natural tension. Some of these centralized players will build private networks. For example, BlackRock has its BUIDL Fund on Ethereum and Base. It’s a tokenized fund that lets people invest in traditional financial assets. The fund is an ERC-20 token, but it’s permissioned—only licensed broker-dealers, ATS (Alternative Trading Systems), and other regulated market participants can hold it. So, there will be centralized assets—like tokenized stocks—that you can only interact with if you’re a bank, brokerage, or have passed KYB (Know Your Business) checks. However, I think decentralization and permissionless self-custody can still exist through intermediaries. For instance, if the BlackRock BUIDL Fund is only available to institutions, retail investors like me can’t buy it directly. But a bank or fintech could become a licensed participant, join the fund as an institution, and then offer retail banking services to customers like me. They’d do KYC on me, and then I could buy and transact with a wrapped version of the fund. But that’s just an example; you can imagine similar things for tokenized stocks—it would mean only US investors can hold them if they’ve completed KYC through a bank. This setup would look somewhat like the current financial system, but with benefits like instant settlement—you wouldn’t have to wait two days for stock certificates to clear. It’s much more efficient. A concrete example is loan origination. Instead of waiting days or weeks for human loan officers to review credit and approve loans, decentralized apps like Moonwell can originate thousands of loans in a single day automatically using smart contracts. So, as traditional finance adopts web3 tech, you’ll see huge efficiency gains. But ultimately, retail users will still be able to take the self-custodial route. I might buy a fraction of Nvidia stock and hold it in my own wallet—not through BlackRock or a big bank, but via something like E*TRADE or a retail-focused platform offering a faster, cheaper experience powered by blockchain. Put yourself in the user’s shoes. When I build onchain apps, I think of it like a Hippocratic oath. For doctors, that means avoiding harm to the patient. For us, it means protecting the user and their funds, no matter what. Of course, crypto has its share of hacks, so as builders, we must never release anything that isn’t audited, secure, and backed by a solid bug bounty. Malicious actors will always try to steal from your users, so protecting user funds has to be a top priority. The other piece is decentralization. Early on, it’s tempting to keep control centralized—you can move faster. But if your app grows to millions in value, you don’t want all control in one place or one person’s hands. It puts your team and users at risk, making you a target. It’s important to think early about moving control to a DAO or decentralized governance by token holders, and to distribute those tokens widely. Moonwell has over 100,000 WELL token holders who govern the protocol. That setup lets us upgrade contracts and add markets safely without centralized control. It builds resilience and helps us sleep better at night. Start by exploring. Moonwell’s a good place to learn how lending and borrowing work onchain. And if you’ve got questions along the way, Mamo’s there too—it’s a cute little AI companion we built to help people get more comfortable with the basics. The jump from curious to confident takes time, so start small and stay curious!

Title: GoFundMe launches new funds aimed at maximizing charitable donations

Nina Ajemian is the newsletter curation fellow at Fortune and works on the Term Sheet and MPW Daily newsletters. – Funding the future. Even when they are not the breadwinners, women tend to make many of their households’ financial decisions, including charitable giving. And with the impending great wealth transfer, in which women in particular are expected to inherit trillions upon trillions of dollars, that could have profound effects on charitable giving throughout the country in the near future. That’s according to Margaret Richardson, GoFundMe’s chief marketing and corporate affairs officer, who I talked to last week about women and philanthropy and the company’s newest product launch. According to Richardson, women are busier than ever. And while they can and have managed many of these household tasks, many are also looking for ways to make managing their finances more seamless. “Women are often the charitable decision makers already in their families, and we see that that trend just continuing as women have more resources and more responsibilities,” says Richardson. That is one of the reasons GoFundMe is launching its newest product today, one it hopes will make charitable giving easier and more impactful—and attract some of those trillions. Called Giving Funds, it is a type of donor-advised fund that will allow users to contribute to the charitable investment accounts right on GoFundMe’s site. Donor-advised funds, or DAFs, are growing in popularity, as I wrote last year. They are tax-advantaged accounts for charitable giving, in which lump sum or automated recurring contributions can be invested; eventually the contributions and gains will go to charity, and they grow tax-free. It can be helpful to think of DAFs as similar to a 401(k), health savings account, or 529 account. Money contributed to a DAF cannot be taken back, it is effectively a charitable contribution and donors are generally eligible to take an immediate tax deduction. The benefit is that you can donate now, get that tax deduction now (if you itemize), invest the funds, and then have more to give in the future. GoFundMe is partnering with fund managers like BlackRock, State Street Global Advisors, and Vanguard to advise on the investment options, which are a number of exchange-traded funds. Though plenty of financial institutions offer DAFs, Richardson says the benefit of doing it on GoFundMe is that users will have all of their charitable giving centralized, and receive one annual tax document. There are no management fees and no minimum balances, and users can give their funds to any of the 1.4 million charities on the platform. Despite their tax benefits, DAFs are still fairly niche products—only about 1% of Americans use them, says Richardson, though an increasingly larger share of the U.S.’s total annual charitable contributions stem from them with each passing year. But a site like GoFundMe offering them could be the start to broadening their appeal—after all, the site has some 200 million users from all income levels, races, and genders. It could be many peoples’ first exposure to the investment tool. And, she says, it makes it easier for people to plan ahead. Many users come to GoFundMe after a natural disaster or other event to find causes to donate to. If they already have a pot of money waiting there that they previously donated—and that has possibly grown as it was invested—it can make all of their charitable giving more seamless. “This could be a really efficient and effective way for people to…get [funds] out the door quickly when organizations need it most,” she says.

Giving Funds is GoFundMe’s latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered NEW YORK -- GoFundMe CEO Tim Cadogan had some complications while fundraising on his own website last fall. Several friends wanted to help Cadogan reach his $28,000 goal as he crowdfunded for a Los Angeles area wilderness rescue team. But they tried to donate through a lesser-known wealth management tool called a donor-advised fund, or a DAF, a no-frills investing vehicle for money earmarked as eventual charitable gifts. After cutting checks and waiting three weeks, Cadogan said, the money finally arrived. “It was just a bit of a thing,” he added. "If they were using a Giving Fund, it would take ten seconds.” Giving Funds are GoFundMe's latest in a flurry of product rollouts with the purported goal of moving stagnant U.S. charitable contributions beyond the 2% GDP mark where totals have long hovered. But the for-profit company's DAF, announced Monday, enters a crowded market of more than a thousand providers — products often with older, wealthier clienteles that are often criticized for warehousing gifts. To transform the way that everyday users plan their donations, Cadogan will have to widen the appeal of DAFs beyond the likes of the technology entrepreneur's circles. And he wants to change public perceptions of his company as just a crowdfunding site. “We’re also hopeful that more people will start using GoFundMe for a broader set of things in their lives: not just that one fundraiser they’re supporting, not just that one nonprofit. But they’re coming in and they’re managing their giving portfolio with us and through us,” Cadogan said. “That connects directly to our mission, which is we want to help people help each other.” Donor-advised funds grew popular over the last decade among ultra-high net worth individuals as a tax-efficient instrument for grantmaking without the hassle of a more sophisticated charitable foundation. Donors can immediately write the contribution off on their taxes but face no deadline for giving the money to a nonprofit. The idea: account holders could invest money they wanted to ultimately donate, let the funds grow tax-free while they sit and give themselves time to identify the recipients best aligned with their giving goals. There's since been a rush to court average givers. Legacy financial services firms such as Fidelity Charitable lowered the minimums to open accounts. Fintech startups such as Daffy contrast their flat fees with the hidden expenses they allege their competitors charge. All that traction brought IRS proposals last year to impose penalties on those who abuse DAFs and Congress has considered legislation that would require some deadlines for disbursements. GoFundMe's Giving Funds will have no minimum balances, zero management fees and donations starting at $5. Users can load their DAF through their bank accounts or direct deposits for free. Credit card payments will be covered through the end of the year and then face the company's standard transaction fee of 2.2% plus 30 cents. Contributions can then be invested in a choice of exchange traded funds from managers including Vanguard, Blackrock and State Street Global Advisors. Cadogan pitches Giving Funds as a way to be more intentional about giving — something he said user feedback suggests more people want. As he sees it, widespread adoption hasn't occurred because DAFs have been framed as “wealth management products.” “This is a giving product,” Cadogan said. “It’s something for everybody. And you don’t need to know the words ‘donor advised fund.’ It doesn’t show up.” DAFs remain scrutinized for allowing donors to reap tax benefits before they ever redistribute any money to charitable causes — even if the notion that the channel is being exploited is fiercely debated in the nonprofit sector. Opaque disclosure requirements make it difficult to put a number on the overall assets held within the funds. The National Philanthropic Trust placed the total at more than $250 billion in 2023. Cadogan believes GoFundMe's culture is uniquely suited to nudge users with targeted spotlights of the 1.5 million charities already active on the platform. Giving Funds holders will be peppered with information about local nonprofits, crisis responders, their friends' charities of choice and potential beneficiaries that address their selected issue areas. That “dynamic, alive community” is very different from the “fairly static, passive” financial vehicles in the current market, according to Cadogan. “It’s essentially inspiring the money to move,” he said. Other features seek to encourage contributions by simplifying things. Users can set annual giving goals by a percentage of their income or a fixed number. Their gifts will tally up in real-time records to track their progress and ease year-end tax planning. Streamlining the process was one area for improvement identified in the DAF Research Collaborative's recent survey of more than 2,100 donors. But Jeff Williams, one of the researchers, said DAFs are currently hitting the “sweet spot of convenience and connection to nonprofits.” The challenge for any new player, he said, is that it's a competitive environment with many different options. Plus, he added, many DAFs already are “available-to-everyone vehicles" considering that half run balances under $50,000. “Givers are voting with their feet that DAFs are increasing with popularity. More options are generally better,” Williams said. “Anything that makes sure we maintain or enhance the ease of giving, it makes me happier.” But Direct Relief CEO Amy Weaver, previously the CFO at Salesforce, described GoFundMe's entrance as “a game changer” that could unlock additional funds. Direct Relief, a nonprofit that supplies free medical resources worldwide, reported receiving more than 18,000 DAF gifts totaling $116 million over the past five years. Weaver acknowledged DAFs have been traditionally used by those with more substantial wealth. But she encouraged people to view them as a “savings account" for "good works." “And GoFundMe, with its name familiarity and the fact that it really attracts people making smaller gifts, I think could be incredibly powerful if they can bring DAFs to that group of people,” she said. ___ Associated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have become a $3.4 trillion market this year as U.S. president Donald Trump helps drive the bitcoin price with a wild crypto prediction. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price is nearing its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, bouncing back from April lows of $75,000, with markets braced for a Federal Reserve flip. Now, as a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price higher, traders are eyeing what Trump’s crypto czar David Sacks has said will be a “big” July, while the Federal Reserve is under pressure to cut interest rates and unleash the “trillions and trillions” of dollars that are on the sidelines. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump's second term in the White House has helped the bitcoin price soar. "July will be a big month," Sacks posted to X, adding that he's expecting "a bill signing" for the stablecoin Genius Act, and the crypto market structure Clarity Act “going to the Senate.” "President Trump supports Clarity on market structure as well as Genius on stablecoins," Sacks posted. "Let’s get this done!" The Trump administration has fast-tracked crypto legislation, rushing to pass bills that would legitimise dollar-pegged stablecoins and carve up the bitcoin and crypto market between regulators after companies and developers complained for years they’ve been left in limbo. Earlier this month, the Senate passed the Genius Act that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, legitimizing their use for issuers and custodians. Trump said he expected the the Genius Act to lead to “massive” crypto investment once if it’s passed by the House of Representatives. Trump’s support of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies more broadly has flourished since he returned to the White House in January. Last week, Trump said bitcoin is taking "a lot of pressure off the dollar, and it is a great thing for our country," during a press conference, adding bitcoin has “become amazing.” The U.S. dollar index, which measures its performance against six other major currencies, is on track for its biggest drop in the first six months of a year since the era of free-floating currencies began in the early 1970s.

More as a perfect storm of U.S. president Donald Trump and the Federal Reserve hits. Meanwhile, Powell, who Trump has repeatedly attacked for his commitment to holding interest rates steady even as inflation falls toward its 2% target, is under increasing pressure to lower rates. “Jerome Powell is in an increasingly untenable situation because he will be looked at as politicizing the office of the Federal Reserve,” investor Chamath Palihapitiya said during an episode of the All In Podcast, which he hosts alongside crypto czar David Sacks and fellow investors David Friedburn and Jason Calacanis. “Look at how much money is sitting in money market funds … you have trillions and trillions of dollars of dry powder on the sidelines that will need to find a home.” Bitcoin and crypto analysts are generally feeling upbeat about the market’s outlook as policy, macro and funding factors align. “The setup for bitcoin remains compelling,” Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments. “A clean break above $110,000 could trigger a fast move to $120,000—putting our $138,500 summer target within reach. With policy, macro, and flows aligning, bitcoin may be setting up for a bullish end to the year—where a push toward $200,000 is no longer just a long shot, but a growing probability."

Title: Click, speak, move: These brain implants are poised to help people with disabilities

Jon Hamilton Phillip McKenzie, who was paralyzed from the neck down in a fall in 2012, uses a brain-computer interface developed by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to navigate complex virtual tasks that simulate everyday activities, UPMC and Pitt Health Sciences hide caption People who have lost the ability to move or speak may soon have a new option: surgically implanted devices that link the brain to a computer. More than two decades after researchers first demonstrated that a person could move a computer cursor with their thoughts, several firms are poised to take the brain-computer interface (BCI) from experimental curiosity to commercial product. "We know it works, we know the enabling technologies are now ready," says Michael Mager, the CEO of Precision Neuroscience. "It's time to turn this academic work into a thriving industry that can make a big impact on people's lives." Already, experimental brain-computer interfaces have been implanted in dozens of people. The latest devices go under the skin and can communicate wirelessly with a smartphone or tablet. Elon Musk's Neuralink is the most visible player in the BCI field. But the first product to reach the market may well come from competitors including Precision, Blackrock Neurotech, Paradromics, or Synchron. Some of these companies, like Blackrock, have much more experience than Neuralink. Others use less invasive, and potentially safer, technology that may make it easier to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration. The first BCI customers are likely to be people living with paralysis from a spinal injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Early products will allow them to control a computer cursor, or generate artificial speech. Implanted BCIs work by detecting and decoding signals coming from areas of the brain that control movement or speech. These signals indicate when a person is trying to move a limb or speak a word. A BCI system typically includes sensors that detect brain activity, an interface that processes the signals, and an external device that turns thought into action. The result: A cursor moves, a prosthetic hand reaches, a synthetic voice speaks the words a person is trying to articulate. "Imagine the joy of connecting with your loved ones, browsing the web, or even playing games using only your thoughts," says the narrator of a promotional video from Neuralink. The company, which did not respond to requests for an interview, calls this capability "telepathy." Neuralink pushed BCIs into the public imagination in early 2024, thanks to a charismatic and resilient man with paralysis. A diving accident left Noland Arbaugh unable to move from the shoulders down. At 29, he became the first person to get Neuralink's device. A robot threaded more than a thousand electrodes into his brain's motor cortex at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix. Then, human surgeons there installed a wireless interface about the size of a quarter in his skull. A few weeks later, Arbaugh was on stage at Neuralink's headquarters in Fremont, California, describing his experience controlling a computer cursor. "It's freakin' wild," he said. "When I first moved it just by thinking, it blew my mind for like a day. I just could not wrap my head around it." A video featuring Arbaugh's remarks has attracted more than 25 million views on Musk's social media platform, X. But the success was tempered by Neuralink's announcement a few weeks later that some of the threads of electrodes in Arbaugh's brain had "retracted," making the device less sensitive. Since then, Neuralink has reported implanting its BCI in at least six other people. But details about those experiments remain scant. While Neuralink's surgical robots and wireless electronics are new, using thoughts to move a cursor isn't. Dr. Leigh Hochberg — who holds positions at Brown University and Massachusetts General Hospital — was part of a team that pioneered the approach in 2004. Their subject was Matt Nagle, a man who was living with paralysis after being stabbed in the neck. Hochberg's team linked Nagle's brain to a computer using old-fashioned wires that passed through his skull. A research video from 2004 shows Nagle using his thoughts to open an email. "It was exactly what was supposed to happen," Hochberg says. "And even for all of us that were expecting it — there was a little bit of magic there." Nagle died in 2007 of an infection unrelated to the experiment. BrainGate evolved into an academic consortium directed by Hochberg. And in June 2025, a team at the University of California, Davis reported that a BrainGate 2 BCI allowed a man with ALS to speak through a computer. "I. Am. Good," the synthesized voice says in a video accompanying the study. The speech is slightly halting, spoken one word a time. But the voice sounds human — it was constructed from old audio of the man speaking. Experiments like that one show how computer interfaces have improved, Hochberg says. Instead of monitoring a few dozen neurons, they may listen to thousands. Instead of sending information out through wires, they use wireless protocols. And instead of interfacing with a wall of computers, the signals may go to a single laptop or tablet. Another big change is that scientists keep finding ways to decode brain activity "more accurately, more consistently and more reliably," Hochberg says. In the past few years, that has meant employing artificial intelligence to recognize the neural activity patterns that reveal a person's intention to speak, or pick up a bar of chocolate. The field has also become specialized, Hochberg says, with some groups focused on decoding speech while others work on improving control of robotic limbs. There are even groups "focused on putting information back into the brain," Hochberg says, which can add a sense of touch to a robotic arm or hand. The University of Pittsburgh is among the leaders in providing sensory feedback through a brain-computer interface. "You can't have fine and dextrous motor control with visual feedback alone," says Jennifer Collinger, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh. You need that sense of touch to be able to respond in a natural way." With touch feedback, the user can tell when an artificial finger makes contact with an object or when an artificial hand is holding a cup tightly enough to keep it from falling. So Collinger and her colleagues have been working with Blackrock Neurotech, whose brain interface technology has been used experimentally in dozens of people. One of those people is Nathan Copeland, who was paralyzed in a car accident. In 2016, Copeland famously used a robotic arm to bump fists with President Barack Obama. In 2021, Copeland was part of a study that showed how a sense of touch improved his ability to grasp and manipulate objects with his prosthetic hand. "With sensation, I could feel that the hand had made contact," Copeland said in a 2021 interview with NPR. "I could also tell if I had a firm grip on it or not." But advanced features like sensory feedback aren't going to appear in the first implanted devices on the market, Collinger says. Instead, they are likely to offer control of a computer cursor, much like BrainGate did in those lab experiments more than 20 years ago. "There's been enough consistent success that now companies are saying, 'Okay we can offer a first-generation device to people that will offer some kind of benefit to them,'" Collinger says. One of those companies is Precision Neuroscience, which was cofounded by Ben Rapoport, a neurosurgeon and engineer who had previously helped start Neuralink. Precision's other co-founder and CEO, Michael Mager, says the company's short-term goal is a wireless device that allows a person with paralysis to operate a smartphone or computer. "We think about accessing news and entertainment, we think about productivity software like Microsoft Office, Word, Powerpoint, Excel," Mager says. "If you can operate those programs as well as someone who is able-bodied, it's quality-of-life enhancing — and it's also potentially enabling for people to go back to work." Precision's device differs from Neuralink's because it doesn't insert its electrodes into the brain. "We have a very, very thin film that is designed to sit on the surface of the brain without penetrating into or damaging the brain," Mager says. That makes the implant safer and less invasive, Mager says, which could make it easier to get approval from the FDA. Synchron avoids opening the skull entirely. Its electrodes are delivered through blood vessels using technology designed to place stents in blocked arteries. All of these devices face some common challenges, Mager says. "We're sampling from thousands of electrodes, thousands of times a second, and the amount of data that comes off of these systems is just enormous," he says. It is far too much data to transmit through existing wireless links. So companies are working on ways to reduce or compress the data. Another obstacle is the cost to conduct the sort of clinical trials required by the FDA. That will probably be hundreds of millions of dollars, Mager says. Even so, Mager thinks his company and several others, including Neuralink, have the resources and expertise to turn the brain interface concept into a marketable product. That won't take another 20 years, he says. Perhaps another two or three. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Surging inflows catapult IBIT to fourth-largest US ETF with rapid AUM growth, outshining rivals. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is rapidly cementing its status as the most dominant BTC fund among its peers. Bitcoin analyst James Check highlighted the divergence in a June 29 X post, noting that total inflows across all other Bitcoin ETFs have stagnated around $20 billion since December 2024. In contrast, IBIT alone has drawn over $52 billion in cumulative inflows since its launch, solidifying its dominance in the space. He further pointed out that this trend is reflected in weekly inflow data, where IBIT attracts the lion’s share of new investments and shows minimal outflows compared to competitors. Check wrote: “Dominance for all other ETFs in terms of total AUM has been in constant decline, initially dominated by GTBTC outflows, but more recently due to a clear preference for IBIT by investors.” This matches data from Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, who noted that based on year-to-date inflows, IBIT now ranks as the fourth-largest ETF in the US. According to Balchunas’ data, IBIT has leapfrogged over SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG) and is closing in on heavyweights like Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI). As of June 23, IBIT had recorded $13.7 billion in inflows, which is ahead of SPLG’s $13.4 billion but below VTI’s $19.3 billion. He also highlighted IBIT’s outlier status, noting that the fund is “the fifth in three-year flows (despite only being alive for 1.5 years).” These inflows helped the fund cross $70 billion in assets under management (AUM) in just 341 trading days, the fastest rate for any US ETF. This breakout performance has translated into significant financial gains for BlackRock. Nate Geraci, president of ETF Store, pointed out that IBIT generates $186 million annually in fee revenue, surpassing even IVV (BlackRock’s flagship S&P 500 ETF) by $3 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, this milestone is particularly noteworthy given that IVV is nearly ten times larger than IBIT in terms of assets under management. The shift signals a broader change in institutional behavior. BlackRock, long associated with traditional equity markets, is now seeing more fee revenue from its Bitcoin ETF than from legacy stock-based products. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Stablecoins are attracting considerable attention by traditional financial institutions. Regulatory shifts are paving the way for banks to engage with stablecoins. These are rapidly evolving from a niche vertical in the cryptocurrency ecosystem into a foundational element of the global financial system. Stablecoins are increasingly becoming a preferred choice in modern finance, building a bridge between the traditional financial world and the crypto sector. Their evolution is shaping the future of global finance. In this blog we describe what stablecoins are, explore the current state of the stablecoin landscape, focus on key regulatory developments, the adoption by traditional financial institution, the various real-world use cases, the potential and challenges and the various solutions to these challenges. What are stablecoins? Stablecoins are blockchain-based digital tokens designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged one-to-one to traditional fiat currencies, predominantly the U.S. dollar and the euro, or high-quality liquid assets like commodities such as gold, silver or oil. Stablecoins are designed primarily to function as a stable medium of exchange. While their mechanisms may vary, they all aim to combine the trust and stability of fiat currencies (most commonly the US Dollar) associated with traditional banking infrastructure with the efficiency of blockchain-based transfers, thereby avoiding the volatility inherent in traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This makes stablecoins suitable for commercial transactions, international remittances, and storing value digitally. How stablecoins work? The vast majority of stablecoins are fiat-backed. This means that for every digital token issued, an equivalent amount of fiat currency (or highly liquid, low-risk assets like cash equivalents and short-term government bonds) is held in reserves by the issuer. This 1:1 backing is crucial for maintaining their peg to the underlying fiat currency. Regular attestations and audits are essential to ensure the transparency and integrity of these reserves, building trust among users. These tokens will be listed on various crypto exchanges. Present state: stablecoin market capitalization The current market capitalization of stablecoins was worth around $255 billion early June 2025 according to CoinMarketCap. This record high is driven by a wave of adoption from major global banks. With this market capitalization size and a growing presence in cross-border payments, corporate treasury operations, and emerging market finance, stablecoins are fast becoming a relevant tool in global finance. The market itself has been projected to grow to $2 trillion in the next three years. The growth in stablecoin use is clear when looking at the actual transaction volumes. Over the past year 2024, transaction volumes involving stablecoins rose significantly from $521 billion to $710 billion monthly. A significant milestone occurred in 2024 when the total amount of money transferred using stablecoins reached $27.6 trillion—surpassing the combined total transaction volumes processed by Visa and Mastercard that same year. This trend underscores their growing importance in global commerce and remittances. This however is still a small share of the global M2 money supply, approximately 1%. Dominant stablecoins: USDT and USDC The stablecoin market is dominated by USD-backed variants. The two largest stablecoins out there right now are Tether (USDT: $155 billion) and the USD Coin from Circle (USDC: $62 billion). Together they account over 90% of total stablecoin market capitalization. They have gained traction in both crypto and traditional finance circles due to their ability to combine the stability of fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. This is however not much in the $36 trillion US Treasury market, but the growth has certainly focused US Treasury’s attention. Regulatory clarity: remove fragmentation The regulatory environment for stablecoins in 2025 has evolved dramatically from the fragmented approach of the early 2020s. The dramatic shift towards stablecoins by large institutions follows recent moves by regulatory bodies in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) to create clear frameworks for stablecoins that define capital requirements, reserve management, and operational standards. These regulations may foster innovation while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. These moves may contribute to the further development of consistent and reliable regulations worldwide for blockchain and crypto-related technologies. EU regulation: MICA The European Union (EU) is at the forefront of stablecoin regulation, having introduced Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation for cryptocurrencies including stablecoins. This regulatory framework is designed to protect investors, promote fair and efficient markets, and foster innovation in the crypto space. The MiCA regulation that came into effect in mid-2024, sets clear rules for stablecoins, significantly reducing regulatory uncertainty. Issuers operating in the EU should adhere to specific financial standards. They must hold full reserves, meet transparency requirements, and be authorized by financial regulators. MiCA does not cover central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), but it allows regulated financial institutions (e.g. banks) to issue or support stablecoins, including acting as custodians or liquidity providers. Banks in the EU now have a legal framework to engage with stablecoins in a compliant way. US regulation: GENIUS Act and the STABLE Act US Congress has recently passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins issuance by banks, aiming to bring stablecoin in the US financial system and creating standards for stablecoin oversight. This should be seen as a step towards creating a more stable and secure environment for their use. They focus on reserve requirements, licensing models and systemic risk considerations. This Act would require stablecoin issuers to hold one-to-one reserves, publish regular audits, and follow clear rules to protect users. Reserves backing stablecoins must be segregated from other corporate assets to reduce risk exposure. Monthly verification of reserves will become standard practice, giving users confidence in the stability of these digital assets. The GENIUS Act allows stablecoin issuers to operate under either federal or qualified state supervision, depending on their size and structure. Together with the STABLE Act that sets rules for the overall crypto market, they are are expected to provide the legal certainty needed for more banks and businesses to participate in the stablecoin market. Banking adoption of stablecoins: gather momentum A notable trend is the increasing involvement of major banks and fintech companies in the stablecoin market. This shift follows years of cautious observation and regulatory scepticism. But improved regular clarity has triggered a growing number of banks now experimenting with stablecoins, recognizing their value for improving operational efficiency, driven by a combination of fiat-like price stability with the speed, efficiency, and programmability of blockchain technology. Bank stablecoin initiatives: some examples This year a growing number of traditional financial institutions and fintechs in both the US, EU and Asia are joining existing financial services giants like Standard Chartered, PayPal, Revolut, and Stripe in adopting stablecoins. These companies are increasingly seeing their potential and have started different stablecoin initiatives, seeking to capitalize on the rapidly growing use of these coins. To give some insight here follows a number of examples of banks entering or planning to enter the stablecoin market, US banks Triggered by the pro-crypto Trump administration and the passing of the Genius Act, a growing number of US banks and fintechs are entering or planning to enter the stablecoin market. Including names like JPMorgan, US Bancorp, Bank of America, BNY Mellon and Paypal. Stripe, a leading fintech company, recently acquisitioned Bridge, a stablecoin orchestration platform. This initiative positions Stripe to enhance its payment processing capabilities, particularly in cross-border transactions. Similar moves are expected from competitors like Goldman Sachs and HSBC EU Banks Also banks in the EU have started to enter the stablecoin market including names like Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank and Banco Santander. The French Bank Societe Generale announced its plans to issue a publicly tradable stablecoin pegged to the US dollar named USD CoinVertible (USDCV) via its digital asset unit, SG-FORGE. This follows the launch of its euro-based stablecoin EUR CoinVertible in 2023. Both stablecoins are classified as electronic money tokens and will be arranged according to MiCA, EU’s crypto regulation. Deutsche Bank is also exploring the use of stablecoins and tokenized deposits, evaluating stablecoin options. Bloomberg reports that Deutsche Bank is actively researching how these technologies could be used within its services. Other banks, such as Banco Santander and Credit Lyonnais are also exploring stablecoins. Banco Santander has early-stage plans to launch its own euro- or dollar-denominated stablecoin or offering access to an existing one. Santander's Openbank unit has applied for MiCA licenses in Europe. Asian Banks Asia is leading the world in real-world stablecoin adoption, aimed to make stablecoins a foundational layer of Asia’s evolving payments infrastructure. Stablecoins are now a strategic lever for financial institutions in countries like Singapore (Standard Chartered’s Hong Kong branch), South Korea and Hong Kong (Ant Group), institutions are moving quickly—not just to explore stablecoins, but to scale them. But also in countries like Japan where the three largest banks (MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho) joined a pilot platform called “Project Pax” to use stablecoins for cross-border payments. In Australia ANZ Bank launched an AUD-pegged stablecoin and executed the first public blockchain transaction by an Australian bank, now expanding use cases including real-time pension payments. These examples illustrate that stablecoins are gradually becoming part of mainstream financial infrastructure, not just for crypto-native firms, but for some of the world’s largest banks Stablecoin use cases While the bulk of stablecoin use is currently still within the crypto capital markets and not for everyday payments, this is fundamentally changing. Growing regulatory clarity is expected to unlock broader use cases. These may include cross-border payments and foreign exchange transactions, crypto trading in DeFi, on-chain settlement as well as cash, liquidity and collateral management. Stablecoins are increasingly seen as practical tools to broad institutional use for everyday financial transactions. Cross border payments Financial institutions are considering using stablecoins to improve its payment systems. Cross-border transactions through traditional banking systems can be slow and expensive due to high fees and currency conversion costs. Stablecoins may fundamentally transform how money moves across borders, addressing long-standing pain points in traditional payment systems, delivering reduced costs, speeding up settlements, and increasing financial inclusion. Stablecoins offer the potential to make international transfers faster and more cost-effective compared to some traditional correspondent banking methods. When supported by appropriate infrastructure (such as wallets and custody providers), these funds can be received and accessed by the counterparty almost immediately. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Another major use case where stablecoins are already thriving is decentralized finance (DeFi). They serve as the foundational currency for DeFi applications, enabling lending, borrowing, swapping, yield farming, and more - all without centralized intermediaries. Their programmable nature allows for automated transactions that traditional banking systems cannot match in efficiency or cost. Stablecoins are becoming the essential bridge connecting traditional finance with cryptocurrency ecosystems through DeFi protocols. Banks can use them to automate financial processes like collateralized lending, borrowing, derivatives trading, and even tokenization. This programmability allows banks to participate in blockchain-based financial markets while streamlining operations like asset management and market making. “Programmable Treasury” A third use case of stablecoins is as a means of payment. Governments generally want citizens to transact in their local currencies, and stablecoins challenge that sovereignty. Stablecoins are increasingly being integrated into payment platforms, enhancing the efficiency of transactions. Stablecoins are making it possible for businesses to automate payments based on real-world conditions. This is known as “programmable treasury”. More Accessible Loan Products Stablecoins could also unlock new lending and borrowing mechanisms within traditional banking by leveraging the transparency and programmability of blockchain technology. This could create more accessible loan products, collateralized by stablecoins themselves, opening up new markets and customer segments currently underserved by traditional lending practices. Attract capital and increase available liquidity Financial institutions could also offer reserve management services for assets backing stablecoins. This involves managing significant deposits and ensuring issuers meet regulatory obligations for transparency and liquidity. By welcoming stablecoin issuers as depositors, offering competitive and secure deposit solutions, providing them with secure, low-risk returns, banks can unlock new liquidity pools and expand their capital base and increase the amount of available liquidity, expanding their base of long-term, dependable clients. Onderkant formulier What may stablecoins bring for traditional banks? Financial industry executives cited slow transaction speeds and high fees in traditional banking systems as driving factors for stablecoin adoption. Stablecoins offer unique advantages by combining the stability of assets like fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. Using stablecoins may bring a number of important advantages including price stability, speed and efficiency, lower costs, global accessibility and programmability, making them attractive to international businesses and supply chains. Unlike cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, their value remains relatively steady because they are tied to the value of more stable assets. This makes stablecoins a safer choice for risk-averse traders and investors who want to explore crypto markets without exposing themselves to drastic price fluctuations. Next to that stablecoins enable near-instant settlement of cross-border transactions. By eliminating intermediaries like correspondent banking, they enable domestic and cross-border payments to settle in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems, while offering 24/7 services. Transaction costs may also dramatically decrease. By lowering the transaction costs often associated with traditional banking intermediaries, stablecoins also make financial services more affordable and accessible to a wider audience. Challenges Despite the enthusiasm and their advantages for traditional financial institutions, stablecoins face a number of challenges related to regulatory compliance, interoperability issues and liquidity risks.. Regulatory fragmentation: unclarity and risks Notwithstanding regulation in the EU and upcoming regulations in the US, stablecoins currently still operate under a patchwork of regulations worldwide, leading to unclarity around compliance, especially concerning reserve requirements and licensing. Notably, recent data from Chainalysis reveals that stablecoins are increasingly favoured in illicit activities such as money laundering and sanctions evasion. This underscores the global implications of stablecoin integration and the need for coordinated regulatory approaches. Lack of interoperability Financial institutions also face operational and credit risks inherent in digital currency management. The real challenge will be in the interoperability between stablecoins and existing financial systems. The existence of stablecoins across multiple blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Polygon) introduces challenges in transaction settlements, requiring interoperability solutions. For businesses to fully adopt stablecoin payments, suppliers must be equipped to receive them, necessitating updates to wallets, regulatory clarity, and accounting systems Other risks And here is the liquidity risk. Stablecoins' influence extends beyond yields. The BIS notes that $40 billion in 2024 Treasury purchases by stablecoins outpaced many foreign investors, illustrating their role as de facto market participants. However, their reserve compositions often lack transparency, leaving investors vulnerable to sudden de-pegging events. Managing these risks requires robust compliance frameworks, security measures, and strict adherence to regulatory requirements, complicating their widespread adoption by traditionally cautious banks. Innitiatives by banks Consortium-backed stablecoin A group of big US banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and PNC, met a few weeks ago in a working group to discuss the prospect of offering stablecoins in a collaborative effort. This initiative to develop a consortium-backed stablecoin aims to streamline routine financial transactions, improve transaction speeds whilst managing competition from encroaching crypto firms and counter the growing influence of crypto-native firms and fintech competitors. The potential introduction of a consortium-backed stablecoin by major banks could significantly impact the competitive landscape for community banks and credit unions. Offering familiar, secure interfaces For corporates, accessing stablecoins still involves a lot of manual steps and unfamiliar tools like wallets. Banks can fill this gap by offering familiar, secure interfaces that integrate stablecoin functionality into their existing online banking and treasury services. This include amongst others: helping clients move between fiat currency and stablecoins (and vice versa), or between different stablecoins, holding stablecoins securely on behalf of their clients, streamlining KYC/AML, source-of-funds checks, and transaction screening for blockchain-based payments and guiding clients on how and when to use stablecoins for payments, treasury management or regional risk hedging. Support from blockchain infrastructure providers Companies like Circle at the forefront of transformation Companies like Circle, the global issuer of USDC are at the forefront of this transformation, offering banks cross-chain clearing and other innovative solutions that could reshape the financial landscape. Increased involvement from the traditional financial industry is further supported by the advent of blockchain infrastructure providers like Zero Hash and Fireblocks, which are offering technology geared towards traditional financial institutions looking to integrate stablecoin capabilities. Stripe, which acquired stablecoin orchestration platform Bridge in February 2025, has added payment capabilities for the company’s USDB stablecoin, which generates yield through backing by BlackRock money market funds. Earlier this month, Stripe announced it is rolling out Stablecoin accounts in 101 countries. Matera and Circle join forces: building bridges in payments In a move to accelerate the adoption of stablecoins as a mainstream payment method, Matera, a leading technology provider for the financial system, announced a commercial partnership with Circle, through its regulated dollar-backed stablecoin USDC. This alliance marks the integration between a real-time banking infrastructure and a fully-reserved, transparent stablecoin, at the forefront of interoperability between local currency balances and digital dollars. This partnership unlocks their use in everyday near-instant payments - secure, fast, and accessible - directly from banking and fintech platforms powered by Matera’s real-time ledger, Digital Twin. The collaboration between Matera and Circle advances the concept of a “stablecoin-ready banking platform” building bridges between traditional and digital money. Criticism: BIS and Lagarde Notwithstanding the growing embrace of stablecoins by traditional financial institutions criticism has come recently from the BIS and ECB president Lagarde. BIS report A new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cast doubt on the long-term role of stablecoins in the global financial system. The authors acknowledged that stablecoins have some benefits, including programmability, pseudonymity, and ease of use. Their structure also offers faster and cheaper transactions, particularly for cross-border payments. But the BIS concluded that these advantages are outweighed by risks, especially when compared to money issued by central banks and regulated financial institutions, arguing that they fall short of three essential criteria for functioning as true money: singleness, elasticity, and integrity. These are the core traits the BIS says are necessary for any instrument that hopes to support a modern monetary system. ECB president Lagarde In a recent statement ECB president Lagarde told stablecoins are privately issued and pose in particular risks to monetary policy and financial stability. Stablecoins must therefore “be governed by sound rules, especially when operating internationally”. According to Lagarde the underlying problem is precisely the lack of uniform rules. This fragmented approach prevents a global level playing field and can open the door to new risks and systemic vulnerabilities. “We must therefore remain alert to developments in other jurisdictions and support globally aligned regulations for stablecoins.” Lagarde. She therefore plaids for a Dital Euro. Forward looking: Market future and Expectations As we move through 2025, the stablecoin landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Upcoming regulation is expected in other regions worldwide including the UK, Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea) Australia and Japan. As stablecoins continue gaining traction globally, the financial industry anticipates further adoption, spurred by increasing regulatory clarity and growing consumer trust. In 2025, stablecoins are increasingly being integrated into the financial services infrastructure, a first step bridging the gap between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world thereby enhancing business banking services. Banks that respond early can shape how this technology fits within their client offerings. As banks and fintech companies intensify their involvement, the stablecoin market stands on the threshold of significant transformation. The momentum behind stablecoins suggests they will play a significant role in reshaping the future of global financial system. The next step will be the worldwide introduction of Digital Euro’s and Digital dollars.

Title: The Irish woman reviving ballet in Venice: ‘As a lawyer, ballet became my escape’
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2025/06/30/gerardine-connolly-the-irish-woman-reviving-ballet-in-venice-as-a-lawyer-ballet-became-my-escape/
Time Published: 2025-06-30T05:00:00Z
Full Content:
“The idea is to draw more people into the world of ballet, expose them to a wide variety and bring classical ballet back to Venice,” says Gerardine Connolly, who has been working hard in recent years to create a new ballet company for the Italian city. A successful Irish barrister with a long dedication to the arts, she and co-founder and artistic director Alessio Carbone are on an ambitious mission to revitalise dance in Venice. “It was once the ballet capital of the world, and in the 18th century there were more ballet theatres than in any other city. That rich heritage disappeared without a trace 30 years ago,” Connolly explains. “We want to revive the city’s dance past and reintroduce classical and neo classical ballet to Venetian audiences.” Last July their company Il Balletto di Venezia made a promising debut in Palazzo Barbaro with three ballet excerpts, followed by a presentation in the medieval city of Vicenza that earned a standing ovation. They then travelled to in Messina in Sicily to give an open-air performance, and ended back in Venice with six shows in the church of San Vio, “where we opened the doors and allowed free entrance – there were queues all the way down the street”. For Season Two in July, they have recruited 12 talented dancers from prominent ballet schools, including La Scala and Paris Opera as well as American Ballet Theatre. Nine short vignettes will be performed, each four to six minutes long and involving two dancers, followed by the whole troupe coming together for the finale. “The main idea is to present a piece of work – not like a full ballet telling a story – so you go from excitement to melancholic to finale,” Connolly says. It will open on July 6th in the 15th century Scuola Grande di San Rocco, famous for its Tintoretto paintings and frescoes, before travelling to Florence and Sardinia, finishing in Dublin at the Royal Irish Academy of Music on July 30th. It will be the first time a ballet has been staged at the academy. How did an eminent Irish senior counsel, not a dancer herself, become involved in this venture? Some clues can be found in Connolly’s background. Born in Bangor, one of five siblings, she was educated at Sion Hill in Blackrock and, following in her brothers’ footsteps, trained at King’s Inn. She loved ballet from an early age. “My mother was quite artistic and I loved to dance, but never went to ballet classes. It remained always there in my imagination, as did a love of music, and instead I became a classical guitarist. As a lawyer, ballet became my escape from the adversarial nature of the legal profession,” Connolly says. During her 20s and 30s, Connolly would go to Paris nearly every weekend “and head straight up to Opera Bastille to watch ballet – it was my way of finding an equilibrium in my life,” she says. Her apartment was “floor to ceiling ballet catalogues from the Palais Garnier”, which she kept for 15 years before moving to the Rue St Sulpice “and the ballet world continued”. She married the acclaimed sculptor Patrick O’Reilly, who she met in Fitzwilliam Square, and the couple bought an apartment in Venice in the Palazzo Barbaro on the Grand Canal, once home to Henry James for several weeks in 1892. She remembers the thrill of discovering the city with friends, including the late architect John Meagher and Liberato Santoro Brienza, then professor of aesthetics in UCD. “We fell deeply in love with the city, and would go there at least once a month,” she recalls. When friends who lived there asked her what she was going to do in Venice, she replied: “There’s no ballet here, so I’m going to start a ballet company.” At a performance of the opera La Dame Aux Camelias in Venice, Connolly was introduced to Alessio Carbone, “and we just connected”. A renowned ballet dancer, Carbone had a long career at the Paris Opera from 1997 until his retirement in 2020. From ballet royalty, he began his training at his parents’ school in Venice. His father is a renowned ballet director in La Scala and other Italian opera houses, his mother a star dancer, his sister a ballerina and a brother a flamenco dancer. “Alessio and I then arranged to meet in the Gritti Palace hotel and discussed the idea of starting a ballet company in Venice. It was the beginning of a beautiful collaboration,” Connolly explains. Carbone had already founded a dance company in 2016 in an attempt to breathe some classical dance life back into his native city, as well as directing and organising productions for various festivals and theatres the world over. He was also involved with community projects, teaching dance workshops for underprivileged children in Brazil, performing in hospices for the terminally ill, and organising a ballet to raise funds for the Red Cross efforts in Ukraine. “He knows all the ballet masters, the dancers and the opera houses and is brilliant in terms of knowledge and artistic integrity,” says Connolly. They plan to scout directly with renowned schools, offering gifted graduates without employment the opportunity of work. They hope to capitalise on the pure classical technique typical of young graduates, often lost when they enter companies with a heavily modern repertoire. “We want to create a desirable place for international dance artists to evolve, bring a high-level international audience to Venice and place ballet once again centre stage,” Connolly says describing the ambitious intentions of this not-for-profit company. Her own favourite ballet is Giselle. “If I can ever put that one on, I will hang up my boots,” Connolly says. “I am always drawn to the melancholic, and that’s what resonates with me. I am also attracted to anything very moralistic – Giselle is very philosophical and so beautiful. Modern dance doesn’t resonate for me in the same way. My heart and soul is in classical, and that is where I am transported. I go into a trance watching the death of the swan in Swan Lake.” Supremely stylish in appearance, she cuts an impressive figure at every level and now travels between Dublin and Venice having stepped back from legal work. “I went ahead with this not knowing what I was facing,” Connolly says, “but I knew that whatever it cost, it was going to be fine. I didn’t understand the extensive work and responsibility until it was all over, but we got there.” Like another pioneering Irishwoman, Ninette de Valois from Wicklow who founded the Royal Ballet and the Turkish State Ballet, Connolly has set her aims high and obstacles have not dampened her determination to succeed. Sponsorship, both private and public, is now forthcoming including from the Moszkowski Foundation in the US, Temple Recruitment and the Ronan Group, enabling financial security for the company for at least three years, “but it’s a major project and I am still in shock”, Connolly adds with a laugh. “I can see this family getting huge – all the dancers want to come back, so let it balloon now.” Il Balletto di Venezia opens in Venice on July 5th, travels to Moncalvo, Sardinia, Florence and Treviso, closing in Dublin at the RIAM on July 30th.

With volatility building, Bitcoin’s next leg hinges on who gets caught in the net. The crypto market is teetering on a knife’s edge. The sentiment is holding neutral as bulls and bears battle for control of Bitcoin [BTC] in a high-stakes tug-of-war. This kind of setup usually opens the door for opportunistic traders to take sides, creating an ideal setup for a fresh volatility squeeze. According to AMBCrypto, how this standoff resolves could shape Bitcoin’s next major leg. Bitcoin is closing out Q2 with a decisive rebound from its multi-month low of $98k, right as the macro fear started to cool off. That move pretty much wiped out the bears who were pricing in prolonged geopolitical risk. At the time of writing, Futures market data showed that only 58% of longs were sitting in a potential squeeze zone, down significantly from over 80% just a week ago. Clearly, the market just went through a major leverage reset. Still, as Bitcoin creeps back toward that $110k target, shorts are starting to circle again. And with price stabilizing in the $106k-$108k range after the early-week breakout, bears now have a clearly defined zone to defend. Source: TradingView (BTC/USDT) Nothing captures this better than James Wynn, a trader who’s made headlines this cycle for repeatedly taking high-leverage BTC positions that often end in liquidation. He’s back at it, this time with a 40x short worth $1.49 million, sitting dangerously close to a liquidation level of $108,630. It’s an aggressive bet that places him right at the edge of current price action. Whether Wynn is seeing something the broader market isn’t or simply repeating old mistakes, his position could become the trigger for Bitcoin’s next volatility spike. Unlike the swift early-June rebound where Bitcoin rallied nearly 10% off the $100,424 weekly low and reclaimed $110k in just four bullish candles, this current price action looks more measured. The shift in tempo aligns with a key macro signal: Tether’s [USDT] circulating supply just printed a fresh all-time high at $158 billion, pointing to growing stablecoin liquidity flowing into the system. Source: Glassnode In this context, Bitcoin’s more gradual climb could reflect smart money accumulation rather than speculative chasing, especially with BlackRock reportedly adding $1.15 billion in BTC weekly. This paints its current consolidation as a potential launchpad for a more calculated $110k retest heading into early Q3. If upward pressure persists, Wynn’s 40x short and the 64% short skew on Binance derivatives could become structural fuel for a short squeeze, positioning BTC for a fresh all-time high.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Add 1,430 BTC Daily As AUM Heads For 1.2M Mark – Analyst

The US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have been one of key bullish drivers of the present market cycle, heralding an influx of institutional investors into the BTC ecosystem. In 18 trading months, these ETFs have acquired 6.25% of the Bitcoin market cap cementing their status as a major force in the market. Interestingly, prominent market analyst Axel Adler Jr. has pointed to a recent positive trend within the Bitcoin ETF space, suggesting further upside potential and a bullish outlook for the months ahead. In an X post on June 28, market analyst Axel Adler Jr. highlighted a compelling trend in the accumulation pattern of US Bitcoin Spot ETFs over the past three months. The renowned analyst explains that assets under management (AUM) i.e. net assets of these ETFs excluding the Grayscale GBTC have grown significantly from 932,000 BTC in April 2025 to 1,056,000 BTC today. This development represents a net gain of 124,000 BTC over 87 days, averaging an impressive inflow of 1,430 BTC per day. As the undisputed market leader, the BlackRock IBIT accounts for the majority of this growth attracting 118,000 BTC i.e. 1,360 BTC per day in deposits. In contrast, the remaining 11 ETFs contributed a combined total of 6,000 BTC, or 70 BTC per day, indicating a clear concentration of investor interest around BlackRock’s product. According to Adler Jr., if institutional investors maintain the current accumulation pace of 1,430 BTC per day, these Bitcoin ETFs are on course to hit an AUM of 1,840,000 BTC by September, representing 9.25% of the circulating BTC tokens. Within that total, BlackRock IBIT is expected to hold an estimated 817,000 BTC. When combined with GBTC’s current AUM of $19.79 billion, Adler Jr.’s predictions mean the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs would hold net assets valued significantly over $197.54 billion. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $107,339 reflecting a minor price growth of 0.28% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 33.88% and valued at $30 billion. On larger time frames, the premier cryptocurrency also maintains a positive performance with gains of 5.61% and 1.06% on the weekly and monthly chart respectively, indicating a potential bullish momentum shift following weeks of range-bound movement. Since establishing a new all-time high of $111,970 in late May, Bitcoin has struggled to explore new price territory, instead settling into a descending channel between $100,000 and $110,000.

Title: ‘It feels like a level up’ – Joe McCarthy’s all-action display puts him in the Lions Test match box seat

(AP Photo/Trevor Collens) Lions coach Andy Farrell watches his players warm up ahead of their rugby match against the Western Force in Perth, Australia. Photo: AP Photo/Trevor Collens An opening night outing against the Western Force is a long way from a Six Nations debut in Marseille, but there were shades of Joe McCarthy’s breakthrough performance for Ireland in the way he played in Perth on Saturday. The second-row’s trademark mullet means he fits right in Down Under and he looked as comfortable as he has done in some time as he thundered around the Optus Stadium, skittling blue jerseys as he went. It was a tour de force from the Blackrock second-row, who made two linebreaks and a total 34m across 15 carries and scored a try off the back of Henry Pollock’s brilliant chip and chase. He threw 11 passes including one in the build up that got the Lions moving for Tomos Williams’ try that broke the game open in the second half, with two offloads in the mix as well. Up against retiring former Wallaby Sam Carter and current squad member and enforcer Darcy Swain in the Force second-row, he was a nuisance in contact, turning over a Western Force maul at a crucial stage in the first half, making two dominant tackles and 18 in total in a high work-rate outing. He was busy in the lineout, taking five throws and the local broadcast team that included former Wallaby second row Justin Harrison and Michael Hooper raved about his performance, awarding him the man of the match award. On a night when the Lions’ discipline was highlighted by their coach, McCarthy coughed up just the one penalty. Afterwards, his bruised face bore the hallmarks of a tough night’s work but there was a lightness about the way he spoke that was light years away from his ‘everybody loves to hate Leinster’ line from a few weeks ago. Between the URC title win and a change of scenery, McCarthy looks unburdened and that is a dangerous prospect for the Australians. “It’s such an exciting team to play with – all the players are awesome so you get such a buzz playing with them,” he said. “I loved it. Once I came in for the first session, the standard of training was so high and I just thought, ‘Jeez, I’m going to get so much better, being in this environment.’ I just ripped into it. “It does feel weird [to call yourself a Lion]. It’s very, very cool. “The atmosphere was class and it’s only going to get better. Maybe not all the Lions fans made it to the first game in Western Australia but there were still a lot of red jerseys out there which was cool and there was a good buzz out there. “It was fun to get a bit of space and get my hands free as well. That’s kind of how the Aussies play so that was a bit of a taster today. They look for offloads and linebreaks. It was good to play in a fast-paced game with a lot of offloads.” McCarthy reckons the Lions is going to bring the best out of him. “It’s hard to put your finger on it, sometimes things just happen for you,” he said. “But you might prepare super well for a game and things don’t happen for you. I don’t know. “Especially here, it feels like a level up. There are people here doing everything for you so you try to lean into that, with the medics and the nutritionists. I try to lean on the support staff we have. “I was nervous and on edge a bit this week about playing well, but I’m probably at my best when I feel like my back’s against the wall a little bit.” It helps that McCarthy and his Ireland teammates know the coach and what he wants. Lions coach Andy Farrell watches his players warm up ahead of their rugby match against the Western Force in Perth, Australia. Photo: AP Photo/Trevor Collens Andy Farrell was visibly animated at half time in the dressing-room and he got the required response from the team after the restart. “Andy was pretty calm, generally, but he’s good at getting the boys up,” McCarthy said. “We started really fast but then we let them off the hook a bit with a few penalties. They were still in the game at half-time but then we kicked on a bit. He got us going a bit – he’s really good with the emotion for getting you up. No matter how many games you play for him, he finds a way to do it and we were better for it in the second half.’ “He wants us to be super physical, on the edge, but he tells us, ‘Don’t be desperate, don’t force things – earn the right to get off the line, make tackles and make turnovers.’” This could be a big couple of weeks for the McCarthy family with Joe’s younger brother Paddy in the Ireland squad for their tour of Georgia and Portugal. He’ll then travel out with brother Andrew and parents Joe and Paula in time for the Test series where their boy is set to have a big impact. “I can’t wait for that. They’re going to come out for the last three weeks, to watch the last four games,” McCarthy said. “If Paddy’s playing my family will travel out to Tbilisi. They’ll enjoy that. He was delighted that he made the summer tour and it meant that he could fly to Australia as well. I’m sure he’ll bring his boots with him! “It’s huge. I’d love to see him make his Ireland debut – that would be special.” If he keeps going the way he’s going, they’ll get bang for their buck and in the meantime he’s fully invested in getting the most out of this experience. His role away from rugby is to come up with the Lions’ ‘thought of the day’ with Northampton Saints winger Tommy Freeman. Yesterday, they told the squad that “Today is the oldest you ever have been and the youngest you ever will be”. McCarthy certainly looked like he’s taking an approach that will see him seize his day as a Lion.

Title: Bloomberg: 'Golden Age' of Mass Migration Ends for Business
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/06/29/bloomberg-golden-age-of-mass-migration-ends-for-business/
Time Published: 2025-06-29T16:50:41Z
Full Content:
Business leaders must hire Americans and buy high-tech machines because “the Golden Age [of migration] for employers is ending,” says the pro-migration Bloomberg. “We are witnessing a paradigm shift when it comes to mass immigration, rather than a temporary change,” the June 27 article stated: For as long as most of us can remember, business has been able to call on a ready supply of foreign workers. The giants of Silicon Valley, farmers and food processors, hotels and restaurants, housebuilders and megastores: All have dealt with labor shortages by recruiting immigrants. One result has been an astonishing demographic transformation: 16% of the British population, 20% of the Swedish population, 19% of the German population and 14.3% of the US population were born abroad. WATCH — WOW! Trump Admin Says There Were ZERO May Border Crossings: But public opinion is increasingly opposed to migration, so companies should revive their pre-migration efforts to train locals for new jobs instead of importing workers, Bloomberg recommended: Domestic supply chains have fallen into disrepair in recent decades, in part because both governments and employers have been able to turn to the easy option of importing immigrants. … Companies need to take a more prominent role in fixing domestic [labor] supply chains. Tap into the neglected pool of talent in working-class communities by sponsoring charter schools, endowing university scholarships or spotting and then sponsoring talented students. Improve vocational education by introducing apprenticeship programs or forging relationships with local high schools. Take a more prominent role in providing career guidance in local schools. Employ more unconventional workers such as older workers by introducing flexible working hours or extended holidays. Companies also must invest more in wealth-generating, labor-saving machines instead of exploiting the post-1990 bubble of government-supplied cheap migrant labor, Bloomberg added: This is particularly true of industries that now rely on imported labor such as construction, farming and hospitality. America’s postwar experiment with the factory-based production of houses proved to be a tremendous success, with the price of factory-made homes falling by two-thirds in 1955-73, before it was destroyed by a combination of construction unions and red tape. In agriculture, “intelligent” AI-powered machines can do things that were too delicate for dumb machines, such as nurturing seeds and controlling weeds. In hospitality, robots can do ever more delicate cleaning jobs. The Bloomberg article focused on blue-collar labor and did not spotlight the harm of migration on white-collar Americans. Still, Bloomberg is also posting a series of scoops about the H-1B labor inflow that is displacing many young Americans. Moreover, the Bloomberg article is more evidence that elite opinion is turning away from migration, largely because the establishment media are no longer able to hide the civic chaos, mass deaths and rapes, public anger, primitive ideologies, and economic damage caused by elites’ decision to sideline native populations in favor of the profits earned from foreign migrants. WATCH — ICE Arrests Over 80 Illegal Aliens Working at Louisiana Racetrack: “I used to subscribe to the near consensus among economists that immigration to the US was a good thing,” Professor Angus Deaton wrote in a March 2024 post for the International Monetary Fund. He continued: Longer-term analysis over the past century and a half tells a different story. Inequality was high when America was open [to migration], was much lower when the borders were closed [to migrants], and rose again post Hart-Celler (the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965) as the fraction of foreign-born people rose back to its levels in the Gilded Age. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology “If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard of living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations,” he said. But most business groups and establishment media sites remain pro-migration, regardless of the massive government failures and massive civic chaos that led to the reelection of President Donald Trump in 2024.

Title: The Rocket  Fueled: Bitcoin Supply Shock Incoming, Keiser Says

Bitcoin appears to be tightening its grip on market attention once again—this time not because of price volatility, but due to a looming structural scarcity that some of the asset’s most vocal supporters say is unfolding in real time. Max Keiser, Bitcoin advocate and advisor to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, issued a clear statement on Tuesday, June 25, 2025, via his X account. “I’ve done the math. A Bitcoin supply shock is imminent,” Keiser posted, punctuating the forecast with a rocket emoji. The Bitcoin protocol permanently caps the total supply of Bitcoin (BTC) at 21 million coins. According to blockchain data, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoins have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created. That number is falling fast. This event, part of Bitcoin’s four-year issuance schedule, cut block rewards from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. As a result, the daily release of new coins dropped to approximately 450 BTC per day—down from around 900 before the halving. That drop in new supply arrives just as institutional demand shows no signs of easing. Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, institutional entities have poured billions into the asset. Data from early 2025 shows that ETFs, particularly BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), have absorbed large volumes of BTC. As of June 2025, BlackRock leads all ETF issuers with substantial Bitcoin holdings, outpacing even Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which now controls over 500,000 BTC. In January 2024 after the ETF approvals, Samson Mow warned of a double-edged market pressure: a supply shock from the halving and a demand shock from ETF buying. His view now seems to be taking shape. Mow and Keiser argue that market liquidity could dry up fast when these forces collide. Trading volumes also support the idea of a supply shock. On June 24, Bitcoin trading volume exceeded $3 billion in just one hour. Such spikes indicate growing participation from institutions and retail investors alike, especially during periods of market uncertainty. Bitcoin’s role as a potential store of value is also finding renewed interest amid global instability. The ongoing accumulation by large firms and new treasury entrants such as Metaplanet and ProCap BTC, recently co-founded by VC investor Anthony Pompliano, add weight to the notion that Bitcoin is becoming a preferred long-term asset. On June 25, 2025, Keiser’s remarks will be accompanied by a broader analysis of the changing dynamics in Bitcoin supply and demand. Analysts point to a structural shift—less Bitcoin is being created and more is locked away in institutional vaults. That imbalance already affects availability on exchanges, where reserves continue to drop. Keiser and Mow’s predictions are not new, but the timeline may tighten. With less than five million Bitcoin left to mine, and the next halving set for 2028—when block rewards will fall again to 1.5625 BTC—the pressure on circulating supply may continue to intensify. For now, the data shows demand rising while supply falls. Whether that translates to market movement remains to be seen. But Bitcoin’s architecture ensures one thing: the supply side will not expand. As of late June 2025, that’s no longer just a theoretical talking point—it’s becoming visible on the blockchain.

Title: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Register $2 Billion Inflows As Institutional Demand Surges – Details

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. The US Bitcoin spot ETFs logged over $2 billion in net inflows last week, marking a three-week streak of positive momentum. Despite a bearish start to June, with $128.81 million in net outflows during the first trading week, investor appetite soon quickly rebounded. This turnaround has resulted in a cumulative $4.63 billion in deposits over the past three weeks. On Friday June 27, the 12 US Bitcoin ETFs registered net inflows of $501.27 million bringing the aggregate deposits of the last week to a staggering $2.22 billion. According to data from ETF tracking site SoSoValue, the clean streak of daily inflows from last week extends the ETFs’ positive performance to 14 consecutive days. In analyzing individual ETF data from this week, the BlackRock IBIT registered $1.31 billion in net deposits solidifying its position as the market’s unrivalled leader. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC and Ark/21 Shares’ ARKB also experienced substantial cumulative inflows of $504.40 million and $268.14 million, respectively. Grayscale’s BTC, VanEck’s HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Invesco’s BTCO, and Franklin Templeton’s EZBC also recorded moderate net flows ranging from $1million – $25 million. In familiar fashion, Grayscale’s GBTC produced the only net outflows losing $5.69 million in withdrawals, but still retains its position as the third largest Bitcoin ETF with $19.79 billion in net assets. Following this week, the US Bitcoin Spot ETFs have now recorded $4.50 billion in net flows in June signaling a resolute demand from institutional investors despite Bitcoin market troubles. Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has witnessed extensive corrections since hitting a new all-time high of $111,790 on May 22. Over the last month, BTC has made no new price discovery trading largely between $100,000 and $110,000 to form a descending price channel. While this price performance reflects a neutral market sentiment, the high influx of capital into the Bitcoin ETFs signal a long-term confidence by institutional investors on Bitcoin’s price appreciation prospects. In other developments, SoSoValue data also reveals that US Ethereum Spot ETFs notched up a cumulative inflow of $283.41 million over the last week extending their positive streak to seven consecutive weeks. In June alone, these ETFs saw total inflows of $1.13 billion, marking their largest monthly gain in 2025. As of the time of writing, the total net assets of the Ethereum ETFs stand at $9.88 billion, accounting for 3.37% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum continues to trade at $2,441 with Bitcoin prices set around $107,339. Semilore Faleti is a cryptocurrency writer specialized in the field of journalism and content creation.

Title: Senate removes provision that would sell off public lands from megabill

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/29/2025 8:09:19 AM PDT by RandFan The Senate has removed a controversial provision from its megabill that would have sold off hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was leading the push on the measure, announced late Saturday that the measure would be stripped from the bill. “Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock and not to any foreign interests,” Lee said in a post on X. “For that reason, I’ve decided to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill,” he added. Lee had initially proposed selling off between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands. After that proposal was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian, he put forward a new measure that would have sold off between 600,000 and 1.2 million acres. But, the Utah Republican indicated in his post on Saturday that he would work with President Trump to find uses for what he described as “underutilized” lands. “President Trump promised to put underutilized federal land to work for American families, and I look forward to helping him achieve that in a way that respects the legacy of our public lands and reflects the values of people who use them most,” he wrote. While the measure had some GOP support, it also received pushback from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

Democrats for the most part would not want any Federal land sold to private interest. Those on both sides that are in the pockets of Blackrock and/or the CCP would not want any restriction on who the land was sold to, because the want the government to get the maximum benefit from the sale. On the upside I did see that Trump has cancelled the "No Roads" on US Forest Land in the interest of forest management. 3 posted on 06/29/2025 8:21:57 AM PDT by Pontiac (The welfare state must fail because it is contrary to human nature and diminishes the human spirit.) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: RandFan There's a lot about this bill I don't like, but a significant alternative just isn't possible. The raxor thin margins in the House and Senate means there is only an extremely narrow path.

If your ancestors were here prior to 1854 you also get a lottery share for land in the Gadsen Purchase region, prior to 1848 and you also get a lottery share for Treaty of Guadeloupe land, prior to 1819 and you’re in the running for Onis Treaty land. If your direct ancestors were here before 1803 you get a lottery share for Louisiana Purchase land in addition to all the other lotteries. Each lottery would be for random but similar plots of Federally owned surplus land in a particular lottery location. Once drawn, the land is yours to develop or sell (after a reasonable waiting period). You (the new owner) of course would be responsible for any applicable property taxes or hazardous materials remediation costs (e.g. abandoned mine clean ups). Sorry but if your direct ancestors came here after 1867, you do not qualify for any of the lotteries but you could purchase land from a lottery winner once their mandatory holding period has expired. 20 posted on 06/29/2025 4:24:10 PM PDT by XRdsRev (Justice for Bernell Trammell, black Trump supporter, executed in the street in broad daylight 2020.a) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-31 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Mike Lee (R-Utah), who was leading the push on the measure, announced late Saturday that the measure would be stripped from the bill. “Because of the strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families – not to China, not to Blackrock and not to any foreign interests,” Lee said in a post on X. “For that reason, I’ve decided to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill,” he added. Lee had initially proposed selling off between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of public lands. After that proposal was rejected by the Senate parliamentarian, he put forward a new measure that would have sold off between 600,000 and 1.2 million acres. But, the Utah Republican indicated in his post on Saturday that he would work with President Trump to find uses for what he described as “underutilized” lands. “President Trump promised to put underutilized federal land to work for American families, and I look forward to helping him achieve that in a way that respects the legacy of our public lands and reflects the values of people who use them most,” he wrote. While the measure had some GOP support, it also received pushback from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

If your ancestors were here prior to 1854 you also get a lottery share for land in the Gadsen Purchase region, prior to 1848 and you also get a lottery share for Treaty of Guadeloupe land, prior to 1819 and you’re in the running for Onis Treaty land. If your direct ancestors were here before 1803 you get a lottery share for Louisiana Purchase land in addition to all the other lotteries. Each lottery would be for random but similar plots of Federally owned surplus land in a particular lottery location. Once drawn, the land is yours to develop or sell (after a reasonable waiting period). You (the new owner) of course would be responsible for any applicable property taxes or hazardous materials remediation costs (e.g. abandoned mine clean ups). Sorry but if your direct ancestors came here after 1867, you do not qualify for any of the lotteries but you could purchase land from a lottery winner once their mandatory holding period has expired. 20 posted on 06/29/2025 4:24:10 PM PDT by XRdsRev (Justice for Bernell Trammell, black Trump supporter, executed in the street in broad daylight 2020.a) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-31 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Since taxpayer money was used to buy these lands in the first place, it is long due to repay that debt. Since the original taxpayers who footed the bill for the Louisiana Purchase (1803), the Onis Treaty (1819), the Treaty of Guadeloupe (1848), Gadsden Purchase (1854), Alaska Purchase (1867) are long dead, perhaps repayment can be made to their descendants. We can devise a lottery of Federal land. Anyone who can prove they are the direct descendant of an American resident or Native American tribe prior to 1867 gets one lottery share for a land division in Alaska. If your ancestors were here prior to 1854 you also get a lottery share for land in the Gadsen Purchase region, prior to 1848 and you also get a lottery share for Treaty of Guadeloupe land, prior to 1819 and you’re in the running for Onis Treaty land. If your direct ancestors were here before 1803 you get a lottery share for Louisiana Purchase land in addition to all the other lotteries. Each lottery would be for random but similar plots of Federally owned surplus land in a particular lottery location. Once drawn, the land is yours to develop or sell (after a reasonable waiting period). You (the new owner) of course would be responsible for any applicable property taxes or hazardous materials remediation costs (e.g. abandoned mine clean ups). Sorry but if your direct ancestors came here after 1867, you do not qualify for any of the lotteries but you could purchase land from a lottery winner once their mandatory holding period has expired. 20 posted on 06/29/2025 4:24:10 PM PDT by XRdsRev (Justice for Bernell Trammell, black Trump supporter, executed in the street in broad daylight 2020.a) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-31 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: RandFan There's a lot about this bill I don't like, but a significant alternative just isn't possible. The raxor thin margins in the House and Senate means there is only an extremely narrow path. Sometimes you have to vote for something you don't like because the alternative of having nothing is worse. That's true today, and it was true when McCarthy was Speaker. The people and members can b*tch and scream about what the country needs, and they may well be correct, but the math and makeup of Congress imposes limits that can't be ignored in terms of what is possible.

Yes it would limit how much is sold and how quickly it is sold, but it would keep that land out of the hands of the above which is the whole point. The federal government owns a ridiculous amount of land in the west. It stifles the growth of those states and makes home prices artificially high. In addition to the above, it would generate good revenue for the federal treasury to sell some land. Land sales used to be a nice 10% or so of federal revenues per year. 8 posted on 06/29/2025 8:44:14 AM PDT by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: RandFan Typical of DC.

Title: Bitcoin Bet Turns Bitter: 5 Lawsuits Vs. Strategy For $6 Billion Losses

Strategy Inc., the company once known as MicroStrategy, is now at the center of at least five class‑action lawsuits. Investors claim the firm hid big risks tied to its Bitcoin holdings and painted a rosier picture than what was real. The lawsuits hinge on about $6 billion in unrealized losses and cover an 11‑month stretch from April 2024 through April 2025. According to filings, the complaints say executives made untrue and misleading statements about Bitcoin’s ups and downs and an accounting change that forces the company to mark its crypto to market. One lead plaintiff, Abhey Parmar, insists that top officers breached their duties and oversold the company’s outlook. Based on reports, law firms are already bidding to lead these actions—the kind of scramble you see when big money is at stake. Strategy is facing at least five class action lawsuits alleging securities fraud due to $6 billion in unrealized BTC losses. The lawsuits accuse the firm of misleading investors about Bitcoin risks and profitability. Legal experts say such competing filings are common as firms… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 27, 2025 Investors point to trades by new CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang as proof of inside dealing. They sold about $32 million in stock just before the public disclosure of the accounting shift. Lawyers say that timing raises questions about whether executives knew how badly the mark‑to‑market losses would hit the books. If they held back material facts until after their trades, that could stiffen the case. In April, Strategy warned shareholders it wouldn’t break even in Q1 because of those same unrealized Bitcoin losses. The firm reported a loss of $16.49 per share and cautioned it might not turn a profit soon. That announcement triggered the first suit—filed on May 16 by Pomerantz LLP—and prompted follow‑ons from Gross Law Firm; Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman; Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check; and Levi & Korsinsky. Despite the courtroom drama, the stock is up nearly 30% so far this year. Strategy now holds 592,345 BTC, with a total market value north of $63 billion. The firm bought its Bitcoin at an average of $70,702 per coin, and today they trade around $106,824—an unrealized gain of about $21.3 billion, or roughly 50%. Those figures help explain why investors have stuck with the plan. Based on the latest SEC filings, founder Michael Saylor is the biggest holder, with close to 20 million shares—worth almost $8 billion at $389.50 per share. Other big names include Vanguard at 8.55%, BlackRock at 5.80%, Capital International Investors at 5.80%, Susquehanna Securities at 4.82%, and Jane Street Group at 4.70%. Strategy’s stock trades near $393.24, valuing the company at about $107.50 billion—a 1.67x premium over its net asset value.

Title: Breaking: Mike Lee's Public Land Sale Plan Is Dead

By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Facing overwhelming opposition from all Democrats and a growing number in his own party, Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee tonight withdrew his proposal to sell millions of acres of public land to help balance the federal budget. In a statement issued by his office, Lee said that because of the “strict constraints of the budget reconciliation process, I was unable to secure clear, enforceable safeguards to guarantee that these lands would be sold only to American families — not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests. For that reason I’ve made the decision to withdraw the federal land sales provision from the bill.” Lee’s language, a central part of the omnibus federal budget bill, would have put more than a million acres of BLM land on the auction block starting later this year. Senate leaders, hurriedly working to get the budget to a floor vote this weekend, gave Lee the opportunity to pull his provision, pages 202 to 211 of the thousand-page Big Beautiful Bill, knowing that it would have faced certain defeat by the Republican-majority Senate. That language would have forced the sale of BLM land in 11 Western states to offset tax cuts and royalty rebates to gas and oil drillers. The language in those pages, sponsored and revised over the last two weeks by Lee, would have created the largest disposal of public land since the Homestead Act. Tens of thousands of hunters, anglers, hikers, and public-land recreationists have pummeled the offices of their congressional delegations with increasingly strident demands to kill Lee’s bill. That continued pressure from a broad and vocal coalition of rural hunters, suburban hikers, livestock producers, Main Street business owners, anglers, dirtbag climbers, and whitewater rafters made the difference, says Montanan Randy Newberg, host of Fresh Tracks and a vocal public-land advocate. “Mike Lee did something that we’ve not been able to do, to have all Americans become focused on one issue, no partisanship, no Rs, no Ds, and in the process I hope they have sent a message that public lands are that third rail of American politics,” says Newberg, one of several social-media personalities who rallied his audience around defending public lands. “I think you could also say the same of the Senate, they put partisanship aside to kill this bad idea.” Newberg singled out the work of New Mexico Democrat Martin Heinrich for his ability to keep all Democrats aligned on killing Lee’s bill, and working across the aisle to convince fellow Western Republicans that it was bad for their constituents. While calls for the removal of the land-sale language from the mega bill was nearly unanimous, Lee kept digging in, making revisions that increased the amount of land that could be sold and adding vague language that seemed to stray from what he said was his intention: to allow Western municipalities to buy surrounding federal land in order to grow and build affordable housing for their residents. But in the most recent iteration, released by Lee’s office last night in order to satisfy the Senate’s budgetary rules, the highest priority for would-be disposed BLM lands was their appraised value. That highly valued land would likely have been bought by amenity purchasers, not cash-strapped Western cities. By adding lands with unallocated subsurface mineral rights to the total, the latest draft of the bill alarmed conservationists —— as much as 3 million acres of BLM land might have been available for sale to private industries, speculators, and even foreign governments. The Senate’s budget reconciliation process allows the omnibus budget package to pass by a simple majority. Republicans have only a 3-seat majority in both the Senate and House, but four Western Republicans had indicated they wouldn’t support the budget bill if it contained Lee’s land sales provision. Sources report that the roster of Republicans quietly in opposition to the measure was large and growing, causing the Senate leadership to strike Lee’s language in order to move the rest of the Big Beautiful Bill, which among other things could make tax cuts permanent for the wealthiest Americans and also includes cuts to Medicaid, public-lands management agencies, and federal reimbursements to rural hospitals. The Senate’s death blow to Lee’s bill removes pressure on the House of Representatives to kill the language. The House had been considered the “backwall” in efforts to make sure the land-sale provision didn’t advance to President Trump, who had indicated strong support for the proposal.

Title: ‘The Canal Is Ours’

The building projects both power and exclusion. For most of the twentieth century it was the administrative seat of the former Panama Canal Zone, a US enclave to which most Panamanians were denied access. The canal—one of the infrastructural marvels of the twentieth century and a crucial artery of global trade—became the epicenter of US power in Latin America when Teddy Roosevelt secured control of its surrounding territory in 1903. It retained that distinction for nearly three quarters of a century, until Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama’s military leader, Omar Torrijos, that gradually ceded the Canal Zone to the Republic of Panama. The cession was to be completed by 12:00 PM on that December day in 1999. When the morning arrived, heavy rains drenched the isthmus, but a sea of people turned out all the same. At the strike of noon the crowd rushed up the hill to the Administration Building, waving Panama’s tricolor flag. “The canal is ours,” Panama’s president, Mireya Moscoso, proclaimed from atop the stairs. That celebration echoed this past December, when hundreds of people gathered at the Administration Building to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the end of the canal transition. The Panama Canal Authority, the semiautonomous entity that has overseen the maritime passage since 1997, placed a plaque on the front of the structure commemorating the achievement, which many in Panama and across the hemisphere consider a triumph of Latin American self-determination in the face of centuries of US hegemony. The festivities were not without anxiety. A week earlier, at an event hosted by the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point USA, then–president elect Donald Trump proclaimed that the US was being “ripped off at the Panama Canal”—presumably a reference to the tolls that container ships pay to traverse the passage. Trump complemented the speech with a series of posts on his social media platform, Truth Social, alleging that China was running the waterway and announcing that, consequently, the US would be taking it back. The comments sent shockwaves through Panama. President José Raúl Mulino flatly rejected them, asserting the country’s “nonnegotiable” sovereignty over the passage and insisting that “every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjoining zone is Panama’s and will remain so.” But even as Panamanian society recoiled at Trump’s rhetoric, other sectors saw an opportunity for vindication. When Carter negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties in 1977, he met stiff resistance from the Zonians, US citizens whose families had lived in the Canal Zone for generations, running the waterway and maintaining the slice of middle-class American society that cropped up around it. Carter is effectively a national hero in Panama, but many of the Zonians have long considered him an enemy. “I just hope Jimmy Carter stays alive long enough to see Trump take back the Panama Canal,” one participant posted in a Zonian group on Facebook after Trump’s initial provocations. Carter died that same week. Even amid the funeral rites, Trump continued to disparage Carter’s cession of the US colonial enclave in Panama as “a very big mistake.” For the Panamanians who showed up at the Administration Building on December 31, such language was deeply alarming. But it held an appeal for some of the Zonians, who recall the canal transition as a personal epic of paradise lost. Demostenes Angel/AFP/Getty Images Demonstrators gathering at the Panama Canal’s Administration Building to celebrate the waterway’s final handover to Panamanian control, Panama City, December 31, 1999 At the time of the treaty negotiations, many Zonians rallied behind the burgeoning neoconservative movement, donating to right-wing politicians and collaborating with organizations like the American Conservative Union and the Heritage Foundation—the latter going on to design Project 2025, the policy playbook that has informed much of the second Trump administration’s governance.1 By ceding the canal, they thought, Carter had demonstrated a weakness that, as the arch-conversative Republican senator from North Carolina Jesse Helms warned at the time, “could literally destroy America.” Bound to the Zonians’ plight, then, was the question of America’s global standing. The US’s decline from its postwar grandeur has many causes, but for the Zonians and Trump alike, some answers might be found on the isthmus of Panama. * In 1903 Teddy Roosevelt sought rights to construct a sea-level canal across Panama, then a province of Colombia. When Bogotá refused, he pivoted to Panama’s oligarchy, which had repeatedly agitated for independence over the course of the nineteenth century. Roosevelt promised to recognize and defend the new Panamanian nation, with his gunboats if necessary; in exchange the Panamanian elite gave Washington control over a ten-mile-wide stretch of territory that would encompass the canal. The agreement was enshrined in the 1903 Hay-Bunau-Varilla Treaty, which leased US rights to the territory “in perpetuity.” In November of that year, Washington gained the Canal Zone and Panama gained nationhood in one stroke. Advertisement The task of excavating the canal brought tens of thousands of workers from around the world: European and Chinese émigrés, migrants from surrounding Latin American countries, West Indian laborers seeking opportunity in the face of the stagnation then plaguing former plantation slavery economies. Among the “ditch diggers” were thousands of white US citizens (the hiring of Black US citizens during the construction period was limited), hailing from all corners of the country but especially from northeastern and midwestern industrial centers like New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The meaning of the term “Zonian” has evolved in the past half-century: depending on whom you ask, it could refer to military personnel stationed in one of the fourteen US military bases that once lined the canal, or to US civilians who moved to the Zone over the mid-twentieth century to work for the Panama Canal Company. But in its most restrictive use the term applies to the white US canal builders and their descendants. The first generation of Zonians came from a range of backgrounds—some were engineers, others manual laborers—yet all found themselves on a preferential end of a system of Jim Crow–style segregation that the US exported to the isthmus in the early twentieth century.2 At the base of that system was a two-tiered wage hierarchy. White laborers got paid in gold American dollars (the “gold roll”) whereas other laborers, largely West Indian and Panamanian, got paid in local coin, typically Colombian silver pesos (the “silver roll”). That distinction, in turn, shaped the rest of economic and social life: there were gold towns and silver towns, gold schools and silver schools, movie theaters, recreation areas, drinking fountains, and so on. The Isthmian Canal Commission, the administration overseeing the canal’s construction, claimed to be distinguishing merely between “skilled” and “unskilled” workers, but many gold and silver positions demanded identical responsibilities and duties. A “gold-roller” could make somewhere between two to four times as much as a “silver-roller” for effectively the same job. Otis Historical Archives/Wikimedia Commons A hand-tinted lantern slide of Spanish laborers working on the construction of the Panama Canal, circa early 1900s This system of segregation drew on some of the mechanisms of Jim Crow, as well as its animating spirit, but was complicated by the international setting of the Zone. To preserve white Americans’ primacy, race was “mapped onto nationality,” as the historian Rebecca Herman has written.3 To be American was, in effect, to be white; by extension, “to be a non-U.S. citizen was to be defined as non-white.” European canal builders and white Latinos were relegated to the silver roll; Black US citizens had been restricted precisely because they complicated the logic of the gold–silver hierarchy. By the 1930s some twenty worked civilian jobs in the Zone, almost all of them on the silver roll. The Canal Zone Government didn’t, moreover, extend birthright citizenship to children born to non-US citizens in the Zone, ensuring that even babies born in the Zone’s Gorgas hospital would be denied gold-roll status unless their parents were US citizens. In 1948, to accord with the Truman administration’s civil rights reforms, the Canal Zone administration changed the dual payment system from gold and silver to “US-rate” and “local-rate” (or in some instances “Latin American” rate). A 1955 bilateral agreement prompted lukewarm efforts to unify the wage system, but the Zone’s personnel bureau largely ignored the mandate. By 1961 only 240 Panamanians received US-rate wages, and the discrepancy between the two schedules persisted at a rate of four to one. It would not be until December 1977, two years before the implementation of the treaty and twenty-three years after the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, that the Zone’s last segregated “Latin American” school would officially close.4 * As the century progressed, successive Panamanian administrations sought to reclaim the Zone, forging a series of new bilateral agreements that modified but never annulled the 1903 treaty. By midcentury, nationalist sentiment boiled over into a series of violent clashes between Panamanian citizens and the Zone’s military and civilian populations. Perhaps the most significant occurred on January 9, 1964, when a group of Panamanian students marched into the Canal Zone and attempted to raise a Panamanian flag outside the enclave’s Balboa High School. Their efforts were met with violence, first from the Zone’s residents and police force and then from the US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)—the arm of the US Department of Defense headquartered in the Canal Zone. The confrontation ignited widespread riots that left three hundred people wounded and two dozen dead. Advertisement Amid the upheaval, Panamanian President Roberto F. Chiari suspended diplomatic relations with the US; the terms of their resumption three months later included initiating a process to negotiate a new treaty, which would replace the Hay-Bunau-Varilla agreement. Former president Aristedes Royo, who helped negotiate the Torrijos-Carter treaties and served as the civilian face of Panama’s dictatorship when the agreements went into effect, told me that by trying to keep the Panamanian students from raising their flag that January day in 1964, the Zonians ultimately benefited the Panamanian cause. Royo and I spoke in late 2023, as he was completing his tenure as minister of canal affairs. We met in his wood-paneled office, which was converted from a former Canal Zone school and located only a short distance from where the flag riots broke out. As he recalls it, the 1977 treaties owe a debt of gratitude to “the Zonians’ poor conduct that day.” The road from the riots to the Torrijos-Carter treaties was hardly straight. Successive US administrations delayed, uneager to cede any control over such a strategic foothold. Only in the aftermath of Washington’s catastrophic war in Vietnam, when Carter took office seeking a foreign policy rooted in respect for international law and the self-determination of other nations, did Panama’s fortunes change. At the time of treaty implementation, some 3,500 “true” Zonians—white US civilian laborers with multigenerational histories on the isthmus—and their families resided in the enclave, a select minority among the 14,500 total US and Panamanian workers employed by the Panama Canal Company and the Canal Zone Government. To these Zonians, whose daily reality depended on Washington’s forcible presence in Panama, the 1977 agreement spelled the end of a way of life. Those that remained over the transition period would be tasked with training a Panamanian workforce to take over their jobs. When the treaties entered into force on October 1, 1979, it marked the formal dissolution of the Canal Zone as such: the Republic of Panama immediately assumed jurisdiction over much of the ten-mile-wide territory. US military bases and personnel in Panama came under a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA), an accord establishing a legal framework to dictate the rights and privileges of military-affiliated foreign nationals stationed in another country. US personnel began gradually turning over townsites, military bases, and infrastructure in the former Zone, to be completed over the following decades. In accordance with the Panama Canal Act of 1979, the legislation that implemented the treaties, Canal Commission employees were allowed to retire as early as forty-eight with eighteen years of service, or at any age after twenty-three years of service, effectively ensuring that all workers employed at the time the Torrijos-Carter Treaties were signed would be able to start collecting pensions upon the completion of the transition in 1999. The possibility of early retirement was not enough to placate the Zonians. Even before the ink had dried on the Panama Canal Treaties, negotiation efforts sparked what some in the community have called “the exodus.” A world was ending, and Jimmy Carter was the horseman of their apocalypse. On September 30, 1979, they went to bed under US jurisdiction and awoke under the government of Omar Torrijos, a mestizo general from the hinterlands of Panama.5 The vast majority of the community left Panama and resettled elsewhere, predominantly in the southern climes of the US. They were under no legal obligation to depart; Torrijos had extended citizenship to the Zonians in the years leading up to the treaty, and many of them became dual citizens. Nevertheless, as H.B. Twohy, a fourth-generation Zonian, told me, many felt an expectation to “go back home to a place I’ve never lived before.” U.S. National Archives and Records Administration/Wikimedia Commons The docks of Balboa, the capital of the American-administered Panama Canal Zone, 1923 There is a general feeling among the Zonians of having been unjustly abandoned by a federal government that had for years administered every facet of their lives, from housing to employment to grocery shopping at subsidized commissaries. There is a prevailing notion, too, that the media has dealt them an unfair hand, particularly in its portrayals of the Canal Zone’s racial segregation. “When the treaty came about, everybody was pissed,” recalled Mike Andrews, a onetime cooling and refrigeration foreman who lived and worked on the Atlantic side of the Zone. Despite his opposition to the transition he decided to remain in Panama, where both his parents are buried. Andrews departed the former Zone in 1991 to run a fishing lodge in Panama’s Darién province and has since retired. We spoke in January of 2024 at a Zonian reunion at the Elks Lodge, a beloved Zonian haunt a short drive from the Administration Building just outside Panama City. The mounted antlers of countless bucks lined the walls. “There are few places that the Americans who stayed after the treaty have to go to,” he told me, other than the lodge where we were talking. Before the transition, Andrews said, he used to hunt and fish freely in the Zone’s thick jungles and abundant waters, but now he was irked by Panama’s tighter gun regulations. “We had a utopia,” he told me. “It’s sad what happened…since the treaty. Panamanians have destroyed this country.” * The Zonians did not go down without a fight. At the time of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty negotiations, they pinned their hopes on Ronald Reagan, who as a Republican primary candidate for the 1976 presidential elections gave a fervent, oft-repeated stump speech that made him a hero to US citizens in Panama: [The] Canal Zone is not a colonial possession. It is not a long-term lease. It is sovereign United States Territory every bit the same as Alaska and all the states that were carved from the Louisiana Purchase. We should end those negotiations and tell the General: We bought it, we paid for it, we built it, and we intend to keep it. That the claim was inaccurate—in fact the 1903 treaty leased the Canal Zone territory to the United States in perpetuity rather than transferring ownership—made little difference to the Zonians and their neoconservative allies in the metropole. “We thought he was going to be our salvation,” Andrews recalled of Reagan, who lost the 1976 primary to Gerald Ford but went on to oust Jimmy Carter from the White House in a landslide four years later. After Reagan won the presidency, in Andrews’s telling, he had too much “political pressure put on him” to thwart the canal transition. And yet the US hardly stayed out of Panamanian politics after 1980. The Department of Defense maintained its Southern Command headquarters in the Canal Zone neighborhood of Quarry Heights and continued training Panama’s military, the Panamanian Defense Forces, at the US Army School of the Americas, located in the former Zone’s Fort Gulick. One of the school’s graduates, Manuel Noriega, became the de facto dictator of Panama in 1983 following Omar Torrijos’s death in a suspicious plane crash two years prior. Noriega was a crucial collaborator in the Reagan administration’s War on Drugs, funneling information to the Drug Enforcement Agency and the CIA even as he forged his own narcotrafficking empire. By 1982 he was charging runners from Pablo Escobar’s Medellín drug cartel $100,000 per trip to use Panamanian airstrips to transit their wares, sending members of the PDF to coordinate the operations and payments.6 By mid-decade the US–Panamanian relationship was fraying, in part as a result of Noriega’s illegal activities, which the journalist Seymour Hersh detailed in June 1986 in a bombshell investigation for The New York Times. As Panamanians took to the streets in opposition and the dictatorship meted out increasingly violent repression, the general came to seem more like a liability than an asset. Finally, in 1989, the US Department of Defense unleashed some 26,000 troops on the isthmus to depose and capture Noriega. Steve Starr/Corbis/Getty Images American tanks in the streets of Panama City during the US invasion, 1989 Washington helped install the US-friendly president Guillermo Endara, who was sworn into office on one of the remaining US military bases in the early morning hours of December 20 at the very moment that Operation Just Cause—as the US called the invasion—descended upon the country. Eighteen thousand Panamanians lost their homes to the operation; the Pentagon reported 516 Panamanian casualties, but independent human rights groups estimated that civilian deaths were in the thousands. Many of the slain were residents of El Chorrillo, an Afro-Panamanian neighborhood in downtown Panama City that was also home to the PDF headquarters. The Department of Defense all but razed El Chorrillo to the ground in an indiscriminate bombing campaign in the first hours of the invasion; thousands of Chorrilleros had to be resettled in temporary housing, and many found themselves in active or defunct US bases along the Canal. Twenty-five-hundred people would ultimately spend two years living in improvised shelters fashioned from airplane hangars that were previously part of the Albrook Air Force Station.7 Despite the carnage, much of Panamanian society was relieved to be rid of Noriega. In the years leading up to his ouster the Cruzada Civilista (Civil Crusade), a dynamic coalition drawing from all sectors of the country’s citizenry, assembled a peaceful movement against the strongman. Some of its members would go on to have prominent government positions in post-invasion Panama, including José Raúl Mulino. The country rebuilt, democracy returned, and those exiled by the dictatorship could at last return home. In the following decades relations between Washington and Panama City have been amicable and robust. All the country’s heads of state since 2000 have received their higher education in the US, and the two countries have signed numerous security and free trade agreements since the end of the canal transition. Even as the canal’s administration became solely Panamanian, US presence remained palpable: a retired naval admiral and former commander in chief of the US Atlantic Fleet chairs the Panama Canal Authority’s advisory board. The US has also remained the canal’s primary customer: roughly 40 percent of all the country’s container shipping moves through Panama each year. The Zonians, for their part, largely adapted to life in the continental US, resigned to commemorating their history at reunions in Florida or, for the more committed, returning to Panama for annual events. Some have purchased reverted buildings in the former Canal Zone and fixed them up as vacation stays for part of the year. Many maintain their dislike for Carter and incline toward conservative politics. Mike Andrews, for one, considers Reagan the best president of his lifetime, even if he failed to recover the Canal Zone. “This is a very strong Republican populace,” he told me about his fellow reunion attendees in 2024. Most Zonians have by now come to accept the transition as an inevitable part of history. At this year’s Elks Lodge reunion, however, the enclave the Zonians came to commemorate had reemerged as a major news story. The newly appointed secretary of state, Marco Rubio, was about to land in Panama for his first official trip abroad. “Did you pick out your house yet?” some of the pro-Trump attendees half-joked, suggesting that perhaps their past was not quite past after all. * Rubio arrived on February 1. In Panama City there was a nervous mixture of dread and excitement. More progressive sectors of society were predictably incensed. The historically radical University of Panama held an emergency teach-in following Trump’s inauguration, where students and faculty posted enormous signs proclaiming that “Panama Is and Will Remain Sovereign and Neutral”—both refuting Trump’s claims that China was operating the canal and stressing that Panama has no legal obligation to kowtow to Washington. (One of the original 1977 Torrijos-Carter agreements, the Treaty Concerning the Permanent Neutrality and Operation of the Panama Canal, stipulates as much.) The labor union conglomerate SUNTRACS led protests that shut down large swaths of Panama City; some members trampled signs portraying Rubio in an SS uniform and standing before a Nazi flag. Enea Lebrun/picture alliance/Getty Images A protester confronting police offers during Marco Rubio’s visit to Panama City, February 2, 2025 Not everyone was as quick to condemn the new administration. Many Panamanians were intrigued that the first Latino US secretary of state was visiting their country. On the morning of Rubio’s meeting with President Mulino, onlookers gathered near the presidential Palacio de las Garzas in the neighborhood of Casco Viejo, a small outcropping of lowlands perched on the Bay of Panama. Before the meeting Rubio attended mass in a nearby cathedral that housed an image of the Caridad del Cobre, the Virgin of Charity and Cuba’s patron saint—a nod to his Cuban heritage. The area was swarmed with press and onlookers, some of whom posed to take selfies with Rubio, who spoke to Mulino’s staff and ministers in Spanish. For Rubio, the trip was intended to christen an era of resurgent US dominion in the Americas—one in which the United States would unilaterally dictate other nations’ immigration and trade policy. Panama is of outsized importance to both issues. The southeast end of the country is flanked by the Darién Gap, a treacherous strip of jungle separating South and Central America through which more than 300,000 migrants passed last year on their way north toward the US–Mexico border. Then, of course, there is the country’s relationship with Beijing. China is the Canal’s second-largest customer and has significantly increased direct investment in Panama over the last decade. At a press conference after his meeting with Rubio that February morning, Mulino announced the first of what would in the coming months grow into a cavalcade of concessions to the Trump administration. He assured his constituents that no US military invasion was imminent—an understandable preoccupation for a citizenry that watched Black Hawk helicopters swarm their neighborhoods decades ago—but announced that he would modify Panama’s anti-immigration efforts to accord with the Trump administration’s demands. SENAFRONT, Panama’s corollary to the US Border Patrol, has collaborated with the US government for years on anti-immigration initiatives, receiving direct training from the US Army; there is even an ICE office in the US embassy in Panama City. But Rubio’s visit made plain that Washington expected still more draconian measures. Among other things, Mulino announced that he had offered the US the use of an airstrip to facilitate deportation flights for migrants attempting to pass through the Darién Gap. Before Rubio left the country in the following days, he personally oversaw a deportation flight leaving from the former US airport at Albrook, outside Panama City. Mulino also announced that Panama would withdraw from the Belt and Road initiative, Beijing’s sweeping global infrastructure program encompassing 150 countries around the world, including more than twenty in Latin America. Panama became the first country in the region to sign on to the initiative in 2017, the year it established formal diplomatic relations with Beijing. That rapprochement occurred during the first Trump presidency, during which the state department failed to appoint a US ambassador to the country, leaving, as Mulino put it, “many empty seats” into which China easily slid. And yet China’s presence in Panama is nowhere near as extensive as Trump has claimed. Panama’s relationship to the US remains far more longstanding and robust, and the Mulino administration has made clear which side it’s taking in the emergent new cold war. In a particularly telling move, the week before Trump’s inauguration, Mulino’s government announced that it would audit the Panama Ports Company, a subsidiary of the Hong Kong multinational CK Hutchinson Holdings, owned by the billionaire Li Ka-Shing. In 1997, when the canal’s incoming Panamanian administration offered foreign governments and multinationals leases on concessions to some of the ports along the passage, Ka-Shing vastly outbid his American competitor for control of the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal, offering Panama $22 million in annual rent and 10 percent of its port revenue for a duration of twenty-five years. Panama renewed those contracts as recently as 2021, but the announcement suggested that Mulino’s administration might be hoping to find inconsistencies in Panama Ports’ bookkeeping that could give Panama legal cause to sever the agreements—a development that would permit it to cut one of its principal ties with China at its own discretion. As the audit dragged on, the US sought its own workaround: On March 4 the US asset management firm BlackRock announced an agreement with CK Hutchinson Holdings to purchase 90 percent of the Panama Ports Company. Trump lauded the deal as a foreign policy victory. The Chinese government, for its part, was quick to denounce the agreement as a “hegemonic act” that thwarted “the legitimate rights and interests of other countries through coercion, pressure, inducement, and other despicable means.” Beijing has a series of legal mechanisms it may draw on to probe the deal, including the use of a sweeping National Security law passed in 2020 in response to protests that had erupted in Hong Kong the year prior. Panama, meanwhile, struggling to assert some self-determination, announced that its audit had turned up evidence of misconduct that may lead it to deem the 2021 contract illegal and void. In the event that Panama manages to annul its concessions agreements with CK Hutchinson Holdings, the Panama Ports Company could be ousted from the ports of Balboa and Cristóbal regardless of who owns it, potentially allowing for bids from foreign governments and multinationals on Panama’s terms. The strategy, if it works, will allow Panama to maintain a semblance of autonomy even as it placates Washington by extricating China from its ports. Mulino’s attempted balancing act has yielded dubious results. His pivot away from Beijing and his deference to the US on immigration policy have not stopped Washington from pursuing physical encroachments on the isthmus. Shortly after the BlackRock deal was announced in March, Trump ordered the Pentagon to draw up plans for military actions in Panama—a perplexing move, since Panama demilitarized after the US invasion and has no standing army. And in April Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, fresh off accidentally leaking information about military strikes in Yemen to the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic via Signal, returned to the isthmus to exact still more concessions. During his visit the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding permitting the US to deploy troops to some of Washington’s former military installations along the waterway, which Panama transformed into commercial logistics hubs after the transition. The deployments are rotational, with US troops moving through sites that will remain under Panama’s full administrative authority. The memorandum stopped short of allowing the US to establish its own bases in the country or to retake control of the installations it had vacated by 1999. All the same, it dealt a remarkable blow to Panamanian sovereignty. * As Marco Rubio terminated his February trip to Panama, I met again with Aristedes Royo, this time in a cafe in the business district of Obarrio in downtown Panama City. Royo had concluded his term as minister of canal affairs roughly a year earlier, and that day he was holding court for a cortege of reporters from around the world who had come to the isthmus to cover Rubio’s visit. When Royo and I first spoke in 2023, he concluded the interview with an emphatic affirmation of the good will between Panama and the US—a happy ending to a personal and national saga, one he assumed would not be undone. At our recent meeting, however, he sang a different tune. “It may be dangerous to be America’s enemy,” he said with a slow shake of his head, quoting a line attributed to Henry Kissinger, “but to be America’s friend is fatal.” Mark Schiefelbein/POOL/AFP US Secretary of State Marco Rubio walking with Ricaurte Vasquez, the administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, during a tour of the canal’s Miraflores locks, Panama City, February 2, 2025 Royo spent much of our second conversation explaining in painstaking detail how the Panama Canal functioned—the role of the Panamanian citizens who pilot small vessels to guide container ships through the locks system and the structure of the Panama Canal Authority, which employs more than eight thousand Panamanians to administer and run the waterway. The operation was Panamanian through and through, he emphasized: Panama would be able to limit the access of vessels from any nation if they posed a threat to the canal’s security and neutrality. It felt as though he were attempting to speak to the Trump administration through me, that if he could convince me that China was not running the canal, then the US government would understand it, too. In the following months Panama’s security minister, Frank Ábrego, and its canal administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales, offered similar assurances to visiting US officials. And yet none of them have seemed to stop the Trump administration from reiterating its claims about Chinese incursion. Some in the Zonian community have echoed the allegation. “You can go throughout Panama and see big road signs all in that squiggly Chinese writing,” Mike Andrews told me. In Zonian groups on social media, Trump’s language and policies have inspired debate. Some members celebrated the prospect of renewed US control over the waterway, while others seemed resigned to the idea that there would be no return to the Zone they once called home. (“As a czbrat I loved the cz. But get over it,” one posted in a Facebook group after Trump’s inauguration.) If there was a consistency across the community, however, it was the prevailing sense of historical grievance. “It has hurt many a Zonian that Panama has not erected any monument or memorabilia thanking the USA for the Canal,” Andrews said over e-mail. Panamanians, meanwhile, took to the streets in response to April’s memorandum of understanding, claiming that the president had signed away the country’s autonomy. Mulino has since informed his constituents that he will not renegotiate the security deal. “Panama’s sovereignty is not at stake, it’s not handed over, it’s not given,” he said in his weekly national press conference on May 8. And yet now that US troops are positioned to deploy to three of Washington’s former military bases on the isthmus—Fort Sherman, Rodman Naval Station, and Howard Air Force Base—the country’s military will have a presence on Panamanian soil without parallel since the last century. The installations are nestled in las áreas revertidas (“the reverted areas”), a large stretch of which Panama decades ago transformed into a bucolic nature reserve and rechristened Sovereignty National Park.

Title: Spot XRP ETF Path Made Clear After Ripple CEO Confirms Ending SEC Case ‘Once And For All’

The nearly five-year legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be finally coming to an end after Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced Friday that the company plans to drop its cross-appeal in the prolonged case. “Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said,” Garlinghouse wrote in a post on X. “We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important— building the Internet of Value. Lock in.” Ripple is dropping our cross appeal, and the SEC is expected to drop their appeal, as they’ve previously said. We’re closing this chapter once and for all, and focusing on what’s most important – building the Internet of Value. Lock in. https://t.co/ZsRgDfcpLh The announcement comes just a day after U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres denied a joint bid from Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission to slash a $125 million penalty and toss out a permanent injunction imposed against the blockchain payments company last year. That decision followed less than two weeks after the SEC and Ripple asked that the court reduce the civil penalty over illegal XRP sales to $50 million, significantly less than the $2 billion sought under former Chair Gary Gensler. The legal drama between Ripple and the SEC has been going on for years since December 2020, when the regulator accused the XRP-linked firm of raising $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering. In 2023, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s programmatic sales of XRP on crypto exchanges did not break securities laws. Torres did, however, rule that other direct sales of the token to institutional investors qualified as securities. Ripple was fined $125 million and banned from similar sales. Both Ripple and the SEC agreed to allow $50 million of the initially-imposed $125 million fine to go to the SEC, with the remaining $75 million to be returned to the San Francisco-based company, though they have encountered pushback in court over the past month. XRP was changing hands around $2.19 on Saturday, reflecting a 5% increase over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token is up a whopping 358% over the past year. According to Nate Geraci, the President of ETF Store, the conclusion of the case effectively removes the regulatory hurdle blocking the approval of U.S.-listed spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Over nine asset managers have so far filed for XRP ETF products in the US, including major issuers like Bitwise, ProShares, 21Shares, and Franklin Templeton. Despite the growing XRP ETF filing frenzy, BlackRock — issuer of the largest spot Bitcoin ETF — has yet to submit paperwork for an XRP-based investment vehicle. Geraci believes that with no regulatory obstacles in sight, BlackRock could soon apply with the SEC to introduce an ETF tied to the industry’s fourth-largest crypto by market cap.

Title: Billions in corporate buys can’t budge Bitcoin—5 reasons the BTC price won’t move

Why is Bitcoin’s price flat even as companies buy billions? Hidden dynamics behind ETF flows, paper bitcoin, and market manipulation, for a start. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. From Michael Saylor to David Bailey, Anthony Pompliano to Jack Mallers, and everyone in between, there’s a rising tide of executives buying bitcoin for their corporate treasuries. Large companies and Wall Street are vacuuming up billions of dollars’ worth of BTC every week, yet its price remains relatively untouched. One Bitcoiner took to Twitter to ask why and received more than 1.3K replies. Here’s the best: “Can anyone explain to me why companies are buying billions of dollars of bitcoin every week and the price is virtually unchanged over the last 6 months?” Bitcoin Cam’s question clearly reflects the broader sentiment of Crypto Twitter, receiving over 800,000 views in a few hours and more than 1,300 replies. Even Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff chimed in with his 2 cents: “The whales who already own a bunch of Bitcoin are selling to these buyers to cash out their huge gains.” But the best reply came from SightBringer, who provides signal-bearing intelligence across macro, crypto, and capital. He said: “They’re buying billions and the price isn’t moving because this isn’t a market anymore – it’s a controlled ignition chamber.” Then he broke it down point by point: Basically, large investors like BlackRock and Fidelity are buying real bitcoin through special funds called ETFs. This isn’t just pretend money; these are actual coins being tucked away for the long term. In 2025, public companies bought a record number of bitcoins, and these ETFs are seeing billions in new money come in. The coins are being taken off exchanges, so fewer are left for everyone else to buy or sell. Here, SightBringer explains that most trading on big crypto exchanges doesn’t actually move real coins. Instead, it’s just “paper bitcoin” (IOUs or promises to deliver bitcoin later). This means there’s a lot of trading, but not much real bitcoin changing hands. If everyone tried to take their coins out at once, things could get messy (think Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in 2023). This makes the market seem bigger than it really is. Echoing Schiff’s reply, in point 3, SightBringer means that large holders, known as whales, aren’t selling their old coins on the open market. Instead, they’re selling quietly to new buyers or moving coins to private wallets. This keeps the price from jumping around. In April alone, Glassnode revealed that whales had absorbed more than 300% of the newly mined bitcoin supply, drastically reducing the coins available to everyone else. Big companies and funds don’t like wild price swings. They need stable prices to make sure everything works smoothly. BlackRock and others are even saying bitcoin is less volatile than before, which is good for them, as the asset becomes more credible to investors. SightBringer maintains that the market is being manipulated, with the BTC price being held back on purpose. When it finally breaks out, it could go exponentially higher, and it might not come back down. That’s why the big players are getting ready now, so they’re in the best position when the real move happens. “The real question isn’t “why isn’t it moving?” It’s: Who’s making sure it doesn’t and why?” At the time of press 1:30 pm UTC on Jun. 28, 2025, Bitcoin is ranked #1 by market cap and the price is up 0.11% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has a market capitalization of $2.13 trillion with a 24-hour trading volume of $38.52 billion.

LAST UPDATE | 28 Jun FORMER FIÁNNA FÁIL minister Mary Hanafin has said that she’s “in the mix” for the party’s presidential nomination. “If I could contest it, I would happily do that. It’s a role I would hope people could feel I would do well, both nationally and internationally,” she told The Irish Independent. Sixty-six-year-old Hanafin previously told The Irish Times in April that she was open to the conversation of contesting the presidency – although she said it was ultimately up to Taoiseach and party leader Micheál Martin. She is the first Fianna Fáil party member to announce her intention to contest the nomination. This afternoon, Cynthia Ní Mhurchú was asked on RTÉ’s Saturday with Colm Ó Mongain if she had ruled out a bid for the Fianna Fáil presidential nomination, who replied that she was “extremely happy” in her current role as an MEP. Ní Mhurchú did not wholly rule out the prospect. Fine Gael’s MEP Seán Kelly has all but declared his intention to run, having told The Journal in Brussels earlier this week that the main deterrent is the length of a presidential term. Hanafin was first elected to the Dáil in 1997, serving the Dún Laoghaire constituency. Throughout her three consecutive terms as a TD, she held a number of Cabinet positions, including Minister for Education, Minister for Enterprise, and Minister for Social and Family Affairs, and Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport. Advertisement Hanafin pictured in 2011. Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo In 2011, she was briefly deputy leader of Fianna Fáil, having lost the party’s leadership election to incumbent leader Micheál Martin. Hanafin left office in 2011. In 2014, she served as a councillor on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown county council, representing Blackrock. She remained on the council until 2024. In 2014, Hanafin defied the wishes of Martin for her to refrain from submitting nomination papers to contest the local elections in the Blackrock area. Dubbed the ‘Battle of Blackrock’, Hanafin was ultimately elected on the first count. She drew criticism from former Taoiseach Brian Cowen’s wife Mary Cowen in 2016, when Hanafin was apparently rebuffed by Martin after she announced she intended to join Fianna Fáil’s front bench were she elected to the Dáil. Hanafin subsequently made remarks regarding Martin at the party’s ardfheis – which Mary Cowen derided in a Facebook post. Hanafin is the daughter of Des Hanafin, a businessman and Fianna Fáil councillor who also served as a senator. Her brother John Hanafin was a member of the Seanad from 2002 to 2008.

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has bounced back in recent weeks, surging as serious U.S. dollar collapse fears drive billionaire interest in bitcoin. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, with traders betting a looming Federal Reserve flip will turbo-charge the crypto market. Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump issues a surprise crypto prediction, bitcoin and crypto are braced for a “huge” BlackRock crypto market bombshell that has suddenly appeared on the “horizon.” Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run In-kind redemptions for the bitcoin and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have taken Wall Street by storm over the last 18 months could be coming soon, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Hester Peirce. “I can’t prejudge, but we hear that there’s a lot of interest,” Peirce, who heads up the SEC’s crypto task force, said on stage at a Bitcoin Policy Institute event, adding that in kind bitcoin and crypto ETFs are now “on the horizon.” In-kind redemptions allow investors to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying asset rather than receiving cash, which is currently the case for the spot bitcoin and crypto ETFs approved by the SEC in early 2024—a change described as “huge” by Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In-kind redemptions for bitcoin and crypto funds would make it cheaper and quicker for traders to buy and sell ETF shares, potentially making them more attractive to institutional investors on Wall Street. Earlier this year, BlackRock, which has dominated the spot bitcoin ETF market with its $75 billion IBIT fund, asked the SEC to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for bitcoin ETFs, instead of having to use cash, with the likes of Fidelity and other smaller bitcoin and crypto ETF providers following suit. "Those (forms) are going through the process now," Peirce said. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street’s campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024 that now hold 1.4 million bitcoin worth $152 billion. BlackRock’s fund alone holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth almost $75 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. Meanwhile, the combined bitcoin price and crypto market is on the verge of a “turning point” as it hits $3.4 trillion, according to one analyst. “The $3.4 trillion to 3.55 trillion range is a turning point, which has activated sellers and prevented the market from consolidating higher,” Alex Kuptsikevich, FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments. “Since the end of Wednesday, bitcoin has been testing the $108,000 mark, but it will sell off when it touches this level. Over the past couple of days, we have seen a smooth but steady intraday uptrend, accompanied by heavy buying from medium—and long-term investors. We see this as a sign of buying by professional market participants and link it to strengthening stocks, which increases the likelihood of reaching $110,000 or even $112,000 as early as this week.”
