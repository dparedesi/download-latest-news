Younger players starting out on their professional rugby career are like sponges and eager to learn. Older, or more experienced players, are perhaps more in need of a fresh voice and new ideas. It’s almost hard to credit that Jack O’Donoghue is now 31 and is now in the former category. But, while hardly in the veteran stakes just yet, the Waterford backrower endorses the clear feeling that the Munster squad have embraced Clayton McMillan’s messaging and ideas. “People have been itching to get to work with him,” says O’Donoghue. “When they announced it, I think everyone started tuning into Chiefs games, seeing how they play and getting a flavour for types of players he likes to pick. “From the preseason he set the stall out and there’s been a great mood and a great energy around the place and we’re really excited,” adds O’Donoghue, ahead of Friday’s preseason friendly at Virgin Media Park against Bath (kick-off 7pm). “His mission statement is about holding on to the ball, playing the opportunity that’s in front of you, but not necessarily overplaying. “If the kick is on or if it’s on to get the ball out wide, if that’s the right play, that’s it and you back it and you go with that.” That said, through little fault of their own, it’s a measure of the tumult at Munster that, entering O’Donoghue’s 12th season since breaking the team in 2014, McMillan is the sixth coach he’ll serve under. Munster host Bath in a preseason friendly in Musgrave Park on Friday (kick-off 7pm) and Johann van Graan has enhanced his reputation at the Rec since inheriting a squad at the foot of the Premiership three seasons ago and leading them to their first domestic title in 29 years last May. [ Clayton McMillan expects new leaders to emerge as he puts his stamp on MunsterOpens in new window ] Helpfully, Mike Prendergast, Denis Leamy and Mossy Lawlor have remained in place, but another period of stability akin to van Graan’s five years at Munster would be welcome. “Yeah, a bit of continuity, long-term, looking big picture, that’s something I presume the board, the IRFU are certainly looking at it,” says O’Donoghue. “It’s certainly above the players’ pay grade but that’s something as players you want to see.” McMillan has also brought with him a new Head of Athletic Performance Brad Mayo from New Zealand, as well as Martyn Vercoe as the new team manager, and the new voices have also implemented some modified preseason training which O’Donoghue has described as old school, notably a preseason camp in Rockwell, “back in the dorms and back to Munster Under-20 and Under-18s days”. After “a bit of a clean-up job on my ankle in the off-season” O’Donoghue bulked up in the gym and his enthusiasm for the new campaign was further whetted by the preseason. “We went boxing, hill running, swimming, different varieties of training. We’re not just out on the field constantly, but that just keeps the bit of drive there and stuff like that. “It’s not going to be like, ‘oh, let’s just come back out on the field now to run sprints’. It’s different every day. And that variety certainly was infectious throughout the group. “Some lads hated the swimming, some lads hated the hills, but I think it just kept everyone on their toes. And while some people were really good at the swimming, other people were really good at boxing, there was always one that you found yourself that you could excel on and probably step up in terms of leadership and stuff like that.” McMillan is big into Munster connecting with their people, and there was also a training camp in Ennis, with one in Kerry next week and O’Donoghue’s native Waterford also planned. As someone who has regularly stepped in as captain, O’Donoghue acknowledges there is an onus on him as well as others, to fill the void left by the retirement/departures of Peter O’Mahony, Conor Murray and Stephen Archer. Munster were playing catch-up after losing four of their first six URC matches before the November break last season, only securing a place in the play-offs and this season’s Champions Cup with a last-day win over Benetton. Mindful of this, O’Donoghue says they are looking no further than targeting their initial five-game block before the autumn series this season, namely Scarlets (away), Cardiff (home), Edinburgh (home), Leinster (away) and Connacht (home). However, while he maintains “Europe” has not been discussed, this Friday’s game is a foretaste of Munster’s opening Champions Cup game away to Bath while the ensuing round two game against Gloucester will be at Pairc Ui Chaoimh. “I only went on to purchase a few extra tickets myself and I saw the Blackrock end was sold out and only the two terraces were available. So that’s unbelievable. I think that certainly adds to the excitement that’s going to be building around this season. “And I think the launch of the jersey alone, the talk around that, going back to the ‘06 kind of bit of a twang on it, it’s really nice,” O’Donoghue adds of this season’s new jersey. “The white away jersey, there’s a lot of chat around us at the moment and that’s great, but we have to deliver on the field and that’s all that we’re kind of focusing on.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date What’s making headlines in the rugby world?

Title: Victorian kiosk’s restoration costs in Blackrock reaches €1.1m

The cost of restoring a Victorian kiosk at the main entrance to Blackrock Park in Dublin has been put at €1.1 million by Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council, which said the building will open as a coffee shop in the coming months. The original 2024 tender submitted by the contractor that carried out the work, Bracegrade, was for €690,000, excluding VAT, but a contingency of €150,000 was approved at the same time by the council bringing the overall project cost to some €840,000. In response to a Freedom of Information request, it said an additional €200,000 was sought and approved in January of this year to fund the demolition of an existing but disused public toilet block and construction of a new facility close to the restored tea rooms. Some additional landscaping was also to be carried out. In the end, it said, €1.1 million has been spent to date on the project, which got under way in July of last year and is said to have been completed last month. A tender process was conducted to find a tenant for the tea rooms, which are a short walk from Blackrock village and two substantial shopping centres, and a contract has been provisionally agreed with operator of the Mister Magpie outlets in Ballsbridge and Leeson St. The contracts are currently being completed and the council said the facility will open in the coming months. “We are working closely with the operator to ensure the Tearooms open to the public as soon as possible,” the council said in a statement. [ ‘I can’t believe we’re living here’: Historic Wexford cottage that was at risk of falling into decline is restoredOpens in new window ] The small building, which was a protected structure, was originally built in the 1890s when it operated as a cake and sweet shop. The wider park had been established about 20 years earlier. The kiosk has views over much of it and Dublin Bay. The intention, it is stated, was to “faithfully restore” the building. Internal council documents suggest the tender process was conducted on the cascade basis, under which some potential bidders can be excluded if they are now considered suitable for some of the specialised work involved. The council said the process was “thorough and competitive” and the work carried out included considerable replacement of the building’s fabric, the installation of new windows and landscaping of the surrounding area. A number of grants were received to support the funding of the project including from the Department of Housing, local Government and Heritage’s Historic Structures Fund. Blackrock-based councillor Martha Fanning said that “having been vacant for decades, it’s wonderful to see the refurbishment being completed”. “Restoration works are expensive but the kiosk is a key historic feature of the park which shouldn’t have been allowed get into such a poor state of disrepair.” Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up for push alerts to get the best breaking news, analysis and comment delivered directly to your phone Listen to In The News podcast daily for a deep dive on the stories that matter © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Rumors Of BlackRock Buying XRP Via Coinbase Makes Waves. Is An XRP ETF Filing Coming?
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-xrp-buy-via-coinbase/
Time Published: 2025-09-11T03:00:05Z

The Ripple community is once again caught up in speculation after data showed a steep drop in Coinbase’s XRP holdings. Instead of seeing it as a sell-off, some commentators believe the decline could be linked to BlackRock quietly moving into position through Coinbase Custody. The rumors are persistent, even though BlackRock has already shot down earlier claims about a Spot XRP ETF filing. Nonetheless, this has left many to wonder if there’s more happening behind the scenes than the company is willing to admit. Recent on-chain data revealed that Coinbase’s XRP stash has decreased drastically since the second quarter of 2025. This decrease has seen the amount of coins held by Coinbase fall from 780.13 million to about 199 million, with a 57% fall in August alone. Considering the scale of this decline, the movement has stirred up different rumors. Some investors are of the notion that these are actually intended sell-offs by Coinbase, while others are of the notion that they are only strategic transfers involving institutions. Crypto analyst Crypto X AiMan addressed the situation in a video posted on the social media platform X, where he noted that Coinbase is not dumping the coin, despite claims circulating within the community. According to the analyst, the reduction is more likely linked to BlackRock, and his team had previously highlighted multiple BlackRock-XRP connections. As such, he admonished investors not to interpret the drop in Coinbase’s wallets as bearish but rather as a sign of shifting custody arrangements, possibly connected to the world’s largest asset manager. Comments about BlackRock’s interest in the digital asset are growing louder each day, but it is worth noting that the company has already denied reports of filing for a Spot XRP ETF. A company spokesperson for BlackRock recently clarified that no such product has been filed with the SEC. Nevertheless, the decrease in Coinbase’s wallets coincides with recent developments involving BlackRock’s partnership with Coinbase, which suggests that an official move relating to a Spot XRP ETF could be in the works. Given BlackRock’s embrace of other crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is only a matter of time before the altcoin joins the lineup. Although BlackRock has not confirmed any intentions, the rumors alone have increased interest among many holders, as shown by comments on social media. As many as eight other asset managers have filed for a Spot XRP ETF with the SEC, and many investors are still anticipating that a formal filing might arrive sooner than expected. At the time of writing, the connection between Coinbase’s reduced holdings and BlackRock is speculative, but as the third-largest crypto by market cap, the idea of Spot XRP ETFs hitting the market soon should not be ruled out.

Title: SEC delays decisions on several ETFs tied to staking and altcoins

The decisions postponed BlackRock's Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton's spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed decisions on three crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Sept. 10. The decisions postponed BlackRock’s Ethereum staking proposal alongside Franklin Templeton’s spot XRP and Solana ETF applications. The delays come as the SEC develops a generic listing framework that could streamline future crypto ETF approvals. The postponements position these applications for potential approval during an anticipated October batch decision window, aligning with previous predictions. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted in April that crypto ETFs would likely get a batch of approvals in October, when some of the over 90 filings reach their final deadlines. The SEC has been working with US exchanges on a standardized listing framework for token-based ETFs that would eliminate individual rule-change requests for qualifying assets. The initiative would allow ETF sponsors to bypass the customary Form 19b-4 process when underlying tokens meet predetermined criteria. Under the proposed framework, sponsors would submit registration statements on Form S-1, observe standard 75-day review periods, and list products once the waiting periods have ended. Market capitalization, on-exchange trading volume, and daily liquidity represent key metrics under discussion for qualification thresholds. The current rule-change pathway requires each spot crypto ETF to secure a Commission order before listing, a process designed for novel or complex products.

Eric Balchunas said on Sept. 9 that the “memecoin ETF era [is] about to kick off” with a Dogecoin ETF slated for launch on Sept. 11 under the 40 Act structure. Balchunas said this could potentially become “the first-ever US ETF to hold something that has no utility on purpose,” considering Dogecoin was originally created as a tribute to the Doge meme. A successful Dogecoin ETF launch could catalyze broader approval momentum for pending applications. Seyffart previously shared that there are 92 crypto ETF applications divided across various assets, including Solana, XRP, Litecoin, and staking versions of existing products awaiting SEC decisions. The comprehensive filing list reveals applications from major issuers, including VanEck, Grayscale, Canary, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton, covering assets ranging from established cryptocurrencies to emerging tokens.

Title: Klarna surges 14.6% in NYSE debut as Buy Now Pay Later giant goes public
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/10/klarna-surges-14-6-nyse-debut-buy-now-pay-later-giant-goes-public/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T22:36:35Z

UPDATED 18:36 EDT / SEPTEMBER 10 2025 by Duncan Riley Shares in Klarna Group PLC closed up 14.6% in regular trading today after the Swedish fintech company made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. In its initial public offering, Klarna offered around 34.3 million shares at $40 each, raising about $1.4 billion. The shares opened at $52 each before surging to a high of $57, closing the day at $45.82. Founded in 2005, Klarna offers a “buy now, pay later” service that allows consumers to make online purchases and pay for them in installments, often with no interest over a short period, such as with its “Pay in 4” model. Klarna acts as an intermediary, paying the merchant upfront and then managing consumer payments, effectively removing risk for both parties and simplifying the checkout process. In addition to BNPL offerings, Klarna provides a suite of payment processing services for e-commerce merchants, handling customer payments, managing store claims and disputes. Since obtaining a banking license in Sweden in 2017, the company has also offered broader fintech offerings, including issuing physical and digital cards, providing savings accounts and offering subscription based services. In its IPO filing in March, Klarna said that more than 675,000 merchants have adopted its service to date and that those companies use Klarna to process payments for 93 million customers. The platform’s gross merchandise value, the combined dollar value of the transactions it processes, reached $105 billion last year. Klarna’s revenue rose 24% year-over-year, to $2.81 billion in 2024, and the company generated $21 million in net income. As reported by Bloomberg, the company’s closing price gives Klarna a market value of more than $17 billion, based on outstanding shares, a not unreasonable figure but notably down from a valuation of $45.6 billion the company reached on paper in a $639 million round in June 2021 during the COVID-19 online shopping boom. A subsequent private funding round of $800 million in 2022 saw Klarna’s valuation drop to $6.7 billion. Coming into its IPO, Klarna had raised $4.19 billion over 20 rounds, according to data from Tracxn. Investors in the company included Sequoia Capital Operations, Silver Lake Management, Adit Ventures, WestCap Management, Founders Fund Management, SoftBank Vision Fund LP, Dragoneer Investing Group, Technology Crossover Ventures LP, Macy’s Inc., BlackRock Inc., Visa Inc. and Ant Group Co. Ltd. Klarna’s successful IPO follows a recent run of strong tech-related IPOs, including Figma Inc. in July and Firefly Aerospace Inc. in August. The positive results have also seen more companies line up to go public after a near drought in IPOs over the COVID period amid market uncertainty. Earlier this week, Netskope Inc. and StubHub Inc. disclosed that they had filed for IPOs, while Infleqtion Inc. and CoinShares International Ltd. are opting to go public via mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies.

The SEC extended its deadline for addressing a rule change request by the Nasdaq exchange for staking in the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) to October 30, a 45-day postponement from its original schedule. It also pushed back its decision on 19b-4 rule change filings by Cboe that would allow the listing of the Franklin Templeton Solana ETF and Franklin Templeton XRP ETF to November 14, a 60-day deferral. The latest filings follow a slew of SEC delays in recent weeks on proposals for altcoin funds. On Tuesday, the regulator put off ruling on Nasdaq’s bid to list the Grayscale Hedera Trust to November 12, also 60 days. Last month, the SEC also held up resolving a request to add staking to the the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, which tracks the price of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. At that time, it also moved back its decision on an application by Donald Trump's media and technology company by 45 days to Oct. 8 for a Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF that would track the two largest cryptocurrencies by market value. And it announced identical delays for applications filed for spot XRP funds by Grayscale, CoinShares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, and 21Shares, a spot Dogecoin ETF from Grayscale, and a spot Litecoin product from CoinShares. The dates for potential approvals of those funds vary. Those announcements followed delayed decisions on Solana ETFs from Bitwise, 21Shares, and VanEck, and a Dogecoin fund from 21Shares. Before August ended, the SEC was weighing 90 crypto ETF applications, which spanned a range of assets. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas told Decrypt that the latest delays were consistent with the regulator's recent approach, likely timing approvals of proposed altcoin ETFs and Ethereum staking after likely green-lighting proposals filed in July by Cboe and NYSE. Those exchanges asked the SEC to approve amendments that could significantly shorten the approval process for future crypto exchange-traded funds, automatically listing certain products without requiring case-by-case filings. In separate filings, the exchanges requested changes to their listing standards that would allow certain crypto ETFs to be listed without enduring the SEC's rigorous evaluation, a process that requires exchanges to submit proposed rule changes. Under current guidelines, reviews of proposed changes to funds could take 240 days. "They've been punting and punting [...] and we expect them to keep putting everything off until the generic listing standards are done," Balchunas said. "That is what we think will happen, probably in early October. After that, we expect a flood of ETFs probably in a couple months." He added: "We expect ETH staking to be part of it. This SEC showed every sign of being interested in working with the issuers and solving problems." Bloomberg analysts have predicted a more than 95% probability of Solana and XRP ETFs receiving approval this year. Balchunas described the odds on staking as "pretty high," as well. "We think they'll allow that, too," he said.

Title: 20-year-old fintech Klarna finally went public. Here's who's getting rich.

Two decades after its founding, Klarna has gone public, and its investors are finally seeing a windfall. The Swedish "buy now, pay later" company listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Its stock popped 30% on its debut, jumping above its $40-per-share IPO price to $52 a share. That IPO price gave Klarna a $15.1 billion valuation and netted Klarna $1.37 billion. Per Pitchbook, Klarna had raised $3.85 billion in its history before the public listing. Klarna's IPO has been a long time coming. Founded in 2005, the consumer payments company first hinted at an IPO in 2019, telling Bloomberg it could go public in the next one to two years. Klarna had reportedly planned to go public earlier this year, but delayed its IPO efforts after Trump's Liberation Day tariffs roiled the markets. It's the first major IPO of the fall and is expected to be one of many companies to take the public market plunge before the end of the year. Gemini Space Station, a crypto exchange backed by the billionaire Winklevoss twins, is expected to go public later this week, and 25-year-old ticket marketplace StubHub launched its IPO roadshow Monday. Klarna's IPO price represents a major markdown from its peak valuation, however. The company raised $639 million in 2021 at a $45.6 billion valuation, but slashed its valuation a stunning 85% to $6.7 billion the next year as the fintech sector stumbled on rising interest rates and worsening investor sentiment. Klarna chairperson and former Sequoia Capital Michael Moritz criticized the company's other investors at the time. "The shift in Klarna's valuation is entirely due to investors suddenly voting in the opposite manner to the way they voted for the past few years. The irony is that Klarna's business, its position in various markets, and its popularity with consumers and merchants are all stronger than at any time since Sequoia first invested in 2010," Moritz said in a press release about the round. "Eventually, after investors emerge from their bunkers, the stocks of Klarna and other first-rate companies will receive the attention they deserve." Klarna debuts on the US market facing a number of headwinds, including regulatory risks and widening losses as the company sets aside more capital to cover potential losses if its customers don't pay back their loans. It's been making changes to its operations, too. Klarna will require many of its previously remote employees to return to the office three days a week beginning at the end of September, in part due to Klarna losing talent to firms that prioritize in-person working, Business Insider reported last week. Klarna is also redirecting multiple employees to customer support positions after previously restructuring the business to prioritize AI chatbots handling its customer service. Klarna declined to comment for this story. We used Klarna's share price at Wednesday's market close, $45.82, to determine the value of its major shareholders' stakes after the listing. We're including the 15 shareholders with the largest stakes after Klarna's IPO. Venture firm IVP, Ant Group, and Harvest Growth Capital, other investors in Klarna listed in its IPO filing, were among the top 15 shareholders prior to Klarna's IPO, but sold enough shares in the listing to fall in the rankings. Our calculations included any extra shares that shareholders offered to meet higher investor demand. Now that Klarna is public, here's what those top 15 shareholders' stakes are worth. Venture capital giant Sequoia Capital is the biggest benefactor of Klarna's IPO. The San Francisco-based firm Sequoia owned 78.8 million shares, or about 20.1% of the company, after its IPO. Sequoia first invested in Klarna in 2010, leading the company's $9 million fundraise and contributing additional capital over numerous rounds in the following years. Former Sequoia partner Michael Moritz joined Klarna's board of directors at the firm's 2010 investment and became the chairperson of the board in 2020. When Moritz stepped down from his investing position in 2023, Sequoia partner Matthew Morris joined Klarna's board to represent the firm. The following year, Morris, with Sequoia's backing, reportedly attempted to remove Moritz from the board altogether. After facing pushback from Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Morris withdrew the attempt and stepped down from the board. Sequoia partner Andrew Reed took his place. Moritz remains Klarna's chairperson today. "It's amazing what an iron-willed CEO like [Sebastian Siemiatkowski], an enduring value prop, a team of true believers, and 20 years of steady (ish?) compounding can create," Reed posted on X Wednesday morning. Sequoia bought an additional 7.33 million shares in Klarna between July 2022 and March 2023 for $135 million, according to Klarna's IPO filing. Sequoia sold 2.14 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at its $40-per-share IPO price netted the firm $85.6 million. At a $45.82 closing share price, Sequoia's remaining stake is worth about $3.5 billion. Klarna cofounder Victor Jacobsson owned about 30 million shares of Klarna, or 8% of the company after its IPO. Jacobsson founded Klarna in 2005 alongside Sebastian Siemiatkowski and Niklas Adalberth. He served as the company's CFO until 2012, when he left. Jacobsson and Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and the only cofounder who remains an executive at the company, have reportedly clashed in private for years over key governance decisions at Klarna, like how and when the company should go public. Jacobsson has amassed a large stake in Klarna over the years, including by buying up shares in secondary markets through various holding companies, the Financial Times previously reported. Between July 2022 and March 2023, Jacobsson bought nearly 4 million shares of Klarna for a total of $73 million across four different holding companies, per Klarna's IPO filing. Jacobsson sold about 1.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at a $40-per-share IPO price would've netted him about $52.1 million. At a $45.82 share price, Jacobsson's remaining stake is worth about $1.38 billion. Heartland A/S, the investment holding company owned by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, owned about 37.1 million shares of Klarna, or about 7.8% of the company after its IPO. Heartland first invested in Klarna in 2017 via Brightfolk A/S, another of Holch Povlsen's holding companies. That investment included shares bought from existing Klarna investors such as private equity firm General Atlantic and cofounder Niklas Adalberth. Heartland CEO Lise Kaae sits on Klara's board of directors. The firm sold about 7.4 million shares in Klarna's IPO, or about 20% of its stake. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale brought in about $297 million. At a $45.82 share price, Heartland's remaining stake is worth about $1.36 billion. Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna's CEO and cofounder, owned 25.6 million shares of Klarna, or about 6.8% after its IPO. Siemiatkowski began building Klarna alongside his cofounders at age 23, while he was getting his master's degree at the Stockholm School of Economics. The company, initially named Kreditor and rebranded to Klarna in 2010, sought to allow customers to pay for their purchases after delivery. Siemiatkowski was estimated to be a billionaire in early 2022, with his net worth peaking at roughly $3.2 billion after Klarna raised a funding round the previous year at a $45.6 billion valuation. The company's fundraise in July 2022, however, valued Klarna at $6.7 billion, knocking Siemiatkowski off the billionaire pedestal. Klarna paid $16.5 million to nonprofits founded by Siemiatkowski's wife, including through donations and partnerships, over the last five years, BI reported last week. Siemiatkowski purchased an additional 3.06 million shares of Klarna for $56 million between July 2022 and March 2023. He's the only major shareholder on this list who didn't sell any of his shares in Klarna's IPO. At a $45.82 price, his stake is now worth about $1.17 billion. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia owned about 19.3 million shares of Klarna, or about 4.6% of the company after its IPO. CBA, the largest bank in Australia by total assets, first invested $100 million in Klarna in 2019. It's also backed Anthropic, announcing an investment in the AI startup giant in March. CBA invested an additional $200 million in Klarna in 2020, bringing its stake to 5.5%. As part of its investments in Klarna, CBA received 50-50 ownership rights with Klarna to Klarna's Australian and New Zealand business. CBA bought an additional 1.8 million shares in Klarna between July 2022 and March 2023, according to Klarna's IPO filing, for an aggregate price of $32 million. CBA sold about 1.9 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at the $40-per-share IPO price would've brought in $77.4 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $798 million. Private equity firm Silver Lake owned 17 million shares of Klarna, or about 3.8% of the company after its IPO. The Silicon Valley-based firm's other tech bets include fintech darling Stripe, business-management software company Airtable, and weight-care app Noom. Silver Lake led Klarna's $650 million fundraise in 2020, which valued the company at $10.6 billion. The firm sold about 2.6 million shares in Klarna's IPO, netting it $102 million at a $40 IPO share price. At $45.82 a share, Silver Lake's remaining stake is worth about $663 million. Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC Private Limited owned about 6.3 million shares of Klarna, or about 1.4% after its IPO. The fund manages Singapore's foreign reserves in more than 40 countries. It's also invested in Anthropic, contributing to its September $13 billion Series F fundraise at an $183 billion valuation. GIC invested in Klarna's $650 million round in 2020 at a $10.6 billion valuation. The fund sold about 1.2 million shares in Klarna's IPO, netting it $46.9 million at a $40 IPO share price. At a $45.82 share price, GIC's remaining stake is worth about $236 million. San Francisco-based investment firm HMI Capital owned about 5.6 million shares in Klarna, or about 1.2% of the company after its IPO. HMI Capital manages about $3.22 billion in assets, primarily making investments in public companies including Roblox, Flutter Entertainment, and SailPoint. The firm first invested in Klarna in 2019, contributing to its $460 million fundraise. HMI Capital put more money into the company in its 2020, 2021, and 2022 raises. "From the outset, we believed that their vision of buy-now-pay-later offers a cheaper, friendlier alternative to credit cards. Klarna has proven that by welcoming over 110 million active consumers to its platform," said Justin Nyweide, founding partner and CIO of HMI Capital, in a statement to BI. "We particularly want to congratulate CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Chairperson Michael Moritz and CFO Niclas Neglén for successfully bringing Klarna to market in a turbulent time. We are proud to partner with them and can't wait for Klarna to tackle the immense growth opportunity in front of them." HMI Capital sold 1.1 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which at a $40-per-share IPO price would've brought in $44.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $204 million. BlackRock owned nearly 6 million shares of Klarna, or about 1.1% of the company after its IPO. BlackRock has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in Big Tech giants including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. It's also backed AI data processing startup Databricks, which announced a $1 billion fundraise this week at a $100 billion valuation. The firm first invested in Klarna in 2019, contributing to its $460 million fundraise, and putting more capital into the company in its 2020 and 2021 raises. BlackRock sold about 1.7 million shares in Klarna's IPO. At a $40 IPO share price, that sale would've netted the firm $68.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, BlackRock's remaining stake is worth about $194 million. UBS O'Connor owned about 4.5 million shares in Klarna, or about .9% of the company after its IPO. UBS O'Connor is an alternative investment unit within UBS Asset Management. Per Klarna's IPO filing, its Klarna investment is held in the Nineteen77 funds that UBS manages. It's not clear when UBS O'Connor first invested in Klarna. The fund did participate in Klarna's $800 million Series H fundraise in 2022, per UBS. In May, UBS said it would sell its O'Connor unit, which had roughly $11 billion under management at the time, to Cantor Fitzgerald. That acquisition hasn't yet closed. UBS and Cantor Fitzgerald declined to confirm whether O'Connor's stake in Klarna will be assumed by Cantor Fitzgerald when the deal closes. UBS O'Connor sold about 1.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, which, at a $40-per-share price, would have brought in about $52.3 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth about $148 million. Sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Company owned about 5.4 million shares of Klarna, or about .8% of the company after its IPO. Mubadala invests in companies in the United Arab Emirates and abroad on behalf of the government of Abu Dhabi. It's backed a number of top private companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, and healthcare IPO hopeful Zelis Healthcare. Mubadala invested in Klarna in 2022 as part of the company's $800 million fundraise. Mubadala sold 2.3 million shares in Klarna's IPO, representing about 43% of its holdings. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale would net the firm about $93.8 million. At a $45.82 share price, its remaining stake is worth $141 million. Skandia owned about 4.1 million shares of Klarna, or about .8% of the company after its IPO. The Swedish insurance and financial services company first invested in Klarna in 2015, when it bought a roughly 1% stake. Skandia sold about 1.2 million shares in Klarna's IPO, representing nearly 30% of its stake in the company. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale netted Skandia about $47.7 million. At Klarna's $45.82 closing share price, Skandia's remaining stake is worth about $135 million. Niklas Adalberth, Klarna's third cofounder, owned about 2.9 million shares of Klarna, or about .7% of the company after its IPO. That's the sum of shares held by Adalberth himself and by Sunnersta Invest AB, Adalberth's private investment company. Adalberth used to own about 8% of Klarna. But after Adalberth stepped down as Klarna's deputy CEO and left the company in 2015, he sold all but .75% of his stake to fund his philanthropy and impact investing. Adalberth told BI in 2021 that he left Klarna after reevaluating his priorities, including his feelings toward wealth and consumption. Adalberth sold about 273,000 shares in Klarna's IPO, netting him about $11.7 million at a $40 share price. At $45.82 a share, Adalberth's remaining stake is worth $121 million. London-based venture firm Atomico owned about 3.6 million shares of Klarna, or nearly .7% of the company after its IPO. Started in 2006 by Skype cofounder Niklas Zennström, Atomico has backed some VC heavy-hitters, including fintech giant Stripe and physical therapy company Hinge Health, which went public earlier this year. Atomico first invested in Klarna in 2012, buying shares from an existing investor in a secondary sale worth $14 million. "Over 13 years of partnership with Sebastian and his team, we've seen economic downturns, market turbulence, and inflationary pressures, yet Klarna's business model has always proven remarkably resilient," Zennström said in a statement to BI. "That ability to scale faster while running leaner is unparalleled, and it's a model more companies and founders across Europe will seek to emulate." Atomico sold just over a million shares of Klarna in its IPO. At a $40-per-share IPO price, that sale netted Atomico $41.5 million. At a $45.82 share price, Atomico's remaining stake is worth about $118 million. SEB, short for Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, is a Stockholm-based bank. SEB owned about 2.4 million shares of Klarna, or roughly .6% of the company after its IPO. SEB began working with Klarna in 2012, when Klarna partnered with SEB on its Klarna Checkout platform for merchants. (Klarna sold Klarna Checkout in 2024.) SEB's pension funds also contributed tens of millions of dollars to Norrsken VC, Adalberth's impact fund, in 2020 and 2021. SEB told BI that its stake in Klarna, as listed in the company's IPO filing, is "kept in custody on behalf of clients." The bank declined to comment further. SEB sold about 23,000 shares in Klarna's IPO, which at the $40-per-share IPO price would net the firm about $937,000. At a $45.82 closing share price, SEB's remaining share is worth about $110 million. Jump to

Title: SOL Strategies CEO discusses Solana treasury companies’ role in driving institutional blockchain adoption

Leah Wald emphasized that treasury companies must operate respectfully to maintain industry credibility while benefiting from expanding product availability. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald outlined how Solana-focused digital asset treasury companies can drive institutional adoption and exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. In an interview with CryptoSlate, Wald noted that multiple Solana treasury companies create a “rising tide” effect similar to Bitcoin miners benefiting alongside Bitcoin ETF inflows. She noted the parallel between Bitcoin ecosystem dynamics, where miners receive inflows alongside spot and futures ETFs, suggesting similar potential for Solana-focused companies. Wald explained: “You’ve always seen that in the past where miners get inflows, like Bitcoin miners. ETF gets inflows alongside Bitcoin spot and Bitcoin futures ETFs get inflows.” She described the phenomenon as retail investors choosing different products based on enthusiasm, while institutions prefer ETFs for tax advantages and custody structures. Wald acknowledged widespread market expectations for a spot or staked spot Solana ETF under a 33 Act wrapper, viewing this development as part of a broader rising tide of product offerings. She emphasized that treasury companies must operate respectfully to maintain industry credibility while benefiting from expanding product availability. Bloomberg ETF analysts expect an approval in October, when most of the spot Solana ETF filings will meet their final deadline with the SEC. Addressing concerns about digital asset treasury (DAT) company valuations, Wald acknowledged that many firms that added Bitcoin now trade at discounts to multiple of Bitcoin NAV (mNAV), including Bitcoin miners. A Sept. 2 report by Grayscale highlighted a decreasing mNAV for DAT companies, suggesting a cooling of interest from investors. However, she expressed confidence that SOL Strategies’ dual approach as both a technology company and treasury accumulator provides competitive advantages during market downturns. Wald stated: “It does not scare us. I think it positions us in a position of strength because we’re the only ones running a real business and it’s a business that continues to accumulate and compound.” She noted that discount trading environments place pressure on management teams to execute validator business models effectively rather than relying solely on asset appreciation.

Stay connected via SOL Strategies differentiates itself by calling the company “DAT plus plus,” emphasizing technology development alongside treasury accumulation. Wald described the firm as a technology company first, with treasury accumulation as a secondary function, contrasting with purely speculative treasury models. SOL Strategies added SOL to its treasury and started trading on Nasdaq on Sept. 9 under the ticker STKE. Despite being the second-largest decentralized ecosystem, with over $12 billion in total value locked, Solana still represents a small fraction of the tokenization landscape. Institutions deployed nearly $500 million using Solana’s infrastructure, representing 3.1% of this market. In comparison, Ethereum has a 52% dominance over tokenization efforts. Wald sees institutional treasury companies as catalysts for closing this gap through education and validation efforts. She explained: “I do think that any ETF, like any well-respected issuer or well-respected company, anyone that puts boots on the ground on education is only going to help Solana, the network, grow and succeed.” She emphasized validation and adoption benefits from proper educational initiatives about Solana’s technical advantages. Wald stressed the significant institutional interest, including BlackRock’s plans to launch a yield fund on Solana alongside existing tokenized products from Apollo and Franklin Templeton. She listed these developments as evidence of growing institutional recognition of Solana’s capabilities for tokenization and digital asset infrastructure. Wald concluded by positioning treasury companies as educational ambassadors for Solana’s institutional adoption journey: “It’s on all of us out there to educate why we think that it’s better, cheaper, faster, quicker, all those different merits to get there. Hopefully, with all the DAT leaders out there providing education, it should snowball.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

It's a drama that kicked off last week and has now reached a fevered pitch as some of the biggest crypto companies around compete for the highly sought-after USDH ticker—culminating in an on-chain vote by Hyperliquid stakeholders on Sunday. Major companies like Paxos, Sky, and Frax Finance have thrown their hats in the ring alongside Ethena, with backing from a BlackRock executive. And yet, it appears a new and relatively unknown team in Native Markets is the current frontrunner. Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange, specializing in perpetual futures trading, that lives on its own dedicated layer-1 network by the same. At the time of writing, there’s roughly $5.84 billion in stablecoins on the network—the fifth largest total of all blockchains, per DefiLlama—with USDC accounting for 94.9% of the network’s stablecoins. Over the past 24 hours, it has been responsible for a whopping $1.076 billion in trading volume and has cemented itself as a crucial component in the on-chain economy. With its own stablecoin, Hyperliquid intends to circumvent the biggest players in the space, such as Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT, and secure for itself the lucrative yields these stablecoins generate. While no “special privileges” will be granted to the token, per the Hyperliquid Foundation, crypto heavyweights are now vying for the chance to control the USDH ticker. The Foundation has said the eventual stablecoin must be “Hyperliquid-first” and “Hyperliquid-aligned,” with many proposals creating frameworks that feed revenue back into the ecosystem in some way. Whoever eventually launches the USDH stablecoin would likely benefit immensely from the growing Hyperliquid community embracing the token as the stablecoin of the network. Hyperliquid validators, those responsible for securing the network, should state their voting intention by early Sunday, giving time for users to stake to a validator that matches their vote, before the winner of the USDH competition is formally decided that same day. Here are the issuers in contention to launch Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin: Founded specifically to “build the best stablecoin” for Hyperliquid, according to its Substack, Native Markets started work “months ago” and informed Hyperliquid Labs of its plans, inquiring about the USDH ticker. It proposes to create a stablecoin that will be GENIUS Act-compliant, referring to the landmark stablecoin legislation in the U.S. that President Donald Trump recently signed into law. It plans for Bridge—a platform acquired by payments giant Stripe in 2024—to manage its reserves. Native Markets says it will contribute half of the yield generated from those reserves towards USDH growth partnerships and the other half to the Assistance Fund, a protocol-driven buy back fund. “We are prepared to launch a community-aligned stablecoin within days,” Native Markets wrote on Substack on Monday. Already, a top Hyperliquid validator called CMI has stepped forward and shown support for the proposal. At the moment, market sentiment is placing Native Markets as the overwhelming favorite to win the bidding for the USDH ticker, though several leading figures in the crypto industry have come forward to suggest the organization has received an unfair advantage. Hyperliquid currently loses >$200m a year to firms who treat it as an afterthought at best. I'm co-founding Native Markets to reclaim this value leakage for the ecosystem and to kickstart Hyperliquid's next chapter. pic.twitter.com/oU6RYXE4E9 — max.hl (@fiege_max) September 8, 2025 Ethena notably entered the race on Tuesday, with backing from the biggest asset manager in the world, BlackRock. Ethena is the issuer of the third-largest stablecoin by market cap, USDE, per CoinGecko, behind only industry giants Tether and Circle. The proposal suggests that Ethena’s USDtb, which is the seventh-largest stablecoin, would back USDH, giving it indirect collateralization from BlackRock’s BUIDL fund—a tokenized money market fund. BlackRock’s head of digital assets, Robert Mitchnick, also provided a statement claiming the token would be “uniquely positioned to offer institutional-grade cash management.” On top of this, Ethena says 95% of revenue generated by its USDH reserves will be given to the Assistance Fund or used to purchase HYPE, the native token of the Hyperliquid network. It also suggests that Ethena would cover all transaction costs associated with making USDH the premier stablecoin for Hyperliquid—for example, the costs involved in denominating trading pairs on Hyperliquid in USDH instead of USDC. Established stablecoin company Paxos—issuer of PAX Gold, Global Dollar, and more—is also very much in the mix. Paxos’ proposal not only claims its token would be GENIUS-compliant but also adhere to global regulations, including Europe’s MiCA. It also proposes fiat onramps via SWIFT, ACH, and wire transfers, as well as plans to enable real-world payments for USDH. Plus, it would look to support Hyperliquid’s token on Paxos’ brokerage platform, which is used by PayPal, Venmo, and more. Finally, 95% of interest, not revenue, from the reserves backing USDH will be used to purchase HYPE and redistribute it to applications and validators. We've spent the last three days listening to the @HyperliquidX community, absorbed every concern and doubled down. V2 of our proposal is simple: @Paxos unlocks Hyperliquid at global scale 🌏 — bhau (@bhau___) September 10, 2025 Ethereum DeFi giant Sky, formerly known as MakerDAO, entered the USDH race on Monday. Sky is the issuer of the fourth-largest stablecoin by market cap, USDS, formerly known as DAI—which remains the largest decentralized stablecoin on the market. Sky’s proposal differs from the pack, suggesting USDH be natively multichain (that is, available on various blockchain networks simultaneously), powered by LayerZero, and flexes its security track record and risk management. Sky also says it will deploy part of its balance sheet into Hyperliquid, start buying HYPE with its profits, and grant a 4.85% return on USDH to the Hyperliquid community. USDH powered by Sky. • 4.85% rewards on all USDH on Hyperliquid• 2.2B USDC in instant redemption liquidity• $8B+ Sky balance sheet ready to deploy• Backed by Sky’s 7-year track record Read the proposal by @RuneKek ↓ https://t.co/WYkbHG9Bbc — Sky (@SkyEcosystem) September 8, 2025 Agora, issuers of AUSD, the 29th largest stablecoin by market cap, have directly called out Native Market’s reliance on Stripe, pointing to “clear conflicts” as Stripe builds out its own Tempo layer-1 network—suggesting that Stripe would rather push users onto Tempo than Hyperliquid. Agora proposes to take full control of the stablecoin issuance itself, boasting VanEck as its asset manager. It says it will share 100% of net revenue with the Assistance Fund or buy back HYPE, and like the rest, promises to be GENIUS-compliant. “We strongly urge caution against the utilization of Stripe (Bridge) as an issuer,” Nick van Eck, co-founder of Agora, wrote. “Running an institutional-grade, liquid stablecoin, at global scale is hard. We strongly urge the community to choose experienced partners that are set up for the long-term success of this initiative.” Proposal: Agora stablecoin infrastructure to power USDH with a coalition of best-in-class providers. IntroductionIf Hyperliquid relinquishes their canonical stablecoin to Stripe, a vertically integrated issuer with clear conflicts, what are we all even doing? Summary-… — Nick van Eck (@Nick_van_Eck) September 7, 2025 A mysterious proposal by Frax Finance suggests a “Frax-led alliance with a federally regulated U.S. bank issuer” to issue USDH. However, due to the short window and the legal implications, the proposal is unable to disclose the issuer’s name. That said, the proposal says that USDH will be backed one-for-one with U.S. treasuries via tokenized funds, will be GENIUS-compliant, and with the entire treasury yield returned to Hyperliquid in some way. There are many more proposals in the USDH hunt from lesser-known entities. One, for example, suggests that the USDH ticker should be burned to foster a true free-market environment. Another, very obviously a joke, is written by someone pretending to be the Hyperliquid co-founder and CEO, Jeff Yan, intentionally misspelling words in the Boden meme style and stating that “chart make zig-zag.” The other, more serious proposals include one from OpenEden, which will cycle 100% of its fees into buying HYPE and distributing it to network validators. To many, USDH mania has been the most exciting that on-chain governance has been in a long time. It all builds up to Sunday’s main event when Hyperliquid validators make their final votes.

Title: Klarna’s IPO pops, raising $1.4B, with Sequoia as the biggest winner

But on Wednesday, the company successfully landed on the New York Stock Exchange, having raised $1.4 billion, largely for its existing investors, rather than itself. The fintech giant sold shares at $40, above its announced range of $35 to $37, and came out of the gate with a $15 billion valuation. Shares popped, opening at $52, though quickly settling down to around $46 mid-day. Of the 34.3 million shares Klarna sold, only 5 million were sold by the company, it said. The rest were sold by existing investors like the company’s largest shareholder Sequoia Capital. Entities controlled by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, Silver Lake, BlackRock, and many others sold as well. Despite cashing out some shares, all of them are holding onto the majority of their stakes. Figma’s IPO did a similar thing. Yet, often these existing investors don’t want to sell at the IPO price, a VC told TechCrunch. They kick in shares to help the company meet IPO demand. Floating more shares helps the company obtain a more accurate, and perhaps higher, valuation out of the gate because it helps the IPO attract the biggest institutional investors who wouldn’t bother with an IPO for a small allocation. In Klarna’s case co-founder CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski did not sell any shares. His stake was worth $1.02 billion at the IPO selling price of $40 and he controls about 7.5% of the company. Victor Jacobsson, the co-founder who left the company in 2012, did sell but was, and still is, a slightly larger shareholder. He cashed out of 1.1 million shares and still retains over 8% of the company. Co-founder Niklas Adalberth still owns just under 3 million shares, Klarna disclosed. Sequoia is by far the biggest investor in Klarna, controlling nearly 23% of the company. Famed VC Michael Moritz wrote Klarna’s first check on Sequoia’s behalf in 2010, and stayed on as Klarna’s chairperson even after he left Sequoia in 2023. Some drama ensued when Sequoia added another member to Klarna’s board. But it eventually sorted itself out when Sequoia’s Andrew Reed joined its board in 2024.“This moment feels surreal,” Siemiatkowski shared in published remarks. “When we started Klarna back in 2005, it was just a wild idea — me, Niklas, and Victor, fumbling around, trying to make shopping and payments smoother for people. We got rejected left and right, laughed at more times than I can count. But we kept going.”He continued, “Going public in New York is huge. It’s not just a milestone; it’s a statement. It’s proof that a bunch of stubborn dreamers from Stockholm can take on the world — and win.” Interestingly, though, $1.4 billion is not the record for the biggest IPO of 2025. That’s still held by CoreWeave, which raised $1.5 billion in June. Correction: This story originally misidentified the nationality of Anders Holch Povlsen. That information has been updated.

Title: Arkham Unveils Crypto Rich List — The Titans Behind $1.6 Trillion
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/arkham-top-100-richest-entities-crypto/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T19:00:33Z
Full Content:
Arkham Intelligence has published a ranked list of the 100 richest crypto entities, aggregating on-chain holdings across known address clusters and valuing them in US dollars. According to Arkham, the combined assets of the top 100 exceed “over $1.6 trillion,” underscoring the scale of capital concentrated in a relatively small set of exchanges, custodians, protocols, corporates and notable individuals. The research note was shared via X on September 9, 2025, with valuations explicitly “correct as of 2nd September 2025.” Arkham emphasizes that it ranks entities, not single wallets. In its words, “An entity represents a collection of crypto addresses confirmed to be controlled by the same individual or institution,” a grouping it argues “offers a far more accurate picture of the true net worth of these crypto whales.” Each roster entry links to the corresponding Arkham Intel page where underlying addresses and asset mixes can be examined. The top tier is dominated by centralized exchanges and large institutional platforms. Binance leads with $209.19 billion, followed by Coinbase at $155.81 billion. The third slot is Arkham’s Satoshi Nakamoto entity at $125.07 billion, reflecting the well-known early-mined BTC cluster Arkham tracks. BlackRock ranks fourth with $100.77 billion, then Lido at $69.86 billion and MicroStrategy at $53.21 billion. Fidelity Custody appears seventh at $47.46 billion, ahead of Grayscale at $34.10 billion, while Korean exchange Upbit holds $32.80 billion and DeFi protocol Aave rounds out the top ten with $31.57 billion. Beyond the top ten, the list illustrates how varied the largest balance-holders have become. Major trading venues and market infrastructure providers such as OKX, Kraken, Bitfinex, and Bybit sit alongside L2s and DeFi treasuries including Arbitrum, Uniswap, Spark, Curve and Maker’s Sky. Government-linked clusters appear as well—the “US Government” sits at rank #20 with $23.42 billion and the “UK Government” at $6.99 billion—reflecting seized or controlled assets identified on-chain. There are also long-tail categories like wrapped assets (e.g., WBTC), staking and restaking protocols (Lido, EigenLayer, Ether.fi), and even high-profile memecoin or launchpad ecosystems such as “Official Trump Meme” and “pump.fun,” each with multibillion-dollar tallies. Notably, Arkham’s framing makes clear this is a live market snapshot rather than a static “rich list.” The methodology multiplies the assets held across an entity’s tagged addresses by market prices on the specified date—September 2, 2025—so rankings can and will shift with price, inflows/outflows, and new address attributions. Arkham also spotlights the scale at the top of the distribution, summarizing on X that “the top 100 entities on Arkham hold a total of over $1.6 trillion in assets,” a figure that contextualizes the influence such entities may exert on liquidity and market structure.

Title: The Protocol: SwissBorg’s SOL Earn Wallet Exploited for $41.5M

This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. I’m Margaux Nijkerk, a reporter at CoinDesk. In this issue: SWISSBORG’S SOL EARN WALLET EXPLOITED: Crypto exchange SwissBorg said about 192,600 SOL ($41.5 million) was stolen from an external wallet used exclusively for its SOL Earn strategy. The exploit stemmed from a partner's compromised application programming interface (API), a mechanism that allows software systems to communicate with one another, affecting a single counterparty, the exchange said in a post on X. It was not a hack of the SwissBorg platform. The loss affected fewer than 1% of users and represented about 2% of SwissBorg’s total assets, the firm said. All other funds and strategies remain secure, and user balances within the SwissBorg app are unaffected. SOL Earn redemptions are paused while recovery efforts proceed. SwissBorg says it will cover any shortfall, ensuring no user losses. The company is working with white-hat hackers, security firms and law enforcement to recover the funds. A full incident report will follow once investigations conclude. This exploit arrives amid a sharp rise in crypto thefts, with over $2.17 billion already stolen in 2025. — Shaurya Malwa Read more. LEDGER CTO WARNS OF PNM ATTACK: Charles Guillemet, the chief technology officer at hardware wallet maker Ledger, warned on X that a large-scale supply chain attack was underway after a reputable developer’s Node Package Manager (NPM) account was compromised. According to Guillemet, the malicious code — already pushed into packages with over 1 billion downloads — is designed to silently swap crypto wallet addresses in transactions. That means unsuspecting users could send funds directly to the attacker without realizing it. Guillemet did not name the developer whose account he said was compromised. The incident underscores how deeply interconnected open-source software is and why security lapses in developer tools can ripple into the crypto economy almost instantly. A day later, Guillemet shared that almost zero crypto users had been affected by the hack. “NPM is a tool commonly used in software development using JavaScript, which makes integrating packages easy for developers,” said Guillemet in a message to CoinDesk. When an attacker compromises a developer’s account, they can slip malicious code into widely used packages. “The malicious code attempts to drain users by swapping addresses used in transaction or general on-chain activity and replacing them with the hacker’s address,” Guillemet added. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. BACKPACK EU GOES LIVE FOLLOWING FTX EU ACQUISITION: Backpack Exchange, a global cryptocurrency trading platform, said its European division, Backpack EU, is officially live. Operating out of Cyprus and licensed under the European Union’s MiFID II framework, the exchange is positioning itself as one of the first fully regulated venues in Europe to offer crypto derivatives, starting with perpetual futures. “As far as I'm aware, it's just going to be us and Kraken” in Europe offering perpetual futures, Armani Ferrante, the CEO of Backpack, said in an interview with CoinDesk. The debut follows Backpack’s acquisition of FTX EU earlier this year. In January, the FTX bankruptcy estate said the sale of FTX EU to Backpack was not authorized. Since then, the issue has been resolved and in April the exchange began distributing funds to former FTX EU customers, fulfilling their pledge to compensate users affected by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. Backpack EU will provide users access to over 40 trading pairs with up to 10x leverage, the team said in a statement. The platform says it aims to give both retail and institutional traders a compliant gateway to advanced crypto trading products. The rollout also highlights Backpack’s broader strategy of rebuilding trust in digital assets following a string of exchange failures. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more. POLYGON POS CHAIN EXPERIENCES FINALITY LAG: Polygon’s proof-of-stake chain is live, but transactions are taking longer than usual to lock in, with finality running 10–15 minutes behind schedule. Finality is the assurance that a transaction or piece of data is irreversible once confirmed and added to a block in the blockchain. The foundation said in an X post that a fix has been identified and is being rolled out to validators and service providers. The slowdown was tied to issues on some Bor/Erigon nodes and RPC providers, according to Polygon’s status page. Node restarts resolved the problem for many validators, while others had to rewind to the last finalized block before resyncing, a status page shared. The disruption comes weeks after Polygon’s Heimdall v2 upgrade promised 5-second finality through a modernized consensus stack. – Shaurya Malwa Read more.

Share this article The Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed approval of staking capabilities for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund. The regulatory agency has not provided a timeline for when staking features might be approved for the ETF. BlackRock had sought to include staking functionality, which would allow the fund to earn additional returns by participating in Ethereum’s proof-of-stake validation process. Staking involves locking up Ethereum tokens to help secure the network and validate transactions, typically generating annual yields for participants. The decision affects one of the largest asset managers’ efforts to offer comprehensive Ethereum exposure through a regulated investment vehicle. BlackRock manages approximately $10 trillion in assets globally. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

Title: Top Asset Managers Drop Support for Left-Wing Corporate Activism

His work has been published in The Epoch Times, The Federalist, The Daily Signal and The American Conservative. Previously, he worked more than a decade on Wall Street. A decade-long effort to leverage asset managers to impose net-zero and social justice policies on corporations has gone into reverse with reports from this year’s corporate voting season that the most influential fund managers are no longer voting for these policies. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with more than $11 trillion in assets under management, reported that it voted against 98% of the environmental and social shareholder proposals in 2025, up from 96% against in 2024. Vanguard, the world’s second-largest fund manager with more than $10 trillion in assets, did not vote in favor of a single environmental or social proposal. State Street Investment Management, the third largest with more than $5 trillion under management, has not yet released its 2025 proxy voting report. These three fund managers, often called the “Big Three,” together represent about 25% of the votes cast at annual meetings of S&P 500 companies, a 2022 report by Harvard law professor Lucian A. Bebchuk and Boston University law professor Scott Hirst states. The vast majority of U.S. corporate shares are owned by institutional investors such as asset managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, banks, and insurance companies. These institutions owned 78% of the companies in the Russell 3000 index and 80% of the companies in the S&P 500 index, according to a 2017 study by Pensions & Investments. When individuals buy into investment funds, the fund typically owns the companies’ shares and the voting rights that come with them. And many fund managers have in turn voted for environmental and social agendas, according to an analysis by Lindsey Stewart, an investment analyst at Morningstar Inc. In 2020, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative was formed and grew to 330 members, which until recently included the Big Three, pledging to leverage their influence as shareholders to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. As a sign of changing times, however, Vanguard quit the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in 2022, and BlackRock exited this past January, prompting the club to halt operations soon thereafter. Proxy voting has moved in a similar direction. “The Big Three have indeed effectively ended their support for [environmental, social, and governance] proposals in just a few short years,” Tim Schwarzenberger, portfolio manager for Inspire Investing, told The Daily Signal. “The legal landscape and public perception have shifted quickly, and these major players are now catching up, which is a major victory for common sense,” he said. “Most Americans and shareholders do not want corporations engaged in politics.” In addition, red state attorneys general have recently threatened legal action for alleged violations of antitrust laws, and state treasurers have threatened boycotts of left-wing fund managers. Pressure has also come from conservative shareholders, and this, combined with a Trump administration that opposes climate and social-justice agendas, has taken a toll on corporate activism. “Vanguard and BlackRock have skated where the puck has gone, and should be commended for it,” David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of the Bahnsen Group, said of this year’s proxy votes. “Investors want investment strategies connected to return on their capital—they do not want the intrusion of a poorly-defined social agenda. “That 2019-2022 experiment has ended, and the verdict was clear,” he told The Daily Signal. Some asset managers also faced charges that political goals diverted them from their fiduciary duties to maximize investor returns. Whether or not this was the case, current rhetoric indicates a focus on shareholder value this voting season. In its 2025 proxy voting report, BlackRock stated that many of the environmental and social proposals it rejected “were overreaching, lacked economic merit, or sought outcomes that were unlikely to promote long-term financial value.” Vanguard likewise stated that it rejected proposals that “did not address financially material risks to shareholders.” Conservatives lauded this approach but say they remain vigilant. “Vanguard’s apparent return to sanity and their fiduciary duty to their clients is welcome news,” Will Hild, executive director of Consumers’ Research, told The Daily Signal. “While there are many other ways that asset managers wield influence over corporations, support for extremist, left-wing activist shareholder proposals has been one of the most noxious.” Vanguard’s report referenced the “voluntary withdrawal of proposals by proponents, often following reported engagement with the company.” Conservatives say that in many cases, corporate management settles with activists prior to the vote, in return for having the proposal dropped. Advocates for corporate activism say it is prudent risk management and that companies that pursue climate and social goals will be more profitable. Critics counter that those issues should be left to voters. “Issues of climate policy and social justice should be addressed primarily at the election ballot box, not through corporate activism that is at odds with the values of many Americans,” Schwarzenberger said. “And in truth, most [Environmental, Social, and Governance] risks are already captured in stock prices, so symbolic shareholder votes add little value.” The Daily Signal reached out to BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street for comment.

Title: Quantum computing startup PsiQuantum raises $1B, aiming to build 1M qubit-scale machine
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/10/quantum-computing-startup-psiquantum-raises-1b-aiming-build-1m-qubit-scale-machine/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T16:50:56Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 12:50 EDT / SEPTEMBER 10 2025 by Kyt Dotson PsiQuantum Inc., a well-funded quantum computing startup, said today it has raised $1 billion in late-stage funding to accelerate its efforts to build a large-scale, reliable quantum computer with more than a million qubits. The Series E deal was led by BlackRock Inc., alongside Temasek and Baillie Gifford. The fundraise brings the valuation of the company to $7 billion, more than doubling the company’s valuation since its $450 million Series D in 2021. The round brought on more than a half-dozen new investors, including Macquarie Capital, Ribbit Capital, Nvidia Corp.’s venture arm NVentures andAdage Capital Management, with participation from existing investors that include Blackbird, Third Point Ventures and T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. Quantum computers at any scale require error correction and at a scale as large as 1 million qubits, doing so will become a challenging proposition. Qubits are the quantum equivalent of bits in classical computers. Qubits are used to perform calculations similar to traditional computing; however, they possess properties that allow them to represent both a 1 and a 0 simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform extremely complex calculations faster than the largest supercomputers currently available. “Only building the real thing — million-qubit-scale, fault-tolerant machines — will unlock the promise of quantum computing,” said Prof. Jeremy O’Brien, PsiQuantum’s co-founder and chief executive. “We defined what it takes from day one: this is a grand engineering challenge, not a science experiment.” To meet practical demands, quantum computing firms have been pushing machines to larger and larger sizes. Although only suited for very specific computations, quantum computers have shown promise for solving problems in drug discovery, genetics and materials science. When combined with supercomputers in hybrid systems, quantum computers can solve problems in minutes that would take a traditional system months or years. Since 2021, PsiQuantum has scaled its manufacturing process for its integrated photonic chipset, which uses light for storage and communications within the quantum computer. Additionally, the company has incorporated Barium Titanate into its manufacturing process; this is ideal for ultra-high-performance optical switches, which the company states are the missing component for scaling its machines. The company said the funds will help it build its ambitious quantum machine by 2028. PsiQuantum is not the only quantum outfit with plans to build large-scale machines before the end of the decade. IBM Corp. revealed a roadmap with plans for IBM Quantum Starling, a quantum computer capable of performing 20,000 times more operations than today’s machines. The investment comes shortly after rival Quantinuum raised $600 million at a $10 billion valuation this month and Google LLC unveiled Willow, its largest error-correcting quantum computing chip, at the end of 2024. Along with the funding, the company announced a collaboration with Nvidia that will cover the development of quantum algorithms and software, and the integration of graphics processing units with quantum computing chips using its infrastructure. GPUs are a fundamental technology used for the training, deployment and computational acceleration of artificial intelligence models. “AI is built on classical computing, which has underpinned the last fifty years of technology,” said Tony Kim, head of the Fundamental Equities Technology Group at BlackRock. “Now, we are at the dawn of an adjacent computing platform — rooted in quantum mechanics — that will allow us to simulate the physical world with transformative accuracy.” PsiQuantum also develops the cooling, networking and control systems for utility-scale quantum computers. By harnessing light for networking and control, the company said its systems don’t depend on the now iconic-looking “chandelier”-style cryostats often used to chill quantum computers. Using its specialized technology, the company designed a new high-density cooling solution that can be slotted into modular racks at data centers, capable of cooling hundreds of chips in a single cabinet.

Title: Private Credit Fintech Percent Launches SMA Program

The SMAs will focus on asset-backed, non-bank loans under $25 million and will come with a white label option for RIAs. September 10, 2025 Private credit fintech Percent has launched SMAs focused on private credit investments. The SMAs will invest in asset-backed loans valued at under $25 million, with the firm providing deal selection, servicing and portfolio optimization. Percent executives estimate they can deliver risk-adjusted returns between low double digits and mid-teens. The firm will also work with RIAs to turn its SMAs into white label products for their investors. The SMAs will have an annualized management fee of about 1%, and Percent will charge an additional fee of 10% of the coupon rate of any deal included in the SMAs. Historically, the firm has required a minimum net worth of $250,000 for participating investors, but it is looking to lower that figure. Percent’s platform focuses on raising money from retail investors, family offices, RIAs and credit funds for non-bank lenders and underwriting the transactions. The lenders the company works with include small business lenders, consumer lenders and litigation lenders. According to Percent CEO Nelson Chu, “There are hundreds of thousands of small business loans and consumer loans that make up any one of these [lenders’] investments, so it’s just a significantly better position to be in for investors. And then this new SMA product adds another layer of diversification on top of the original diversification to better protect investors.” Related:GeoWealth Raises $38M in Series C Funding Led by Apollo The private wealth channel has displayed a growing appetite for private credit investments in recent years because, in a rising interest rate environment, they can deliver higher-than-average yields alongside current income. However, that appetite has dampened somewhat in recent months as market volatility and tariff wars have created concerns about potential defaults. Percent has already been providing its existing investors with a customizable product Chu describes as a “blended note.” The firm created approximately 50 of these products for individual investors and family offices and has been adding a few every month for retail investors who want to access structured product investments. Since early September, the firm has transferred the blended notes into the SMA program. “We are in an interesting time in private credit where the Apollos and the Blackstones and the Ares of the world are going further and further down market, offering more products for a younger retail base with a smaller dollar value,” Chu said. “That’s all fine and it’s a great product to invest in. For us in particular, we thought there was a huge opportunity for investors to get additional diversification that they just can’t get in those products. These under $25 million transactions in general will provide a lot better returns, but a comparable risk level, just because it's so diversified across.” Related:Edward Jones Doubles SMAs on Managed Account Platform, with Further Expansion Planned The move is part of a recent uptick in asset managers and advisors incorporating private market products into SMAs and model portfolios. In recent weeks, firms ranging from Fidelity to Wells Fargo have added private market options for their wealth clients. In addition, Vestmark announced that it partnered with alternative investment platform iCapital and asset management giant BlackRock to add private market assets to its tax-managed UMAs for RIAs on the Dynasty Financial Partners’ network. Vestmark’s rival Envestnet also struck deals with BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, State Street Global Advisors and Fidelity to develop custom investment portfolios for advisors using its platform. This trend has also coincided with the rise in popularity of SMAs overall. Research firm Morningstar estimates that between year-end 2022 and mid-year 2024, assets in tax-managed SMAs rose by 67%, reaching $500 billion.

Business FILE PHOTO: A specialist trader works at the post where BlackRock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., July 21, 2022. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo DUBAI : A group of investors led by BlackRock's Global Infrastructure Partners is in talks with lenders to secure up to $10.3 billion in financing for Aramco's Jafurah infrastructure deal, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Banks including JPMorgan and Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation are in talks to participate in the transaction, the two sources said, which will allow Aramco to raise cash upfront in return for steady payments over time. The debt financing will be split into two parts, a short-term and a long-term loan, said the people, declining to be named because the matter is not public. Aramco, BlackRock, JPM and SMBC declined to comment. Under the deal, a newly formed subsidiary, Jafurah Midstream Gas Company (JMGC), will lease development and usage rights for gas processing facilities around the Jafurah gas development and lease them back to Aramco for 20 years.

HYPE holders are smiling to the bank as potential issuers fight over USDH. The Hyperliquid’s USDH race is now down to Native Markets and Paxos. Who will win the deal by the 14th of September? Hyperliquid’s [HYPE] proposed stablecoin, USDH, has triggered one of the most aggressive bidding wars in the crypto sector. Top issuers like Ethena [ENA], Paxos, Sky [SKY] (formerly Maker), Frax, and others are all out fighting to be the official partner. But the top contender in the race, Native Markets, is a new player with no experience, which Dragonfly claims has been ‘fixed’ to win. Slamming the process as a ‘farce,’ Dragonfly VC managing partner Haseeb Qureshi alleged that it was rigged in favor of Native Markets. “Hearing from multiple bidders that none of the validators are interested in considering anyone besides Native Markets. It’s not even a serious discussion, as though there was a backroom deal already done.” Source: X He cited Polymarket odds, bidders, and Native Markets’ immediate proposal after Hyperliquid floated the request, suggesting the team had prior knowledge before the announcement was made public. At the time of writing, however, the contest has narrowed to Paxos and Native Markets. The chances of Paxos winning the bid surged to 47% after the revised proposal, but dropped a few hours later. Still, the market was pricing Native Markets for a likely win at nearly 60%. Source: Polymarket Most of the potential issuers are pledging 95%-100% HYPE value accrual, alongside support by regulated entities like BlackRock. Source: AMBCrypto All proposals from potential issuers should be finalized by the 10th of September. On the 11th of September, Hyperliquid validators should state their preferred potential issuer. The final vote by validators will be done on the 14th of September to allow stakers to align with the validators that mirror their choice. But what does Hyperliquid want to achieve with the USDH? And why now? Currently, Circle’s USDC dominates the decentralized exchange (DEX) and the chain, with $5.5 billion worth of USDC. However, the yield gained ($100M) is not shared with Hyperliquid but with rival Coinbase (as per its agreement with Circle). Source: Reciprocal Ventures Apart from ecosystem growth, the stablecoin should help handle regulatory risks. Especially on the on/off ramp side, according to James Evans, investment analyst at Reciprocal Ventures. “That risk could materialize as an attack on Hyperliquid’s on/off ramps. So in addition to being a product decision, having a compliant stablecoin could be a first step to building regulatory legitimacy.” Some, like Arthur Hayes, have backed Ethena for the USDH bid. But others have pointed out that Paxos and Ethena have existing stablecoin products that would lead to conflicting interests. Amid the bidding wars for USDH, HYPE holders have come out as the main beneficiary. The altcoin printed a new high of $55, up about 20% since the bidding began over the weekend.

Title: US  judge approves Vanguard’s $25m settlement over inflated tax bills

Time Published: 2025-09-10T12:54:08Z

A federal judge has granted preliminary approval to Vanguard Group’s $25m settlement of a lawsuit alleging that the mutual fund giant improperly burdened investors with excessive tax bills, reported Reuters. The settlement relates to the company’s target-date funds and comes after a previous $40m proposal was rejected. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more US District Judge John Murphy in Philadelphia deemed the settlement “sufficiently fair, reasonable, and adequate.” The initial $40m settlement offer, rejected on 19 May, was turned down by Murphy due to concerns that Vanguard could offset this amount against its January settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which he believed would better serve investors as it did not involve legal fees. Investors’ attorneys have highlighted that the $25m is in addition to a $133m fair fund established in the SEC case. Judge Murphy has scheduled a hearing for 6 January 2026, to consider final approval of the settlement. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The lawsuit stemmed from a December 2020 decision by Vanguard to lower the minimum investment required for its cheaper institutional fund classes from $100m to $5m. This change prompted a shift of investors from higher-cost retail classes to these institutional classes, resulting in asset sales and the distribution of taxable capital gains to the remaining investors. Vanguard, with headquarters in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, manages $11tn in assets as of 31 July, the news agency added. The case, known as In re Vanguard Chester Funds Litigation, is being heard in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, under case number 22-00955. In a separate development, a Texas federal court ruled against dismissing a separate lawsuit accusing Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street’s asset management division of anti-competitive behaviour in the coal industry. US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle determined that most of the claims, which allege anti-competitive conduct by BlackRock, Vanguard Group, and State Street’s asset management branch, merit further examination in court.

Title: Hyperliquid’s USDH stablecoin race heats up as Native Markets takes lead amid Paxos’ proposal

With 84% Polymarket odds, Native Markets aims to solidify its lead against evolving proposals from industry veterans. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Hyperliquid’s decision to launch its stablecoin has sparked one of the most competitive governance battles in recent memory. Last week, the decentralized exchange, which had been relying on Circle’s USDC for its liquidity, announced plans to introduce USDH as its native stablecoin. The move immediately attracted a wave of bidders, each vying for the right to issue the token and capture billions in potential value. At least eight organizations have already submitted proposals, including established players like Paxos, Ethena, Agora, and OpenEden. Validators on the Hyperliquid network will ultimately decide who secures the mandate, but in the meantime, speculators have taken to Polymarket to place their bets on the outcome. According to Polymarket odds, one group, Native Markets, stands out as the clear favorite in a market above the $1 million trading volume mark as of press time. Crypto traders on the decentralized marketplace assigned the newcomer a 90% chance of winning the validator vote, but that percentage has dropped to 84% at the time of this report. Native Markets was formed specifically to compete for USDH and is led by Max Fiege, an investor within the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The firm’s pitch proposes a hybrid reserve model in which off-chain assets would be managed by BlackRock, while the on-chain reserves would be held through Superstate using Bridge, a Stripe-owned platform. Native Markets also pledged to split yield from reserve assets, with half earmarked for HYPE token buybacks and half for USDH expansion. Meanwhile, Native Market’s proposal structure has generated both interest and skepticism from community members. In Agora’s proposal, Nick Van Eck, the founder of Agora, pointed out that Native Markets’ proposal reliance on Stripe could prove detrimental to Hyperliquid in the long run. According to him: Get 5 days of high-level strategies the pros use to win in crypto. Limited seats available — claim yours now. Please add [email protected] to your email whitelist. Stay connected via “Stripe recently announced their plans for Tempo, a new layer 1 blockchain. Stripe is committed to driving activity to this ecosystem from a variety of players. How long until Stripe and Bridge start pushing users and perps from other financial applications directly to Tempo instead of Hyperliquid?” Despite these concerns, Dragonfly Capital’s Haseeb Qureshi suggested that Native Markets may have had advance notice of the request-for-proposals process, given how quickly its submission appeared. He wrote: “Everyone else scrambled over the weekend to put something together. So this whole USDH RFP was basically custom made for Native Markets.” However, Alex Svavenik, the CEO of Nansen, countered this claim by stressing that validators have been deeply engaged with all bidders. According to him, the process is far more competitive than critics suggest, with validators actively seeking the best long-term option for Hyperliquid. While Hyperliquid validators might appear inclined toward Native Markets, observers point to Paxos, Ethena, and Agora as candidates with stronger institutional track records. Moreover, these rival firms have been refining their offers, and new entrants are introducing new bids for the USDH stablecoin. On Sept. 10, Paxos unveiled a revised plan centered on a partnership with PayPal. According to the firm, this collaboration would embed USDH into PayPal and Venmo products, list HYPE on PayPal’s ramps, and inject $20 million in incentives for the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Paxos also set strict revenue caps to assure the community of its long-term alignment. It wrote: “Paxos takes nothing until we reach $1 billion in TVL and stays capped at 5% post $5 billion TVL. Any fees earned by Paxos through this milestone will be held in HYPE tokens.” Speaking on the updated proposal, Max Fantle, a Paxos executive, said: “PayPal and Venmo have 400M+ users. Paxos is the only neutral, regulated issuer that can unlock an entirely new institutional customer segment for Hyperliquid that no other issuer can reach.” Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Briffett commented.Committed to financial innovationWith its rebrand, Stream has also introduced an enhanced 'Save' product, as well as launched a new 'Budget' tool, with additional offerings set to be released in the coming year.The Stream platform now contains fifteen products and tools designed to give workers visibility, flexibility and control over their money, including:• Pay - workers can access earned wages before payday• Track - helps workers plan and forecast; it is used 34x per month on average[1]• Save - workers can save directly from salary with 4.33% APR, one of the highest in Britain.

Title: Polymarket’s Top Trader Bets on a 50bps Fed Rate Cut Next Week
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/10/polymarket-s-top-trader-bets-on-a-50bps-fed-rate-cut-next-week
Time Published: 2025-09-10T06:12:26Z

A leading trader on decentralized betting platform Polymarket, who goes by the name JustWakingUp, is wagering that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates by 50 basis points (bps) next week. According to X handle Polymarket Whales, JustWakingUp is the platform’s most prolific trader, boasting nearly $400 million in total trading volume to date and profits exceeding $2 million. The trader has placed a $15,000 bet that the Fed will reduce rates by 50 bps to 3.75% next week and is already showing a 3% gain on the position as of writing. The trader stands to make roughly $226,000 if the Fed does cut rates by 5 bps. The market, however, largely expects the Fed to deliver a 25 basis point cut next week, with the CME’s FedWatch Tool assigning a 91% probability to such an outcome. That said, the odds of a jumbo 50 bps cut have surged to nearly 10% following Friday’s disappointing August jobs report, reflecting growing expectations of more aggressive easing. BlackRock and StanChart have called for a 50 bps cut. Adding to market expectations, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Tuesday that the economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ending March 2025 than previously estimated, marking the largest annual downward revision on record. Traders are now closely watching Wednesday’s U.S. Producer Price Index and Thursday’s Consumer Price Index data releases. Softer-than-expected readings could add to expectations for a 50 bps cut, potentially sending bitcoin and stocks higher.

Title: CoinShares Sets Sights on Wall Street: Will the $1.2B Nasdaq Debut Redefine Crypto
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/coinshares-sets-sights-on-wall-street-1-2b-nasdaq/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T03:00:56Z
Full Content:
CoinShares, Europe’s largest digital asset manager with approximately $10 billion in assets under management, has announced plans to go public in the United States through a $1.2 billion merger with Vine Hill Capital, a Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The transaction would see CoinShares shift from Stockholm to Wall Street, signaling a major step in its bid for global dominance. Ranked as the fourth-largest digital asset exchange-traded product (ETP) manager globally, behind BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity, CoinShares currently holds a commanding 34% market share in Europe. Over the past two years, its assets under management have tripled, fueled by strong inflows and the rapid expansion of its product lineup, which has grown from just four offerings in 2021 to 32 across multiple platforms. CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti described the move as “far more than a venue change,” framing the Nasdaq listing as a gateway to global leadership. He highlighted the U.S. as the hub of digital asset innovation, where institutional demand and improving regulatory clarity are creating fertile ground for expansion. CoinShares operates with industry-leading margins, 76% adjusted EBITDA in the first half of 2025, and has built a diversified business model based on recurring fee revenues supplemented by trading activities. With its proven European strategy, the company now seeks to capture U.S. investors by introducing a broader suite of digital asset products, including tokenized real-world assets. The $1.2 billion deal, priced at a discount compared to peer valuations, includes a $50 million institutional anchor investment. Both company boards have approved the merger, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. Upon completion, the combined entity will trade under Odysseus Holdings Limited. The timing of CoinShares’ U.S. expansion coincides with a wave of favorable regulatory developments, including the rollback of restrictive SEC policies and the drafting of new legislation aimed at fostering a clearer market structure for crypto. If successful, CoinShares’ Nasdaq debut could not only strengthen its foothold in the world’s largest asset management market but also set a precedent for how European crypto firms scale globally.

Title: BlackRock Continues to Offload Millions in Bitcoin, Ethereum, But for How Long?

Time Published: 2025-09-09T22:24:24Z

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock moved $640 million in crypto assets to Coinbase Prime over two days, with deposits of 44,774 ETH and 900 BTC on September 9, following similar moves on September 8. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager and the leading institution in Bitcoin BTC $115 121 24h volatility: 1.1% Market cap: $2.29 T Vol. 24h: $43.16 B and Ethereum ETH $4 449 24h volatility: 2.5% Market cap: $536.92 B Vol. 24h: $33.25 B exchange-traded funds (ETFs), offering via iShares products IBIT and ETHA, traded on Nasdaq. Differently from TradFi, part of BlackRock’s activities can be seen on-chain, with BTC and ETH moves to (deposits) and from (withdrawals) Coinbase Prime accounts, usually representing sales and purchases, respectively. On that note, Lookonchain and other on-chain analytic tools have been monitoring BlackRock activity, spotting recent likely sell-offs in the past two days, with significant deposits to Coinbase. On September 9, BlackRock-owned accounts deposited 44,774 ETH, worth $195.29 million, and 900 BTC, worth $101.67 million, to Coinbase Prime, based on Lookonchain’s post. Before that, on September 8, the asset manager was seen depositing 72,370 ETH, worth $312 million, and 266.79 BTC, worth $29.88 million. BlackRock just sold 44,774 $ETH($195.29M) and 900 $BTC($101.67M) again.https://t.co/bcKGkl1VXE pic.twitter.com/xyubPNpGjK — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) September 9, 2025 BlackRock’s market-making activities are a direct reflection of the ETFs’ net capital flows. They should represent the real-world adjustment and settlement of the ETFs’ holdings to match investor demand for shares, bridging traditional finance (TradFi) trading on Nasdaq with the crypto market. Nevertheless, the deposits and withdrawals are not necessarily representing all the sales and purchases in real time—simply reserve adjustments. For example, on September 8, IBIT and ETHA saw net flows of +229 BTC, worth $25.50 million, and -43,770 ETH, worth $192.70 million, respectively, according to data from Coinglass. On September 9, however, IBIT added 227 BTC. Lookonchain reported this movement in the September 9 update, showing similar numbers that conflict with the recently observed on-chain activity. Total Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF net inflows | Source: Coinglass Both assets had massive outflows last Friday, on September 5, which may have required the reserve adjustments on Coinbase Prime, as seen earlier today from the Lookonchain report, causing large deposits and sell-offs. Or, institutions are positioning in advance of a yet unknown pricing event, as smart money like BlackRock can be seen as a market canary. Now, the price charts appear to be forming a bullish structure for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, potentially signaling a recovering institutional interest, again conflicting with the signal from Wall Street whales. Additionally, Arkham has reported BlackRock is “buying more” cryptocurrencies, reaching over $100 billion in total reserves. BLACKROCK NOW HOLDS OVER $100B IN CRYPTO AND THEY’RE BUYING MORE pic.twitter.com/7eRAzJ0fod — Arkham (@arkham) September 9, 2025 CrypNuevo, a prominent Bitcoin analyst with a relevant accuracy rate, believes BTC is poised for a bull rally in the following days, hunting upward liquidity in the expectation of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. $BTC Sunday update: 10 days until the first Interest Rate cut this cycle, and the chart is undecided with choppy Price Action. Uptrend structure is intact but sentiment is bearish in this pullback and many are calling it a sell the news event. How am I playing this? 🧵↓(1/7) pic.twitter.com/h1Y4DhFXK7 — CrypNuevo 🔨 (@CrypNuevo) September 7, 2025 Other indicators, like Tether minting 2 billion USDT during a market dip, very similar to what happened in December 2024, could also suggest it is time to buy and not sell, as seen in BlackRock’s recent activities. All that only evidences the volatility and complexity of short-term speculation, which is affected by a lot of nuance and different factors, together with big players’ movements.

The decentralized exchange and layer-1 network is currently being powered by Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT0, but Hyperliquid’s community is currently soliciting proposals on a “Hyperliquid-alinged” stablecoin that could serve as an alternative. Proposals have already been penned by entities including stablecoin issuer Paxos, but Ethena’s proposal emphasizes that its support would also come with that of its partners. Ethena flexed partnerships with Anchorage Digital, a federally chartered digital assets bank, and Securitize, the BlackRock-backed, real-world asset tokenization firm. Anchorage issues Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin, which is backed by BlackRock’s tokenized BUIDL fund. “We are excited to enable Ethena’s USDtb, which is 100% backed by BUIDL and uniquely positioned to offer institutional grade cash management as well as on-chain liquidity to Hyperliquid users,” BlackRock Head of Digital Assets Robert Mitchnick said in the proposal. Introduced in the first quarter of 2023, Hyperliquid was viewed as a scrappy DeFi Startup not too long ago. But now projects like Ethena are clamoring for its feedback, underscoring how that perception is changing. Hyperliquid has $5.7 billion in stablecoins on its network, for example, according to crypto data provider DefiLlama. Under Ethena’s proposal, USDH would be initially backed by USDtb, and therefore have indirect backing from the $14 trillion asset manager’s BUIDL fund. With at least 95% of the revenue generated by USDH’s reserves, distributions would be made to Hyperliquid’s so-called Assistance Fund, alongside HYPE purchases and distributions to validators. HYPE changed hands around $53 on Tuesday, a 20% increase over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. The token serves as Hyperliquid’s governance token, letting holders participate in the process of voting on software upgrades and other initiatives. If Ethena receives a green light, the project would cover transaction costs associated with making USDH the go-to stablecoin within Hyperliquid’s exchange, its proposal adds. Among other notable benefits, the proposal states that Anchorage would issue Ethena’s USDtb stablecoin natively on Hyperliquid’s network. On top of that, Securitize would deploy its platform on the layer-1, bringing “institutional grade tokenized funds, stocks, and other financial products to the Hyperliquid ecosystem for no deployment cost.” CORRECTION (September 10, 2025, 12:17 p.m. PT): Removes mention of World Liberty Financial, which is not among the suitors for Hyperliquid's stablecoin.
