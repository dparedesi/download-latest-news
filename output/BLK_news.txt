tiun, a fintech helping media providers to attract, engage and convert younger audiences, is today announcing a $2.5 million pre-seed funding round led by Founderful. The funds will kick-start their efforts to become Europe's preferred way to pay for online media. 0 18 December 2024 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. In particular, the tiun team is focused on onboarding new business partnerships and integrations with third-party payment methods i.e. digital wallets. These will simultaneously provide media platforms with exposure to previously untapped audiences while also allowing a new generation of users to access and pay for media by “tiuning in”, offering more convenience and flexibility while being more secure.The tiun team believes that consuming and paying for online content should be simple and that users shouldn’t need to create a new account, give up personal information, provide credit card details and subscribe - every time they find a new media platform. Especially among young users, the tedious process of registering and subscribing is not considered “convenient” anymore. tiun offers media companies easy-to-integrate solutions that allow a new means of authentication and payment to provide world-class user experiences that drive millions of users, and increase customer spending and engagement.Swiss VC firm Founderful led the round, which also included Blue Wire Capital and a16z scout Maximilian Lehmann, among other angel investors. tiun was founded in early 2023 by the experienced co-founder trio Nikolaos Christoforakos, Christian Heiduschke and Sandro Zweig. Ex-BlackRock Zweig previously led a fintech product development agency that boasted Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank amongst its clientele. Christoforakos provides tiun with expertise in go-to-market strategies having previously helped scale teams at the likes of Amazon and Moss. Lastly, Heiduschke has almost a decade of experience in building scalable, robust SaaS products, having originally achieved a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich. Born out of a shared frustration at being hit with paywalls the team quickly agreed there must be an alternative, more user-friendly way of charging for media, which doesn’t require the repetitive surrendering of personal data, and began work on a solution. tiun Co-founder Nikolaos Christoforakos explains, “There’s a clear disconnect between the modern way we expect to consume media and how media is bought and paid for today. The subscription model was invented to bring convenience to consumers, preventing them from having to pay for every item they wanted to consume. This worked too for the media providers, who got consumer loyalty in return - so the model grew exponentially. That same experience can in today’s world often be a hindrance for a young user to convert and become a loyal customer. tiun intends to build that bridge by working closely with media businesses, in a way which will significantly benefit both consumers and media businesses.”tiun enters the market at a time the news media industry is in financial freefall. A lack of revenue is causing significant layoffs throughout the industry. Estimates by the Press Gazette suggest that 2,500 media jobs have been cut in the US and UK this year alone. Big-name takeovers in the US haven’t yet solved the problem, either. Over the past decade, Jeff Bezos, Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, and Marc Benioff bought The Washington Post, LA Times, and Time Magazine, respectively. Despite their backing, those three publications alone lost an estimated $150 million in 2023. tiun builds the infrastructure that allows younger audiences to connect their wallet with an online service in a few clicks to access and pay for media, allowing them to pay for the time they consume. Pascal Mathis, Partner at Founderful, says, "The internet has become the dominant way by which people consume media. Be it television, printed media, the radio, or physical CDs, one by one the internet has triumphed by facilitating a smoother, simplified user experience. The one area online media has failed to address, however, is effective monetization, deterring users with inconvenient and fragmented methods. Tiun removes these hurdles, creating seamless connections between consumers and providers. We're thrilled to support the team in solving this challenge at such an early stage."The tiun team sees vast potential in the solution in all kinds of media beyond written news, including streaming, and gaming. The company has already onboarded 50+ media titles across Central Europe, which are making use of the infrastructure.The tiun infrastructure can track activity and end the session if there is no movement after a given time, preventing users from overspending. To incentivize uptake, tiun limits the amount media providers can charge users to a maximum of 20% of what a monthly subscription would cost. Once those limits are reached, the remainder of the month is free. The data and insights gathered by the platform can be used to inform media strategies to ensure media is as engaging as possible. Bertie Highmore, Head of Investments at Blue Wire Capital says, “The tiun team have extensive experience in - and demonstrated ability for - building, launching and scaling digital platforms. Strong appetite has already been shown for their product, which solves one of the biggest emerging issues in online media. We’re excited to be on board, and are looking forward to what will be a huge next twelve months for them.”The tiun team is delighted to raise its initial funding round to develop a first-of-its-kind solution to modernize the way online media providers charge for their services. The team will share a series of exciting updates in the coming year.

Title: Ardonagh Reaches $14 Billion Valuation With Stone Point Investment

The deal will see Greenwich, Connecticut-based Stone Point become a “significant minority shareholder” in Ardonagh, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public. Stone Point’s stake will likely be in the 15% to 20% range in the secondary equity sale, which valued Ardonagh at 16 to 17 times its annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, one of the people said. Ardonagh was last valued at $7.5 billion when Abu Dhabi Investment Authority invested in the firm in late 2021. It is majority-owned by private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners. Private credit specialist HPS Investment Partners, set to be acquired by BlackRock Inc., owns a minority stake in Ardonagh. The deal is the latest in insurance broking that signals large-scale transactions are heating up in the industry, with both private equity and strategic buyers hunting for assets in the fragmented market. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co agreed to buy AssuredPartners in a $13.45 billion deal this month, its largest-ever acquisition. In September, Marsh McLennan agreed to buy McGriff Insurance Services in a $7.8 billion cash transaction, also its biggest. Founded in 2017 from the combination of broker Towergate and four other entities, London-based Ardonagh has become one of the world’s 20 largest brokers in recent years. It generated pro-forma income of $1.9 billion in 2023. Over the past three years alone, Ardonagh bought 13 businesses in markets including Brazil, Spain and Italy. This year, it bought Australia’s PSC Insurance Group for an implied equity value of A$2.3 billion ($1.5 billion), taking it private and combining it with its Envest business. Private Credit Ardonagh is also a large borrower in the $1.6 trillion private credit market, having secured what was the largest-ever loan from a group of private credit funds in 2020. Last year, Ares Management Corp. provided a direct-lending package worth about £1 billion ($1.3 billion) to support the sale of its personal insurance business to Markerstudy. Ardonagh’s latest funding is likely to prompt speculation about any next steps Howden Group, another major UK insurance broker, might take to boost growth. The company, founded by David Howden 30 years ago, has long been considered a likely candidate for an initial public offering. The firm had an enterprise value of $13 billion in 2022. It is owned by 5,200 employee-shareholders, private equity firms General Atlantic and Hg, Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec as well as the Howden Foundation.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn’t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn’t miss. The United States is gearing up to be the leader in artificial intelligence technology. However, other nations are also intensifying their efforts to compete in this rapidly advancing field. To challenge the United States’ dominance in this critical technology, Russia has recently pledged to participate in the global race for artificial intelligence actively. READ ALSO: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings Speaking at Russia’s flagship AI conference last week, President Vladimir Putin said Russia would develop artificial intelligence with BRICS partners and other countries. According to Putin, the new AI Alliance Network would include national associations and development institutions in the field of AI from BRICS countries and other interested states. He also claimed that the country must participate equally in the global AI race. “Russia must participate on equal terms in the global race to create strong artificial intelligence. It is precisely the advanced solutions that Russian scientists are currently working on. We invite scientists from all over the world to join in the collaboration”. Russia has been subject to Western sanctions which have been directed to restrict the country’s access to technologies it needs in the war against Ukraine. As a result, some of the world’s major producers of microchips have halted exports to Russia, limiting its AI ambitions. Reuters reports how Russia’s dominant lender Sberbank, who is currently leading the AI development in Russia, admits that the microchips underpinning AI development are the trickiest hardware to replace. In this regard, it noted how national AI associations from BRICS members Brazil, China, India, South Africa, Serbia, Indonesia, and other non-BRICS countries, had joined the AI Alliance Network. The network will be working toward joint research in technology and AI regulation, offering opportunities for AI products to be sold in other member countries’ markets. Currently, the leading AI powers of the world are the United States and China. It goes without saying that Russia’s alliance with China has the potential to significantly reshape the future landscape of artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, the US is also gearing up to continue leading in AI. President-elect Donald Trump has already appointed an AI and Crypto Czar. Trump is also set to repeal President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI. Trump plans to repeal Biden’s AI order to reduce regulatory constraints, fostering rapid innovation and maintaining the U.S. edge in the global AI race.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) is an automotive and clean energy company that uses advanced artificial intelligence in its autonomous driving technology and robotics initiatives. On December 13, Reuters reported that The Trump transition team wants the incoming administration to drop a car-crash reporting requirement opposed by Elon Musk’s Tesla. The requirement, if dropped, would weaken the government’s ability to investigate and regulate the safety of vehicles that come with automated driving systems. Tesla is going to benefit the most from the removal of this provision, as the company has reported more than 1,500 crashes to federal safety regulators under the program. This has led to multiple federal investigations. The recommendation to eliminate the rule came from a transition team that was responsible for producing a 100-day strategy for automotive policy. According to the team, the rule is considered a requirement for “excessive” data collection, according to a document reviewed by Reuters.

We recently compiled a list of the Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cardio Diagnostics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDIO) stands against the other AI stocks. There is a growing concern in Silicon Valley that the progress around artificial intelligence is slowly “losing steam”. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa explores whether AI progress is slowing, and what it means for the industry. Early signs of struggle are bubbling up in major tech names. As highlighted by Bosa, the first sign of things slowing down has been a lack of progression between models. OpenAI has led the pack in AI advancements, with each of the new models of ChatGPT exponentially better than the last. READ NOW: 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm and Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Analyst Ratings Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about today. OpenAI's highly anticipated model Orion was expected to be a ground-breaking system bringing us closer to AGI. However, the initial vision is being scaled back. “While Orion’s performance ended up exceeding that of prior models, the increase in quality was far smaller compared with the jump between GPT-3 and GPT-4, the last two flagship models the company released, according to some OpenAI employees who have used or tested Orion”. The same roadblocks have been happening to other AI models, such as that by Anthropic. Just like OpenAI, Anthropic is also witnessing a timetable slip for the release of its long-awaited Claude model called 3.5 Opus. "The AGI bubble is bursting a little bit. It's become clear that 'different training approaches' may be needed to make AI models work really well on a variety of tasks." Even some of the big tech giants aren't enthusiastic about the progress AI has been making. Speaking during the New York Times annual DealBook summit at Jazz at Lincoln Center, Sundar Pichai stated how generative AI won’t be changing lives in 2025— at least, not more than it already has. “I think the progress is going to get harder. When I look at [2025], the low-hanging fruit is gone. The hill is steeper ... You’re definitely going to need deeper breakthroughs as we get to the next stage”. However, if progress is plateauing, it has to do with scaling laws. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei states that the scaling laws are a misnomer. He emphasizes that while these patterns have historically guided AI development—suggesting that increasing data and computational power leads to improved AI capabilities—they are not guaranteed to continue indefinitely. As such, AI companies have been turning to synthetic AI, i.e. data generated artificially. The Information reports that Orion was produced based on synthetic data. However, the problem has been that low-quality data, in turn, leads to low-quality performance. As such, with leading tech companies poised to unveil new models over the next eighteen months, their pace of progress—or lack thereof—has the potential to dramatically redefine the dynamics of the competition.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) stands against other important AI announcements for investors. Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund supported by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has reduced its holdings in major US tech firms, mentioning concerns over their substantial AI-related spending. Financial Times reported that fund manager Stephen Yiu highlighted a significant reduction in Microsoft shares, which dropped out of the fund’s top ten holdings for the first time since 2017. He noted that the return on invested capital for the company might decline due to AI investments and hinted at potentially exiting the stock entirely if AI costs exceed cash generation. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants have faced growing scrutiny over their rising capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with Wall Street increasingly wary about returns. Yiu has also reduced stakes in Meta and previously exited Amazon and Alphabet, expressing concerns over AI-driven spending outpacing profitability, the report states. While the fund remains optimistic about Nvidia, which now represents around 10% of its portfolio, Yiu expressed less confidence in the other six companies. He also supports Broadcom, benefiting from AI infrastructure development. According to the report, Blue Whale Growth, managing £1.3 billion, has returned 24% this year, outperforming peer funds, but has reduced its exposure to US tech stocks significantly compared to benchmarks.

In stark contrast to the caution seen in Western markets, Southeast Asia’s emerging economies are racing to establish themselves as key players in the global AI landscape. According to CNBC, the region benefits from a youthful, digitally savvy population and growing government support for AI initiatives. While Singapore has already made significant strides in AI adoption, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also accelerating efforts to harness AI for a range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. This growing focus on AI offers immense potential for economic growth, creating new jobs and boosting productivity. However, as these countries ramp up their AI strategies, they face challenges related to infrastructure, digital literacy, and the need for skilled workers. As experts point out, the AI race in Southeast Asia is not just about adoption but about tailoring technology to the region’s unique needs. Despite the hurdles, the region is positioning itself as a promising center for AI innovation, and many expect that ASEAN’s commitment to AI could help its economies thrive in the global tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son is making a bold move to accelerate AI development globally. Son plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. His goal is to create 100,000 AI-related jobs before the end of President-elect Donald Trump’s term, as reported by Reuters. Known for his strong advocacy for AI, Son has already made notable investments in AI companies such as OpenAI and Graphcore, further signaling his commitment to the sector’s growth. This massive investment, paired with Southeast Asia’s rising AI ambitions, highlights the growing global momentum behind artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A close-up of a laptop with a software engineer coding on the monitor. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) provides a cloud-based platform that offers monitoring and security solutions for applications and infrastructure. The company leverages AI to improve performance analysis, improve security management, and streamline workflows across cloud environments. Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz upped his price target for Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) to $170, up from $155, while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock as part of his outlook for the software sector in 2025. This adjustment reflects the broader trend of increasing valuations for several companies, driven by higher comparison multiples. Moskowitz noted: “DDOG remains a clear leader in the observability market, with multiple businesses at scale, and with potential tailwinds in the form of digital transformation, cloud migration, and GenAI.” The firm expressed a more optimistic view than many regarding cloud adoption in the coming years, mentioning both existing on-premise customers and new clients as key drivers. This was part of its detailed 2025 software sector outlook. Overall, DDOG ranks 6th on our list of important AI announcements for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of DDOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: The Economics of Investor Engagement

Institutional investors such as mutual funds, pension funds, and exchange traded funds (ETFs) play a prominent role in today’s economy. According to the CFA Institute, institutional investors now hold over $70 trillion in investable assets and thus wield immense influence over the corporations they invest in. But how do these institutions actually exercise their power? The most nuanced and direct way for investors to interact with their portfolio firms is through shareholder engagement, where they communicate with corporate managers to share their perspective, suggest changes, or gather information. In a new study, we quantify the costs, benefits, and economy-wide impact of engagement by some of the largest institutional investors in the world. Engagement activities range from writing letters to CEOs and joining meetings to pressing for better governance or environmental practices. Unlike voting or selling shares, engagement is a private dialogue, making it a less-easily observed but potentially more powerful and nuanced tool. By addressing issues directly with corporate leaders, investors aim to improve company performance – and, in turn, the value of their investments. The institutions in our sample each employs a dedicated stewardship team that engages with hundreds or even thousands of portfolio firms every year. Despite its importance, we know surprisingly little about the economics of engagement. How much does it cost? What are the benefits? How much value does it create? Using novel data on investor engagement drawn from the yearly stewardship reports of eleven large institutional investors including BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and T. Rowe Price, we quantify these economic forces for the first time. We find that institutional investors act as if spending $10,000 on engagement increases a company’s value by 0.3 basis points (bps), or 0.003 percent, on average. While that may sound small, when scaled by trillions of dollars in market capitalization and assets under management, the potential benefits are significant. However, engagement isn’t free; the stewardship team requires significant resources to research the issues and conduct meetings with corporate leaders. We find that both the costs and benefits vary depending on the firm being engaged. Smaller companies are slightly more expensive to engage with but offer much higher returns on engagement, an average 5.5 basis point expected increase in firm value. Yet institutional investors engage less with smaller firms because they hold smaller positions in those firms, limiting the potential payoff. We also find that engagement costs are higher for firms with entrenched management, where presumably resistance from leadership makes it harder to drive change. The economics of engagement also depend on the type of fund that is engaging. Active funds – those that try to outperform the market by actively picking stocks – are more likely to engage than index funds, which simply aim to match the performance of an index like the S&P 500. Surprisingly, this difference isn’t because active funds are inherently better at engagement. In fact, we find that active and index funds create equal amounts of expected value when they engage. Rather, it’s a question of incentives. Index funds charge lower fees, meaning they capture a smaller share of the value created through engagement. As a result, despite their larger positions and more diversified holdings, they engage less. Yet as passive investing continues to dominate the market, the role of these funds in engagement is becoming more pronounced. Index funds tend to hold larger stakes in companies simply because they track broad indices, which increases their potential to create value when they do engage. Using simulations, we examined what would happen if passive investing continued to grow, reaching 90 percent of all mutual fund assets. We find that index funds would engage more often, driven by their even larger holdings, and generate substantial value for both their investors and society. Our estimates suggest that index funds have flat economies of scale: Tracking an index does not become more difficult as the fund grows. As a result, the continuing rise of passive investing increases the total societal benefits of their engagement. On the other hand, our estimates show that active investors face diseconomies of scale that limit their effectiveness as they grow. As an actively managed fund attracts more resources, it becomes harder to identify and act on profitable opportunities that move the needle. As Warren Buffett once said, “Anyone who says that size does not hurt investment performance is selling. The highest rates of return I’ve ever achieved were in the 1950s. I killed the Dow. You ought to see the numbers. But I was investing peanuts then. It’s a huge structural advantage not to have a lot of money.” Smaller active funds can engage more selectively and effectively. In our simulations, active funds actually create more value for society when they shrink. At the same time, active fund managers and investors certainly don’t want their funds to shrink, and we might expect them to fight this trend, for example by lowering their fees or introducing new active investing options. Our findings add new dimensions to the debate about the future of investing and corporate governance. Engagement clearly has the potential to create significant value, but its benefits are unevenly distributed. Index funds, with their flat economies of scale, may increasingly fill the gap left by shrinking active funds, creating a system where the societal value of engagement could rise even if the payoff to individual funds and investors are smaller. The study also highlights the challenges of aligning private incentives with social benefits. While active funds are more motivated to engage under current fee structures, index funds generate broader social gains as they grow. This mismatch creates a tension between what’s best for active fund managers and their investors and what’s best for the economy as a whole. More broadly, our findings imply that engagement is a relatively hidden but powerful tool for increasing firm value – one that benefits not just large institutions, but the broader economy, too. As the balance between active and passive investing shifts, so will the dynamics of how institutional investors engage with the companies they own. This post comes to us from professors Davidson Heath at the University of Utah’s David Eccles School of Business, Daniele Macciocchi at the University of Miami’s Herbert Business School, and Matthew C. Ringgenberg at the University of Utah. It is based on their recent article, “The Economics of Investor Engagement,” available here. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Introducing Nirvana V2: Here's What You Need to Know | HackerNoon
URL: https://hackernoon.com/introducing-nirvana-v2-heres-what-you-need-to-know
Time Published: 2024-12-18T04:03:07Z
Full Content:
The Nirvana protocol has one mission: to produce a truly resilient store of value. One that holds its worth regardless of market cycles, evolves without central planning, and scales indefinitely. Without these three legs to the stool, an asset’s value will only ever be temporary. Nirvana builds on the open and algorithmic nature of decentralized finance to create an entirely new class of asset that meets the promise of this new paradigm we call “DeFi”. In a word: Nirvana’s store of value – ANA – could very well be the most “cryptonative” of all assets on offer. It takes the principles of crypto and blockchain seriously – almost fanatically – and encodes them into its DNA. It is not controversial to note that crypto (and especially DeFi) has been going through a rough, prolonged puberty. The sector has been stuck in the awkward phase of being half “decentralized” and half “traditional”, half “democratic” while half manipulated by cabals of ultra-wealthy insiders. The goal was trustless, open, algorithmic systems, but the reality has been a messy blend of old-fashioned problems with new-fashioned aspirations. Crypto caught on because it promised to create an asset that is resilient, decentralized, and scalable. Nirvana’s purpose is to bring this vision finally to reality. Let’s take these three pillars one at a time. The hope for Bitcoin is that it becomes “digital gold” – that is, a “safe haven” asset that holds its value with a rock-hard grip. So far, this remains just hope. The annualized volatility of Bitcoin has been 4-9 times greater than gold’s, and it is anyone’s guess where the roller coaster goes next. The problem is not Bitcoin’s fault. It is that Bitcoin’s technology is not of the same ilk as its market. Its ledger is famously tamper-resistant, but its market is only human, and sometimes, humans decide to rotate out liquidity. This fact will never change. Bitcoin’s price has nothing to do with blockchain technology, and the value that Bitcoin stores has much to do with the convictions of Michael Saylor and Blackrock. We should go one step further with digital assets. Nirvana’s key insight is: make the market algorithmic too. If the liquidity for the asset is deterministic, and the humans are left out of the equation, then we can guarantee value for a token with the same mathematical precision that we guarantee its supply. Yes, Bitcoin guarantees that the supply will stop at 21 million – but what if it could guarantee that its price will never go below, say, $70k? Nirvana does. Nirvana’s ANA token has a hard floor price, guaranteed at the protocol level. This price cannot be breached because the mathematical rules of the Nirvana market ensure that every ANA token in supply can be sold back to the protocol at this floor price. But why stop there? The floor price for ANA also rises. It rises automatically with demand for ANA and follows the price of ANA upward. Every time the floor ratchets up, the intrinsic value of ANA gets locked in forever. The more expensive ANA becomes, the higher the floor price becomes, and the greater amount of value gets permanently stored in each token. We can do better than “digital gold”. After all, the price of physical gold has no bottom. When we make the market and liquidity itself algorithmic, we have an entirely new kind of asset that has truly guaranteed value. The price of ANA may go up and down, but it can only go down so far as its current floor allows. One remarkable goal of crypto protocols is to be everlasting. They should continue to live long, healthy lives even if the founder disappears. After all, they are just code. But the original creator is not infallible, and protocols need to adapt after inception to survive. It is not viable to freeze the code once, and never touch it again. The truth is that all major DeFi teams make changes to their programs, big and small, all the time. The founders must operate their business as businesspeople would, and it is an open secret that a great many attempts at decentralized governance turn out to be theater in practice. There is another path. Nirvana’s governance is simple, deterministic, and mechanical – just like its market. The first and most important step in liberating governance from central authority is zero “team allocation” of governance power. With Nirvana, everyone is on equal footing on Day 1. There are no governance tokens held back in insider wallets, put on vesting schedules, or pre-sold in dark OTC markets. Remember: when a team “airdrops” its governance token, but keeps 80% of the supply in reserve for its own stewardship, this is oligarchy, not democracy. The second step is to embed the governance process in the automated, immutable code of the contract. The code itself is like a Constitution document for the protocol – it sets the rules for how governance functions and makes affects on the program. All that can happen is users participate in governance according to those indelible rules. The method for governing Nirvana is simple. Every mutable parameter of the protocol is a number, and this number can be nudged in one direction or the other every week, according to a programmatic ballot. This elegant system gives full control over the token holders to steer the protocol gradually, without the need for any central committee with admin access. Nirvana gives control of the protocol to the rational, economic incentives of its participants. And by doing so, ensures that the protocol will endure, evolve, and adapt regardless of any one human’s involvement. DeFi broke down barriers. All you need is a connection to the internet in order to participate. But most, if not all, crypto assets buckle under the weight of massive adoption and ultimately break. They cannot truly scale as useful stores of value for hundreds of millions of individuals simply because too much of the supply is overly concentrated among those who got in early. Concentration can be good for price, but it is bad for liquidity. The key to making an asset scalable is that it becomes more liquid as it becomes more valuable. The status quo among crypto assets is unfortunately the opposite. The common playbook for tokens is to restrain supply, and thereby reduce liquidity and increase volatility, in the hope of price appreciation. Needless to say, low liquidity cuts both ways. And the brief history of crypto markets has already experienced numerous liquidity crises where panic selling seemed like the only option. The ANA token is paradigmatically different. It scales indefinitely, meaning there is no cap on supply, but it is also never printed out of thin air. Every ANA token exists strictly because someone paid for it. And when that someone bought it, they also increased its liquidity – that is, they extended the sell depth. With this one move, Nirvana turns the presumed negative relation between supply and price on its head. The prevailing myth is that a greater supply implies a lower value, but with ANA its supply and its value are positively correlated. More ANA means more liquidity and value for ANA. There is no cap on the supply for ANA because there is no cap on the value of ANA. These two properties are combined in the mathematics of the Nirvana market. ANA will become as plentiful and valuable as its holders want, and the floor price will rise at pace. But even if the circulating supply and price explode, illiquidity is not a problem ANA will ever face since the floor price is guaranteed for all tokens. Panic selling is not rational in this system. And even if a spurt of irrational selling does occur, it will never move the price beneath its floor. There is no reason to rush to the exit. Nirvana’s store of value is one that can be held securely by everyone because the market liquidity is maintained by no one. It scales automatically with adoption. Crypto ignited the imagination of a generation with its dream to produce an asset that is fair, open, and, in some real sense, permanent. Nirvana embodies this ideal by infusing cryptonative principles into every aspect of the protocol, including the price and liquidity of its asset. ANA is a “pure” cryptonative store of value. The market is cryptonative, the governance is cryptonative, and the scale is unlimited. The protocol truly steers itself and the market truly makes itself because the only power that has influence over either comes from the organic, anonymous users that participate in them. The value that ANA accrues comes from genuine market demand, and the value that ANA stores is guaranteed by the protocol’s floor price. About Nirvana Founded by a distributed team of DeFi veterans with deep roots in the Solana ecosystem, Nirvana is on a mission to redefine token markets and elevate the decentralized finance landscape. With the relaunch of Nirvana V2, the team reaffirms its commitment to building secure, transparent, and equitable financial systems for all.

Currently, Samayat Services LLP holds a 96.55 per cent stake in the Gurugram-based supermart major. As the IPO is an OFS, the company will not receive any funds from the IPO proceeds. The Kedaara Capital-backed company is a one-stop destination catering to middle—and lower-middle-income consumers in India. The product range includes both in-house and third-party brands and covers three key categories: apparel, general merchandise, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG). On Tuesday, the Gurugram-based Vishal Mega Mart raised ₹2,400 crore from anchor investors as part of the IPO process by finalising the allocation of 30.76 crore shares to anchor investors at ₹78 per share. Among the marquee investors included global funds such as Government of Singapore, Monetary Authority of Singapore, JP Morgan, Custody Bank of Japan, Nomura, Blackrock, Government Pension Fund Global, Schroder International Selection Fund, HSBC Global, TIMF Holdings, CLSA Global, and Prudential Hong Kong and domestic institutions Domestic institutional investors like SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, Kotak Mahindra AMC, Nippon Life India, Axis Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life Trustee, Franklin, Mirae Asset, HDFC Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance, Canara Robeco MF, Invesco, Tata MF, Max Life Insurance, Bajaj Holdings, UTI MF, Bajaj Allianz General Insurance, Baroda BNP Paribas MF and Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance. Targeted towards the middle- and low-income consumers, the retailer has a significant presence in tier-II cities with a store network of around 645 at the end of September. Despite a dip in discretionary demand among urban consumers in the country, the company has managed decent growth at over 12 per cent across its three main categories of apparel, general merchandise and FMCG.

Title: Why Is 3M Company (MMM) Among the Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-3m-company-mmm-among-224319955.html
Time Published: 2024-12-17T22:43:19Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stands against the other conglomerate stocks. As per Lloyd Capital, the new year starts on the back of economic resilience. Global conditions remain benign, courtesy of a healthy US economy, moderating inflation, and a gradual easing of global monetary policy. However, investors are required to remain cognizant of the several risks looming. Notably, governments worldwide have fueled economic activity in a way that has deteriorated fiscal positions. Also, inflation is yet to fully return to the respective targeted levels and the geopolitical situation remains uncertain. As per the investment management firm, investors are required to remain focused on analyzing the quality of the businesses they purchase and ensuring that these are done at prices offering an adequate margin of safety relative to intrinsic value. As per BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, the S&P 500 index should reach 6,666 by 2025 end. Part of this growth is expected to stem from healthy economic growth. The investment firm's economics team expects that the US economy should grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 2% growth. As a result, the firm has favored companies that are GDP-sensitive and is now going overweight on Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Real Estate, among others. Bank of America went on to add that, in 2025, there will be a broadening out of the stock market rally from the "Mag 7" tech stocks to other 493 stocks of the S&P 500 Index. J.P. Morgan also has somewhat similar expectations. Let’s look at that in detail. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. J.P. Morgan believes that equity earnings should broaden moving forward. Equity returns were dominated by "Mag 7" since the beginning of 2023. Over that period, the broader market (S&P 500 index) managed to return 62%, more than half of which was made by Magnificent 7 (delivering 242% over the same period). The strong returns have a solid backing as the Mag 7 were able to grow their earnings at 40%, and the remaining 493 stocks in the index were able to post 2%. However, J.P. Morgan expects that performance is expected to broaden in 2025 as the remaining "493 stocks" should be able to more than 5 times their earnings growth to 13% in 2025. Therefore, Wall Street analysts believe that investing in companies having a diversified presence should deliver healthy returns in contrast to pure-play (sector-specific) investments. The wealth management firm believes that reduced interest rates, renormalization of inventories and production, and easier comparables are expected to act as potential tailwinds for the cohort over the next year. Analysts are bullish on businesses with multiple revenue streams and one group that gives investors a diversification advantage is conglomerates. With this in mind, let us now have a look at the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener and online rankings. After getting an initial list of 20-25 stocks, we selected the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A specialized industrial laboratory, filled with high-tech machinery for producing abrasives. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 82 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) offers diversified technology services in the US and internationally. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)’s delivered a YTD return of more than ~40%, courtesy of the appointment of a new CEO and implementation of strategic initiatives. The new leadership plans to focus on 3 main areas: driving sustained organic growth, improving operational performance, and effective capital deployment. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) targets to revitalize its R&D efforts to align organic growth with global GDP growth rates. By doing this, the company should regain its innovation edge and capture new market opportunities. The new CEO’s emphasis on operational execution improvements throughout various areas including facility rationalization and distribution network optimization should unlock significant cost savings and efficiency gains. These initiatives are expected to fuel margin expansion and improve cash flow generation. Wall Street expects 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) to achieve adjusted operating margins in the mid-20s range. This expansion is expected to stem from self-help measures, such as cost structure optimization, salesforce restructuring, and facility rationalization. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)’s strong emphasis on distribution network optimization should result in improved supply chain efficiency and reduced costs, supporting margin expansion. As per Wall Street, with the appointment of a new CEO and the implementation of strategic initiatives, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) should see a potential turnaround. Analysts at UBS Group raised shares of the company from a “Neutral” rating to a “Buy” rating, increasing the target price from $130.00 to $184.00 on 13th November. Overall MMM ranks 1st on our list of the best conglomerate stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) stands against the other conglomerate stocks. As per Lloyd Capital, the new year starts on the back of economic resilience. Global conditions remain benign, courtesy of a healthy US economy, moderating inflation, and a gradual easing of global monetary policy. However, investors are required to remain cognizant of the several risks looming. Notably, governments worldwide have fueled economic activity in a way that has deteriorated fiscal positions. Also, inflation is yet to fully return to the respective targeted levels and the geopolitical situation remains uncertain. As per the investment management firm, investors are required to remain focused on analyzing the quality of the businesses they purchase and ensuring that these are done at prices offering an adequate margin of safety relative to intrinsic value. As per BofA's equity strategy team, led by Savita Subramanian, the S&P 500 index should reach 6,666 by 2025 end. Part of this growth is expected to stem from healthy economic growth. The investment firm's economics team expects that the US economy should grow at an annualized rate of 2.4% in 2025, higher than Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 2% growth. As a result, the firm has favored companies that are GDP-sensitive and is now going overweight on Financials, Consumer Discretionary, and Real Estate, among others. Bank of America went on to add that, in 2025, there will be a broadening out of the stock market rally from the "Mag 7" tech stocks to other 493 stocks of the S&P 500 Index. J.P. Morgan also has somewhat similar expectations. Let’s look at that in detail. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In. J.P. Morgan believes that equity earnings should broaden moving forward. Equity returns were dominated by "Mag 7" since the beginning of 2023. Over that period, the broader market (S&P 500 index) managed to return 62%, more than half of which was made by Magnificent 7 (delivering 242% over the same period). The strong returns have a solid backing as the Mag 7 were able to grow their earnings at 40%, and the remaining 493 stocks in the index were able to post 2%. However, J.P. Morgan expects that performance is expected to broaden in 2025 as the remaining "493 stocks" should be able to more than 5 times their earnings growth to 13% in 2025. Therefore, Wall Street analysts believe that investing in companies having a diversified presence should deliver healthy returns in contrast to pure-play (sector-specific) investments. The wealth management firm believes that reduced interest rates, renormalization of inventories and production, and easier comparables are expected to act as potential tailwinds for the cohort over the next year. Analysts are bullish on businesses with multiple revenue streams and one group that gives investors a diversification advantage is conglomerates. With this in mind, let us now have a look at the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. Our Methodology To list the 10 Best Conglomerate Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we used a screener and online rankings. After getting an initial list of 20-25 stocks, we selected the ones having high hedge fund holdings. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiments, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A shot of a commercial plane with a blur of color in the background, representing the production of auxiliary power units in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing powerhouse. Wall Street believes that Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s long-term growth should be driven by a commercial agreement with Bombardier, which is a leading manufacturer of business jets. This alliance includes using Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s avionics and engines in Bombardier's aircraft fleet, which should act as a significant opportunity. The agreement should generate ~$17 billion in lifetime revenue opportunities for Honeywell, further strengthening the potential long-term benefits of this alliance. These revenue opportunities indicate a promising growth trajectory for Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s aerospace segment. Apart from securing a steady revenue stream, it strengthens Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON)’s position as a leading supplier of avionics and engine technologies for business jets. The agreement should lead to higher market share and enhanced brand recognition in the business aviation segment. With Bombardier continuing to innovate and expand its product line, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) should benefit from the elevated demand for advanced avionics and propulsion systems. With the business jet market recovering and growing, Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) remains well-placed to capitalize on this trend, potentially resulting in sustained revenue growth and margin expansion in the aerospace segment. UBS Group reissued a “Buy” rating with a price target of $298.00 (up from $215.00) on the company’s shares on 13th November 2024. Overall HON ranks 2nd on our list of the best conglomerate stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of HON as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than HON but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Bitwise Strategist Juan Leon Calls Ethereum ($ETH) ‘The Comeback Kid of 2025’
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/why-bitwise-strategist-juan-leon-calls-ethereum-eth-the-comeback-kid-of-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T21:31:51Z
Full Content:
Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise Asset Management, believes Ethereum is primed for a significant resurgence in 2025. In a blog post published Dec. 17, Leon argues that Ethereum, despite being overshadowed in 2024, stands to gain tremendously from the $100 trillion market for real-world assets. Leon says that while Bitcoin and Solana dominated headlines this year, Ethereum remained largely overlooked. He points out that Bitcoin surged on the back of spot Bitcoin ETFs and historic capital inflows, posting a 130% year-to-date return, while Solana, buoyed by retail-driven meme coin speculation, delivered a 106% gain. In comparison, he says, Ethereum’s 66% year-to-date return seemed lackluster. However, Leon points to a pivotal shift occurring in recent weeks. According to Leon, over the past 10 days, spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted $2 billion in net inflows, a stark contrast to the $250 million recorded over the preceding four months. Leon attributes this to renewed investor confidence in Ethereum. Leon credits Ethereum’s role as the dominant platform for tokenizing real-world assets as a driving factor behind its comeback. He believes that tokenization—the process of digitizing traditional financial assets like Treasury bills and real estate—represents a massive opportunity. By enabling faster, cheaper and more efficient transactions on blockchain networks, Leon suggests tokenization could transform global financial markets. Leon emphasizes that this is not a distant concept but an active trend gaining momentum today. Major financial institutions such as BlackRock and UBS are already bringing tokenized real-world assets on-chain, spanning government securities, commodities, real estate and private equity. For instance, BlackRock operates a $578 million tokenized Treasury fund, and Leon predicts tokenized fund assets will triple in 2025, with Ethereum at the center of this expansion. Leon explains Ethereum’s dominance in this space by citing its unmatched security, decentralization and track record. He argues that since launching in 2015, Ethereum has established itself as the most trusted platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Leon adds that Ethereum holds 81% of the market share in tokenized assets, which makes it the platform most asset managers prefer to use. Leon describes Ethereum as a safe and reliable choice for developers and institutions due to its proven infrastructure and expansive validator network. This stability, he suggests, encourages confidence for those looking to move real-world assets onto blockchain rails. Leon underscores the enormous size of the real-world asset market, estimated at $100 trillion globally. While he notes that shifting these assets to blockchain platforms will take time, he predicts fees generated from tokenized real-world assets could eventually surpass $100 billion annually. This amount would be more than 40 times Ethereum’s current year-to-date fees of $2.4 billion. Leon adds that greater regulatory clarity—particularly with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that supports pro-crypto policies—could accelerate this shift. He believes favorable regulations would make Ethereum an attractive investment opportunity with substantial potential rewards. Leon identifies tokenization as one of the primary drivers of Ethereum’s resurgence. Combined with other growing trends, such as the increasing use of stablecoins and AI agents engaging in crypto transactions, Leon sees Ethereum’s central role in tokenizing real-world assets as a major opportunity for growth in 2025.

Title: Jim Cramer on NIKE, Inc. (NKE): ‘It’s Amazing How Much Damage The Previous CEO Did To This Once Unassailable Brand’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan for This Week: 8 Stocks in Focus. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, provided insights on Friday about this week's Federal Reserve meeting, key earnings reports, and the retail sales numbers due to be released. According to Cramer, the market is in a holding pattern at the moment, with investors growing increasingly uneasy. "When the market bides its time, guess what, people tend to get a little nervous," he remarked. “I think the Wall Street's gotten a little too negative frankly, as we get oversold and we're getting there. But I've been warning about stocks going to excessive levels for two weeks now, so I can't be all that positive until we see a couple days where bond yields actually go lower with the stock market.” Cramer pointed out that retail sales figures will be released on Tuesday, and although they are coming out just before the Fed's meeting, they will likely stir significant debate. This is especially true given the unusual timing of Black Friday this year, with a compressed shopping period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. He speculated that the bond market had a rough week, and if retail sales come in cooler than expected, it could provide a much-needed counterbalance, perhaps offering a potential buying opportunity after the Fed meeting. READ ALSO Jim Cramer Talked About These 6 Airline Stocks and Jim Cramer Discussed 18 Companies That Hit $100 Billion in Market Cap in 2024 Looking ahead to Wednesday, Cramer noted that the Federal Open Market Committee is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. While he cautioned that nothing is certain, he emphasized that numerous Fed officials have indicated that a rate reduction is likely. He added: “Every little signal from the Federal Reserve brings out predictions causing many people to sell good stocks when they are freaked out. You also have people who just can't let it go, dogs with bones. As soon as we get the Fed rate cut, well, guess what? They're immediately focused on the next cut. I think this is absurd.” Cramer clarified that while he does see the Fed as important, he believes investors should not get bogged down by every minor shift in central bank policy. He reminded viewers that the Fed operates based on data, not ideology. He acknowledged that there could be dissent within the Federal Open Market Committee, but he cautioned against making investment decisions solely based on what the Fed might do next. “Contrary to popular belief, there's more to investing than monetary policy and I wish everyone knew that. They don't.” Moving on to Friday, Cramer highlighted that the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation data would be released, offering the first look at the latest inflation numbers. “Finally, on Friday, we get our first look at the next set of inflation data, that's called the personal consumption expenditures number. Remember, my view is that we'll continue to get endless chatter about what the Fed might do or not. So if this number runs hot, you're gonna hear a lot of doomsaying, and why do I put it up there then? Well, because maybe it's a good opportunity to buy something on weakness because other people will be freaked out by what the doomsayers say.” In summary, Cramer believes we’re entering a seasonally strong period for stocks, though recent performance in some sectors has been underwhelming. He noted that while the Santa Claus rally typically provides a boost toward the end of the year, it’s important to wait for the Fed’s meeting to pass before making any significant moves. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 13. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 75 Cramer stated that NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has to introduce more innovation to stay competitive with its rivals. “After the close, we believe we're gonna get a revelatory report from Nike. Now, the new CEO Elliott Hill, he's an old Nike hand by the way, will have to lay out a story about how to reignite this brand globally, which is undersold from Adidas, Hoka, Deckers, Hoka of Deckers, and then On Holdings, which we've had on a bunch of times. I think Nike has to do more than just say it'll work harder with its partners. That's a hackneyed statement, doesn't hold any water with me anymore. The company needs to show innovation, dazzling innovation, the kind that makes us feel like fools for even thinking of abandoning Nike. It's amazing how much damage the previous CEO did to this once unassailable brand. It won't be undone easily and we'll need both, a roadmap with a line of sight to the end of the number cuts and a sense of newness.” NIKE (NYSE:NKE) designs, develops, markets, and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services, including performance gear for various sports activities. It has been facing challenges in managing the right balance between direct-to-consumer sales and its broader sales strategy. Company executives admitted that they overemphasized direct and online sales, which left the brand unprepared for the return of in-store shopping as pandemic lockdowns eased. As the company reduced sales through large retail partners and redirected inventory to its own channels, it experienced a significant drop in revenue. In fiscal Q1 of 2025, revenue fell by 10% year-over-year, with sales coming in below expectations. In October, Matthew Friend, chief financial officer, acknowledged that the company had made mistakes by focusing too heavily on direct sales and said teams were engaging closely with partners to address these issues. Additionally, in October, NIKE (NYSE:NKE) replaced its CEO with Elliott Hill, a long-time company veteran. Hill previously ran Nike's product and marketplace division. The upcoming fiscal Q2 2025 earnings call ought to provide further insights into the new strategic direction under Hill’s leadership. Overall NKE ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's game plan. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Wealth strategies that used to be reserved for billionaires are becoming more accessible
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/wealth-strategies-for-billionaires-are-becoming-more-accessible-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-17T19:17:32Z

Investing like a billionaire comes with a high price tag. But thanks to technology, the barriers to these elite opportunities are starting to crumble. Consider direct indexing, a strategy favored by the rich to lower taxes by selling underperforming stocks and using the losses to offset other gains. These personalized portfolios used to be out of reach of the merely affluent, requiring steep account minimums. Over the past five years, direct indexing has exploded as technological advancements have made it worthwhile for wealth managers to offer the services to Main Street customers. The account minimum for Fidelity's FidFolios, for example, is only $5,000. "Direct indexing has become accessible at a different level of wealth than it has been in the past," said Ranjit Kapila, the copresident and chief operating officer of Parametric. "That wouldn't have been available or possible without the technology trends we've had to be able to do this level of computation at scale in a cost-efficient manner." Parametric, the pioneer of direct indexing, is also moving downstream. By adopting fractional-share investing, Parametric lowered the minimum for its core product to $100,000 from $250,000. The firm plans to offer a direct-indexing product with fewer customization features for $25,000 in 2025. Private markets face steeper hurdles. This opaque field was traditionally reserved for deep-pocketed investors like pension funds and ultrarich individuals. But now investors have more access to financial results for funds and privately held companies as data providers race to meet their needs. Machine learning and AI have made it easier for these firms to extract and analyze data. BlackRock views this data as the great equalizer and has grand ambitions of indexing these opaque private markets. The asset-management giant agreed this summer to acquire the data powerhouse Preqin for $3.2 billion. "We anticipate indexes and data will be important to future drivers of the democratization of all alternatives," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on a conference call. "And this acquisition is the unlock." Leon Sinclair, Preqin's executive vice president, argued that with the number of public companies dwindling, it's imperative for mass-affluent investors to get better access to private markets. "Clearly there's more, deeper, better sources of funding for private companies that could stay private for longer," Sinclair said. "I think it's fair that the mass affluent can — in the right way — be brought along on that journey to get exposure to that part of the mosaic earlier." Kapila described these technological developments as part of a trend in wealth management to capture customers before they make it big. "There's a desire by financial advisors to try and engage investors earlier in their wealth-accumulation cycle," Kapila said. Parametric, acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2021, operates in a competitive arena. Thanks to a wave of similar acquisitions, Parametric faces well-capitalized rivals such as BlackRock's Aperio and Franklin Templeton's Canvas. Industry stalwarts like Fidelity and upstarts like Envestnet also want a piece of the action. Kapila said the need to compete on scale and fees required Parametric's technology to be as efficient as possible. "It'll be harder," he said. "We have to do many, many more accounts to really drive growth in assets, etc. But those challenges are exciting to me as a technologist." To meet that need, Kapila is pushing Parametric to develop more automated products, such as Radius, which launched this year. Radius constructs equity and fixed-income portfolios and runs simulations to identify the best selections for portfolio managers. He plans to launch more cloud-native tools, which are easier to scale and manage, for other asset classes in 2025 and 2026. Parametric is also piloting generative-AI tools to onboard accounts more efficiently. Clients' expectations are also rising. There's demand for Parametric's tax benefits but with actively managed strategies rather than indexes, he said, spurring partnerships with asset managers. Parametric recently launched an offering that allows customers to pick equities off strategies from the financial-advisory and asset-management firm Lazard. To stay ahead of the curve, Preqin is developing more sophisticated products. Last year, the UK firm launched an Actionability Signal that uses machine learning to identify private companies likely to be open for investment. "The sole focus on public information for certain tasks around valuation and risk management are not really going to be the way that people do this," Sinclair said. "We're moving much more to a world where real proprietary private information at the asset level, which is transactionally oriented, is available to people." In June, his division launched a data tool that analyzes $4.8 trillion worth of deals across 6,500 funds. This database can be used in a slew of ways, from backing up valuations in negotiations to identifying which financial factors, such as revenue growth or debt paydown, contributed the most value to a successful deal. With the rise of generative AI, Sinclair expects that users will be able to interpret data with more ease using natural language commands. "I think you'll see that be more prominent across the industry where people expect to interact with large data sets in really natural common ways," he said. "We think all that will probably start to be visible over the coming years." On average, retail investors allocate just 5% of their portfolios to alternative investments. If BlackRock successfully indexes private markets, it could go a long way toward boosting that percentage. However, Sinclair said more work is required to help mass affluent investors feel comfortable investing in private markets. As someone who grew up working class and was only introduced to finance in college, he knows there is an education gap to overcome. "To get Joe Bloggs very excited and comfortable with committing capital, they need to be able to understand what the different basis of those returns are," Sinclair said. He added: "I think it's in the industry's interest to enable those new sources of capital, to bridge the gap in understanding, to bridge the gap in analytics, to bridge the gap in frequency of reporting, to make that an easier journey for people to go on."

Title: Bitwise predicts Ethereum revival in 2025 driven by institutional interest, RWA growth

Bitwise investment strategist estimates that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on Ethereum could ultimately surpass $100 billion annually. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Ethereum (ETH) is poised for a resurgence in 2025 as it rides a wave of emerging trends to capitalize on a $100 trillion opportunity in tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), according to a letter shared with investors by Bitwise’s senior investment strategist, Juan Leon. The document highlighted that the crypto market was marked by two narratives this year: Bitcoin’s (BTC) new all-time high, driven by spot exchange-traded funds (ETF) approval in the US, and Solana’s (SOL) meteoric popularity as retail investors piled into memecoin speculation. As a result, Ethereum’s 66% year-to-date return paled when compared to BTC’s 130% gain and SOL’s 106% rally. However, recent signs suggest a reversal of sentiment. Over the past 10 days, Ethereum ETFs have attracted a staggering $2 billion in net inflows, eight times the $250 million net inflows recorded in the preceding four months. On Dec. 5, data from Farside Investors pointed out that the spot Ethereum ETFs traded in the US registered $428.5 million in inflows, a new daily record propelled by $292.7 million directed at BlackRock’s ETHA. Moreover, Ethereum ETFs saw less than three-digit daily inflows in only 3 out of the 10 past trading days saw inflows. This surge indicates that institutional and retail investors are warming up to Ethereum again. The tokenization of real-world assets might be the fuel for Ethereum’s resurgence. This process involves digitizing traditional assets — such as Treasury bills, real estate, and commodities — into blockchain-based tokens, offering faster, cheaper, and more efficient trading and settlement. Tokenization is no longer a far-off dream. Major players like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and UBS have adopted blockchain technology to tokenize RWAs. BlackRock’s tokenized treasury fund, BUIDL, currently has a market cap of $544 million. According to the letter, real-world assets are valued at roughly $100 trillion globally, creating a staggering opportunity. While it could take decades for significant portions of this market to shift to blockchain rails, Leon sees immense potential upside. Considering that Ethereum holds 81% of the RWA market, Leon estimates that fees generated from RWA-linked activity on Ethereum could ultimately surpass $100 billion annually, more than 40 times the network’s $2.4 billion in fees year-to-date. The letter attributes Ethereum’s dominance to its status as the most reliable and decentralized smart contract platform, secured by its long history of supporting decentralized applications and its vast distributed validator network. As the world’s largest asset managers explore tokenized assets, Ethereum remains the “battle-tested” standard. Furthermore, regulatory tailwinds could accelerate this transformation, setting Ethereum for potentially explosive growth. The letter noted that an increasingly pro-crypto U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may provide much-needed clarity, removing barriers to adoption and institutional participation.

Management and staff representatives at the Becton Dickenson (BD) plant in Drogheda have reached agreement on redundancy terms more than five months after it was announced the facility is to close. The final deal is understood to provide for staff to receive six weeks of pay per year of service capped at two years’ pay in addition to their statutory entitlements. There are also to be service recognition payments of €3,000 per year for those working for the company for more than 17⅓ years as well as payments to cover the loss of benefits like health insurance and orderly wind down payments linked to productivity. Almost 200 people currently work at the plant which opened in 1964. The decision to close it was taken by the company after an international supply chain review. About 110 people will leave in March of next year with the rest staying on until the scheduled closure in September 2026. Plant manager Catherina McGuirk said the decision to close had been “extremely difficult” but that “the agreement recognises the commitment and hard work that every employee has given to BD over the years and gives our employees the clarity they need to plan for the future as we all move forward.” She said that with agreement now in place, the company would seek to take steps to ensure it leaves a last positive legacy in Drogheda. Mike Fairbourn, BD’s general manager across the UK and Ireland said the company would work with government agencies and others to seek a new owner for the plant. “I am very aware of the impact this has had on our employees and the local community,” he said. “This is why BD has committed to work collaboratively with the IDA and local officials to secure a new owner for the facility. This would mean that the site can remain as a contributor to Drogheda’s economic growth, as well as a potential source of employment. Siptu sector organiser, Andrea Cleere, welcomed the agreement with the company which was reached after talks between management, unions and other staff representatives at the Workplace Relations Commission. “The acceptance by our members of these redundancy terms has brought clarity concerning the conclusion of their employment with Becton Dickinson and will now allow them to plan for their future,” she said. She said some of those scheduled to leave in March had already secured new employment to commence in the period afterwards. The medical devices multinational continues to operate other facilities at Enniscorthy, Limerick and Blackrock in Dublin.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch: Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other top AI stocks to watch. Former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever recently claimed that a major change is on the horizon of artificial intelligence. Accepting a "Test Of Time" award for his 2014 paper with Oriol Vinyals and Quoc Le on Friday, December 13, he claimed that reasoning capabilities will make the technology far less predictable. He discussed how an idea his team had explored a decade ago regarding scaling data to new heights for pre-training AI systems, has begun to reach its limits. As such, more data and computing power had resulted in ChatGPT which OpenAI launched in 2022. "But pre-training as we know it will unquestionably end. While compute is growing, the data is not growing, because we have but one internet”. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Investors Shouldn’t Miss and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm Speaking of its limits, Sutskever also proposed some ways of breaking new ground, such as technology itself generating new data, or AI models evaluating multiple answers before choosing the best response for a user, to improve accuracy. He further went on to predict a future of super-intelligent, self-aware AI capable of reasoning like humans, forecasting that the long-awaited AI agents will eventually become a reality in this advanced era. As such, AI leaders are now hinting that the generative AI revolution is entering a new phase, with advanced foundation models poised to bring reasoning and long-term thinking to AI capabilities. “We’re in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we’re at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking.” Long thinking enables AI models to take more time to “think over” the results they generate for us, and are an effort to bring AI into System 2. System 2, a term popularized by Daniel Kahneman in his book “Thinking, Fast and Slow”, represents a mode of thinking that is slow, deliberate, analytical, and demanding conscious effort. As these capabilities develop further, AI is expected to move beyond its current applications in different sectors to intensely impact fields like medicine, research, and education, as evidenced by OpenAI’s recent advancements and their practical benefits in accelerating scientific discovery. “We’re going to have AI systems that can talk more fluently with us, that can also visualize the real world. And this combination of reasoning and multimodal capabilities, I think, is going to enable us to build more powerful agentic applications next year.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer service team in an office setting using the company's Customer 360 platform to communicate with customers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116 Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud-based CRM company that has gained significant traction after the launch of its AI-powered platform called Agentforce. On December 12, Macquarie analyst Steve Koenig initiated coverage of Salesforce with a “Neutral” rating and a $370 price target. The analyst told investors in a research note that Salesforce CEO and founder Marc Benioff is aiming to position the company as a “digital labor” pioneer with the new Agentforce product. The move strives to target growth as share gains stall and the company faces slowing momentum. Even though there is excitement and interest around Agentforce, there may be some challenges, the analyst noted. In particular, the consumption-based pricing model of Gen AI functionality could disrupt Salesforce's current seat-based revenue model. In addition, Salesforce’s sequential revenue additions have been declining for three years, a key concern for the firm. As such, meeting market expectations requires a turnaround. Overall, CRM ranks 3rd on our list of top 10 AI Stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of CRM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

iStockphoto The recent series of UFO and drone sightings across the United States, especially in the Northeast, has law enforcement and American citizens on high alert. That includes the New York Police Department (NYPD), which recently experienced their own strange story involving a large, mysterious drone. According to a New York Post report and a video shared on social media, the New York Police Department came into possession of this large, mysterious drone after an email tip. The drone, which appears to measure approximately six-feet in diameter, was reportedly discovered by the NYPD on the sidewalk at Fifth Street between Market Street and Morris Avenue in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. As officers were investigating, a passer-by said he worked in the building that houses the headquarters of the drone’s manufacturer — which he identified as Amogy Inc., a sustainable energy startup working to use ammonia as a renewable fuel source, including for aerial vehicles. Amogy CEO Seonghoon Woo would later tell police, according to New York Post sources, that the drone was owned by his company. He also reportedly claimed that the drone was inoperable and had been placed on the sidewalk after a company party about a month ago. An Amogy spokesperson told the New York Post that the drone was used in a demonstration of its clean energy technology three years ago. The spokesperson also added, “NYPD took possession of it for a brief period. Amogy cooperated fully with NYPD and the drone has since been returned to the company after NYPD determined the drone was not a threat.” According to the X (Twitter) account, @ShadowofEzra, BlackRock – the world’s largest asset manager – is one of Amogy’s investors. Other investors in the research and product development company include Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, AP Ventures, SK Innovation, and Aramco Ventures.

You can’t make this stuff up.” “I wouldn’t be surprised if these are Chinese spy craft like the spy balloon a couple years ago which the Biden administration at first denied even existing, then said it posed no threat and finally admitted what it was before a symbolic destruction of it after it had fully completed its mission of collecting and electronically sending photos and data back to Beijing,” another person commented. “‘Hey, let’s just throw a commercial drone in the street to make people believe that they aren’t the government’s drones they’re seeing. We’ll let someone find it and then have the police take pictures with it thinking they’ve cracked the mystery,'” someone else wrote on X sarcastically. “Not one single person believes this was left on a sidewalk a month ago. NOT ONE!” read another comment.

Title: Indiana Fund Narrows Finalists to Replace BlackRock

The Indiana Public Retirement System has identified State Street, Northern Trust and UBS Asset Management as potential replacements for BlackRock as manager of a $969 million global fixed-income portfolio, INPRS staff said during a December 13 board meeting. Indiana law, passed in May, requires state pension funds to replace a manager or service provider if the firm is determined to have made “ESG commitments,” defined as actions taken or factors considered “with the nonfinancial purpose” related to environmental, social or governance issues. If a manager or service provider is determined to have made an ESG commitment, then the board of INPRS must replace them with a comparable firm if one is available. If there is at least one service provider expected to be materially equivalent or materially better financially for the system, then the comparable firm must be chosen. On June 21, Indiana State Treasurer Dan Elliott determined that BlackRock Inc. was engaged in an ESG commitment, citing BlackRock’s Form 10-K filing that referenced ESG risks and the firm’s status as a signatory to the Net Zero Asset Management Initiative, a group of 325 managers representing $57.5 trillion in assets that support investing aligned to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Want the latest institutional investment industry news and insights? Sign up for CIO newsletters.  Following the treasurer’s finding, INPRS issued on June 28 a request for proposals for potential replacements. The BlackRock portfolio eligible for replacement is a passive global inflation-linked bond portfolio. “It’s a portfolio that, frankly, in my opinion, is not even ESG-related, because it’s a global fixed-income portfolio,” said one INPRS staff member in the December 13 meeting. INPRS staff and the fund’s investment consultant, Verus, determined State Street, UBS and Northern Trust to be comparable to BlackRock, following the RFP process. “They all have over $1 trillion in assets, [and] they all have passive fixed-income assets greater than $90 billion,” an INPRS staff member said in the meeting. Like BlackRock, State Street, Northern Trust and UBS are all members of the Net Zero Asset Owner Initiative. Firms like State Street have also been placed on watchlists and have been scrutinized for ESG commitments. The board of INPRS made a unanimous decision to confirm those three firms as comparable vendors. A provider selection is due within 180 days of the RFP, which puts the deadline as December 25. INPRS staff at the board meeting noted that there were no concerns with BlackRock’s investment performance, but BlackRock’s status as engaged in an ESG commitment dictated the change. “We’re proud of having helped hundreds of thousands of Indianans invest and retire with dignity. Despite this decision, we remain committed to Indiana and the $102 billion we have invested in the state on behalf of our clients,” a spokesperson for BlackRock said in a statement. INPRS manages $46 billion in assets for more than 529,000 beneficiaries.

By way of example, Microsoft and BlackRock have created a $30 billion fund to support new data centers and energy infrastructure for the burgeoning AI boom, and Meta is planning a new $10 billion subsea cable that will span the entire globe. Google, for its part, recently announced Umoja, the first subsea fiber-optic cable to connect Africa and Australia — and it’s joining a $90 million funding round into Cassava Technologies, one of the partner companies involved in the Umoja project. With its first African data center operational for a year, among other infrastructure projects such as the Equiano subsea cable, Google confirmed to TechCrunch that it’s now taking a direct equity stake in Cassava, though it didn’t provide comment on the rationale behind the investment. However, it’s clear that it’s looking to improve infrastructure across the continent. Indeed, Africa has been hit by widespread outages throughout 2024, which have been attributed to faulty undersea cables, so it makes sense that Google would want to fund efforts to bolster connectivity for consumers and businesses that might want to use its services. Cassava announced $310 million in funding overall, though $220 million of that is in the form of a credit facility for one of its subsidiaries. The $90 million equity tranche included investments from the U.S. federal government’s International Development Finance Corporation (DFC); Finnish development finance company Finnfund; and Google itself. The funding will help Cassava: “… strengthen its balance sheet, drive sustainable profitable growth, and cement its position as a global technology company of African heritage,” according to a press release that also detailed a broader reorganization of the company. “It’s a pivotal milestone that we expect to unlock immense value and catalyze the further expansion of our digital infrastructure and services to bridge the digital divide on the continent,” Cassava CEO and President Hardy Pemhiwa (pictured above) said. African telecommunication company Econet spun out Cassava in 2021, serving as a standalone business for Econet’s various digital services and infrastructure initiatives spanning data centers, fiber broadband networks, renewable energy, cloud, cybersecurity, and more. Although Africa is a major focal point for Cassava, it also operates across other “key growth markets” including the Middle East, India, and Latin America. Among its business units is Liquid Intelligent Technologies, which worked with Google to build the terrestrial segment of Umoja; the cable starts in Kenya, and snakes through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, before concluding its land journey in South Africa. Separately, another of Cassava’s business units, Liquid C2, this year announced a partnership with Google and Anthropic to bring “advanced cloud, cybersecurity solutions, and generative AI” services to companies across Africa. This constituted part of Google’s previous commitment to invest $1 billion in Africa’s digital economy. “Businesses are increasingly turning to generative AI to drive operational efficiencies, improve the customer experience, and empower their employees like never before,” Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said of its partnership with Liquid C2 at the time. “This partnership has the opportunity to transform how African businesses serve and engage their customers as we provide them a foundation for innovation.” Topics Senior Reporter Perplexity acquires Carbon to connect AI search to your work files Microsoft bought nearly 500K Nvidia Hopper chips this year OpenAI brings ChatGPT to your landline GitHub launches a free version of its Copilot ‘It’s dumb to IPO this year’: Databricks CEO explains why he’s waiting to go public A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs This fintech processed $1B in payments through word-of-mouth Subscribe for the industry’s biggest tech news Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch’s coverage.

Title: DeFi Meets Traditional Finance: Zoth and Singularity Finance's New Treasury Management Solution | HackerNoon

Zoth and Singularity Finance announced their collaboration on December 17, 2024, launching ZTLN Prime (ZTLN-P), a tokenized investment product that bridges traditional finance with blockchain technology. The product aims to provide institutional investors with access to U.S. Treasury ETFs and money market funds through blockchain infrastructure. ZTLN-P represents a shift in how institutions can manage treasury assets, combining traditional financial instruments with digital asset technology. The product is backed by Blackrock-managed iShares ETFs and money market funds, focusing on U.S. Treasury bills, which provides a foundation for stable returns in the digital asset space. The partnership leverages Singularity Finance's tokenization framework and Zoth's experience in bringing traditional financial instruments to blockchain networks. This combination addresses several key challenges in the digital asset space, particularly around regulatory compliance and liquidity management. The regulatory framework supporting ZTLN-P includes oversight from the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) and adherence to the Mutual Funds Act (2021 Revision). This regulatory structure provides institutional investors with familiar compliance frameworks while operating in the digital asset space. Doo Group serves as the custodian for the underlying assets, adding another layer of institutional infrastructure to the product. This custody arrangement demonstrates the project's focus on establishing traditional financial safeguards within the digital asset ecosystem. The significance of this launch extends beyond the immediate product offering. It represents a growing trend of bringing traditional financial instruments into the blockchain space, potentially opening new paths for institutional adoption of digital asset technology. Pritam Dutta, CEO of Zoth, emphasized the product's focus on institutional-grade investments, noting how it combines traditional treasury instruments with blockchain efficiency. Mario Casiraghi, Co-founder of SingularityDAO and Singularity Finance, highlighted the product's role in bridging traditional and decentralized finance. The launch also showcases Singularity Finance's broader strategy in the real-world asset (RWA) space. Cloris Chen, CEO at Singularity Finance, explained how ZTLN Prime fits into their ecosystem development plans, particularly in creating infrastructure for RWA projects. This development comes at a time when institutional interest in digital assets continues to evolve, with a growing focus on products that combine traditional financial stability with blockchain technology's efficiency. The partnership between Zoth and Singularity Finance demonstrates how companies are working to meet this institutional demand. Looking ahead, this collaboration could influence how other companies approach the integration of traditional financial products with blockchain technology. The focus on regulatory compliance, institutional-grade custody solutions, and traditional asset backing might set precedents for future developments in the space. The launch of ZTLN Prime also reflects the broader evolution of the digital asset industry, as it moves toward products that cater to institutional requirements while maintaining the benefits of blockchain technology. This balance between innovation and institutional standards could prove crucial for the industry's continued development. For institutional investors, ZTLN Prime offers a new option for treasury management that combines familiar assets with new technology. The product's structure suggests a potential template for future institutional-focused digital asset products, particularly in how they approach asset backing, regulatory compliance, and risk management. This development indicates a maturing digital asset ecosystem, where traditional financial products and blockchain technology can coexist within regulatory frameworks, potentially opening new opportunities for institutional participation in the digital asset space.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold Bitcoin?

Bitcoin logo is seen in this illustration photo taken in Warsaw, Poland on 05 December, 2024. ... [+] (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The price of Bitcoin cryptocurrency (BTC) is likely headed to new highs in 2025 after surging nearly 150% in 2024. Currently trading at nearly $104,000, Bitcoin has eclipsed AI superstar Nvidia in the last 6 months with >55% returns while Nvidia stock barely moved (Sell Nvidia, Buy Intel Stock?). There are reasons to be excited about Bitcoin going into next year considering the political, administrative and market developments. Cryptocurrency has traditionally been regarded as a “speculative” asset with no real contribution to the economy. However, it’s hard to ignore its growing legitimacy, increased adoption, and demand. But, other opportunities exist, too. Up 40% in a week? See What’s Happening With Broadcom Stock? The OG cryptocurrency crossed $100,000 mark for the first time riding on support from the Donald Trump-led administration. In addition to a shift in regulatory view, notable institution adoption, broader ecosystem developments, limited availability, and global macroeconomic uncertainty could put Bitcoin above $150,000 by the end of 2025. But Bitcoin’s rise hasn’t been without its risks and accompanying volatility. If you want upside with a smoother ride than crypto, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Donald Trump’s evolving stance on Cryptocurrency bodes well for Bitcoin’s future. His view toward creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and a need for favorable cryptocurrency regulations, is re-vitalizing confidence in the Cryptocurrency. One item on Trump’s presidential campaign agenda was to create a strategic reserve for Bitcoin. While it’s still far from materializing, a concrete bill has already been proposed in the Senate. If passed, it would entitle the Treasury and the Fed to build a reserve of about 5% of the global Bitcoin supply within five years with the purpose of hedging against currency risk, lowering national debt, and supporting the country’s balance sheet. Historically skeptic SEC chair, Gary Gensler, has already decided to step down, which will likely pave the way for crypto-friendly regulations going forward. Moreover, Donald Trump’s team is contemplating creating a dedicated position in the White House to oversee and drive the blockchain ecosystem. These developments will likely work to mitigate risks of investing in a speculative asset, inviting more players into the market - and this is already happening. See What’s Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Growing Institutional investor interest toward Bitcoin is very clear. Bitcoin ETFs have been the most popular in 2024 – a year that saw record new ETF launches. Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has already amassed AUM of $45bn + since its launch in January 2024. As of August 2024, Private Companies and ETFs controlled over 1.2 million units of Bitcoins representing 6.29% of the total supply of Bitcoins. In addition, the cryptocurrency’s holdings of publicly traded companies rose almost 200% year-on-year to ~$20 billion, as of mid-2024. Amid the prevailing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, Bitcoin is emerging as a lucrative investment option and a hedge against crashing fiat currencies especially in hyperinflationary environments such as in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Lebanon. In 2023, Bitcoins made up 9% of Venezuela’s remittances, with crypto adoption further picking up amid oil sanctions. Bitcoin can emerge as a viable hedging instrument for governments as well, with a possibility of central banks diversifying their asset pool with Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies. The U.S. and China are already headed that way with other countries likely to follow suit. The price surge is likely to get a boost from fixed supply and growing demand. This “scarcity” sets Bitcoins apart from conventional fiat currencies. There are only about 21 million coins in existence today, which is essentially all the bitcoins that have been mined. The rate at which new coins are mined drops around the halving events that happen every four years, with the most recent one in April 2024. When the reward to mine new Bitcoin is halved, fewer new coins are mined and added to the pool, thus limiting the supply and driving up prices. In fact, historical trends around halving events have shown a subsequent rise in Bitcoin prices. This year, the price has gone up over 50% since April. Back in April 2020, the price jumped 10x in the one year that followed. Though all the increase cannot be attributed to halving alone, its role is consequential. Since Bitcoin arguably still lacks any intrinsic value, it is susceptible to market sentiment which makes its price volatile. Three years ago, Bitcoin dropped almost 50% twice. First from March 2021 to June 21, and again from Nov 2021 to Jan 2022. Besides, with limited supply of units, the price is potentially open to manipulation by large institutional investors. Cybersecurity threats to stored bitcoins, and potential environmental impact related restrictions also add to the risks involved in this asset class. There have been numerous periods - such as 2018 and 2022 when bitcoin could not beat the S&P 500. In fact, consistently beating the broader markets — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks and even cryptocurrencies. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: 'Most clients are probably out of balance': BlackRock's stock chief says investors should consider this portfolio change in 2025
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-portfolio-unbalanced-index-growth-value-investing-blackrock-inflation-diversification-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-17T15:06:28Z

Buying an S&P 500 index fund has long been considered an easy way to gain broad market exposure and diversification. But these days, this is increasingly not the case, warns Tony DeSpirito, BlackRock's chief investment officer for US fundamental active equity and the lead portfolio manager of the BlackRock Equity Dividend portfolios. In the past, the largest sector in the S&P 500 has typically made up less than 20% of the index. Post-pandemic, that's changed as Big Tech companies' share prices have taken off. As the largest names in the index continue to grow in market capitalization, they've brought the index along with them and driven much of the overall market returns. These high concentration levels leave investors vulnerable to market fluctuations and risks such as a potential resurgence in inflation, which has historically hurt growth names, according to DeSpirito. "Most clients are probably out of balance. They've gotten growth tilted," DeSpirito told BI. "There's an opportunity to supplement it with value," he added. DeSpirito believes it would serve investors well to take a step back from growth and increase their allocation to value stocks in 2025. With flashy, fast-growing companies like the Magnificent Seven taking the spotlight in recent years, it's not hard to see why value has been pushed aside. Today's investors are hungry for growth stocks, which typically increase their profits at a quicker clip than value stocks, or those that trade at a lower price than intrinsic value and are priced below their peers. But investors who aren't actively seeking growth are still overexposed to it. Even before the Magnificent Seven's run-up, the stock market had been tilting towards growth for the last decade, as low interest rates made it more attractive for investors to bet on less-established stocks, according to Björn Jesch, chief investment officer of the asset manager DWS. These factors have created a highly concentrated market dominated by the technology sector, DeSpirito said. As a result, when investors buy the S&P 500 index, they become overexposed to growth by default. DeSpirito sees two main reasons why investors should start shifting away from growth. Concentration risk and persistent inflation significantly shaped markets in 2024, and DeSpirito believes they'll continue to do so in 2025. That's where value investing comes in, he said, as value stocks provide diversification on both fronts. Market concentration is at an all-time high, surpassing dot-com bubble levels by many measures. Today, the movements of just a few stocks — for example, Nvidia — can disproportionately impact the rest of the market. Exposure to value stocks can reduce that volatility and ensure that your portfolio performance isn't at the mercy of a single stock or sector: "Value stocks look a lot different from the Magnificent Seven," DeSpirito said. Historically, it's not been sustainable for market concentration to remain elevated for extended periods of time. Expect more stocks to contribute to the overall gains of the S&P 500 in 2025, DeSpirito predicted. Investors who diversify and add value stocks to their portfolio will benefit from the market broadening out beyond the Big Tech names. DeSpirito added that value stocks also have an impressive track record during inflationary periods. On the other hand, high valuation multiples tend to decline in response to elevated inflation, meaning that expensively priced growth stocks are more sensitive to inflation. Just look at 2022, when inflation surged to over 9% and central banks began to raise interest rates. The MSCI World Growth Index, which tracks large and mid-cap growth stocks, dropped almost 30% over the course of 2022, while the MSCI World Value Index only declined around 6% in the same time period. Investors looking to get exposure to value might decide to buy a broad value index, but DeSpirito cautions against that. The S&P 500 isn't the only index that's gotten growth-heavy: "Even when I look at value indices, they too have shifted more towards growth," DeSpirito said. "You really need to find an active manager who stuck to their value discipline," DeSpirito added. Investors can also take a sector approach to diversifying with value. "Value stocks are mainly found in the financial, healthcare, industrial, and energy sectors. Growth stocks are mainly found in the technology, consumer discretionary, and communication services sectors," Jesch wrote in a recent note. Examples of actively managed value funds include the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), which DeSpirito manages, the T. Rowe Price Value ETF (TVAL), and the Avantis US Large Cap Value ETF (AVLV). Jump to

Title: 6 unique ways we advanced energy solutions in 2024

[[read-time]] min read Highlighting some of the steps we took to build a smarter energy future this year. Demand for electricity is rising across the world, driven by the rapid growth of manufacturing and AI, electrification of buildings and transportation, and the ongoing digitalization of our economy and society. Meeting this growing demand is one of the key challenges of our time and an enormous opportunity to build a smarter energy system that benefits people everywhere. This year, we pursued a range of actions to procure more energy and drive new technological and market innovations — all with the aim of driving the systems change needed to meet growing electricity demand affordably, sustainably and reliably. Here are six unique ways ways we made progress in 2024: Operating on carbon-free energy every hour of the day requires technologies like geothermal and nuclear power that can fill gaps in wind and solar generation. But these technologies are often costly and existing markets do not incentivize their development. That’s why we partnered with NV Energy to propose a new clean transition rate that brings corporate buyers and utilities together to unlock new investments. This will make it easier to develop projects that deliver “clean, firm” capacity to the grid while ensuring their costs aren’t passed along to other electricity consumers. This model can be replicated in additional markets, starting with Duke Energy, where we signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to explore the development of a similar rate structure in their service territory. Bringing new clean energy online is particularly challenging in the Asia Pacific region, where wind and solar resources are not readily available in many markets. In addition to announcing long-term agreements for new clean energy capacity in the region, we partnered with BlackRock to develop a 1 GW pipeline of new solar capacity in Taiwan. Our investment in solar developer New Green Power will help meet Google’s electricity demand in Taiwan and allow us to offer some of this new capacity to our semiconductor suppliers and equipment manufacturers in the region. Through these nine projects in five countries across the region, this year we're proving it’s possible to turn challenges into opportunities in Asia Pacific. In addition to creating new mechanisms to accelerate advanced clean energy technologies, we are also supporting the companies developing these technologies and bringing them to market. Our new, first-of-its-kind partnership with Kairos Power will unlock up to 500 MW of new, clean power from a series of small modular nuclear reactors. Kairos Power’s passively safe system and iterative development approach will help bring down costs and ensure more communities can benefit from clean, reliable nuclear power. No company alone can advance new clean energy technologies at the speed and scale required to decarbonize global electricity systems. That’s why we launched a new initiative with Microsoft and Nucor to aggregate our demand for advanced, clean technologies like enhanced geothermal, long-duration energy storage, clean hydrogen, and advanced nuclear. These technologies are critical to achieving fully decarbonized, reliable electricity grids, but their early stage development requires significant upfront investment. By working together, large clean energy buyers can accelerate the investments and market innovations needed to scale these essential technologies. This year, we upscaled our first-of-its-kind process that dramatically accelerates the execution of power purchase agreements (PPAs) with clean energy developers. The results since we started using this process have been meaningful: we’ve signed contracts to purchase over 3.3 GW of new clean energy generation capacity across North America and Europe and we’ve cut the time required to negotiate and execute these PPAs by roughly 80%. We recently unveiled a novel strategic partnership with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate to co-locate data centers with new clean energy in the U.S. By thoughtfully building data center load next to new additional power generation where possible, we’ll reduce both the timeline to operation and the amount of new transmission required. This model is an important complement to efforts to unlock development of new transmission infrastructure and optimize utilization of the existing grid. While the diverse range of actions we’ve taken this year have helped advance the next generation of energy solutions, there’s much more to be done. As we build on this year’s momentum in the years to come, we will continue to refine our approach and push for the innovations needed to create more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy systems.

Title: America Vs. The World? Both Can Win With These 8%+ Dividends

A detailed view of the earth from space with night lights It looks like 2024 will end with a big gain for investors in US stocks, with the S&P 500 up 28% year-to-date, even better than my (admittedly optimistic) expectations: I saw a roughly 15% gain for the S&P 500 going into the year. If this gain holds, 2024 will go down as one of the best years in the last 20, with only 2013 and 2019 doing (just slightly) better. However, unlike those years, the momentum isn’t coming mainly from tech, with the benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) actually trailing the market, with a 24.5% return year-to-date, as of this writing. That’s a good sign because it suggests that AI darlings like NVIDIA (NVDA) aren’t driving the market to irrational heights. Instead, this looks like a strong fundamental recovery after 2022’s selloff. Since that selloff was mainly driven by speculation about a recession that never happened, the 2024 bounce makes sense. Still, if you’re mainly holding US stocks, you might be wondering if, after all these gains, now is a good time to focus more on foreign shares. We actually discussed one strategy for doing so through our favorite closed-end funds (CEFs) in last Thursday’s article. The chart below lends weight to this idea. Look at how the benchmark S&P 500 index fund (in purple) has done compared to the iShares Core MSCI Total International Stock ETF (IXUS), in orange. IXUS tracks global stocks, excluding the US: IXUS Total Returns Global stocks’ lag suggests it’s a good time to go into them. Problem is, this could be said for just about any given time since IXUS’s IPO over a decade ago. The fund (in orange below) has badly trailed the S&P 500 ever since. SPY Outperforms The reason behind this gap makes sense if you think about it: US companies are generally more profitable than their overseas cousins and, as a result, have attracted higher prices. This isn’t a 2024 story—it goes back nearly half a century, as this chart from Goldman Sachs shows. US Stocks Soar The takeaway here is that foreign stocks—at least if they’re bought individually or through an ETF—are at best a short-term investment. But the calculus changes somewhat when you buy them through a CEF, due to two things: When an international CEF trades at a deep enough discount, we can ride that discount as it closes, propelling the fund’s price along with it. And we’ll collect those high dividends as that happens. We can see that in the BlackRock Enhanced International Dividend Trust (BGY), a holding in our CEF Insider service that we also discussed in last Thursday’s article. Since the start of 2024, BGY’s discount has shrunk from around 15% to 9% as I write this, helping drive a 13.5% total return. And with BGY yielding 9.1% now, thanks in part to a recently announced dividend hike, most of this return has come as dividend cash. So with discounted CEFs like BGY, then, buying international can make some sense, since you can get these funds’ assets at a discount and collect their outsized income streams while you wait for that discount to disappear. (Though we still have to be careful given global stocks’ long-term underperformance—with BGY’s discount narrowing, we are moving closer to shifting it to a “hold” form a “buy” in our portfolio. Then perhaps we’ll sell and take profits). That closing discount gives a fund like BGY a big advantage over an international ETF like the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA), which doesn’t get the “discount booster” a marked-down CEF does—and saddles us with a mere 2.9% dividend. We can see the difference these things make when we stack up the year-to-date total return of our CEF, BGY (in orange), with EFA (in purple). BGY Outperforms But our international-CEF exception aside, we continue to focus mainly on US-based stocks (and US-based CEFs) in CEF Insider. We can see why in the performance of the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), a holding in our portfolio that’s topped the S&P 500 with a 30.6% year-to-date return. The fund holds many US blue chips we all know well: Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Visa (V) among them. It trades at an 11.4% discount. The best part? Nearly half of the fund’s return came as dividends, thanks to ADX’s high yield: 8.1% as I write this. This is not easy for ADX’s management, investing as they are in a relatively volatile asset class, because they need to maintain a high cash outflow while still staying in the market. But ADX has a long history of sending high payouts to investors—and a long history in general: the fund was founded back in 1929. The bottom line? For income and for long-term performance, ADX is a clear winner. And second, any long-term investment outside the US should be handled with care and generally shorter term, with deep-discounted, and high-yielding, CEFs playing a role.

Investing.com -- Billionaire dealmaker Michael Rees is exploring the possibility of merging three to five firms from Blue Owl's portfolio to create a major player in the industry, according to the Financial Times, citing four sources privy to the matter. The proposed combination would encompass a range of sectors, including private equity buyouts, credit-based investments, infrastructure deals, and real estate. Blue Owl was established in 2021 through the merger of Dyal Capital, a firm founded by Rees, with credit investor Owl Rock Capital (NYSE:OBDC) and a public Spac during the boom. It owns stakes in private infrastructure groups such as Stonepeak and I Squared Capital, as well as firms with large infrastructure-like portfolios like Bridgepoint. Blue Owl also holds minority stakes in Vista Equity Partners, Silver Lake, HIG Capital, Platinum Equity, Cerberus, and Clearlake Capital among others. The firm would not be involved in any potential merger. While Rees's proposal is still in its nascent stages, it highlights the ongoing consolidation in the alternative investment market. Top dealmakers in the industry are being compelled to decide whether to remain private and focus on a few core strengths or join larger publicly listed financial groups. Last week's $12 billion acquisition of credit manager HPS by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), a company in Blue Owl's portfolio, has prompted many firms to reconsider their strategies. There's a growing concern among executives that the industry's influence will increasingly be controlled by a few diversified entities capable of attracting new capital from sources ranging from large sovereign wealth funds to individual investors and potentially even retirement savers. In October, Goldman Sachs executive Michael Brandmeyer cautioned that many independent private equity groups were underestimating the influx of cash to larger players and the challenges arising from succession processes. He referred to these groups as "zombie firms," stating that they were unaware they were investing their last funds. Despite the ongoing disruption in the private equity industry, advisors have noted that deal discussions rarely result in transactions due to concerns about conflicting strategies and personalities. As one private capital executive close to Blue Owl puts it, the merger proposed by Rees would be a "merger of equals," with different valuations in different sectors and some overlap, making it a complex yet potentially beneficial move.

Title: Why Is Amkor Technology (AMKR) Among the Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) stands against other best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now. Semiconductors are the modern-day equivalent of oil when it comes to the general well-being of the global economy. Tens of thousands of gadgets, computers, cars, and other items and products rely on a steady stream of chips to power up today’s world. As a result, chip manufacturers often have a steady flow of orders that they have to consistently churn out to ensure that a multitude of industries are not disrupted. However, while chip manufacturers often see most media coverage, the complex nature of transforming sand into a chip capable of 20 petaflops of output requires thousands of steps. To execute these steps, manufacturers rely on a diverse set of suppliers for a myriad of products such as chip manufacturing machines, specialty chemicals, masks, design technologies, and other items. Firms that provide these products and technologies are called semiconductor equipment providers and their role in the industry is just as important as the chip manufacturers’ is. To understand why semiconductor equipment stocks are important, consider the Biden Administration’s $280 billion CHIPS and Science Act. Signed by the President in 2022, it aims to ensure that the American semiconductor industry catches up to its peers in Taiwan and South Korea and is not dependent on any disruptions in the South China Sea. The biggest beneficiary of the CHIPS Act is the Taiwanese contract chip manufacturer that leads the world in manufacturing technologies. It ranked 4th on our recent list of trending AI stocks, and the firm has received $6.6 billion in direct funding and it is eligible for $5 billion in additional loans to set up advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona. Yet, even though the first of these facilities is set to start production in the first half of 2025, the fact that the firm’s operations are based in Taiwan is already creating problems. For starters, a report from Reuters suggests that the world’s leading AI GPU manufacturer (which ranked 3rd on our list above) might have to ship its GPUs to Taiwan for packaging after they’ve been manufactured in the US. This is because after the chips are manufactured, they have to be packaged to ensure power supply and communications with the rest of the computer system. The packaging technologies for these advanced chips are called Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), and for the Taiwanese firm, all of its packaging facilities are located in its home region. The need to ship the chips to Taiwan for packaging is not the only hurdle for the fab’s American manufacturing operations. Another problem, and one that is directly related to semiconductor equipment stocks, relates to the different chemicals that are required throughout the chip manufacturing process. These chemicals include sulfuric acid, acetone, ammonium hydroxide, and others to ensure the purity of the silicon wafer throughout the fabrication process. However, according to a report from Macquarie Bank, since the Taiwanese fab relies on Taiwan-based firms for its chemical supply chain, the costs of manufacturing chips at the Arizona site could be 30% higher than in Taiwan. The higher costs stem from the fact that the chemical companies are hesitant to move to the US since they might be unable to enjoy economies of scale and the resulting cost benefits. The bank outlines that the lack of an American chemical supply chain that is qualified by the Taiwanese fab means that chemicals such as sulfuric acid might be costlier to ship internationally than their list price. Therefore, it’s clear that semiconductor equipment firms play an equally important role in chip fabrication. Another important example of this fact is the Dutch chip manufacturing machinery provider that ranked 9th on a recent list of AI news and ratings that Wall Street was watching. This firm is the only company in the world capable of manufacturing high-end chip-making tools called EUV scanners. Without these tools, firms such as the Taiwanese fab cannot make leading-edge chips with feature sizes smaller than 7-nanometer. In fact, the rising threat of China utilizing Western technologies for military use has also led the US government to stop the chip manufacturing equipment provider from selling its equipment to China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). The sanctions have dealt a sharp blow to Chinese chip manufacturing ambitions, with the latest chip from Huawei still being manufactured on the older 7-nanometer node. In contrast, the latest iPhone uses chips built through the 3-nanometer process technology. To make our list of the best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy, we ranked all US-listed semiconductor equipment stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024 and picked out those with the highest number of investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close up of a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) package awaiting testing. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 27 Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) is an Arizona-based semiconductor equipment provider that provides semiconductor testing, packaging, and other associated services. Its shares are down 17% year-to-date, which is unsurprising even though packaging technologies have gained importance in the chip industry because of AI chips. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) depends to a large extent on the health of the smartphone industry. For the nine months ending in September, 49% of the firm’s revenue came from smartphones and communications devices. The market for these devices depends on consumer spending, and Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR)’s shares dropped by a massive 18% in July after the firm’s midpoint third-quarter EPS guidance of $0.49 missed analyst estimates of $0.65. Naturally, the smartphone market has to recover for the firm to benefit from tailwinds. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR) has also won funding from the US government under the CHIPS Act for packaging, and it is also a TSMC partner for the Arizona site. Both these factors can help the firm in today’s AI-driven chip era. Amkor Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMKR)’s management commented on its TSMC deal during the Q3 2024 earnings call. Here is what they said: “First of all, the MOU that we signed with TSMC, now is that it’s intended to offer our mutual customers a seamless manufacturing supply chain and a technology offering between Asia and the US and by standardizing on advanced packaging technology in the US versus Asia that offers these joint customers a seamless transition for dual qualification of specific devices. And that will happen in our Peoria factory, it will be for the Compute segment, but also for the Communications segment technologies. Now we have to remember that our Peoria factory, our Arizona factory is not captive to TSMCs, but we will run TSMC technology in that factory, specifically for joint customers. Overall, AMKR ranks 10th on our list of best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMKR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMKR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

BlackRock’s IBIT dominates Bitcoin ETF market with $54 billion in assets. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States have now eclipsed gold ETFs in total assets, achieving this feat in less than a year of their launch. According to data from K33 Research, the combined assets of Bitcoin ETFs have reached $129.3 billion. Meanwhile, gold ETFs hold a slightly lower total of $128.9 billion. This shift highlights Bitcoin’s rapid rise in the ETF market, outpacing gold, which has enjoyed a two-decade advantage. Investor appetite for BTC ETFs has surged, especially following the success of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump in the US elections on Nov. 5. The sector’s growth has been further fueled by consistent inflows, marked by a 13-day streak during which these ETFs attracted over $2 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) leads the market with over $54 billion in assets. This figure is nearly double its iShares Gold Trust (IAU) holdings, underlining BTC’s growing dominance in the sector. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also play significant roles, each managing approximately $22 billion in assets. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Without these tools, firms such as the Taiwanese fab cannot make leading-edge chips with feature sizes smaller than 7-nanometer. In fact, the rising threat of China utilizing Western technologies for military use has also led the US government to stop the chip manufacturing equipment provider from selling its equipment to China’s Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC). The sanctions have dealt a sharp blow to Chinese chip manufacturing ambitions, with the latest chip from Huawei still being manufactured on the older 7-nanometer node. In contrast, the latest iPhone uses chips built through the 3-nanometer process technology. To make our list of the best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy, we ranked all US-listed semiconductor equipment stocks by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024 and picked out those with the highest number of investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AMAT) is an American firm that sells products used in different chip fabrication processes such as deposition and etching. Its products cater to the needs of chip fabrication, display manufacturing, and other industries. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)’s shares are up by 9.70% year-to-date as they have been hit particularly hard by the tensions between the US and China. During its fiscal year 2024, 37% of the firm’s revenue came from China. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)’s stock dropped by 11% in July after reports claimed that the US government could even restrict foreign companies using materials sourced from America from selling their products to China. However, as the industry shifts to new technologies such as gate-all-around transistors, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) can enjoy favorable catalysts in the future. Parnassus Investments mentioned Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), the world’s largest supplier of wafer fabrication equipment for semiconductors, saw its shares pressured by negative sentiment around a potentially broad-based trend of capital expenditure cuts in memory spending.” Overall, AMAT ranks 1st on our list of best semiconductor equipment stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMAT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMAT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Analysis-2024 the 'year of the bond' as record inflows top $600 billion

By Harry Robertson LONDON (Reuters) -Investors have poured a record $600 billion into global bond funds this year, taking advantage of some of the highest yields in decades ahead of an uncertain 2025. Dwindling inflation has finally allowed central banks to lower interest rates, pushing investors to lock in the relatively high yields available and finally delivering the "year of the bond" after $250 billion left fixed-income funds in 2022. "The story is income," said Vasiliki Pachatouridi, head of EMEA iShares fixed income strategy at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). "We are seeing the income being put back into fixed income. We haven't seen these levels of yields in almost 20 years." Bond yields tend to fall, and prices rise, as central banks reduce short-term borrowing costs. Although returns on the ICE BofA global bond index have been middling at around 2% this year, the yield on offer topped 4.5% late last year, the most since 2008. As of mid-December, $617 billion had flowed into developed and emerging market bond funds, according to financial data provider EPFR, topping 2021's $500 billion and putting 2024 on track to be a record year. Stocks, meanwhile, have drawn $670 billion of inflows as indexes in the U.S. and Europe scale new heights. Cash equivalent money market funds, which boast high yields and little risk, have fared the best, pulling in more than $1 trillion. CREDIT CRAZE Corporate bonds, which offer higher yields than equivalent government debt, have proven particularly popular, rallying as companies weathered the rise in central bank interest rates. The yield on the ICE BofA global corporate bond index has fallen to its lowest over risk-free government debt since before the financial crisis in 2007. "Before interest rates started to drift up a few years ago, a lot of companies locked in their funding for a long time," said Willem Sels, global chief investment officer at HSBC's private bank. "Therefore, the impact of rising borrowing costs on corporates was much less than people expected. At the same time, a lot of companies earned more on their cash holdings." PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE Investors have shown a clear preference for passive exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which were on track for a record year with $350 billion of inflows by the end of November, according to Morningstar Direct data. "ETFs give investors access to a number of assets that previously were harder to trade, including bonds," said Martin Oehmke, professor of finance at the London School of Economics. "Corporate bonds, for example, are notoriously illiquid and ETFs offer easy access to this market in a much more liquid form." The two biggest passive fund players - BlackRock and Vanguard - have reaped the benefits. BlackRock's iShares fixed income ETF business alone attracted $111 billion of inflows between January and the end of October, according to estimates from Morningstar Direct. Vanguard's bond funds took in an estimated $120 billion, the vast majority of which went to its index business which includes ETFs. PIMCO, traditionally known for its active management, has also had a strong year. It has drawn around $46 billion into its bond funds, according to Morningstar, after shedding some $80 billion in 2022. FLOWS COULD SLOW A number of factors could cause inflows to slow in 2025. President-elect Donald Trump's tax-cutting and deregulatory agenda has caused U.S. stocks to jump and inflows into equities to surge, limiting the appeal of bonds. Data from EPFR and TD Securities shows $117 billion flowed into U.S. stock funds in the four weeks after Trump's Nov. 5 victory, more than four times the $27 billion into global bonds. Meanwhile, investors are sceptical that corporate bonds can rally much further after this year's strong performance. "It seems very hard to continue to expect spreads to tighten much more, and I don't believe that bond yields will be much lower from where we are today," said Carl Hammer, global head of asset allocation at Swedish bank SEB.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Weight Loss Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) stands against the other weight loss stocks. Most people have at some point sought to include weight loss and physical exercise in their daily life. The weight loss and fitness market is quite substantial worldwide since improving one's fitness can have direct physical and psychological benefits. Over one billion people worldwide—650 million adults, 340 million adolescents, and 39 million children—are obese, according to the WHO. A novel class of weight-loss medications that don't include strict exercise regimens or diets seems to be revolutionary. People who are overweight or obese can lose 15% to 20% of their body weight with the aid of these ground-breaking medications. According to Andy Acker, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, "This may be the largest opportunity we've ever seen in the pharmaceutical industry." Weight-loss medications are undoubtedly well-liked. Investors are drawing comparisons between the leader in artificial intelligence chips and the US pioneer in weight-loss drugs. Given this increase in demand, Morgan Stanley Research has raised its forecast for the worldwide obesity medication market from $77 billion to $105 billion by 2030. Branded obesity medications brought approximately $6 billion in 2023. According to Forbes, the most prescribed Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 GLP-1 agonist in 2023 was Semaglutide, the market leader for obesity medications and the generic form of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. It accounted for almost 88% of all new prescriptions. At present, the FDA has approved just three GLP-1 medications for weight control: tirzepatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide. By 2030, the GLP-1 market is expected to grow to $100 billion, driven equally by obesity and diabetes, according to JP Morgan Research. Thirty million GLP-1 users, or around 9% of the population, may be in the US by 2030. The rising demand for obesity drugs will have a broad effect, helping industries like biotech but creating challenges for others like the food and beverage industry. According to Chris Schott, a Senior Analyst specializing in the U.S. Diversified Biopharma industry, “GLP-1s have been used to treat T2D since 2005, starting with the approval of Byetta, with follow-on products continually improving on efficacy. The most recent, Ozempic and Mounjaro, offer significant advantages over previous products and have accelerated class growth,” “Indeed, the newest generations of GLP-1s and combos lead to 15-25+% weight loss on average, well above prior generations of products.” Some are praising the most recent generation of GLP-1 pharmaceuticals as "miracle drugs" for the treatment of obesity. However, because GLP-1s are expensive and have limited insurance coverage, not all obese people can use them. According to Jonathan Gruber, a professor of economics and the chairman of MIT's economics department, the annual cost of treating 40% of obese Americans at the current rate—roughly $15,000 per person—would surpass $1 trillion. That's almost the same as the government spends on the entire Medicare program. That's a staggering figure. According to a study released in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the use of GLP-1 medications, including semaglutide, for weight loss has increased over the last ten years, while it has dropped by about 10% among those with type 2 diabetes. The researchers warn that the ensuing extended drug scarcity may limit the treatments' availability to diabetics. Dr. Yee Hui Yeo, a clinical fellow in Cedars-Sina's Karsh Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, emphasized that it is crucial to ensure that diabetic patients have access to GLP-1 therapies as the demand for obesity medications increases. According to the FDA, growing demand is the cause of the shortages. The European Medicines Agency warned that the GLP-1 medicine shortage is a "major public health concern" that is unlikely to be resolved in 2024, indicating that the shortages affect more than only the US. According to NPR, shortages have made it difficult for those with diabetes to get their prescriptions, and some have had to reduce the medications they can use. The potential of GLP-1 medications, which were first created to treat diabetes but are currently being used to treat obesity, was covered by the panelists on "Weighing the Future of Obesity Drugs," which included Julia Angeles of Baillie Gifford, Debra Netschert of Jennison Investments, and Gentry Lee of Fayez Serofim. Netschert highlighted ongoing efforts to further reduce injection frequency and minimize adverse responses, as well as the development of GLP-1 medicine delivery from weekly dosages to multiple daily injections. Despite their exceptional efficacy, Netschert noted that due to supply limits, 1.5 million of the 110 million eligible patients in the US are now receiving therapy with GLP-1 medications. In their disagreement over who should foot the bill, Netschert pointed to significant insurance and Medicare/Medicaid reimbursements, while Angeles asserted that most patients pay cash. According to Netschert, up to 700 million people globally might require these medications outside of American borders. Notably, the panel found that GLP-1 medications were approved more quickly in the United Kingdom than in any other country, indicating their perceived value. The UK payors are generally stringent. Since the market for obesity medications is still in its infancy, it would be a good idea to add several weight reduction stocks to your watchlists. For this list, we scanned through holdings of weight loss ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 weight loss stocks. From that list, we picked 12 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024, based on data tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is a British-Swedish multinational biopharmaceutical company specializing in developing and manufacturing treatments for diseases such as cancer, respiratory conditions, cardiovascular issues, and autoimmune disorders. Its product portfolio includes biologics, vaccines, and prescription drugs like Tagrisso for lung cancer, Farxiga for diabetes and heart failure, and Symbicort for asthma and COPD. The company is among the largest pharmaceutical companies worldwide. AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) is advancing in the weight loss and obesity treatment market with innovative drug candidates. AZD5004, an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist licensed from Eccogene, offers a convenient alternative to injectables. Phase I trials demonstrated safety at lower doses, with patients experiencing 5.8% weight loss and improved glucose levels. Now entering Phase IIb trials, AZD5004 is expected to generate $800 million in sales by 2032 due to its favorable tolerability and simplified manufacturing. These developments make AZN one of the best weight loss stocks on our list. AZD6234, a long-acting amylin receptor agonist, targets gastric emptying and appetite suppression, catering to patients intolerant to GLP-1 therapies. Phase I results showed weight loss with manageable side effects. The corporation is exploring its use in combination with AZD9550, a GLP-1/glucagon dual agonist, to enable once-weekly dosing and fat-selective weight loss, enhancing patient convenience and treatment efficacy. By developing oral treatments and combination therapies, AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ:AZN) aims to broaden its market presence and meet diverse patient needs in obesity care. As of Q3 2024, 42 hedge funds held shares in the company as tracked by the Insider Monkey database. The largest shareholder in the company was Fisher Asset Management with holdings worth $816.5 million. Analysts hold a consensus Strong Buy rating on the stock. Overall AZN ranks 9th on our list of the best weight loss stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
