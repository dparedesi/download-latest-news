We recently published a list of 12 Best Brewery Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) stands against other best brewery stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The global alcohol industry is currently grappling with strict regulations, high taxes, inflation, and rising costs, which are likely to persist and may squeeze the profit margins of alcohol producers. The global brewing industry had been hit particularly hard as beer production worldwide fell to 1.88 billion hectoliters last year, representing a YoY decline of 0.9 %. Peter Hintermeier, Managing Director of BarthHaas, commented: “After we had managed to post modest growth in 2022 despite unfavorable conditions, we were expecting another small increase in 2023. However, energy, raw materials, packaging, logistics, and labor costs remained at a high level, which put pressure on the brewing business in many countries.” READ ALSO: 10 Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds The American brewing industry is also faced with a declining demand, as beer consumption in the US last year fell to its lowest level since the 1970s, according to the Brewers’ Association. In fact, in 2022, the American spirits industry surpassed beer in revenue for the first time ever. The trend then continued in 2023, driven primarily by the spirits RTD category. Nevertheless, the country’s major brewers were still in good financial health, thanks to rising prices and a consumer shift towards more expensive, often imported beers. A major factor behind the decreasing demand is also global drinking habits have shifted dramatically over the last few years. The modern consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness and seek alternatives to traditional alcoholic beverages, giving rise to the rapidly growing low and no-alcohol trend. To make sure they don’t miss out on the opportunity, several industry behemoths have hopped on the zero-alcohol bandwagon and are now offering products with all of the taste and none of the booze. Despite the aforementioned challenges, the alcohol sector can be an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios, simply because of the buffer it provides during tough economic times. An analysis by Goldman Sachs has revealed that beer and spirits volumes in the American market have shown little correlation with economic growth. Their sales are more related to the general trends of alcohol consumption per capita rather than the general state of the economy. This is because beer and spirits are often seen as affordable luxuries or even staples. According to a study by Cambridge University, the decreasing levels of average per capita income lead to very small changes in gross alcohol, wine, and beer consumption. In fact, the surge in unemployment during recessions could instead trigger an increase in the average alcohol intake. A great example of this is how Americans drank more alcohol during the pandemic and this was also reflected in the resultant imposts collected by the national kitty. Alcohol tax revenues collected by the U.S. Treasury Department rose by 8% in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2021, compared to the previous year, and remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Another popular investment vehicle in the alcohol industry is rare whiskeys. Aptly named ‘Liquid Gold’, this beloved liquor can preserve and even increase in value during economic instabilities, inflationary periods, and recessions. One simply cannot forget about the bottle of The Emerald Isle Collection that sold in auction earlier this year for $2.8 million, or the 1975 cask of Ardbeg single malt which was acquired by a private collector in Asia in 2022 for over $20 million, more than double the amount Glenmorangie paid for the entire Ardbeg distillery and all its stock in 1997. The Rare Whisky 101 Apex 1000 Index tracks whiskeys that are highly sought after for collection. It has gained over 384% since 2013, against almost 301% gains by S&P’s famous benchmark of the top 500 companies for the same period. The RW Japanese 100 Index, which includes 100 collector’s bottles from Japan, has seen gains of around 350% since 2015. The index includes bottles like Ichiro’s Malt ‘Card’ Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds, and King of Hearts, among others. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 12 companies operating in the brewing sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Beer Alcohol Stocks Held by the Most Hedge Funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:CCU) is a beverage giant that operates in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The company, known for its Cristal brand, is one of the biggest brewers in its home country of Chile. It was announced in October that Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU), which distributes PepsiCo products in Chile, has struck a deal for its rights also in Paraguay. The company has acquired a 51% stake in Bebidas del Paraguay, Distribuidora del Paraguay, and AV, in association with Vierci Group. This marks Paraguay as the second country where CCU holds the PepsiCo license, promising growth and investment opportunities. Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) had a mixed Q3 2024 as organic volumes were down 6.9%, mostly due to a weakened demand in Argentina. However, its Chilean segment saw a 7% revenue increase, driven by a 5.2% rise in prices and improved volumes. All in all, the company managed to achieve a net profit of CLP 29.55 million ($29.77 million) during the quarter, a significant 211% increase from the same period last year. CCU also offers an above-average annual dividend yield of 3.67% as of December 28, 2024. Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) continues its focus on expanding its product line and recently launched Escudo Maki, a limited-edition variety produced with wild maquis collected by an agricultural cooperative in the south of Chile. Moreover, its subsidiary CPCh launched ‘Hard Fresh: Hard Soda’, a 5% ABV ready-to-drink cocktail in response to the growing demand for low alcohol options with nice flavors. In Q3 of 2024, shares of Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) were held by 3 hedge funds in the IM database, with First Eagle Investment Management holding the largest stake of 15.69 million shares, valued at around $182.47 million.

While we acknowledge the potential for CCU to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Is JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) the Best Dividend Stock of 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Dividend Stocks of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other dividend stocks. Macroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation. Improved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve’s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024. Dividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019—a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates—dividends contributed 75% to the market’s overall returns. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company’s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not. Reflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers. This broader adoption of dividends has expanded the range of options for equity income investors, offering greater access to dynamic and high-growth companies. For instance, major tech companies that are market leaders have recently introduced dividends. Meanwhile, established tech giants demonstrate that dividend payments can coexist with innovation and reinvestment, proving that companies can excel at both. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed a selection of dividend stocks and identified those that have provided positive returns in 2024. From this group, we focused on companies offering yields above 2% as of December 30. We then narrowed down the list by selecting companies with the most hedge fund investments, based on Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:JPM) is a New York-based multinational investment banking company. The company's diverse revenue streams make it an attractive investment option. With operations spanning consumer and commercial banking, capital markets, and asset management, its diversification enables strength in one sector to offset weaknesses in others, enhancing overall stability. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered an over 39% return to shareholders. In the third quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported revenue of $42.7 billion, marking a 7% increase from the same period last year. The company showed strong financial and operational results, with a net income of $12.9 billion and a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 19%. The Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) division performed well, with a 31% rise in investment banking fees and an 8% increase in the Market's revenue. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) also proved to be a generous dividend payer, distributing around $3.06 billion in dividends to shareholders during the quarter. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per share, yielding 2.09% as of December 30. At the end of Q3 2024, 105 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared with 111 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $8.6 billion. Overall JPM ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than JPM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Here’s Why Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (CGDV) Is One of the Best Performing Dividend ETFs in 2024

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) stands against the other dividend ETFs. By the end of 2023, the global ETF market had reached $11.1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and expanded to include 9,149 funds. This growth was driven by several milestones and the diversification of ETF offerings, which now cover equity, fixed income, active management, and alternative strategies. Despite unpredictable factors such as the rise of AI or policy changes, ETFs continue to be a vital investment tool. According to State Street Global Advisors, although only 45% of individual investors in the US use ETFs, nearly 70% of financial advisors and 67% of institutional investors recommend or use them frequently. However, ETFs still make up only 11.25% of the total global investable assets, suggesting there is significant potential for further growth. Interest in ETFs is rising, particularly among retail investors, with 63% of US investors planning to purchase ETFs in 2024, a sharp increase from 37% during 2022. Active ETFs are experiencing considerable growth, with global inflows hitting a record $166 billion in 2023 and continuing to rise in 2024. Much of this growth is driven by fixed income and alternative investments, while AI-related ETFs, especially in robotics and semiconductors, are attracting large amounts of investment. These trends reflect the growing demand for ETFs as investors seek more flexible and efficient ways to respond to market changes. A Reuters report from October 2024 highlighted that US ETFs focused on dividend-paying stocks have experienced a significant increase in inflows since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle the prior month. In September, 135 US dividend ETFs tracked by Morningstar saw $3.05 billion in inflows, far higher than the average $424 million per month in the first eight months of 2024. However, this trend may slow as US Treasury yields have risen recently, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting a two-month high following strong employment data that suggests the economy is resilient and may not need further large rate cuts. Dividend ETFs tend to offer stable payouts and potential for growth, addressing challenges regarding unpredictable yields and limited principal growth. However, high-dividend ETFs vary in stability. Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the year-to-date (YTD) share price performance of each ETF as of December 30, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A close-up of a wealth manager's hands hovering over a laptop presenting a customer with investment options. YTD Share Price Performance as of December 30: 20.14% Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) aims to generate consistent income that surpasses the average yield of the S&P 500 by investing in dividend-paying companies or those with the potential to pay dividends. As of December 27, 2024, the ETF manages nearly $12.4 billion in assets, with a 0.33% expense ratio and a 1.74% 30-day SEC yield. Launched on February 22, 2022, Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) holds 52 stocks in its portfolio as of November 2024. CGDV ranks 1st on our list of the best performing ETFs. Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) is one of the top stocks in the Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV)’s portfolio. Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) provides HVAC, refrigeration, fire, security, and building automation technologies globally. It operates in three segments – HVAC, offering heating, cooling, and ventilation products and services; Refrigeration, providing transport refrigeration and commercial cooling solutions; and Fire & Security, offering fire detection, suppression, and security technologies. In Q3 2024, Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) reported a 20% increase in organic orders, positioning the company for continued growth in 2025. Despite challenges in residential and light commercial HVAC in Europe and China, the company achieved 4% organic sales growth. Strong aftermarket performance is set to deliver double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year. CARR repurchased $400 million in shares in Q3 and plans to repurchase $5 billion in shares by the end of next year. Carrier Global's adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.77, up 3% year-over-year, driven by organic growth, pricing, and productivity, partially offset by higher interest expenses, tax rates, and share count. Insider Monkey’s Q3 database indicates that 45 hedge funds were bullish on Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR), the same as the prior quarter. Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.15 billion. Overall CGDV ranks 1st on our list of the best performing dividend ETFs of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CGDV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CGDV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently published a list of the 10 Best Environmental Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stands against the other best environmental stocks to invest in right now. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded on November 24, with a landmark agreement that sets a new collective goal for climate finance. The agreement, which aims to triple the annual finance to developing countries from the previous goal of $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035, marks a significant step forward in global efforts to combat climate change and support vulnerable nations. Furthermore, this new finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) also aims to scale up collaboration among all actors including governments, private sector entities, and international financial institutions to finance developing countries to reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2035. The progress made at COP29 builds on the global climate action achieved at previous conferences. COP27 established a historic Loss and Damage Fund, while COP28 delivered a global agreement to transition away from all fossil fuels in energy systems swiftly and fairly, tripling renewable energy and boosting climate resilience. The new finance goal at COP29 is a crucial step in ensuring that these commitments are met and that the global community remains on track to limit global warming. According to a report by McKinsey, the $300 billion annual goal for climate financing falls drastically short of the estimated $1 trillion needed annually to meet global targets. On a broader scale, McKinsey estimates that up to $9 trillion per year will be required globally by 2050 to decarbonize physical assets and transition towards a sustainable future. The report highlights that private capital is widely seen as a key enabler in bridging this financing gap. However, many investors remain cautious, not just due to a lack of funds, but due to a shortage of credible, scalable investment opportunities, execution challenges, insufficient risk management, and delays in scaling operations. The geopolitical and macroeconomic environment further complicates the sustainability landscape. Higher interest rates, inflation, and energy supply disruptions have created an environment where cost assumptions from just a few years ago no longer hold true. In light of these dynamics, McKinsey identifies three key strategies for businesses to navigate the complex investment landscape in sustainability. First, companies must reevaluate and refresh sustainability strategies as past assumptions may no longer be valid, and companies must take a pragmatic approach to align their strategies with current realities. Second, businesses must accelerate climate technology industrialization. While renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in cost competitiveness, other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and precision fermentation, require further industrialization. Third, companies must address execution risks, streamline supply chains, and ensure they have experienced teams capable of managing large-scale sustainable projects. The report concluded by emphasizing that companies who will act decisively, embrace innovative financing mechanisms, and prioritize operational excellence will not only contribute to global sustainability goals but also position themselves for future growth in an evolving economic landscape. The journey towards a sustainable future requires collaboration, innovation, and accountability across all sectors. While the challenges are significant, the opportunities for growth, resilience, and value creation are even greater. To compile our list of the 10 best environmental stocks to invest in right now, we used environmental ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 environment-friendly companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024.

Title: 2024 The Year Of Crypto: From Bitcoin ETFs To Memecoins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2024/12/31/2024-the-year-of-crypto-from-bitcoin-etfs-to-memecoins/

Cryptocurrency on trading app, Bitcoin BTC with altcoin digital coin crypto currency, BNB, Ethereum, ... [+] Dogecoin, Cardano, defi p2p decentralized fintech market As the best year in crypto’s history comes to a close, it’s worth looking back at how it went and where it leaves us for 2025. BTC led the show this year. It began with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock, Fidelity, and other top institutions. Then the fourth Bitcoin Halving happened in April. Options contracts went on spot bitcoin ETFs, catalyzing mass adoption. American and Russian lawmakers proposed strategic bitcoin reserves, and then, the big milestone, bitcoin crossed the much-awaited $100,000 mark in early December. But 2024 wasn’t only about Bitcoin’s success. It was also about key infrastructural upgrades and cutting-edge innovations across Layer-2s, Real-World Assets (RWAs), and Crypto AI. Stablecoins, the the killer app in digital assets delivering the fiat on and off ramps to Web3.0 exploded in 2024 with a number of new issuers and a market cap of over $200 billion, and memecoins had a great run this year, garnering much interest from retail users and investors. Both retail and institutional interest led to holistic industry growth in 2024, driving new use cases and solving for real-world problems. Bitcoin ETFs have reached a market cap of over $132 billion, with more than $10 billion inflows since Donald Trump won the American presidential election. 2024 was also about the winds of political change and a new pro-crypto administration in the U.S. The appointment of former PayPal exec David Sacks as AI and crypto czar, and the appointment of former college football player and Republican congressional candidate Bo Hines to the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, chaired by Sacks, is helping 2025 to take shape rapidly. Add Paul Atkins who will become the new SEC Chair role, replacing Gary Gensler who will resign on January 20th, and the anticipated appointment of Brian Quintenz, a16z exec and the crypto policy right hand of former CFTC Commissioner Chris Giancarlo, crypto dad and uber crypto policy czar - the team that delivered the bitcoin future market, and it looks as if the U.S. is positioning to dominate crypto, globally. Ryan Chow, co-founder and ceo of Solv Protocol, says, “The approval of bitcoin ETFs has legitimized the asset class as an institutional grade investment. Besides the incoming liquidity and positive price activity, bitcoin ETFs have increased BTC’s popularity. It’s not surprising that Bitcoin DeFi has attracted more than $3 billion in TVL, despite its nascency.” Alongside bitcoin, AI emerged as a leading narrative, dominating crypto mindshare with an all-time high of 48 percent by November. Currently, the crypto-AI sector has a market cap of over $34 billion with a strong growth potential. Tiancheng Xie, co-founder and cto of Polyhedra Network, explained, “AI’s biggest challenges revolve around trust, transparency, and accountability, by utilizing blockchain in-particular zero knowledge proofs we can ensure verifiable data, fair contributor compensation, and a trustless builder ecosystem, which in-turn creates scalable innovation in a more trusted environment.” According to a16z’s Builder Energy dashboard as well, crypto developers are heavily focussing on AI with over 34 percent of projects using AI in 2024. The dashboard also shows building blockchain infrastructure is the second most popular category this year with over 19 percent builder activity. According to a16z’s Builder Energy dashboard as well, crypto developers are heavily focussing on AI with over 34 percent of projects using AI in 2024. The dashboard also shows building blockchain infrastructure is the second most popular category this year with over 19 percent builder activity. Ben Wynn, cmo at House of ZK, echoed how infrastructure developments have been a major focus for the industry to increase overall capacity, saying, "Blockchain development continues to grow significantly, with over 23,000 monthly active developers globally in 2024 - a roughly 40 percent annual increase since 2015 - and ZK is growing even faster, with over a 50 percent annual growth over the past four years. ZK deployments have surged from 40 in 2020 to approximately 640 in 2024 - a 16x increase - reflecting its transition from mostly theoretical to more practical use, and it's becoming widely recognized as the foundation for solving the pressing challenges of scalability, privacy, interoperability, and more. "Its potential to transform every facet of blockchain is clear and, with adoption quickly accelerating, we expect developer activity in ZK to grow exponentially in the coming years" Overall, infrastructural improvements on the back-end are having a big positive effect in onboarding new users to crypto. In September 2024, a record-breaking 220 million wallet addresses interacted with a blockchain at least once, the highest ever in crypto’s history. On average, there are 30-60 million monthly active crypto users currently, or around 5-10 percent of the 617 million global crypto owners. The surge in on-chain interactions has been primarily driven by Solana, NEAR, and Base. Interestingly, Solana and Base also lead the list of chains in builder interest. Meanwhile Base, with a 10.7 percent builder interest, has some of the most popular memecoin projects like Brett and Goose.run driving user adoption. Memecoins are now a $130 billion industry, despite all the controversies surrounding this asset class. Many analysts consider the sudden rise of memecoins in 2024 as a speculative fad and aberration, with others considering it the epitome of digital culture and successfully leveraging speculation as a use case. As Riva Tez of LayerZero Labs said at Consensys 2024, memes have helped crypto win the "narrative war". Likewise, Momin Saqib, Brett ambassador, emphasized the memecoin narrative while noting, “Memecoins capture the spirit of the internet—playful, inclusive, and dynamic while their communities provide a rare sense of belonging in a day and age where loneliness is an epidemic in modern society. Brett for me stands out as a beacon of connection—uniting people through humor, vibrant communities, and shared experiences. It has become a movement that transforms digital engagement into joy, purpose, and inclusivity, all while driving real-world impact through its inspiring charitable initiatives in water and education.” Besides community formation, Ryan, core contributor of Goose.run, explained how memecoins create novel wealth-generating opportunities saying, “By monetizing meme’s virality, memecoins have shown how speculation can be a utility in itself. If memecoins, however, stay isolated in speculative trading, they’ll miss out on enormous untapped liquidity. It’s important to create a sub-sector of Meme Finance (MemeFi) to leverage memecoins in DeFi to maximize their use cases.” Despite not being blue chip assets, memecoins are the second-most popular category dominating market narrative mindshare. Drew Cohen, marketing lead of GME on Ethereum, considers the spectacular success of memecoins as a revolt against VC-backed coins. Cohen explains, “Retail investors don’t have free and fair entry points for VC-backed tokens because the coins already have high valuations at launch. Memecoins create an equitable opportunity for everyone that challenges the VCs as gatekeepers of crypto finance. Thus, memecoins give power back to the masses.” Hatu Sheikh of Ape Terminal, also emphasizes the importance of retail investors in the crypto economy saying, “No industry can flourish until the general public invests in your projects. After all, institutional investors can only do so much. Protocols need to have a strong and diverse user base who will invest and become your most vocal marketing support in the long run.” As 2024 draws to a close, we see a simultaneous rise in bitcoin, infrastructure investment, institutional liquidity, and memecoings. Perhaps for the first time in fifteen years, there’s no one winner - in 2024, everyone's a winner - this time, it is appears very different. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: The businesses that didn't make it through 2024

SPQR closed its doors in July. Photo: RNZ / Melanie Earley It's been a tough year for businesses around the country. In November, company liquidations were up 27 percent year-on-year, according to Centrix. Businesses large and small suffered - and even some big names did not make it. Here are some of the prominent businesses that did not survive 2024. Aucklanders were shocked in July when Ponsonby favourite SPQR closed its doors. The restaurant opened in 1992. "The hospitality industry is struggling and has been since the Covid-19 pandemic. Globally, it's hard out there for people and when the dollar is tight, this sector suffers," liquidator Stephen Lawrence told RNZ at the time. The fallout from SolarZero's liquidation continues. Owned by international asset manager BlackRock, SolarZero provided leased solar energy systems to about 15,000 houses around New Zealand. But it was placed into liquidation because the business was not sustainable, BlackRock said. The problem for the government is that the NZ Green investment Fund had set up a taxpayer-funded lending facility of $145m for SolarZero, of which it said about $115m had been drawn down. Maketū Pies went into liquidation, but was saved by new owners. Photo: Laura Smith There was some good news in this story for pie lovers. Maketū Pies went into liquidation in November after years of losses, but was saved by new owners. Privately owned catering business Montana Group took over the 42-year-old brand and its about 20 employees in early December. Organic and wholefoods grocer Huckleberry went into liquidation in the middle of the year. In their report, liquidators said the failure was driven by a downturn in customer numbers and spending, as well as a reduction in turnover. "The result of this was he revenue was no longer able to sustain the company's outgoings or expenses." Ezibuy hit trouble again this year. Its parent company, Mosaic Brands, appointed administrators. Its other brands, such as Katies and Millers, were also affected. Mosaic told the ASX that a "small number of stakeholders" did not support its proposals for restructure, or negotiating a commercial outcome, and Mosaic could not reach an acceptable resolution with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over proceedings relating to the late or non-delivery of goods during the pandemic. Last year, voluntary administrators were appointed to Ezibuy, which owed more than $100 million to creditors. At the time, Mosaic said its significant decline in sales through 2022 was at odds with the rest of the business. But Mosaic bought it back earlier this year, planning a simplified online-only operation. Wellington co-working space Digital Nomad did not make it until the end of the year, either. Liquidators said the main reason was that it was too difficult to maintain a sustainable level of tenants and revenue to make the operation profitable. "The working landscape has been changing in Wellington for the last few years since Covid-19 and the shift to working from home has made it particularly challenging to secure tenants." Auckland-based plumbing supplies business Franklins went into liquidation. It had been owned by the Smith family for 69 years. But it said the "changing landscape of the building industry and the current state of the economy" had led the director to make the decision to shut the business. Economist Shamubeel Eaqub said he hoped the year ahead would be an easier one. "But business failures is a lagging indicator. Many businesses that limp through the recession are not in good shape for the recovery, so there will be a tail of businesses which will continue to fail for the next year or so. "But many other businesses will benefit from a cyclical recovery. The key risks are when the economic recovery takes hold: two headwinds from sharply slowing net migration and prospect of more intense fiscal austerity.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM) stands against the other dividend ETFs. By the end of 2023, the global ETF market had reached $11.1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and expanded to include 9,149 funds. This growth was driven by several milestones and the diversification of ETF offerings, which now cover equity, fixed income, active management, and alternative strategies. Despite unpredictable factors such as the rise of AI or policy changes, ETFs continue to be a vital investment tool. According to State Street Global Advisors, although only 45% of individual investors in the US use ETFs, nearly 70% of financial advisors and 67% of institutional investors recommend or use them frequently. However, ETFs still make up only 11.25% of the total global investable assets, suggesting there is significant potential for further growth. Interest in ETFs is rising, particularly among retail investors, with 63% of US investors planning to purchase ETFs in 2024, a sharp increase from 37% during 2022. Active ETFs are experiencing considerable growth, with global inflows hitting a record $166 billion in 2023 and continuing to rise in 2024. Much of this growth is driven by fixed income and alternative investments, while AI-related ETFs, especially in robotics and semiconductors, are attracting large amounts of investment. These trends reflect the growing demand for ETFs as investors seek more flexible and efficient ways to respond to market changes. A Reuters report from October 2024 highlighted that US ETFs focused on dividend-paying stocks have experienced a significant increase in inflows since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle the prior month. In September, 135 US dividend ETFs tracked by Morningstar saw $3.05 billion in inflows, far higher than the average $424 million per month in the first eight months of 2024. However, this trend may slow as US Treasury yields have risen recently, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting a two-month high following strong employment data that suggests the economy is resilient and may not need further large rate cuts. Dividend ETFs tend to offer stable payouts and potential for growth, addressing challenges regarding unpredictable yields and limited principal growth. However, high-dividend ETFs vary in stability. Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the year-to-date (YTD) share price performance of each ETF as of December 30, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Invest in Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other logistics stocks. Logistics companies transporting goods around the world continue to navigate uncertainty as Donald Trump plans to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. As reported by CNBC, Dave Bozeman, the new CEO of C.H. Robinson, sees an opportunity in Trump tariffs. The logistics giant is a top 3 carrier on the China-U.S. freight lane also carrying nearly 10% of the freight on the US-Mexico lane. Citi transportation analyst Ari Rosa considers the company’s business diversified enough to work through tariffs despite its global forwarding business being very exposed to China. The CEO’s stance on the tariffs was quite positive as well, as he stated: “The freight still has to move. It might just move at a different starting point, and we would still be there to move that.” In an interview with CNBC, Ravi Jakhar of the firm Allcargo Group, the world’s LCL consolidation leader and India’s largest integrated logistics solutions provider, reiterated optimism regarding the Trump tariff risks. He mentioned how over 4 years ago when sanctions came in from the Trump administration, the firm saw an increased import into its Vietnam offices from China and improved export out of Vietnam, alongside increased momentum in Indonesia and the Philippines. In his opinion, whether it is a short-term tariff sanction or a long-term structural trend, trade flows could change in terms of origins and destinations but the overall trade flows would remain robust as long as manufacturing and consumption are there. As of what’s recent in the logistics landscape, the holiday season is in full swing, with holiday surcharges playing a crucial role in profitability for logistics companies since they charge their big retail customers extra fees on a per-package basis compared to their June volume during the busy holiday season. The increase in e-commerce is also benefitting such logistics providers and full truckload carriers. Simultaneously, an increase in freight in anticipation of future tariffs is also being seen. A survey from Merchants Fleet and Atomik Research of decision-makers in organizations that typically transport freights of consumer-packaged goods throughout the US revealed that 88% saw AI as useful in alleviating pressures on their fleets this peak delivery season. AI’s data-driven capabilities are to streamline operations and decision-making, with the majority of the respondents citing supply chain optimization as a primary benefit. Other advantages mentioned were improved route optimization, enhanced inventory management, and reduced downtime by identifying maintenance issues with fleet vehicles. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now, we went through stock screeners, ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 11 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024.

The company is uniquely positioned as it serves many of the fastest-growing population centers in the United States while operating from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways and seamlessly connecting with Canada's rail systems. It is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has already laid the foundation for its success as it posted year-over-year improvements for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024, in reportable injury rates, freight car velocity, and locomotive productivity among other major metrics. Recently, the company closed 2024’s third quarter, demonstrating strategic success. Improved safety and service performance drove solid revenue growth which translated into third-quarter earnings per diluted share up 10% and operating income up 11%. Hence, the firm is positioned well to lead in safety, service, and operational excellence. Overall UNP ranks 1st on our list of the best logistics stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of UNP as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: The Vanguard-FDIC Agreement On Passive Investing And Bank Ownership

Banks In a landmark development last week, Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers with nearly $9 trillion assets under management, agreed to new terms with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to clarify its role as a passive investor in U.S. banks. This decision, while important for Vanguard, may have broader implications for asset managers, the banking sector, and financial regulation. FDIC’s Push for Accountability The prominence of index fund managers like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, collectively overseeing more than $23 trillion in assets, has grown significantly over the past decades. These firms often hold substantial stakes in public companies, including banks, through their passive investment strategies. By mimicking indices such as the S&P 500, they have amassed considerable influence without actively managing or directing company operations​​. Historically, the regulatory framework has allowed asset managers to bypass stringent shareholder banking regulations, provided the asset managers do not influence management decisions. However, concerns have mounted the last few years about whether “self-certification” by these asset managers genuinely supported maintenance of their passive roles. With stakes exceeding 10 percent in many banks, questions arose about potential conflicts of interest and undue influence over critical financial institutions. Notably, FDIC board members, including Jonathan McKernan and Rohit Chopra, argued for more rigorous oversight. They highlighted the risks of concentrated ownership in a few hands and the implications for competitive fairness and economic stability​​. The FDIC began revising its approach in mid-2024, proposing tighter controls on investment firms crossing the 10 percent ownership threshold. Focusses included enhanced disclosure requirements and greater scrutiny of informal interactions between asset managers and bank executives​​. Vanguard’s Landmark Agreement On December 27, 2024, Vanguard finalized an agreement with the FDIC, addressing these regulatory concerns. Key provisions include: Implications for the Industry and Regulation This agreement signals a turning point in how passive investment giants operate within regulated sectors. By setting a precedent with Vanguard, the FDIC may ask other firms, notably BlackRock and State Street, to adopt similar agreements. Such measures aim to balance the benefits of passive investing—like broad market access and lower costs for investors—with the need for transparency and accountability in sensitive sectors like banking​​. Critics argue that increased regulatory oversight might discourage investments in banks, potentially harming the sector’s growth. Industry representatives contend that the FDIC’s actions lack a clear demonstration of harm, raising concerns about regulatory overreach​​. Conclusion Vanguard’s deal with the FDIC underscores the evolving relationship between regulators and financial powerhouses holding significant bank shares. The action could reshape the landscape of passive investing and its interplay with accountability and regulatory oversight. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Bitcoin Traders Monitor Key Technical Levels Including $100,000

Bitcoin traders are watching several technical levels. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin traders who leverage technical analysis have been monitoring important levels of support and resistance, singling out $100,000 in particular as being psychologically significant. The world’s most prominent digital currency appears to be following a downward trend since reaching an all-time high of more than $108,000 on December 17, Coinbase data from TradingView reveals. On Monday, December 30, the cryptocurrency fell below $91,500, reaching its lowest level since late November, additional Coinbase figures show. In spite of this recent price activity, bitcoin is still in a strong, upward trend that has propelled it to multiple fresh, all-time highs over the last several months. Several analysts have noted this strong performance, including the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O. The market observer emphasized such developments in emailed comments, stating that “We are still in a crypto bull market, even though it feels a bit different than previous cycles and we will see a lot of bullish price action in the crypto markets, primarily with Bitcoin.” “Closing 2024 Bitcoin is currently in a downtrend on the daily chart since hitting all-time high of $108,000 on 12/17/2024,” she noted. “I’m personally watching psychological levels like $100,000 and $90,000. These areas are important as most are not trading full-time and passive investors,” Wendy O clarified. “Those numbers spark excitement.” “When we look at $100,000 as resistance, it seems to be an area the masses may see as a good value to sell, and that could also be why we have been in a downtrend since hitting all-time high of $108,000,” she stated. Further, the analyst emphasized the strong institutional demand stemming from both BlackRock and MicroStrategy, and noted that as countries grow increasingly interested in using bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the digital asset’s price could easily push higher. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also weighed in, highlighting several technical levels. “On the downside, support could emerge around the $85,000–$86,000 zone, followed by the $80,000 level, and deeper at $75,000 if the market continues to decline,” he noted via emailed comments. “On the upside, resistance is likely to be encountered near $95,000–$96,000, with the $100,000 mark acting as a significant psychological barrier,” said DiPasquale. “If Bitcoin manages to break above $100,000, the $105,000 area could become the next key resistance level,” he pointed out. “Traders should also monitor volume around these levels to gauge the strength of any price action, while broader macroeconomic factors and sentiment will play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s medium-to-long-term direction,” the analyst emphasized. Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, offered a different point of view. “Bitcoin has been truly range-bound, while showing more action to the downside, since December 20, three days after the most recent ATH,” he stated via email. “Counting today, it’s bounced off the $92k area three times. That level is also the bottom of a channel which started in November 2022, which has provided major support in the past (although not without fail),” said Enneking. “If $90k breaks, and the odds are about even that it will, there is some support of $88k, but the next bottom will probably be lower (although almost certainly still with an ‘8’ handle),” he stated. “By the time that plays out, inauguration euphoria will probably kick in with Bitcoiners licking their chops at the prospect of a pro-crypto administration and BTC turning into a reserve asset (N.B. Not a reserve currency) – and BTC will be primed for the next ATH,” Enneking predicted. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL. One Community. Many Voices.

The Nasdaq had reached 4000, a nearly sixfold increase in seven years. Unemployment in the world’s largest economy had shrunk to 3 per cent, the lowest in more than a generation. Having borne the burden of the Cold War, the American people were reaping the peace dividend. Xi Jinping, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin all seek radical change to the current world order.Credit: AP In other countries, the news was equally bright. The Europeans had introduced both a single market and a single currency and were well on their way to becoming a “United States of Europe”. The once-mighty communist international had dwindled to Cuba, North Korea and a few university departments. World trade in manufactured goods had doubled in the 1990s and would double again in the 2000s. Global poverty was receding faster than ever. A quarter of a century later, the mood could not be more different. A sizeable majority of the global population – three in five people – believe the world is getting worse. This is as true in traditionally optimistic America (which has just elected an irascible 78-year-old to succeed a faltering 82-year-old) as it is in stagnating Europe. The world’s second-biggest economy, China, is run by a proud Marxist-Leninist, Xi Jinping, whose achievements include removing limits on his time in power. The world’s most populous country, India, is in the hands of an illiberal strongman, Narendra Modi. China and Russia have built an axis of authoritarian states that are determined to push back against Western liberalism. Vladimir Putin’s “war on the West” has involved not just the invasion of Crimea and Ukraine and the dispatching of private militia across Africa, but numerous sorties, by plane and submarine, into Western territory. Xi has declared that any foreign power that tries to “bully, oppress, or enslave us” will “be battered and blooded from colliding with a great wall of steel forged by more than 1.4 billion Chinese people using flesh and blood”. In the 1990s, we looked forward to a world of entrepreneurial vigour, public sector discipline and spreading peace. Optimists might point out that the first quarter of the 21st century has been better than the first quarter of the 20th, when the Great War took the lives of 15 million people and provided the material for both communism and fascism, not to mention World War II. But the contrast with the optimism of the 1990s is nevertheless astonishing. And worse is almost certain to come. Some security officials believe we are engaged in an undeclared war with the “axis of autocracy”. Donald Trump, elected with a clear majority, has hinted he will pursue a policy of America First and may well destroy the institutions that undergirded postwar security. The EU is in a state of paralysis, with the leaders of the two most powerful countries, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz, discredited and their economies stagnant. And tens of millions of people are likely to flee Africa and Latin America in coming years, driven by a combination of economic stagnation, political fragility and climate change, empowering the far right and undermining the stability of the West. As for the miracle of technology, one survey of AI researchers discovered that 48 per cent thought there was at least a 10 per cent chance that its impact would be “extremely bad”, that is, lead to human extinction. What has gone wrong with the 21st century? Let’s start by acknowledging that there have been successes. We have created an entire virtual world. Today, more than half the world’s population has some sort of internet access, and there are about as many mobile phones in the world as people – 8 billion-plus. This has ushered in a world of information and entertainment that never existed. There are more than a billion fewer people living on less than $US2.25 a day than there were in 2000, thanks to catch-up growth in developing countries. In 2012-13, the global poverty headcount fell by 130 million people, marking it as one of the most remarkable years in history. In December 2020, China declared it had eliminated extreme poverty completely. Yet even these positives contain negatives. The information revolution has undermined the business models of “old media” companies that put a premium on checking facts while, at the same time, empowering rumourmongers who depend on polarisation and misinformation. There has been no significant impact in reducing global poverty in the decade since 2015.Credit: Getty Images The spread of smartphones has coincided with the spread of psychological problems, particularly among the young. The war against poverty is going into reverse. In China, economic growth has slowed to a crawl. In Latin America and Africa, poverty rates are again rising, thanks to economic stagnation, political instability and rapid population growth. In all, the number of people living in absolute poverty has barely declined since 2015. The West has made a succession of policy errors that both weakened its elites and emboldened its autocratic critics. George W Bush invaded Iraq based on false information and then bungled the occupation. Angela Merkel, Germany’s powerful chancellor from 2005 to 2021, failed to address her country’s two biggest weaknesses: its dependence on Russian energy supplies and its failure to invest in its own defences. In the UK, David Cameron dealt with a feud within the Conservative Party by holding a popular referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, plunging the country into chaos and reducing its economic growth rate. The world has also lived through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, which deepened the growing sense of economic injustice and paved the way for the rise of populism. The problem lies with more than just a handful of policy mistakes. It lies with the broader development of the global economy-cum-polity. In the 1990s, we looked forward to a world of entrepreneurial vigour, public sector discipline and spreading peace. What we got was the very opposite: oligopoly, government splurge and militarised blocs. The consolidation of capitalism is most advanced in the US, the leading economic power, and in tech and finance, suggesting that oligopoly is the way of the future. Five tech companies are each worth more than $US1 trillion ($1.6 trillion), and one, Apple, is worth more than $US3 trillion. Three big investment houses, BlackRock, the Vanguard Group and State Street, collectively manage around $US22 trillion in assets. Over the past two decades, industries have grown more concentrated. This may be the result of excellence: Google and Apple are superbly run, and Microsoft is undergoing a renaissance after a period in the doldrums. But would anyone argue that America’s airline industry is a model of innovation and customer service? The success of the superstar companies slows the rate of innovation and thwarts competition; the success of second-rate companies contributes to a general sense of frustration. It’s notable that the world’s first great age of populism, before World War I, coincided with the rise of giant companies, particularly in the US and Germany. Bill Clinton’s pronouncement in 1996 that the era of big government was “over” has proved hollow.Credit: AP Meanwhile, Clinton’s pronouncement in another State of the Union Address, in 1996, that the era of big government was “over” has proved hollow. Americans tax themselves like a small-government country but behave like a big-government one. The US deficit is roughly 6 per cent of GDP, twice the average of recent decades and the US government stepped in to save failing companies such as Citigroup and General Motors in 2008. The situation is worse in the EU, where government sprawl is not balanced by economic vigour. European countries spend beyond their means on welfare while the bureaucracy in Brussels prides itself on its role as “regulatory giant” rather than its ability to ignite growth. Putin put paid to talk of the “peace dividend” with his invasion of Crimea in 2014 and Ukraine in 2022. But, in truth, the most serious threat to the global order comes from China, which has an economy 10 times the size of Russia and a much more disciplined leadership. From its admission into the World Trade Organisation in 2000, but gathering pace with the rise of Xi to the top job in 2013, China poured a portion of the “globalisation dividend” into building up its military might. China’s navy is the biggest in the world, and its nuclear arsenal may reach 1000 warheads by 2030, according to the US Department of Defence. It is also roaring ahead in tech. China has overtaken the West in hypersonic missiles – those capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound and evading air defences – and is pioneering lasers, orbiting space robots and high-altitude balloons. What are the chances that the next 25 years will be better than the last? The 21st century has seen the two most compelling ideologies of the 1990s malfunction horrendously. These are neo-liberalism, the belief that, overall, markets are more efficient than governments in organising economic life, and neo-conservatism, what started as a corrective to the left’s overconfidence in the power of the state to fix everything. The great danger in coming years is that we will see the further decline of a third ideology: liberalism. Across the West, liberal leaders are flailing. Kamala Harris decisively lost to a candidate who has broken one of the most important liberal rules: giving up power graciously when you lose an election. The two most flamboyant liberal politicians of the past decade – Macron in France and Justin Trudeau in Canada – are flailing. Keir Starmer won a landslide election victory in the UK on the promise of reviving the pragmatic centre only to make a mess of governing. Liberal elites have prepared the way for a populist backlash by a combination of commission and omission. They have fixated on cultural issues such as pronouns at a time when regular people are suffering from stagnant living standards. They have betrayed the principle of race-blind meritocracy by embracing race-conscious policies. And they have paid too little attention to growing worries about immigration even as expanding populations put pressure on housing and public services. The result has been to cede ground to populists such as Trump, Nigel Farage in Britain and Marine Le Pen in France. Which future we choose depends, above all, on whether liberals can once again revitalise their beliefs. There are some reasons for optimism about the future. The AI revolution has the potential to cut administrative costs while giving everyone the equivalent of a smart assistant. The collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria is a serious setback for the “axis of autocracy”, reducing Russia’s influence in the Middle East and suggesting that even the most vicious dictators can be overthrown. The Republicans’ triumph in 2024 could prove self-correcting, creating opportunities for a new generation of middle-of-the-road Democrats. Yet all this potential could go the other way. AI may destroy the jobs of millions of knowledge workers, creating a radicalised middle class, while handing more power to a few tech giants. A newly liberated Syria may break up into warring territories or fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. Trump and his allies may well destroy the rules-based international order that has largely kept the peace since 1945. An intriguing study of 120 years of populist governments suggests that the most common reaction to the failure of populism is for voters to demand yet more populism. Which future we choose depends, above all, on whether liberals can once again revitalise their beliefs or whether they will continue to drift and dither. Can they address the causes of populism, or will they continue to repeat empty phrases? Can they think like regular people, or will they continue to act like members of a global elite? Can they adapt classic liberal ideas about open competition and freedom of speech to radically new circumstances? What happens this next quarter-century depends on how well we answer these questions.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Invest in Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) stands against the other logistics stocks. Logistics companies transporting goods around the world continue to navigate uncertainty as Donald Trump plans to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. As reported by CNBC, Dave Bozeman, the new CEO of C.H. Robinson, sees an opportunity in Trump tariffs. The logistics giant is a top 3 carrier on the China-U.S. freight lane also carrying nearly 10% of the freight on the US-Mexico lane. Citi transportation analyst Ari Rosa considers the company’s business diversified enough to work through tariffs despite its global forwarding business being very exposed to China. The CEO’s stance on the tariffs was quite positive as well, as he stated: “The freight still has to move. It might just move at a different starting point, and we would still be there to move that.” In an interview with CNBC, Ravi Jakhar of the firm Allcargo Group, the world’s LCL consolidation leader and India’s largest integrated logistics solutions provider, reiterated optimism regarding the Trump tariff risks. He mentioned how over 4 years ago when sanctions came in from the Trump administration, the firm saw an increased import into its Vietnam offices from China and improved export out of Vietnam, alongside increased momentum in Indonesia and the Philippines. In his opinion, whether it is a short-term tariff sanction or a long-term structural trend, trade flows could change in terms of origins and destinations but the overall trade flows would remain robust as long as manufacturing and consumption are there. As of what’s recent in the logistics landscape, the holiday season is in full swing, with holiday surcharges playing a crucial role in profitability for logistics companies since they charge their big retail customers extra fees on a per-package basis compared to their June volume during the busy holiday season. The increase in e-commerce is also benefitting such logistics providers and full truckload carriers. Simultaneously, an increase in freight in anticipation of future tariffs is also being seen. A survey from Merchants Fleet and Atomik Research of decision-makers in organizations that typically transport freights of consumer-packaged goods throughout the US revealed that 88% saw AI as useful in alleviating pressures on their fleets this peak delivery season. AI’s data-driven capabilities are to streamline operations and decision-making, with the majority of the respondents citing supply chain optimization as a primary benefit. Other advantages mentioned were improved route optimization, enhanced inventory management, and reduced downtime by identifying maintenance issues with fleet vehicles. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now, we went through stock screeners, ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 11 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The firm offers regional, inter-regional and national LTL services through a single integrated, union-free organization. ODFL also offers a range of value-added services including container drayage, truckload brokerage and supply chain consulting, other than its core LTL services. The firm is a leading national LTL carrier, with third-party data validating its value proposition and opportunities for market share growth. The market share opportunity for Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) in the LTL market stays massive. The company is not just the leading but is deemed the best-positioned LTL carrier, with a solid history of significant revenue growth and profitability, superior customer service delivered at a fair price, ongoing opportunity to win market share, as well as an experienced and motivated team. Furthermore, Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) continues to invest to keep moving forward, building on the aforementioned progress. The firm made significant real estate purchases from 2014 to 2023 of $2.1 billion to expand and improve the service center network. The capacity to grow supported by an unmatched investment in its network and equipment further reiterates the firm’s strong positioning. Overall ODFL ranks 8th on our list of the best logistics stocks to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ODFL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News Investors Probably Missed. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NICE Ltd. (NASDAQ:NICE) stands against the other AI stocks. A December 30 report by CNBC discussed the rapid adoption of generative AI by businesses, its potential to significantly impact global GDP, and the varying perspectives of leaders on its future. As per the report, generative AI has evolved from a novelty to a key tool for businesses, with nearly two-thirds of organizations using it for tasks like customer service automation and data analysis. While its growth could potentially boost global GDP by $7 trillion in the next decade, opinions among business leaders vary. Jamie Dimon and Bill Gates view AI as transformative, comparing it to past technological breakthroughs. However, Sundar Pichai and Satya Nadella caution that further advancements will be slower, requiring deep innovation. Meanwhile, concerns about AI's ethical risks, highlighted by Warren Buffett and Mark Cuban, suggest the technology could have unintended consequences, despite its growing importance in industries like defense. READ ALSO: 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar and 10 AI News Investors Shouldn't Miss. CNBC’s TechCheck anchor, Deirdre Bosa reported on December 30 that DeepSeek, an open-source AI model developed by a Chinese research lab, has emerged as a serious competitor to leading models like GPT-4 and LLaMA 3.1. Despite using lower-cost H800 chips, which are less powerful versions of the H100, DeepSeek outperformed these models in key benchmarks and was built for just $5.5 million, a fraction of the cost of other frontier models that require hundreds of millions or even billions to develop. This signals a shift toward more commoditized AI models, where progress relies less on building new infrastructure and more on optimizing existing models. The development raises concerns for investors in major U.S. tech companies, as it challenges the long-standing dominance of firms like OpenAI. Additionally, the success of DeepSeek highlights the potential advantage of open-source models, suggesting that nations like China, without access to the latest chips or massive investments, could still compete effectively in the AI race, Bosa mentioned. The implications of this development, particularly for the U.S.-led AI dominance and global geopolitical dynamics are expected to unfold further in 2025. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A data scientist sitting in front of a monitor to review the performance of AI-driven digital business solutions. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 24 NICE Ltd. (NASDAQ: NICE) provides cloud-based AI platforms designed to improve customer engagement, automate workflows, and strengthen decision-making processes. On December 19, Jefferies downgraded NICE (NASDAQ:NICE) from Buy to Hold, citing factors such as a CEO transition, slower-than-expected cloud growth for 2025, and heightened competition. The firm reduced its price target to $200 from $215. Incoming CEO Scott Russell, formerly of SAP, has received positive feedback, but Jefferies sees potential risks from the departure of long-time CEO Barak Eilam. Analyst Samad Samana forecasted 2025 cloud revenue growth at 15%, below the 16.6% consensus, and noted increasing competition in the CCaaS market from incumbents, large software vendors, and hyperscalers introducing GenAI tools. Overall, NICE ranks 3rd on our list of AI news that investors probably missed. While we acknowledge the potential of NICE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NICE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK) the Best Pharma Dividend Stock to Buy In 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks. The pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth. Looking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape. As executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025. Innovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs. In addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges. Our Methodology In this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most. The companies listed below are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. Dividend Yield as of December 28: 3.30% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global healthcare company operating through two segments – Pharmaceutical and Animal Health. The Pharmaceutical segment offers a range of human health products, including treatments for oncology, immunology, neuroscience, virology, cardiovascular conditions, and diabetes, under well-known brands like Keytruda, Januvia, and Bridion. It also provides vaccines for various age groups under brands such as Gardasil and Pneumovax. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) has recently partnered with the Chinese biopharma company Hansoh to develop an oral GLP-1 receptor agonist for treating metabolic conditions and obesity, entering a market dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Despite strong performances in oncology and vaccines, Merck’s stock has fallen 20% over the past six months. The licensing deal with Hansoh includes a $112 million upfront payment and up to $1.9 billion in royalties and milestones. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) reported $16.7 billion in total revenues, a 4% increase, or 7% excluding foreign exchange effects. The human health business grew 8%, driven by oncology, while the Animal Health business saw an 11% sales increase. Key oncology product KEYTRUDA grew 21% to $7.4 billion, fueled by expanded use in both early and metastatic cancers. Lynparza revenue grew 13%, while sales of WELIREG more than doubled. GARDASIL sales decreased 10%, primarily due to a decline in China, though global sales increased in other regions. Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK)’s full-year earnings guidance has been adjusted to $7.72 to $7.77 per share, factoring in foreign exchange and business developments. The company remains focused on innovation, dividend growth, and pursuing strategic acquisitions. On November 19, Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share, a 5.2% increase from its prior dividend of $0.77. The dividend is distributable on January 8, 2025, to shareholders on record as of December 16. Insider Monkey’s Q3 database shows that Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) was held by 86 hedge funds, compared to 96 funds in the last quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth nearly $800 million. Overall MRK ranks 3rd on our list of the best pharma dividend stocks to buy in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Bank regulator gives BlackRock January deadline on bank stakes

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has told asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) it has until Jan. 10 to accept an agreement that would allow the agency to step up scrutiny of its investments in FDIC-regulated banking institutions, according to a person familiar with the matter. On Friday, the FDIC said it reached a similar deal with Vanguard strengthening the rules the asset manager must observe as a passive investor in FDIC-supervised banks, the latest step in a months-long tug-of-war between the banking regulator and the two biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The FDIC is pushing both firms to adopt "passivity agreements," which provide the regulator with more tools to monitor compliance on the part of the asset managers with pledges not to influence the business decisions of the FDIC-regulated banks in which they invest. The individual familiar with the state of the negotiations between BlackRock and the FDIC said the firm received the regulator's latest proposal on Friday, less than an hour after the announcement of the Vanguard agreement. That source said the wording of the proposed agreement is "substantively the same" as that of the Vanguard pact. The FDIC declined to comment on the Vanguard agreement or the negotiations with BlackRock. "We know that chief executive officers and board members of large companies carefully watch the policy pronouncements of these mega-owners," said Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a member of the FDIC board, in a statement released on Monday. "If a large asset manager is truly passive as it claims, it should have no problem complying" with the kind of passivity agreement the FDIC is seeking, Chopra said. In a public comment letter submitted to the FDIC in October, BlackRock said it already makes legally binding commitments to the Federal Reserve Board to remain a passive investor in U.S. banks. "BlackRock does not exercise control over FDIC-supervised institutions, nor does it seek to," Benjamin Tecmire, head of regulatory affairs, said in the letter. The FDIC has not stated what consequences might follow if BlackRock does not meet the Jan. 10 deadline.

By Suzanne McGee Dec 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has told asset manager BlackRock it has until Jan. 10 to accept an agreement that would allow the agency to step up scrutiny of its investments in FDIC-regulated banking institutions, according to a person familiar with the matter. On Friday, the FDIC said it reached a similar deal with Vanguard strengthening the rules the asset manager must observe as a passive investor in FDIC-supervised banks, the latest step in a months-long tug-of-war between the banking regulator and the two biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The FDIC is pushing both firms to adopt "passivity agreements," which provide the regulator with more tools to monitor compliance on the part of the asset managers with pledges not to influence the business decisions of the FDIC-regulated banks in which they invest. The individual familiar with the state of the negotiations between BlackRock and the FDIC said the firm received the regulator's latest proposal on Friday, less than an hour after the announcement of the Vanguard agreement. That source said the wording of the proposed agreement is "substantively the same" as that of the Vanguard pact. The FDIC declined to comment on the Vanguard agreement or the negotiations with BlackRock. "We know that chief executive officers and board members of large companies carefully watch the policy pronouncements of these mega-owners," said Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and a member of the FDIC board, in a statement released on Monday. "If a large asset manager is truly passive as it claims, it should have no problem complying" with the kind of passivity agreement the FDIC is seeking, Chopra said. In a public comment letter submitted to the FDIC in October, BlackRock said it already makes legally binding commitments to the Federal Reserve Board to remain a passive investor in U.S. banks. "BlackRock does not exercise control over FDIC-supervised institutions, nor does it seek to," Benjamin Tecmire, head of regulatory affairs, said in the letter. The FDIC has not stated what consequences might follow if BlackRock does not meet the Jan. 10 deadline.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Pot Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GrowGeneration Corp. (NASDAQ:GRWG) stands against other pot stocks to buy according to analysts. The global marijuana market is growing and the market for legal cannabis is expected to rise at a CAGR of 25.7% and reach $102.2 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. Despite regulatory limitations, the cannabis industry is getting attention from investors, suppliers, and researchers. If we want to know how hedge funds feel about pot stocks, we recently covered 11 Best Cannabis Stocks To Invest In according to hedge fund sentiment. A total of 38 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medicinal use. In addition, 24 states and the District of Columbia allow cannabis for adults’ recreational use. As the push for legalization continues to grow, more people are accepting the idea of legalizing marijuana across the US. The US is the leading country with the highest weed consumption in the world. If you want to know where most weed is consumed in the US (See Here: 30 Cities with the Highest Weed Consumption in the US). The American legal cannabis industry experienced notable growth in 2023 as legal sales across the US were $28.8 billion, up by 10.3% year-over-year. Consequently, the legal cannabis market added 22,952 new jobs in 2023, reflecting a better business atmosphere, especially in the cannabis industry. In 2024, the legal cannabis industry supported over 440,445 jobs, an increase of 5.4% from 2023, as per the 2024 Vangst Jobs Report. The major driver for the cannabis industry remains the rising demand for its use for medical purposes. In the coming years, new markets are expected to fuel growth in the cannabis industry. One such example is Nebraska’s vote in favour of legalizing medical marijuana last month. As we write this article, 24 states have legalized recreational weed in America, in addition to the District of Columbia. However, selling or possessing marijuana remains a crime under federal law. In November, Florida voters rejected a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana, which was a major setback for the legal cannabis industry in the US. Amendment 3 fell short of the required 60% threshold for legalization, despite historic funding levels and an endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump. Florida remains home to the country’s largest medical marijuana market, adding around $2 billion in annual revenue. Amendment 3 could have boosted the cannabis market to a projected $6 billion by 2026. Florida voters will have to wait for two more years until cannabis legalization gets back on the ballot. Florida has disappointed cannabis investors and consumers and it has had an impact on cannabis stocks. One of the first cannabis ETFs, Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF, has plunged over 45% since November 4, as of December 23. ​​You can also visit and see 12 Cheap Chinese Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.

Title: Dungeons & Dragons causes controversy with rule change over identity

Fox News Insider "Races" are now "species" in the beloved game Dungeons & Dragons, which recently marked its 50th anniversary, irking some loyal fans. "Some character traits have been divorced from biological identity; a mountain dwarf is no longer inherently brawny and durable, a high elf no longer intelligent and dexterous by definition," a report in The New York Times explains. "And Wizards of the Coast, the Dungeons & Dragons publisher owned by Hasbro, has endorsed a trend throughout role-playing games in which players are empowered to halt the proceedings if they ever feel uncomfortable." The company also now suggests that extended Dungeons & Dragons campaigns begin with sessions allowing players to lay out their expectations and which topics they wish to avoid, which could include sexual assault or drug use, the Times writes. "What they’re trying to do here is put up a signal flare, to not only current players but potential future players, that this game is a safe, inclusive, thoughtful and sensitive approach to fantasy storytelling," said Ryan Lessard, a writer and frequent Dungeons & Dragons dungeon master, according to the report. ENTERTAINMENT INSIDER SAYS ESG FUNDING IS WHY WOKE ENTERTAINMENT KEEPS GETTING MADE DESPITE LOSING AUDIENCES Chris Pine, star of the "Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves" movie. (Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty Images) But some gamers are frustrated. "It’s an unnecessary thing," Robert J. Kuntz, an award-winning game designer who frequently collaborated with Gary Gygax, a co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons, told the Times. "It attempts to play into something that I’m not sure is even worthy of addressing, as if the word ‘race’ is bad." AP UNDER FIRE AFTER OLYMPIC BOXER WHO FAILED GENDER TEST NAMED AMONG ‘FEMALE ATHLETES OF THE YEAR’ Wizards of the Coast executives defended the new rules by saying players desired greater leeway in creating their characters. But some have slammed the attempt at a more "inclusive" game that some argue comes at the expense of the game's authenticity. Darren Kent on the "Dungeons & Dragons" red carpet. (Carey Dodd Associates) BLACKROCK ADMITS ESG ADVOCACY COULD PROVE BAD FOR BUSINESS In an X thread about the new Wizards of the Coast Players Handbook and Dungeon Master's Guide that analyzed D&D’s origins in the 1970s, users blasted WoTC and Hasbro for distancing themselves from the game's original creators due to their apparent insensitivites. The foreword claims the original role-playing game largely excluded women or portrayed them "disrespectfully," and portrayed slavery "not as a human tragedy but as a commercial transaction." "Wizards of the woke," one X user said in response to the passage. X owner Elon Musk weighed in with an even blunter message. "Nobody, and I mean nobody, gets to trash E. Gary Gygax and the geniuses who created Dungeons & Dragons," he wrote. "What the f--- is wrong with Hasbro and WoTC?? May they burn in hell." Musk also weighed in on a passage Babylon Bee editor Kyle Mann highlighted in which players in the game's latest iteration are encouraged to signal if they are triggered by any of the game's content. "Wtf," Musk simply replied. Fox News Digital reached out to Hasbro for comment. Mark Kern, a former team lead of "World of Warcraft," recently weighed in on how the video game industry and entertainment at large cater to progressive views in their content in exchange for access to money. One consultant agency, Sweet Baby Inc., for instance, described itself as an "inclusion-focused narrative and consultation company" working toward "diversifying and enriching the video games industry." "There is a coordinated effort to insert diversity politics into games by ALL parties involved to the detriment of the quality of the games themselves. Sweet Baby’s Inc.’s very public and self published involvement is just the tip of the iceberg," Kern told Fox News Digital.

Title: Chopra: Regulators Must Do More to Ensure Investment Managers Aren’t ‘Improperly Influencing’ Banks
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/bank-regulation/2024/chopra-regulators-must-do-more-to-ensure-investment-managers-arent-improperly-influencing-banks/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T21:44:43Z
Full Content:
Recent steps taken by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will help ensure that fund managers are not “improperly influencing” decisions made by FDIC-supervised banks, Rohit Chopra, member of the FDIC board of directors and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) said in a Monday (Dec. 30) statement. Chopra said in the statement that very large investment managers like BlackRock and Vanguard own stakes both in commercial enterprises and in banks and that these firms often characterize their involvement with these companies as “passive.” “However, we know that chief executive officers and board members of large companies carefully watch the policy pronouncements of these mega-owners,” Chopra said. “If these firms are not truly ‘passive,’ they may be in violation of longstanding statutes, including those relating to banking.” Chopra’s statement came after the Friday (Dec. 27) release of an amended advisory opinion by the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, saying that large “passive” asset managers may not have a representative on the board of directors of a bank in which they have a significant ownership stake. In addition, the FDIC said Friday that it entered into an investor passivity agreement with Vanguard in which the agency has advanced tools to ensure that the company remains passive in terms of its ownership stake in FDIC-insured banks. Reached by PYMNTS, Vanguard said in an emailed statement that the agreement is part of its ongoing commitment to passive investing. “Vanguard is built around passive investing and has long been committed to working constructively with policymakers to ensure that passive means passive,” the statement said. “This agreement with the FDIC is another example and recognition of that ongoing commitment.” BlackRock did not immediately reply to PYMNTS’ request for comment. In his Monday statement, Chopra said the steps taken by the FDIC are “small, but significant” and advance the goal of ensuring that fund managers are not “improperly influencing” FDIC-supervised banks. “Agencies across government charged with safeguarding critical sectors of the economy from conflicts of interest and anticompetitive conduct will need to take further steps with respect to these large investment managers,” Chopra said. We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Is Amgen Inc. (AMGN) the Best Pharma Dividend Stock to Buy In 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) stands against the other pharma dividend stocks. The pharmaceutical industry in 2024 faced a relatively quiet year, with deal volumes similar to 2023 but lower deal values, reflecting a shift toward smaller, more strategic transactions. Despite challenges such as patent expirations and market uncertainty, innovation remains strong, and there is a better investment environment for biotech. Lower interest rates have also eased capital costs, contributing to increased mergers and acquisitions activity. Biotech IPOs and venture capital investments are seeing a slight recovery, though investment is more concentrated in established companies. However, major pharmaceutical companies face a $300 billion growth gap due to patent expirations, making dealmaking crucial for future growth. Looking ahead to 2025, EY believes that the pharmaceutical sector is expected to see more deal activity, especially if interest rates remain low. There may be a rise in larger acquisitions to address growth gaps, although smaller, strategic deals are likely to persist. Politically, the US policy environment is shifting with potential impacts on business, including lower corporate taxes and deregulation, but also the possibility of higher tariffs and continued drug pricing reforms. Changes in immigration and leadership within health agencies could also affect the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, with new appointees potentially disrupting the regulatory landscape. As executives prepare for 2025, drug pricing and access remain their top concerns, according to a Deloitte survey. The survey highlighted that primary concerns include competition from generic drugs and biosimilars and the looming patent cliff, with over $300 billion in sales at risk due to expiring patents by 2030. This has executives expecting a surge in mergers and acquisitions in 2025. Innovation remains at the forefront as companies look to fill gaps left by expiring patents. However, competition in profitable areas like oncology and immunology is fierce, leading to price pressures even before generics or biosimilars hit the market. On the flip side, the success of GLP-1 receptor agonists is sparking renewed interest in general medicines, with companies racing to tap into the $200 billion market. Additionally, about 20% of companies are adjusting their portfolios to focus on high-potential candidates and better meet market demands. Advanced therapies like cell and gene therapies are also gaining attention, with a shift away from more traditional drugs. In addition to the competitive landscape, life sciences companies are also keeping a close eye on regulatory changes. In the United States, concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act are growing, while in Europe, shifts in clinical trial regulations could add complexity. As a result, life sciences companies are preparing for a year of both innovation-driven growth and regulatory challenges. Our Methodology In this article, we reviewed Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database to identify pharmaceutical dividend stocks that hedge funds favored the most. The companies listed below are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A pharmacist filling a prescription for a complex drug developed by the company. Dividend Yield as of December 28: 3.61% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) develops and delivers human therapeutics globally. Its key products address conditions like psoriasis, osteoporosis, cardiovascular risks, cancer, and anemia. Amgen is particularly appealing due to its undervaluation and strong pipeline, including the experimental obesity drug MariTide, which could significantly boost its valuation. Even without MariTide’s success, Amgen’s intrinsic value remains solid. This favorable risk/reward dynamic, combined with its strong fundamentals, makes Amgen a compelling choice, with the potential for significant upside as the pharma sector stabilizes. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) is also 8th on our list of the best dividend stocks. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) reported strong Q3 results with a 23% revenue increase to $8.5 billion, driven by double-digit growth in 10 products. Key drivers included a 17% rise in oncology sales, a 21% increase in rare disease sales, and a 67% growth in TEZSPIRE for severe asthma. Repatha and EVENITY also showed strong performance in general medicine. The company’s pipeline progress, particularly with the obesity drug MariTide, positions it for long-term growth. Biosimilars also performed well, with a 9% sales increase. Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) returned capital to shareholders with a 6% increase in its dividend, paying $2.25 per share in Q2. For 2024, the company expects total revenues between $33.0 billion and $33.8 billion, with non-GAAP EPS ranging from $19.20 to $20. Q4 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be lower than Q3 due to planned investments in key assets like MariTide and olpasiran, as well as other strategic initiatives. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 database, Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) was found in 68 public stock portfolios, compared to 69 in the last quarter. Two Sigma Advisors is one of the most prominent stakeholders of the company. Overall AMGN ranks 8th on our list of the best pharma dividend stocks to buy in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AMGN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMGN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Fidelity lifts valuation of Elon Musk's X and xAI even higher
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/fidelity-boosts-valuation-elon-musk-x-xai-2024-12
Time Published: 2024-12-30T21:02:36Z
Full Content:
Fidelity has lifted its valuation of two Elon Musk-controlled tech companies even higher, according to recent filings. This was the second month in a row that the mutual-fund giant raised the value of its stakes in xAI and the social-media platform X, the filings show. The Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund valued its xAI shares at $79,857,865 at the end of November, a monthly report posted at the end of December said. That's a 6.4% increase from October, when the fund valued its stake in xAI at $75,062,706, and an increase from September, when the value was $44,152,362. The fund's annual report, published at the end of September, said that at the end of July it owned 3,688,585 xAI shares, which were acquired on May 13 for $44,152,000. However, xAI recently closed a hotly anticipated funding round that Fidelity participated in alongside A16z, BlackRock, Kingdom Holding, Lightspeed, and other investors. xAI confirmed the $6 billion round in a blog post on December 23. It's unclear how many shares of xAI the Blue Chip Growth Fund has now, but previous filings showed that the price from September to October rose to $20.35 a pop from $11.96. Fidelity's Blue Chip Growth Fund also increased the value of its shares in X in November to $5,797,734, according to the filings. That's about a 5% increase from October, when shares were valued at $5,530,358, and a 39% increase from September, when Fidelity valued its stake in X at $4,185,614. Musk's 2022 acquisition was panned as one of the most overvalued tech acquisitions in recent memory. But the deal has provided significant benefits for Musk. After using X to support Donald Trump's reelection, he's set to wield considerable influence in the incoming Trump administration. X has also been a lucrative source of training data for xAI, which has used content on the social-media platform to develop powerful AI models that compete with similar offerings from OpenAI, Google and other tech companies. But the X deal still hasn't worked out that well for investors, at least not yet. Despite two straight months of increases, Fidelity still values its X stake far lower than it did in late 2022, when Musk purchased X for $44 billion. Earlier filings indicate Fidelity's Blue Chip Growth Fund at the time invested $19.66 million. Representatives for Fidelity declined to comment on Monday. Representatives for X and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. Correction: December 31, 2024 — An earlier version of this story mistakenly reported the number of times in a row that Fidelity has increased the value of its stake in xAI and X. The correct number is two months in a row. Jump to

Title: Report: BlackRock’s Record ETF Offering Helped Bitcoin Hit $100K
URL: https://www.pymnts.com/blockchain/bitcoin/2024/blackrock-record-etf-offering-helped-bitcoin-hit-100000-dollars/
Time Published: 2024-12-30T20:18:43Z

BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is reportedly a record-breaker, in more ways than one. The company’s iShares unit offers 1,400-plus ETFs, including its Bitcoin Trust, which launched this year, Bloomberg reported Monday, (Dec. 30). That trust, known as IBIT, now has more than $50 billion in assets, the strongest debut ever for an ETF, and the size of more than 50 European market-focused ETFs put together. “IBIT’s growth is unprecedented. It’s the fastest ETF to reach most milestones, faster than any other ETF in any asset class,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart, per the report, adding that — at the current asset level and an expense ratio of 0.25% — IBIT can expect to earn around $112 million per year. IBIT’s success goes beyond BlackRock and helped mark a turning point for bitcoin, according to the report. BlackRock — the world’s largest investment firm — has more than $11 trillion in assets under management, so its embrace of bitcoin ETFs helped push the cryptocurrency’s price above $100,000 for the first time, the report said. This year began with the Securities and Exchange Commission approving bitcoin ETFs after years of opposing the idea. The move was cheered by figures throughout the cryptocurrency sector, including Sui Chung, CEO of Kraken-owned CF Benchmarks. “A spot ETF has always been important because it stands to open bitcoin up to a much broader swathe of investors,” Chung said in a statement to PYMNTS at the time. “We look forward to working with asset-allocators as they incorporate this new asset class into their portfolios and models, significantly increasing the number of investors who could have BTC exposure.” Coinbase, meanwhile, called the approval a “watershed moment for the crypto economy” on its company blog, saying the ETFs “will help catalyze further growth and innovation and expand the size and breadth of crypto markets.” This year has been momentous for cryptocurrency. “The changes of 2024 laid the groundwork for a more resilient and integrated crypto ecosystem,” PYMNTS wrote last week. “Regulatory clarity, technological advancements and growing institutional interest signaled that the industry was entering a new phase of maturity. However, achieving mainstream adoption will require continued innovation, collaboration and a commitment to addressing the challenges that remain.” We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Ethereum Price Declines Despite Record Staking And ETF Activity

Time Published: 2024-12-30T20:00:09Z

Recent Ethereum market swings have revealed an interesting disparity between price and network activity. Staking activity has kept rising while ETH retreated to $3,400, a 16% drop from its December peak. Due to investors staking record amounts of ETH, the total staked assets have exceeded expectations. Even while short-term price fluctuations have led some to doubt Ethereum’s viability, this surge in staking is a sign of growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s long-term worth. Another significant development is the increase in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are concentrated on Ethereum. The net total of $2.68 billion has been amassed over the past 25 days, with ETF inflows recorded on 23 days. On December 27, the total net assets of ETFs exceeded $12 billion as a result of the nearly $48 million in daily inflows, data from SoSoValue shows. The Ethereum ETF offered by BlackRock has garnered the majority of these investments, underscoring the institutional interest in ETH in defiance of the recent price decline. The popularity of Ethereum spot ETF reflects the larger crypto market, in which ETFs are starting to be a preferred choice for both institutional and ordinary investors. On the other hand, significant inflows of Bitcoin ETFs in recent months suggest that traditional financial markets are progressively welcoming digital assets. Ethereum’s price decline, on the other hand, illuminates an alternative narrative. Ether’s price drop is likely to be driven by profit-taking following its recent rally and broader macroeconomic uncertainties, as the cryptocurrency market remains volatile. Regulatory pressures and concerns about the likelihood of another interest rate rise have accentuated the cautious mentality of traders. Despite the slump, some analysts see this as a time of consolidation rather than cause for worry. They note that Ethereum’s staking and ETF inflows are strong markers of long-term market confidence. Ethereum’s most recent advancements occur amid an atmosphere of optimism regarding its ecosystem. Continued attention is being drawn to recent enhancements, such as the transition to proof-of-stake and ongoing scalability improvements. These developments are enabling Ethereum to preserve its leadership in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi). It’s important for investors to keep a long-term view while also being able to handle short-term fluctuations. The changing nature of crypto investing can be seen in the growing use of ETFs and staking. The price of Ethereum may go up and down, but its network and use cases are still strong.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Why Is Amylyx Pharmaceuticals (AMLX) Among the Best Biotech Penny Stocks to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Biotech Penny Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) stands against the other best biotech penny stocks to invest in now. Goldman Sachs has spotlighted an often-overlooked sector poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs: biotechnology stocks. In a recent note to clients, John Flood, Goldman’s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, highlighted biotech as an under-the-radar opportunity for those seeking to capitalize on the Fed’s rate cuts. Flood noted that biotechnology stocks are uniquely sensitive to changes in interest rates as they often rely on projected future profits and are heavily impacted by the cost of capital. With little or no current profitability but significant upside potential, if clinical trials succeed, these stocks have an “option-like structure” that makes them particularly responsive to interest rate movements. The note also emphasized that biotech has recently seen improved fundamentals driven by positive clinical outcomes and a more favorable regulatory environment. Despite these tailwinds, biotech remains under-owned by hedge funds. According to Goldman’s data, the sector ranks in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year and just the 4th percentile over the past five years. Recent performance data supports Goldman’s outlook. The iShares Biotech ETF climbed 7.7% in Q3, outperforming the Nasdaq Biotech Index and more than doubling the S&P 500’s 3.2% gain over the same period. For investors anticipating a continued decline in bond yields, Goldman suggests biotechnology stocks may offer more attractive exposure compared to other rate-sensitive equity sectors, which are more dependent on broader economic growth trends.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance on October 30, Stacey Sears, Portfolio Manager at Emerald Advisers, provided a comprehensive overview of the current landscape and investment opportunities in small and emerging biotechnology companies. Sears acknowledged that there has been a significant innovation in the healthcare industry, especially over the past 20 to 30 years, which was catalyzed after the decoding of the human genome in 2003, as it identified over 8,000 genetic diseases. This breakthrough provided a roadmap for researchers and scientists, leading to accelerated innovation in areas such as DNA and RNA editing and the development of treatments for orphan and rare diseases. Sears noted that small and emerging biotechnology companies have been at the forefront of this innovation. In 2023, approximately two-thirds of all clinical trials were initiated by small and emerging biotechnology firms, and about 56% of new drug substances approved by regulatory bodies originated from these smaller companies. Sears pointed out that the sector has been underperforming over the past couple of years. This underperformance is largely due to the inverse correlation between healthcare stocks and interest rates and yields. However, she noted that the sector is now starting to see a favorable shift. Clinical advancements have continued unabated, and the pipeline of new treatments and drugs remains robust. Large pharmaceutical companies are facing a patent cliff, estimated to be around $30 billion by the end of this decade as their drugs become generic. Small and emerging biotechnology companies are seen as key sources for filling this pipeline. This situation is creating a potential M&A tailwind, as larger companies look to acquire innovative smaller firms to bolster their drug pipelines. The biotechnology sector presents a unique investment opportunity, driven by favorable interest rates, ongoing clinical advancements, and increased M&A activity. Small and emerging biotech firms, in particular, are poised to play a critical role in addressing unmet medical needs and fueling innovation in the healthcare space.

To compile our list of the 12 best biotech penny stocks to invest in now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 30 largest biotechnology companies trading below the price of $5 as of December 26. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 12 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 26 Stock Price as of December 26: $4.00 Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is a biotechnology company dedicated to developing innovative treatments for patients with neurodegenerative diseases and endocrine conditions characterized by high unmet medical needs. The company has built a robust pipeline of promising therapies, including avexitide, AMX0035, and AMX0114. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is focusing on the advancement of avexitide, a GLP-1 receptor antagonist with both FDA therapy and orphan drug designations. Avexitide is being developed for the treatment of post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH), a debilitating condition that affects a significant portion of bariatric surgery patients. The company is on track to initiate a pivotal Phase III trial in PBH in the first quarter of 2025. This trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avexitide in reducing hypoglycemia events, with topline data expected in 2026. The positive results from earlier clinical trials, including a 66% reduction in Level 3 hypoglycemia events and a 53% reduction in Level 2 hypoglycemia events, provide a strong foundation for the Phase III program. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) is also focusing on the continued development of AMX0035, a novel therapy with potential applications in multiple rare neurodegenerative diseases. The company recently reported positive topline data from the Phase II HELIOS trial of AMX0035 in Wolfram syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive insulin-dependent diabetes, optic atrophy, and deafness. The trial demonstrated significant improvements in pancreatic function and other disease measures, providing a strong rationale for advancing AMX0035 into a Phase III program. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMLX) plans to meet with the FDA and other stakeholders to inform the design of this Phase III trial, with updates expected in 2025. Additionally, the ORION trial of AMX0035 in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is recruiting well, and the company expects to share interim data in mid-2025. Overall, AMLX ranks 5th on our list of best biotech penny stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AMLX to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMLX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Mysterious $361.5 Million Bitcoin Transfer Sparks Hot Discussion Within Community
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/mysterious-3615-million-bitcoin-transfer-sparks-hot-discussion-within-community-3791876

U.Today - The crypto community carefully watches the blockchain space for large transactions, which reflect the current whale activity. According to Whale Alert, a blockchain sleuth that tracks down large cryptocurrency transfers, earlier today, a massive amount of Bitcoin was transferred by cryptocurrency whales. The post said that anonymous wallets had exchanged $361,584,691worth of Bitcoin — 3,856 BTC. In the comments thread, an X user pointed out at the mighty power of blockchain transfers, which cannot be beaten by bank transactions — the transfer fee for moving the $361.5 million in crypto comprised merely 0,00066 BTC, which equates to $61,57: “Thats the power of payment. You can pay this much for 2 usd fees.” Another commentator wrote that this potentially could be an over-the-counter (OTC) purchase/sale or a cryptocurrency exchange/whale restructuring their crypto wallets: “Large BTC transfer indicates potential OTC deal or exchange cold wallet restructuring.” Kiyosaki touched on several topics in it. The first was criticizing the boss of the world’s largest wealth management fund BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Larry Fink. Kiyosaki tweeted that Fink had begun to dump BTC, most likely referring to massive — close to $200 million — Bitcoin outflows by the company last week in a single day. Then the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” author said that he would continue to buy Bitcoin, contrary to his earlier tweets, in which he claimed that once BTC surpassed $100,000, he would stop doing that. The world’s largest cryptocurrency soared above $108,000 in early December, but currently it is trading at slightly above the $93,000 price level. Kiyosaki believes that Larry Fink is suppressing the price so that whales are able to continue buying it. Financial guru Kiyosaki also doubled down on his ultra-bullish price prediction, made approximately a month ago. According to it, the investment expert sees Bitcoin soaring as high as $350,000 next year, largely thanks to a pro-Bitcoin presidential candidate winning the recent election.

Title: Is UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) the Best Stock for 10 Years?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Long-Term Stock Portfolio: Best Stocks for 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) stands against the other long-term stocks. To select stocks with long-term growth potential, investors should focus on fundamental analysis, evaluating financial health through earnings history, revenue growth, and profit margins. Companies that consistently demonstrate earnings growth and possess a strong competitive advantage are more likely to thrive over time. Investing in dividend-paying stocks is also beneficial, as those that regularly increase dividends indicate financial stability. Identifying stocks in growing industries, such as technology, renewable energy, and healthcare, can further guide investment choices. Diversification across various sectors reduces risk, ensuring that underperformance in one area can be balanced by gains in another. By combining such strategies, investors can improve their chances of finding promising stocks that align with long-term financial goals. On December 26, Drew Pettit, Director at Citi Research, discussed his long-term investment strategy on CNBC as he looks ahead to 2025, emphasizing a "barbell" approach that balances high-growth stocks with lower valuation names. This is relevant for investors considering a long-term stock portfolio over the next decade. Pettit advocates for pairing mega-cap growth stocks with cyclical and defensive sectors, where fundamentals are expected to improve. He believes that adopting this barbell strategy can enhance portfolio resilience and capitalize on diverse market opportunities. In the realm of AI, Pettit noted a growing enthusiasm among investors. He highlighted a shift in perception, moving beyond backend applications to include companies that are more customer-facing within the AI value chain. When it comes to specific investments within AI, Pettit expressed a preference for semiconductors over software at this time. He pointed to Marvell Technology as a standout choice, projecting that its custom AI chip business could experience remarkable growth, projected at 200% next year, followed by an additional 60% growth in the subsequent year. Pettit also discussed his strategy for 2025 and outlined plans to reduce exposure to consumer stocks while focusing on attractive areas within the sector that are less sensitive to interest rates. He highlighted the potential of fintech and payment companies and said that they are well-positioned for long-term growth amid deregulation. Pettit emphasized that his firm's focus is not on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but on traditional payment networks. He expressed concerns about consumer data trends and interest rate changes, advocating for a balanced approach by seeking high-quality stocks less affected by rate fluctuations and recommending key positions such Big Tech for long-term investment. Methodology We first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top blue-chip stocks with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate of over 10%. We then selected the 10 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A senior healthcare professional giving advice to a patient in a clinic. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 11.88% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 112 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) is a global healthcare company that offers health insurance plans through its UnitedHealthcare segment, and healthcare services through its OptumHealth segment. UnitedHealthcare provides health plans for individuals, employers, and government programs. OptumHealth offers health services like pharmacy care services, health information and technology, care delivery, care management, and population health management. Its key growth driver is its strategic transition to value-based care, a healthcare delivery model that prioritizes improving patient outcomes and reducing costs by incentivizing quality over quantity. This is demonstrated by the company's significant investments in OptumHealth. In 2023, OptumHealth revenues grew by over $2 billion, reaching ~$26 billion, driven by an increase in the number and type of care services offered and the patients served. Patients served by OptumHealth's value-based care models have shown improvements in key health metrics. For example, they are more likely to receive cancer screenings, have better control of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and are 10% less likely to experience emergency room visits or be readmitted to the hospital compared to patients in traditional fee-for-service models. UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s (NYSE:UNH) is well-positioned to capitalize on the evolving healthcare landscape and continue to deliver strong financial performance. Parnassus Value Equity Fund finds an attractive investment opportunity in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), a high-quality company with strong long-term growth prospects trading at a discounted valuation. Here's what the firm stated in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We purchased two new stocks, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and Amazon. These are high-quality businesses facing temporary issues, which allowed us to purchase them at discounted valuations. The addition of UnitedHealth increases our small overweight to the Health Care sector. UnitedHealth benefits from secular tailwinds of an aging population, health care cost inflation and increasingly relevant use of heath care data/analytics. It also commands industry leadership when it comes to its extensive assets, vertical integration and deep management bench. Even though the stock has underperformed in the past year, we believe many of those factors have been priced in, positioning it well for growth in the near term.” Overall UNH ranks 6th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of UNH as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UNH but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A pharmacist handing out a pharmaceutical drug to a patient in a drug store or chemist. 10-Year Revenue CAGR: 10.97% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 68 AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is a global biopharmaceutical company that specializes in developing and marketing innovative medicines and therapies for several health conditions. It prioritizes R&D to discover new treatments for complex diseases and maintains a competitive advantage through its diverse product portfolio. Humira, a flagship drug for autoimmune diseases, was a top revenue generator for the company, reaching sales of $21 billion in 2022. However, in Q3 2024, Humira's revenues declined to $2.23 billion, a 37.2% year-over-year decrease, attributed to the loss of patent exclusivity in 2023 and increased competition from biosimilar drugs. Still, the total revenue for AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) rose by 3.8% year-over-year. The immunology segment was a key driver of this growth, generating $7.05 billion in revenue, a ~4% increase year-over-year. The company continues to be a strong investment option for long-term investors. It maintains robust financial performance and consistently rewards shareholders with attractive returns. In its Q3 2024 investor letter, Polaris Global Equity Strategy discussed the strong performance of the US biopharma sector, with AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) demonstrating successful growth despite Humira's exclusivity loss. Here's what the firm had to say: “U.S. biopharma/biotech companies topped the health care sector, with the majority of holdings posting returns in excess of 10%. AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) showed positive top-line growth from its immunosuppressive drugs, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Abbvie’s management continues to work through the loss of exclusivity from Humira, switching patients to Skyrizi or Rinvoq rather than Humira biosimilars.” Overall ABBV ranks 10th on our list of the best stocks for 10 years. While we acknowledge the growth potential of ABBV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Jim Cramer Says Powell Industries, Inc. (POWL)’s Numbers Were Incredible, Stock Now Up 156% YTD

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 10 Industrial Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) stands against the other industrial stocks. As 2024 comes to an end, the flagship S&P index is up by 25.9% year to date, driven primarily by technology stocks and investors rushing to pile into artificial intelligence. Additionally, as opposed to earlier worries of a recession, the US GDP has continued to grow as well. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), America's economy grew by 3.1% in Q3. According to the IMF, the US GDP is projected to grow by 2.8% in 2024 and stand out from most of the developed world and China. Yet, while technology stocks and the industry are eye-catching, they are not the only components of the economy. In 2024, while the overall economy has grown, some sectors haven't done well. One sector that's often perceived to be the pulse of the economy is the industrial sector. It measures output from large-scale plants, and in today's era of high interest rates, industrial stocks haven't done too well. For instance, while the broader S&P is up 25.9%, its industrial component has managed to post 16.94% in gains this year. The sluggishness in the industrial sector hasn't gone unnoticed by Jim Cramer either. On the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points but reduced 2025's projected rate cuts to two from an earlier four, Cramer commented on the state of the American economy ahead of the Fed's announcement. He outlined the need to look at other sectors apart from technology. "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks," said Cramer, adding "There are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn’t like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!” Cramer wondered why the Fed was cutting rates at all since the economy appeared to be quite robust. He stressed the need to sift through the data to find out the real state of the economy. According to Cramer, "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that if you look at what we’re seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it’s not strong either if you count colds.” The CNBC host wasn't convinced by the Atlanta Fed's estimate of the US GDP growing by 3.2% in Q4. He stated that he was "trying to find why. I’m trying to find where that is. You know David that travel’s very strong yeah. Leisure’s very strong. Dining out’s very strong. These are strong and by the way, they’re very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don’t know what kind of weighting they have but wow.” Another sector that's representative of the broader economy and ties closely with industrial stocks is the automobile sector. Automotive firms often depend on the outputs of industrial firms, and if the industry is slow then industrial firms also face a demand slowdown. America's two biggest auto manufacturers, the firms behind the F-150 truck and the company developing the Cruise autonomous driving system, have both struggled in the stock market in 2024. The former's stock is down 17.5% year-to-date and the latter was up by a mere 10.5% by early August when investors were more uncertain about the economic outlook. Similarly, Elon Musk's car company had gained just 1.22% ahead of the election as its EV business continued to struggle with competition overseas and slow sales in the US. Cramer also commented on the trouble that the automotive sector is facing during the program. He was perplexed as to why "the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti." It's important to dig deeper into the automobile industry since it "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers,” Cramer commented. Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about industrial stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out industrial and materials stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A circuit breaker installed in a control panel illuminated by bright LEDs. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 26 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-19-24 Performance Since Then: 35.10% Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) is an industrial equipment provider that primarily makes and sells electrical equipment. Its products are used across a wide range of industries such as utilities, energy exploration, and most important, data centers. Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL)'s utility and data center businesses have catalyzed the shares this year which are up by 156% year-to-date. The growth has come on the back of the firm's revenue growing by 45% in its fiscal year 2024. The stock soared by 26% after Trump's victory in the November election as investors expected Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL) to benefit from lower regulation in energy exploration and a broader economic recovery. Here's what Cramer said in August: “Lately, the market has fallen in love with a particular kind of industrial stock. These are still smokestack stocks, but they also have powerful secular growth drivers, meaning they can thrive even if the economy doesn’t accelerate. Tonight, I have a smaller company that falls into the same category: Powell Industries. This company has been around since 1947 and went public decades ago. However, the stock has caught my attention over the past couple of years, skyrocketing from $20 in late September 2022 to $171 today—a gain of more than 700%. So, what does this company do, and how did the stock manage to catch fire like this? More importantly, can it keep running once the Fed starts blessing us with rate hikes? Overall POWL ranks 9th on our list of the industrial stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of POWL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than POWL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why The 60/40 Portfolio Needs Bitcoin In Today’s Market
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/30/why-the-6040-portfolio-needs-bitcoin-in-todays-market/

Metallic Bitcoin symbol with financial chart over dark background. Horizontal composition with ... [+] selective focus and copy space. If you happen to be a Bitcoin skeptic, you’re not alone. A recent Pew Research survey found that 63% of Americans are not confident in the reliability or safety of cryptocurrencies in general. But when BlackRock speaks, it often pays to listen. In its just-released 2025 Global Outlook report, the world’s largest asset management firm lays out a case for Bitcoin not only as a diversifier alongside gold but also a strategic hedge against an environment where the historical stock-bond correlation is breaking down. For decades, the classic 60/40 portfolio—60% stocks, 40% bonds—was the gold standard of diversification. When stocks crashed, as they did during the dotcom bubble and global financial crisis, bonds usually rose in value, providing a cushion against market volatility. But we’re in a new regime now where this correlation has become increasingly unreliable. If you recall, 2022 was the worst year on record for U.S. stocks and bonds. BlackRock identifies this trend and suggests that investors need to look beyond government bonds for diversification. This is where gold and Bitcoin come into play. Both assets offer unique advantages as hedges and diversifiers, but they do so in different ways. Bitcoin’s potential as a portfolio diversifier stems from its unique value proposition. It has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and its demand is influenced by adoption trends, investor sentiment and macroeconomic factors. In the days following the November election, Bitcoin surged above $100,000, with its market cap topping $2 trillion—just under 2% of the total value of global equities. Bitcoin's market cap approaches 2% of global equities Last Thursday, Bitcoin tumbled 3.6%, falling back below $100,000, on the news that the Federal Reserve will approve fewer interest rate cuts than the market expected next year. BlackRock isn’t suggesting that Bitcoin should replace bonds in your portfolio. Instead, they’re recommending a modest allocation—1% to 2%—to capture its diversification benefits without significantly increasing risk. In fact, a 2% Bitcoin allocation provides a similar risk profile to holding the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla) in a balanced portfolio. Even though Bitcoin’s market cap has fallen below $2 trillion, it remains the seventh-largest asset in the world, ahead of Saudi Aramco and even silver. The global gold market, by comparison, is valued at $17.8 trillion—nine times larger than Bitcoin. But Bitcoin’s growth trajectory is undeniable. Before its price declined, it took 40 ounces of gold to buy one Bitcoin. That’s roughly double what it was at the beginning of the year. Bitcoin doubled its value relative to gold in 2024 Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could match and even surpass gold’s $17 trillion market cap within the next five to eight years. That’s a bold prediction, but it’s not without merit. As more investors, institutions and nations adopt Bitcoin, its scarcity becomes more pronounced, potentially driving prices higher. While Bitcoin has established itself as digital gold, Dogecoin has carved out a niche as a lighthearted, community-driven cryptocurrency with surprising staying power. Originally launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has since grown into a legitimate digital asset with a market cap in the tens of billions. Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its utility for microtransactions. It’s used mostly to tip content creators and foster online engagement. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it an ideal currency for small, everyday payments. Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin has no hard cap, which helps keep its price stable for transactional use. Elon Musk’s longtime support of Dogecoin has contributed to its growing popularity. News that President-elect Trump plans to appoint Musk to co-lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has added to the speculation and excitement. Since the election, Dogecoin has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. Dogecoin has outperformed Bitcoin since the U.S. election While it’s still seen as a “meme coin,” Dogecoin’s growing user base and real-world utility suggest that it might deserve a closer look from investors. There’s even talk of a Dogecoin ETF next year. BlackRock’s research makes a compelling case for a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin. I believe this relatively small position can provide meaningful diversification benefits without exposing your portfolio to excessive risk. And as Bitcoin’s market cap continues to grow, that modest allocation could deliver outsized returns. Remember, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. But so was gold during the 1970s when it was reintroduced to the free market after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. I’ve been in this game for decades, and what I know is that over time, volatility tends to decline as an asset becomes more widely adopted. Gold will always have a place in my portfolio as the ultimate store of value. But it’s also important to stay open to new opportunities. Bitcoin represents a new frontier in wealth preservation and growth, and even the most conservative investors can no longer afford to ignore it. One Community. Many Voices.

We recently compiled a list of the 9 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors' Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) stands against the other AI stocks. Artificial intelligence has become a dominant force in the stock market, driving the performance of top companies and capturing the attention of major investors. Insider Monkey's Q3 data reveals that 15 of the 20 companies most favored by hedge funds are deeply involved in AI, reflecting its growing influence across industries. The Magnificent 7 stocks, which include tech giants leading the AI revolution, remain the most widely held by hedge funds, highlighting their central role in shaping market trends. The AI boom continues to surge, fueled by companies not just adopting but spearheading advancements in this transformative technology. As valuations for AI-driven stocks climb to unprecedented levels, the sustainability of this rally comes into question. Can the sector’s rapid growth justify its soaring price tags, or is a market correction inevitable? Investors remain on edge, closely monitoring the balance between innovation and valuation. According to a CNBC report, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang described the “AI computing ramp” as being in its early stages, with years of growth ahead, predicting AI-driven advancements in fields like science and healthcare. CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz highlighted how AI is enabling both cybercriminals and cybersecurity efforts, calling it the future “battle of AI.” Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy emphasized generative AI’s role in democratizing enterprise data, noting ongoing collaborations and a robust AI product pipeline. AMD CEO Lisa Su discussed the competitive semiconductor market, stating that different computing architectures are needed for AI’s diverse applications and stressing that AI’s full impact will unfold over the years. Lastly, Generac CEO Aaron Jagdfeld pointed to increasing power grid pressures due to AI-related technology demands, emphasizing the growing need for backup solutions for critical facilities. READ ALSO: 11 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and Jim Cramer Talked About These 8 Stocks. While AI is so far looking like a force for good, it is coming with its own challenges. According to the Bloomberg report, AI Needs So Much Power, It’s Making Yours Worse, the U.S. power grid is facing growing challenges from "bad harmonics," which occur when electrical wave patterns deviate from the ideal. These distortions can damage home appliances, increase fire risks, and signal deeper grid issues. Data shows that households near data centers experience more severe harmonics, with over half of homes with the worst distortions located within 20 miles of major data center activity. In areas like Northern Virginia, where data centers dominate, the proportion of homes experiencing high harmonic distortions exceeds the national average fourfold. Whisker Labs, using a million residential sensors, reports that 1.7% of sensors nationwide exceeded the 8% distortion threshold, a figure that jumps to 6% in areas like Prince William County, Virginia, the report states. While some utilities dispute these findings, the data highlights how data centers, combined with aging infrastructure, electrification trends, and extreme weather, are straining the grid. As the electricity demand for data centers increases, Big Tech is looking toward nuclear fuels to meet the demand. For example, Reuters reported that Amazon has signed three agreements to develop small modular reactors (SMRs) to address the growing power demand from data centers. One project, in collaboration with X-Energy, will be based near a Northwest Energy site in Washington state and aims to generate up to 960 MW, enough to power over 770,000 homes. The company is also funding a $500 million round for X-Energy’s SMR development, targeting over 5 gigawatts of capacity by 2039. These moves come as U.S. data center power usage is set to triple by 2030. It has also partnered with Dominion Energy for an SMR project in Virginia.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff promoted the company's AI agents in a Yahoo Finance interview. In another Yahoo Finance interview, D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria tempered expectations about their revenue impact. He noted that Salesforce’s proposed per-transaction pricing model could worry customers, as high usage might lead to unpredictable costs. While the approach may take time for customers to adapt, Luria believes it will likely contribute only modestly to revenue next year. This comes as Salesforce is projected to approach $40 billion in revenue, making the AI agents less impactful on its overall financial performance. Overall CRM ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks on investors' radar.

Title: Is NatWest Group plc (NWG) Among the U.K. Dividend Champions for 2024?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the U.K. Dividend Champions List: 2024 Rankings by Yield. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) stands against the other U.K. dividend champions. In recent years, investors have shown a preference for global stocks, particularly high-growth options like US technology companies, over UK equities. Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities. That said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK’s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives. Lindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets. The lower volatility in the UK market presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly given its attractive dividend yields. The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson’s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish’s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A person using a laptop to access a bank's online banking system. Dividend Yield as of December 29: 4.37% NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is a London-based retail and commercial bank that offers mortgages, loans, credit cards, and related services. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported an attributable profit of £1.17 billion and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 18.3%. Customer deposits, excluding central items, grew by £2.2 billion, driven by increased savings across all three business sectors. The company expects to maintain a RoTE above 15% for 2024 and projects income, excluding notable items, to reach around £14.4 billion. In addition, total income, excluding notable items, increased by £182 million (5.1%) compared to Q2 2024, primarily due to growth in lending, deposits, and margin improvement. L1 Capital also highlighted this in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG): NatWest is the largest commercial lender in the U.K. (20% share) and the second largest U.K. retail bank with ~13% of all mortgages. We see NatWest as best positioned in the U.K. Banking sector to benefit from improving margin trends, with topline growth supported by a rebound in U.K. housing and economic activity. Moreover, with significant buybacks owing to a strong capital position, NatWest should see ~8% EPS growth p.a. over the next three years vs. ~2% expected growth for CBA. Although CBA enjoys a more dominant market position in Australia vs. NatWest in the U.K., it appears overvalued in our view as it trades on ~24x FY25 P/E (historical highs) compared to only ~7x for NatWest. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is delivering solid returns in 2024, surging by nearly 83% in the past 12 months. A significant portion of the company's success in the past year is due to the unusually high interest rates, which allowed the bank to achieve exceptionally strong returns on its loans. In 2024, the bank consistently kept its net interest margin—the difference between the interest it paid and earned—above 2%. NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG) is a solid dividend payer as the company expects to pay ordinary dividends amounting to approximately 40% of its attributable profit in FY24. Currently, it pays a semi-annual dividend of $0.1543 per share for a dividend yield of 4.37%, as of December 29. As of the close of Q3 2024, 15 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in NatWest Group plc (NYSE:NWG), up from 11 in the previous quarter. These stakes are collectively valued at over $33.8 million. Overall NWG ranks 3rd on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of NWG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NWG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Over the past decade, the British index has achieved a 6% annual total return compared to 13% for the US broader market. Analysts suggest that this underperformance is partly due to weak earnings, domestic political instability, and the absence of a significant technology sector in the UK market. However, a notable factor is the sharp decline in valuations as investors have steered away from UK stocks. Goldman Sachs remarked that the challenge is not a lack of interest from foreign investors, who currently hold about two-thirds of the UK market capitalization, but rather the limited participation of domestic investors in UK equities. That said, investing in UK stocks can still be a worthwhile choice. While the UK market lacks significant technology companies, its equities in sectors like finance, energy, and mining provide diversification opportunities that complement the tech-heavy and highly valued US markets. In addition, the UK’s index faces less risk from tariffs and trade restrictions. Goldman Sachs Research highlighted that UK equities could gain from various government measures, such as pension reforms aimed at boosting domestic investment in UK stocks and policies supporting homebuilding initiatives. Lindsay Matcham, involved in futures sales trading at Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, suggested that UK equities could appeal to investors seeking diversification. She noted that these stocks offer attractive valuations, strong dividend yields, and reduced concentration risk. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, presented a rather interesting take on the UK market's limited exposure to technology stocks. He pointed out that this reduced exposure has made the UK stock market less volatile compared to the US, where technology stocks are a key driver of market fluctuations. Mould observed that, despite its criticisms, the UK market experienced a relatively stable summer compared to the US, attributing this to differences in valuation and the relative expectations of the two markets. The lower volatility in the UK market presents compelling investment opportunities, particularly given its attractive dividend yields. The FTSE 100 offers a yield of 3.68%, while the FTSE 250, representing medium-sized UK firms, provides slightly lower but still appealing income prospects. This setup allows investors to explore higher-growth sectors, such as smaller companies while benefiting from rising dividends. According to BlackRock, UK dividends are currently growing at a rate of 2-3%, aligning with long-term inflation. Stocks that consistently grow their dividends often have stable cash flows, enabling them to increase payouts over time. Janus Henderson’s 2023 annual dividend report highlighted this upward trend, revealing that UK dividends reached approximately $86 billion in 2023, a significant rise from the $63.1 billion distributed in 2020. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best FTSE dividend stocks. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed the UK CCC Dividend list, which highlights UK companies with the longest histories of dividend growth. This list is based on the structure of David Fish’s US Dividend Champions spreadsheet and serves as a useful tool to help identify and screen dividend growth stocks in the UK. From this list, we chose 10 stocks with the highest dividend yields as of December 29 and arranged them in order from lowest to highest yield. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of bottles of whisky and other alcoholic beverages from a winery. Dividend Yield as of December 29: 3.26% A British multinational alcoholic beverage company, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) ranks fourth on our list of the best FTSE dividend stocks. The stock has dropped by nearly 13% over the past year, largely due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Despite this, analysts remain optimistic about the company's growth prospects. Diageo holds leading products in categories like scotch, gin, and vodka. Its large scale allows for substantial marketing investments, ensuring its brands remain prominent and difficult for competitors to displace. In addition, the company's size provides a strategic advantage, enabling it to acquire smaller competitors and increase their value before they become significant threats. Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) reported positive FY24 earnings that were reassuring for investors. The company generated $20.3 billion in revenue, which represented a slight decrease of 1.4% compared to the previous year. The report also highlighted that Diageo either grew or maintained its market share in over 75% of its net sales across measured markets, including the US. Aristotle Capital Management, LLC made the following comment about DEO in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Headquartered in London, England, Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) is a global leader in the alcoholic beverages industry. The company has a vast portfolio of over 200 well-recognized premium spirits (~80% of FY 2024 sales), beers (~15% and mostly Guinness) and other beverages (~5%) that are sold in nearly 180 countries. Led by its Johnnie Walker brand, Diageo is the world’s largest exporter of Scotch whiskey—its largest category at ~25% of sales—followed by other spirits such as tequila and vodka (~10% each). Diageo also owns a ~34% stake in the premium champagne and cognac maker Moët Hennessy (a subsidiary of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton). Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO) has been gaining momentum due to its robust cash flow. In FY24, the company generated $4.1 billion in operating cash flow and $2.6 billion in free cash flow, reflecting year-over-year increases of $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. With this strong cash position, Diageo returned $1 billion to shareholders during the fiscal year and raised its annual dividend by 5%, bringing it to $1.0348 per share. The stock's dividend yield comes in at 3.26%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 26 funds held stakes in Diageo plc (NYSE:DEO), compared with 31 in the previous quarter. These stakes are worth nearly $703 million in total. Overall DEO ranks 4th on our list of the U.K. dividend champions for 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of DEO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DEO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) the Best Dividend Growth Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against the other dividend growth stocks. Dividend stocks had a challenging year in 2024 as investor interest largely shifted toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which monitors companies with at least 25 years of consecutive dividend growth, rose by just over 5% year-to-date, significantly trailing the nearly 26% return of the broader market. This underperformance isn't unusual for dividend stocks, which often struggle to compete for attention against more dynamic market options. However, seasoned investors may recognize the enduring value and potential of dividend stocks over the long term. Also read: 8 Best German Dividend Stocks To Invest In Historically, dividends have played a significant role in the total returns of US stocks, accounting for nearly one-third of overall equity returns since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period marked by declining interest rates, dividends contributed 75% to the broader market’s return. In an environment of falling interest rates, dividends become even more valuable by providing a steady cash flow when fixed-income investments may offer lower yields. Companies that initiate dividends rarely stop paying them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can enhance a stock's appeal to investors, potentially boosting its market value. According to a report by Franklin Templeton, over the last decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently increased, with an average annual growth rate of just over 7%. In favorable market conditions, dividends have boosted total returns. During challenging years, such as 2020 and 2022, when returns were low or negative, dividends played a more significant role in total returns, offering stability and strengthening portfolio resilience. This resilience of dividend stocks is rooted in the robust financial health and strong balance sheets of the companies behind them. Analysts emphasize the importance of targeting high-quality dividend-paying firms when investing in this category. Ramona Persaud, who manages the Fidelity Equity-Income Fund and Fidelity Global Equity Income Fund, shares this perspective. She prioritizes investments in well-established companies with solid dividends and attractive valuations. Persaud noted that falling interest rates often create favorable conditions for dividend stocks, as their yields become more appealing compared to declining bond yields. She also highlighted that lower rates could broaden market gains, unlike the past two years, where growth was dominated by a small number of large-cap stocks. Here are some other comments from the analyst: "Ideally, I look for a stock that has a combination of these factors. I can't always get all 3, so I look for a good balance of them. If I can get higher quality at a cheaper price, and the company pays a compelling dividend, that's when a stock is really interesting to me." High-quality companies also provide the benefit of consistent dividend growth. Investors view dividends as a long-term commitment, so companies that pay them must maintain profitability, generate returns, and ensure steady cash flow. This makes dividends an important measure of a company’s overall quality. Firms that regularly raise their dividend payments show that they are consistently generating profits, which may indicate greater resilience during economic or market downturns. Our Methodology: For this article, we scanned the list of dividend aristocrats, which are the companies that have raised their payouts for 25 consecutive years or more. From that list, we picked 10 companies with the highest 5-year annual average dividend growth rates. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of their annual average dividend growth in the past five years. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A wind turbine, its blades spinning to generate clean renewable energy. 5-Year Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 10.51% NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) ranks fifth on our list of the best dividend aristocrat stocks. The Florida-based renewable energy company posted strong earnings recently. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $7.57 billion, a 5.6% increase from the previous year. The company had another strong quarter in renewable energy and storage development, adding about 3 gigawatts (GW) to its project backlog for the second consecutive quarter. Over the past four quarters, it has secured roughly 11 GW in new projects. Madison Investments made the following comment about NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “The top contributors in the quarter were NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Oracle Corporation, Progressive Corporation, Equifax Inc., and United Healthcare. NextEra has continued to perform well given its strong position in the renewable energy space, increasing demand for power, its transmission capabilities, as well as a tailwind from lower interest rates.” In addition to its strong foundation, NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has developed one of the largest portfolios of solar and wind power assets worldwide. This segment has gained from the shift away from polluting carbon fuels towards cleaner, renewable energy sources. Given the long-term nature of the power transition, the company is poised for continued growth over the coming decades. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered a nearly 19% return to shareholders. NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.515 per share on October 18, which fell in line with its previous dividend. In 2024, the company stretched its dividend growth streak to 28 years. Moreover, the company has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of over 10.5% in the past five years. The stock supports a dividend yield of 2.86%, as of December 29. Of the 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey at the end of Q3 2024, 69 funds held stakes in NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), compared with 73 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $2.47 billion. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall NEE ranks 5th on our list of the best dividend growth stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NEE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: While institutions own 40% of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), individual investors are its largest shareholders with 58% ownership

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Deutsche Bank's significant individual investors ownership suggests that the key decisions are influenced by shareholders from the larger public A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 35% ownership Institutional ownership in Deutsche Bank is 40% If you want to know who really controls Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft (ETR:DBK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that individual investors own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn). And institutions on the other hand have a 40% ownership in the company. Insiders often own a large chunk of younger, smaller, companies while huge companies tend to have institutions as shareholders. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Deutsche Bank, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Deutsche Bank Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. We can see that Deutsche Bank does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Deutsche Bank, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Deutsche Bank. BlackRock, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 6.2% of shares outstanding. Capital Research and Management Company is the second largest shareholder owning 4.7% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 4.1% of the company stock. Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder. Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future. While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own €336m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in whether they have been buying or selling. The general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, collectively holds 58% of Deutsche Bank shares. With this amount of ownership, retail investors can collectively play a role in decisions that affect shareholder returns, such as dividend policies and the appointment of directors. They can also exercise the power to vote on acquisitions or mergers that may not improve profitability. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Deutsche Bank better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Deutsche Bank you should be aware of.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is A Buy, And I Think It Will Continue To Perform Well’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-amazon-com-055243750.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 286 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-14-24 Performance Since Then: 31.56% Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the biggest eCommerce firm in the US and also a key player in the lucrative cloud computing industry. Its partnership with AI firm Anthropic has also allowed the company to establish a foothold for itself in the AI industry and access technologies for enterprise AI products provided through AWS. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is also among the handful of firms that operate across all layers of the AI stack - from designing custom chips to providing end-use applications. The tail-end of November and the start of December have been great for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s shares as its Project Rainier supercomputer built using in-house Trainium chips will be used by Anthropic to train AI. Cramer was very optimistic about the firm in August: "We recently bought more Amazon shares because I believe the market was too harsh on their last quarter. Amazon is a buy, and I think it will continue to perform well." Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Why investing for the long run, especially if you buy certain popular stocks, could reap huge rewards. The technology provides blowing-filling-capping solutions for water, milk, and juice bottles in beverage applications. The S&P 500 index is set to cap off a banner year. Investing in the S&P 500 through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) is generally a smart move as the index has historically returned an annual average of 9% per year with dividends reinvested, but other funds may beat the S&P 500. One of the best-performing ETFs of the last 10 years has been the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SMH), up roughly 800% over that time span.
