A GROUP OF youths who broke a teenager’s fingers in south county Dublin told him not to mess with lads from their school again, a court has heard. One of the group of perpetrators, Luke Daly (23), has had his sentence deferred after he pleaded guilty to simple assault at Rock Road, Blackrock, Co Dublin on 7 December 2019. Daly, of Booterstown Avenue, Booterstown, Co Dublin, was one of ten or 20 youths who set upon the victim in what a judge said “may have been a case of mistaken identity”. Daly admitted grabbing the victim’s jacket and pulling him to the ground, however, gardaí could not say that he had any role in kicking or hitting. The victim suffered three fractured fingers when he was kicked by some of the youths as he went to get the DART home after attending a house party. At Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, Daly was ordered to keep the peace and be of good behaviour pending sentence next April. Judge Orla Crowe said the offence would warrant a sentence of two months, but that she intended to dispose of the case under Section 100 of the Criminal Justice Act. Daly was also ordered to pay the victim the sum of €3,000, which he had offered as a token of his remorse. Judge Crowe said the victim in the case was “entirely innocent and blameless” and simply should not have been subject to attack. Garda Eoin O’Mahony told Alison Fynes BL, prosecuting, that the victim went to a house party in Booterstown on the night, then left with some friends and his girlfriend to go to Domino’s Pizza. The victim told gardaí that shortly after 11pm, he was walking his girlfriend and two other friends towards the DART station, when he saw a group of ten or 20 lads walking behind them. Some of the group grabbed his friend, saying: “Can we have a chat?” and then pulled him to the ground. The victim said he ran to help his friend and then a lad ran after him, pulled him to the ground and a group began kicking him in the ribs. He asked them were they done and they replied: “Don’t mess with lads from (a particular school).” The victim’s friends gave similar statements, describing the large group as saying “You won’t mess with (a named school) again.” Advertisement The court heard there had been an altercation earlier on at a house party which did not involve either the victim or his friends. Daly was arrested and admitted to grabbing the victim’s jacket and pulling him down. He told gardaí pushes were exchanged and that the victim was on the ground when he left. The court heard that the large group of males had incorrectly assumed that the victim and his friend were part of a rival school. Daly had just turned 18 at the time, while the rest of the group of perpetrators were all underage. One of the other members of the group was assigned a Garda Junior Liaison Officer but no-one else was identified or prosecuted. The victim did not wish to attend court or make a victim impact statement, the court heard. Daly pleaded early at the District Court to the charge of simple assault, but the court referred the matter to the Circuit Court. Daly has no previous convictions and has not come to garda attention since, the court heard. Kevin Roche BL, defending, said it was an extremely childish incident which got out of control and was entirely out-of-character for his client. Counsel said this case has hung over Daly throughout his undergraduate degree and the Master’s degree he is currently doing. Daly, whose parents were present in court, was described as pro-social. The court heard that Daly has been putting money aside from part-time work and had brought the sum of €3,000 to court by way of compensation. Judge Crowe said it had been a “grave misunderstanding” and may have been a case of mistaken identity. The judge noted the large number of testimonials on Daly’s behalf and described him as a person of considerable academic and musical talent. “He has not come to any adverse attention since and has devoted his life to study. This was manifestly out-of-character. Gardaí have no concerns about this man,” added the judge. Daly is due back before court on 10 March 2025 for mention and final orders will be made on 10 April, when the case will be disposed of, if Daly has met all conditions.

Delivered every Thursday straight to your inbox, it’s a must-read for those looking to stay inspired. Click here to get on the newsletter list! Hey ForbesBLK, Ayisha Mendez here. Did you know that Black women are the fastest growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the United States? Out of the 2.7 million businesses nationwide, 61% are self-funded, according to the Harvard Business Review. This is largely due to the lack of access to capital, exacerbated by the fact that less than 1% of venture capital dollars go to female founders. One ForbesBLK community member taking this head on is Genever Oppong, a private equity associate at BlackRock. She has witnessed firsthand the transformative effects of directing capital toward under-resourced communities of color. And emphasized that, “Together, we can shine a spotlight on the intersection of capital and community, showcasing how strategic investments in Black founders and investors can lead to transformative outcomes.” For Black Business Month, we did just that by joining forces with Genever’s network of Black Women Investors (BWI) and Tonna Obaze from Tonna&Co, for the State of Capital event aimed at providing strategies to access capital. This gathering brought together Black founders and funders to demystify venture capital and discuss equitable pathways to funding. During the event, panelist Stephany Ohaz, a Nigerian-American Investor whose pursuit of “finance for good” led her to impact investing, shared insights on how capital can be used as an agent of change. One of those impact recipients is Abena Boamah-Acheampong, founder of Hanahana Beauty, known as the, “Skincare Entrepreneur (Who) Is Giving Her Customers Equity In The Brand.” Her advice for those seeking capital is to, “look for people who have aligned incentives with you” and to prioritize building a supportive community – not just within your consumer base but also among those who can foster your growth. State of Black Capital by Marvin Lloyd “It’s also possible that VC funding is not the right fit for your business... and that’s OK,” explained Wilglory Tanjong, founder Amina Iris, known for its “Beyonce-approved” bags. During a live workshop led by Atlanta entrepreneur and local advisor, Yaminah Childress, members explored alternative ways to secure capital through the grant writing process. Events like this highlight the vital role community, training and networking play in fostering financial empowerment and establishing strategies for advancing capital.

Billionaire Gautam Adani's Adani Enterprises is in talks with institutional investors, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Qatar Investment Authority, and Rajiv Jain’s GQG to raise $2 billion through a qualified institutional placement (QIP), Moneycontrol reported on Wednesday, October 9, citing people aware of the development. The potential institutional share sale is expected to be launched before the end of October, according to the sources cited by the news portal. Adani Enterprises shares ended 0.42 per cent lower at ₹3,152.90 on Wednesday, compared to the previous close of ₹3,166.15. “Adani Enterprises is in talks with a dozen institutional investors, including ADIA, QIA and GQG, which have backed Adani group companies in the recent past. The QIP will be launched once they have firm commitments from these institutional investors,” said a person aware of the development, as per the report. The news portal's emails to the Adani Group remained unanswered, while the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority refused to comment on the development. According to the report, queries sent to the Qatar Investment Authority and GQG also remained unanswered. The funds raised through the QIP issue are planned to be used for the company's capital expenditure and to repay some debt of the company and its subsidiaries, according to the report. On May 28, the Adani Enterprises board approved plans to raise nearly ₹16,600 crore through a QIP issue. Adani conglomerate's Adani Energy Solutions also raised nearly $1 billion through QIP, subscribed almost six times, according to the report. GQG, Blackrock, Nomura, ADIA, QIA and a bunch of domestic mutual funds, such as SBI MF, HDFC MF and Tata MF, participated in the QIP issue, according to the news portal. The news portal reported on September 5 that Adani Group plans to raise between ₹30,000 crore and ₹40,000 crore from retail investors through a non-convertible debentures (NCD) issue over the next three to four years to diversify funding sources and mitigate risk. The company's total debt increased to ₹50,124 crore in the financial year 2024, compared to ₹38,320 crore in the previous year. Adani Enterprises' long-term borrowing increased to ₹43,718 crore in the financial year 2024, compared to its levels of ₹32,590 crore in the previous year. The external debt was ₹29,511 crore in FY 2024, up from ₹22,237 crore in the previous year showing increased leverage and improved liquidity, as per the report.

Title: Hedera Analyst Thinks HBAR Will Easily 30X After Sinking 70% In 6 Months
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/hedera-hbar-30x-sinking-70-in-6-months/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T17:00:15Z
Full Content:
Hedera, a proof-of-stake platform, wasn’t spared from aggressive bears in early October. After HBAR, its native token, floated higher in September, the rejection of bulls in early October resulted in a double top. Overall, there is optimism that bulls will resume and push prices to new Q4 2024 highs. The pace of this growth will depend on how the market performs and whether fundamental factors around the project will prop up buyers. While there are cracks in the HBAR price action, considering the dump from April highs of around $0.18, one analyst on X thinks the token is set for major gains. From his assessment, Hedera can easily score 30X in the coming sessions, mirroring the gains posted by Cardano in the last cycle. Then, ADA soared by over 170X. If HBAR is to follow the same path, the token can easily soar to $6, over 60X from its 2024 highs. Presently, technical candlestick arrangements favor sellers. After the rally to $0.18 in April 2024, HBAR has been falling. To put the numbers into perspective, the token is down 70% but is stable after finding support in August and September. The local resistance is the double top at around September highs. If prices break above this liquidation zone, HBAR bulls could embark on the journey to drive the coin to $0.18. In effect, this will resume the uptrend set in motion in Q1 2024 and early Q2 2024. There are fundamental factors to consider that may propel HBAR, helping the token shake off weaknesses. Early this month, Canary Capital released the first United States HBAR Trust. Like Grayscale products, including the ETHE and GBTC, the HBAR Trust allows institutional investors to gain exposure to HBAR. Accordingly, this could drive demand, lifting prices. In September, Hedera launched the Asset Tokenization studio. Through this solution, the network would be at the forefront of driving the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) while adhering to existing laws. Already, BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, believes tokenization will rapidly grow in the coming years, managing trillions. According to rwa.xyz, over $12.7 billion worth of RWAs has been tokenized. Additionally, there is interest. In the last month alone, the number of RWA holders rose to 68,929, a 4% increase. Most of these assets are tokenized on Ethereum and Stellar. Dalmas, a seasoned crypto reporter, brings a unique perspective to the industry.

He firmly believes that DeFi and NFTs are here to stay and will continue to drive financial inclusion. Coming from Nairobi, Kenya, it is easy to see the source of his inspiration: Across Africa, millions lack access to traditional banks. Remote villages, limited documentation, and high minimum balances create insurmountable barriers. DeFi, not just Maker or Aave, for example, but think of Bitcoin and USDT, cuts out the middleman. Forget banks with their limitations. Even so, DeFi isn't a magic solution. The continent still struggles with reliable internet access, and educational campaigns highlighting the benefits of this wonderful solution are insufficient. Moreover, even for those interested, understanding DeFi can look like learning a new language. Dalmas is here to help make the tech easy to understand and digestible, even for beginners. The story of DeFi in Africa is still being written. Challenges abound, but the promise of a more inclusive financial future is a powerful motivator. With innovation and collaboration, Dalmas firmly believes that DeFi could become the key to unlocking Africa's full economic potential. This possibility and its immense value motivate Dalmas to continue breaking key DeFi innovations and more across the globe.

Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, said there’s been a surge in active Bitcoin addresses—up by 39% over the past week. That signals increased demand and liquidity, he said. Otychenko also noted a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s Network Value to Metcalfe Ratio (NVM). NVM measures the relationship between Bitcoin's market value and the activity on its network, indicating potential under- or overvaluation. And now, the Bitcoin NVM is at levels not seen since its all-time high—suggesting the cryptocurrency could be trading below its intrinsic value. "Historically, when active addresses surge like this, it often precedes or accompanies price increases," Otychenko told Decrypt. The NVM metric has been a reliable indicator in the past, as it did in late 2022 and September 2023, when BTC saw price recoveries following similar drops in NVM, he added. Currently, Bitcoin is trading down 0.6% at $62,120, struggling to maintain levels above key technical indicators. It remains sandwiched between the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) and the 50-day SMA, a situation that mirrors price action from October 2023. For the cryptocurrency to break out of this consolidation, a move above the 200-day SMA with higher trading volume is essential. "Bitcoin needs to push above the 200-day SMA and sustain those levels to see further upward momentum," Otychenko said. However, the gains over the past week have come with decreasing volume, suggesting a lack of strong bullish momentum. On a broader level, analysts like Brian Dixon, CEO of OTC Capital, are rethinking Bitcoin’s traditional characterization as a purely risk-on asset. "Recent analyses, including from major financial institutions like BlackRock, are challenging the view of Bitcoin as only a risk asset," Dixon told Decrypt. He highlighted the evolving narrative of BTC behaving more like gold during economic downturns, pointing to its potential role as a risk-differentiated or even risk-off asset. This shift could redefine Bitcoin’s position in investment portfolios, making it a more attractive option for long-term diversification. "Bitcoin might offer protection against market volatility in ways that traditional assets might not," Dixon added, furthering the case for its adoption as a hedge against traditional market downturns. In terms of institutional flows, Bitcoin ETFs have seen mixed results. On Tuesday, the total net outflow from Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $18.6 million, with the Fidelity Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) leading the outflows at $48.8 million. However, the BlackRock ETF (IBIT) saw an inflow of $39.5 million on the same day. Spot ETFs that track Ethereum, which has remained relatively stable, saw a total net outflow of $8.1 million from spot ETFs on October 8, data from SoSo Value shows. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price BTC was trading down 0.6% at $62,050 and Ether is trading flat at $2,432, according to data from CoinGecko. BTC's immediate price action remains contingent on upcoming macroeconomic data. Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro, noted that the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes and the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data could serve as triggers for Bitcoin’s next move. "Potential triggers to break out of this range could be Fed minutes or U.S. inflation data if they lead to a reassessment of expectations in traditional markets," Kuptsikevich said, in a note to Decrypt.

You may skip our detailed analysis and jump to 2025 Social Security COLA Falls Short: Discover the 5 Best States to Retire and Offset the Gap. 2025 Social Security COLA and Best States to Retire The Social Security Administration will be announcing an official 2025 Social Security Cost-Of-Living-Adjustment (COLA) very soon, following the release of the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) on October 10th, 2024. That’s right, the much-anticipated date for an estimated 68 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits in the US is almost here. According to a Gallup survey, these checks are a major source of income for a third of retirees. It’s no surprise that the upcoming announcement and related news are sparking both anticipation and concern among those who depend on these benefits. To help seniors keep up with inflation, the SSA adjusts the Social Security benefits at the beginning of each calendar year based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the COLA is defined as the “percent increase between the third quarter average of the CPI-W for a given year and the previous peak third-quarter average of the CPI-W”. Based on this definition, the number that’s missing for the final COLA announcement is the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming. The state’s very tax-friendly status, with no state income tax and a median home price of $275,000, makes it the most affordable option on the list. Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: V_TWIN In Florida, when I moved here 10 years ago, I’d agree it was affordable. But it has gotten really expensive. Insurance is expensive in both auto and homeowners. And after two hurricanes, I see it going up even more. Gas is always more expensive than other states and food is costly here. You do save on no state taxes and property taxes, but everything else is very costly. 3 posted on 10/09/2024 8:17:37 AM PDT by napscoordinator (DeSantis is a beast!

Also, when she got her first power bill here she laughed out loud about how low it was.....she said she was paying three times as much in south Florida.....so cost of living in Fla. is relative to locale. 5 posted on 10/09/2024 8:27:00 AM PDT by V_TWIN (America...so great even the people that hate it refuse to leave!)

As per the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the COLA is defined as the “percent increase between the third quarter average of the CPI-W for a given year and the previous peak third-quarter average of the CPI-W”. Based on this definition, the number that’s missing for the final COLA announcement is the September Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The Bureau of Labor Statistics is scheduled to release this number on October 10th, not long after which the COLA will be announced. After calculating the difference increase of the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the average CPI-W for the third quarter of 2023, it will be rounded to the nearest tenth of 1%. Looking at the current inflation data, the COLA for 2025 is expected to be around 2.5%. This is lower than the 2024 COLA of 3.2%. While a falling COLA is indicative of falling inflation, many seniors are going to be far from pleased with the modest raise. A TSCL 2024 Retirement Survey reveals how one of the top retirement concerns for seniors is their depleting retirement savings due to persistently high prices. 78% of the seniors surveyed reveal how their monthly budget for essentials like housing, food, and essentials has been higher than last year. More importantly, 75% say they want Congress to pass legislation that would base the COLA on the CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E) instead of the CPI-W. CPI-E is an index that is more specific to seniors, and hence better reflects the spending patterns and inflationary pressures experienced by older adults, making it a more accurate measure of their financial needs. This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming. The state’s very tax-friendly status, with no state income tax and a median home price of $275,000, makes it the most affordable option on the list. Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum.

Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4.

It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming.

This shift could potentially lead to higher benefits for seniors, as the CPI-E takes into account costs that disproportionately affect them, such as healthcare and housing. The fear of outliving one’s retirement savings is growing now more than ever due to a myriad of factors. Social Security funds are expected to deplete less than a decade from now, people are living longer and need more to survive, and Americans can save less in general due to the high costs of living in the country. This is why BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink believes capital markets can help solve the problem revolving around the ability of Americans to afford retirement as their lifespan elongates. According to Fink, having access to investing can help people retire in a financially sound manner. “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson “Today in America, the retirement message that the government and companies tell their workers is effectively: ‘You’re on your own,”. And before my generation fully disappears from positions of corporate and political leadership, we have an obligation to change that.” – Larry Fink. Here’s what Jim Cramer says about Larry Fink and his company. “Larry Fink’s done an incredible job, not only in making money but also in producing the best asset management software. I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia.

I don’t think this company gets nearly enough credit for either and its stock deserves to trade higher. I think you could break out here.” In the second quarter of 2024, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) beat earnings expectations with a reported EPS of $10.36, while expectations were $9.98. The investing firm delivered its highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period, with double-digit operating income growth and a 160 basis point margin expansion. The firm saw over $80 billion in net new assets and ended the quarter with a record $10.6 trillion in AUM, showcasing strong performance and growth momentum. According to the Insider Monkey database, 47 out of 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), up from 45 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of BLK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than BLK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6. Georgia Insider Monkey Score: 126 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $372,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Next on our list of best states to retire in the US is Georgia. Living expenses in the state are 9% lower than the national average, and home prices are well below the national median as well. Combine this with its tax-friendliness, and seniors are going to have a much easier time retiring to the state in light of the smaller Social Security COLA increase. 5. Delaware Insider Monkey Score: 136 Cost of Living Index: 100.5 Median Home Price: $365,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Delaware offers a cost of living close to the national average, with a median home price of $365,000 according to Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). This makes it an affordable option for retirees. Its tax-friendly policies, including no sales tax, enhance its appeal. The state’s coastal charm and moderate climate further contribute to its desirability for retirees. 4. Tennessee Insider Monkey Score: 146 Cost of Living Index: 90.8 Median Home Price: $385,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-friendly Tennessee’s low cost of living and no state income tax make it a top retirement destination. Home prices in the state are well below the national average, standing at an estimated $385,900. The state’s tax-friendly environment is ideal for retirees seeking affordability. Additionally, Tennessee offers scenic beauty and cultural experiences in cities like Nashville and Chattanooga. 3. Florida Insider Monkey Score: 150 Cost of Living Index: 102.4 Median Home Price: $403,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly The Sunshine State of Florida is always going to be a retiree-favorite. That said, its very tax-friendly retirement policies, including no state income tax, attract retirees seeking financial ease. With a diverse range of retirement communities and a median home price of $403,300, it remains a popular destination. The state’s warm climate and numerous recreational activities further enhance its appeal. 2. South Dakota Insider Monkey Score: 170 Cost of Living Index: 91.2 Median Home Price: $320,900 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly South Dakota has previously topped our list of best states to retire in the US in 2024. It remains one of the most tax-friendly environments for retirees, with no state income tax and a low cost of living. The median home price of $320,900, coupled with its scenic landscapes and outdoor activities, makes it a top choice for those seeking tranquility and affordability. 1. Wyoming Insider Monkey Score: 179 Cost of Living Index: 92.8 Median Home Price: $275,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Making it to the top on our list of best places to retire in the US amidst the 2025 Social Security COLA shortfall is the state of Wyoming. The state’s very tax-friendly status, with no state income tax and a median home price of $275,000, makes it the most affordable option on the list. Its low cost of living, coupled with stunning natural beauty and wide-open spaces, offers retirees a peaceful and financially secure retirement.

Methodology To compile the list of best states to retire in the US to offset the gap caused by the small 2025 Social Security COLA, we incorporated both existing rankings and updated data on critical factors like cost of living, housing affordability, taxes, and access to healthcare. The rankings were derived from previous score assessments, with new data integrated to reflect current conditions. A final Insider Monkey score was then assigned to each state, with those scoring higher ranked as more advantageous for retirees looking to stretch their income during retirement. The cost of living index has been sourced from Missouri Economic Research & Information Center, while median home prices are taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). With that said, let’s head over to the best states to retire in the US: 11. South Carolina Insider Monkey Score: 54 Cost of Living Index: 95.5 Median Home Price: $380,700 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly One of the best states to retire in the US to offset the gap by the potentially smaller 2025 Social Security COLA is South Carolina. Affordable home prices, lower-than-national median home prices, and tax-friendliness make it a great place to settle down in one’s golden years. There are no taxes on Social Security benefits, and there is a $10,000 taxable income deduction available for seniors receiving other types of retirement income. The state boasts some of the lowest property taxes in the country. 10. Nevada Insider Monkey Score: 88 Cost of Living Index: 102.6 Median Home Price: $465,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Nevada’s cost of living may be a tad bit higher than the national average, but it’s one of the most tax-friendly states one can retire to. There is no state income tax, which means all income at the state level goes tax-free to retirees. Property taxes in the state are also relatively lower, even though sales tax is higher than the national average. Nevertheless, there are sales tax exemptions that benefit seniors, such as on groceries, newspapers, and prescription drugs. 9. Texas Insider Monkey Score: 89 Cost of Living Index: 91.7 Median Home Price: $348,300 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Being one of the few states that don’t have an income tax, Texas deserves a place on our list of best states to retire in the US. Its combination of tax-friendliness, affordable cost of living, and lower-than-national median home prices make it a strong candidate on our list. However, every state has its pros and cons. For Texas, the setback is high property and sales taxes. Similar to Nevada, there are sales tax exemptions available on groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and prescription drugs. There are several property relief programs for seniors too. 8. Michigan Insider Monkey Score: 97 Cost of Living Index: 90.9 Median Home Price: $270,800 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Tax-Friendly Michigan offers good healthcare options, though costs can vary depending on the area. Its low cost of living (9% below the national average), affordable median home price of $270,800, and tax-friendly policies, further allow retirees to maximize their savings while enjoying a good quality of life. 7. Mississippi Insider Monkey Score: 113 Cost of Living Index: 87.7 Median Home Price: $256,000 Retirement Tax-Friendliness: Very Tax-Friendly Mississippi boasts one of the lowest costs of living in the country. Living expenses here are 12% lower than the national average. Moreover, home prices are also some of the most affordable at a median home price of $256,000 as per Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). All sorts of retirement income in the state goes tax-free, which also makes it an extremely tax-friendly state to retire to. Undoubtedly, it is one of the best states to retire in the US in light of the smaller 2025 Social Security COLA. 6.

by Mark Steyn Clubland Q&A October 9, 2024 https://www.steynonline.com/14692/live-around-the-planet-wednesday-october-9th Thank you for all your questions. If you missed the live broadcast, the action replay can be heard in full here. UPPERDATE! We're live now, so let's have at it! UPDATE! We'll be going live in about fifteen minutes, so do get ready to fire off your questions via the comment form below. See you at the top of the hour. And to listen simply click the livestream feed. Yes, it's me! Mark Steyn of that ilk - back in the saddle for another hour of questions from Steyn Clubbers around the planet. Our Clubland Q&A starts live at 3pm North American Eastern - which is 8pm British Summer Time/9pm Central European. If you chance to be elsewhere, do check local listings below. As we go to air, Hurricane Milton - the world's strongest this year - is barreling down on Florida, a mere fortnight after Hurricane Helene. We hope our many Club members in the Sunshine State, and others in the path of this storm, will stay safe. Six million Floridians have been ordered to evacuate. America is four weeks from its laughably misnamed "Election Day", so there are political implications to meteorological phenomena in swing states. I'm happy to discuss those or anything else on your mind, but I am particularly mindful of the callousness of our age. I'm thinking not just of bigfoot media's indifference to the suffering in Appalachia, but of a thousand smaller, daily tragedies. Last Thursday, for example, Dr Jackie Stone became the latest Covid contrarian to be driven to kill herself: On 3 October @DrJackieStone took her own life. Everything she valued and found purpose in was taken from her. If you don't know by now, this is how it works if you speak up against The Narrative. Here is an extract from her final interview. 🎥Me and @woodybaloo... pic.twitter.com/RiTmLXT02I I cannot claim to have known Dr Stone except through the Internet - she followed me on Twitter after we began telling the stories of vaccine victims on The Mark Steyn Show. I knew that she had developed an effective protocol for treating Covid that included Ivermectin - she practised in Zimbabwe, where, strange though it may sound to American and European ears, the government was rather less deranged in the Covid years than that of, say, Minnesota or France. Nevertheless, because Dr Stone's treatment was insufficient of a cash cow for Big Pharma and the public health agencies they have corrupted, she was targeted and, as noted above, lost everything in her life. After hosting a health summit with other dissident doctors at Victoria Falls just over two months ago, she fell into despair and joined the lengthening list of those around the world so comprehensively punished for their dissent that there was nothing left but suicide. You may be over Covid but Covid isn't over you - because it's the template for your future. The evil men who imposed the lockdown/vaccine regime on you will do it all over again next time - even though, as we now know, they went to "drug-fueled sex parties" while a generation of kids was psychologically kiboshed and women's fertility nosedived across the west. The "conventional wisdom" is now literally killing us - and yet, as Hillary Clinton and John Kerry have recently assured us, in the future they're building any objection to it will not be tolerated. On today's Clubland Q&A I'm happy to entertain your thoughts on that, or on anything else you want to raise. Whether or not you're a member of The Mark Steyn Club, you can listen to our show live as it happens wherever you chance to be on this turbulent earth: Club membership is required only to ask a question. We love to hear from brand new members, and especially appreciate those who are having such a great time in these parts that they've signed up a chum for a Steyn Club Gift Membership. Among the additions to our ranks in recent days are newbies from around the globe - from Belfast to Bigfork, from Tokoroa to Thief River Falls, from London, Ontario to Latham in the Australian Capital Territory. Whether you've joined this week either for a full year or a see-how-it-goes experimental quarter, do shoot me a head-scratcher for today's show. But, if you're not interested in joining, no worries, as they say in Oz: We seek no unwilling members - and as always the show is free to listen to, so we hope you'll want to tune in. So see you back here at 3pm North American Eastern - which is 8pm in London, 9pm in Paris, 10pm in Jerusalem; half-past-ten in Teheran; midnight-forty-five in Kathmandu; 3am in Singapore and Honkers (sorry about that); 5am in Sydney and Melbourne; 7am in Auckland, and a rather more convivial hour for the kippers and kedgeree in His Majesty's Dominions eastward across the Pacific, where you're so far ahead I've probably already lost my appeal by now...

Our first visit to America has been a 4000 mile bus trip from New York to Miami via New Hampshire, Quebec, Niagara, Washington, Nashville, New Orleans, Orlando and countless other places we've heard of in songs and stories. Its an amazing country for sure. So green, and so much water! I know we only see a tiny slice of the real America on a trip like this but I've been struck by the lack of political signage for either side. I thought we would see blue and red posters everywhere but we've barely seen a hint that theres an election looming. Is this an indication of indifference to the direction America is heading, or are we just not travelling in the right places? Regards, David.

Title: Portfolio Update: New Stock Picker Appointed for Alliance Witan

October 09, 2024 09:55 ET | Source: Alliance Trust Plc Alliance Trust Plc Alliance Witan PLC (the “Company”)LEI: 213800SZZD4E21OZ9W55 Portfolio Update: New Stock Picker Appointed for Alliance Witan Alliance Witan PLC (“Alliance Witan” or the “Company”) announces that its investment manager, Willis Towers Watson (“WTW”), has appointed Jennison Associates (“Jennison”) as an additional stock picker for its multi-manager global equity portfolio, taking the total number of stock pickers to eleven. New York and Boston-based Jennison was founded in 1969. It has $210 billion of assets under management (as of 30 June 2024) and specialises in investing in companies with exceptional growth prospects. Jennison previously managed part of the multi-manager global equity portfolio of Witan Investment Trust (“Witan”) before the latter’s combination with Alliance Trust plc to create Alliance Witan (the “Combination”), which completed on 9 October. Jennison’s allocation of approximately 5% of the Company’s portfolio has been largely filled from a subset of the stocks which it managed within Witan. Most of the balance of Witan’s portfolio transferred pursuant to the Combination has been handed to BlackRock, which is acting as transition manager, for realignment. However, with two managers in common between Alliance Trust and Witan – Veritas Asset Management and GQG Partners – there have also been some other in specie transfers of stock which will be retained. The overall risk profile of the Alliance Witan portfolio will remain largely unchanged from that of the Alliance Trust portfolio before the Combination, reflecting the continuation of the distinctive multi-manager approach previously employed. There will be no major regional, style or sectoral biases relative to the market, with most of the added value designed to come from stock picking. Details of allocations by manager will be available in the next factsheet. Craig Baker, Chief Investment Officer of WTW and Chair of the Alliance Witan Investment Committee, said: “Jennison has long been one of our highest-rated managers and will diversify our exposure to growth stocks. The combination with Witan gives us the opportunity to transfer them in largely in-specie, hence with relatively low transaction costs.” 9 October 2024

Title: TCPC stock touches 52-week low at $8.03 amid market challenges

In a turbulent market environment, TCP Capital Corp (TCPC) stock has reached a 52-week low, dipping to $8.03. This latest price level reflects a significant downturn for the investment firm, which has experienced a -26.42% change over the past year. Investors are closely monitoring TCPC as it navigates through the prevailing economic headwinds that have impacted its performance and valuation. The 52-week low serves as a critical indicator for the company's short-term outlook and potential strategic adjustments moving forward. In other recent news, BlackRock TCP Capital (NASDAQ:TCPC) Corp has announced a series of leadership changes. Rajneesh Vig will step down from his roles as Chairman and CEO but will remain on the Board of Directors until January 31, 2025. Phil Tseng will take over as Chairman and CEO, and Jason Mehring will assume the role of President. Patrick Wolfe has been appointed the new COO, and Dan Worrell will join Tseng as Co-Chief Investment Officer. The company also reported notable financial achievements. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) TCP Capital repaid $250 million of the 2024 Notes, resulting in an increase in the company's asset coverage ratio to 180.2%. The Q2 2024 earnings report disclosed an adjusted net investment income of $0.38 per share and an annualized return on average equity of about 14%. A third-quarter dividend of $0.34 per share was declared, indicating a strong financial position. These recent developments reflect the company's strategic plan for a smooth transition and its commitment to maintaining a diversified investment portfolio. The company's financial strategy, executive changes, and performance are based on recent press releases and earnings reports. TCP Capital Corp's (TCPC) recent dip to a 52-week low aligns with several key insights from InvestingPro. The stock's volatility and recent price decline are reflected in InvestingPro data, which shows a 22.62% price drop over the last three months. This downward trend is further emphasized by the stock trading at just 66.09% of its 52-week high. Despite these challenges, TCPC maintains a significant dividend yield of 24.16%, which could be attractive to income-focused investors. An InvestingPro Tip highlights that TCPC has maintained dividend payments for 13 consecutive years, demonstrating a commitment to shareholder returns even in difficult times. However, the company's financial health presents a mixed picture. While TCPC's revenue grew by 16.64% over the last twelve months, reaching $232.32 million, an InvestingPro Tip indicates that the company was not profitable during this period. This aligns with the negative P/E ratio of -11.32 and the diluted EPS of -$0.71. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 5 additional tips that could provide deeper insights into TCPC's financial situation and future prospects.

Title: Bitcoin Price Surge In 2024 Not Enough To Beat Gold’s Risk-Adjusted Returns – Details Here
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-price-surge-in-2024-not-enough-to-beat-golds-risk-adjusted-returns-details-here/
Time Published: 2024-10-09T11:00:44Z

According to Goldman Sachs, Bitcoin (BTC) price appreciation in 2024 failed to compensate for its price volatility risks. Meanwhile, gold’s higher risk-adjusted returns reaffirmed its “safe haven” narrative. The leading digital asset by reported market cap surged from roughly $42,000 at the beginning of the year to as high as $73,000 in March 2024, recording more than 73% gains. At its current market price of $62,790, BTC is still more than 40% up from its price in January 2024. Notably, throughout 2024, Bitcoin has consistently outperformed major equity indices, fixed-income instruments, gold, and crude oil. However, according to data tracked by Goldman Sachs, despite BTC’s impressive gains, its price performance in absolute terms fails to compensate for its volatility. The analysis by Goldman Sachs puts BTC’s year-to-date (YTD) volatility ratio at just under 2%. In comparison, gold gave a risk-adjusted return of 3%, posting strong 28% gains in absolute terms. For the uninitiated, the volatility ratio measures the return an asset generates for each unit of risk or volatility it carries. A higher ratio indicates that an asset provides better returns relative to the risk taken, while a lower ratio suggests less efficient performance. The analysis notes that Bitcoin’s volatility ratio was only better than Ethereum’s native ETH token, S&P GSCI Energy Index, and Japan’s TOPIX index among the non-fixed income growth-sensitive investments. Bitcoin’s low volatility ratio compared to gold cements the latter’s claim as a “safe haven asset.” This came under the limelight last week when BTC slumped, and gold surged following Iran’s offensive against Israel. Since its inception following the 2008 financial crisis, Bitcoin’s ascent to a trillion-dollar market cap asset has been remarkable. The fixed supply of 21 million, decentralized network architecture, and halving every four years make BTC an appealing asset. However, the market cap gap between Bitcoin and gold remains vast. That said, several crypto analysts are confident that Bitcoin will outperform the shining metal in the coming years. For instance, seasoned analyst Peter Brandt recently made an ambitious prediction that by 2025, BTC could see its price jump 400% relative to gold. Similarly, in August 2024, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck stated that BTC could surge to $350,000 on the back of greater adoption. Most recently, investment management firm BlackRock declared Bitcoin a “gold alternative” due to its fixed supply and increasing investor confidence in its ability to tackle inflation and avoid value erosion during uncertain times. On the contrary, billionaire Ray Dalio has expressed his opinion on the Bitcoin vs. gold narrative, saying that BTC will never fully replace gold. BTC trades at $62,790 at press time, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

Title: MGE Energy, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:MGEE) institutional investors lost 3.2% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mge-energy-inc-nasdaq-mgee-102311006.html
Time Published: 2024-10-09T10:23:11Z
Full Content:
Significantly high institutional ownership implies MGE Energy's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 14 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have bought recently A look at the shareholders of MGE Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:MGEE) can tell us which group is most powerful. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 62% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$3.2b last week. Still, the 27% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. We would assume however, that they would be on the lookout for weakness in the future. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of MGE Energy, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for MGE Energy Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. MGE Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at MGE Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. MGE Energy is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 16% of shares outstanding. With 13% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, The Vanguard Group, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. After doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. While there is some analyst coverage, the company is probably not widely covered. So it could gain more attention, down the track. The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of MGE Energy, Inc. in their own names. Keep in mind that it's a big company, and the insiders own US$6.1m worth of shares. The absolute value might be more important than the proportional share. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. With a 38% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over MGE Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Title: China markets plunge on Beijing stimulus disappointment

Shares in mainland China plunged as traders expressed their disappointment with the lack of new stimulus. The U.S. government’s possible attempt to break up Google weighed on tech. China: Hong Kong and Shanghai plunges over stimulus sadness A day after Hong Kong’s Hang Sang Index posted its steepest one-day plunge since 2008, China mainland shares took their own steep dive. Shanghai’s SSE Composite dropped 6.62% while Hong Kong gave up another 1.38% as investors again voted against Beijing’s Tuesday explanation of its stimulus plans—which offered few details and no new big measures. China’s finance minister will give another briefing on Saturday, at which investors expect more measures to boost the economy. Japan: Nikkei rises as 7-Eleven owner shares rise on higher bid The Nikkei 225 rose 0.87%, buoyed by shares in retailer Seven & i Holdings, which soared as much as 11.7% before closing up 4.71% after Bloomberg reported that Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard had increased its takeover bid by about 20%. Tech shares also rose, as new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dissolved parliament in advance of Oct. 27 snap elections in which he hopes to consolidate power. Europe: Shares waver as fading China optimism and Rio Tinto deal dampen upswing European stocks rose slightly early Wednesday, as fading China optimism softened a general upswing. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was up 0.50% in early trading with broad-based rises, tempered by a drop in Rio Tinto shares on the announcement it was buying Arcadium Lithium for $6.7 billion. The STOXX Europe 600 was up a marginal 0.18%. U.S. premarket slips with Boeing and Google news A day after all three rose, the main U.S. indexes were all down in premarket trading Wednesday, as Boeing’s withdrawal of its pay offer to its striking machinists trimmed 0.8% from its shares, and the announcement that the DOJ might push to split up Google weighed on owner Alphabet. The possible DOJ action weighed on tech more broadly, a day after the group of tech stocks known as the Magnificent Seven all rose, with the largest gain going to Nvidia, up 4.1% Tuesday. And earnings season is here: Delta Air Lines reports on Thursday, and JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock on Friday. CPI data for September will also be released before the bell on Thursday. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Shiba Inu Earns Recognition For Charitable Contributions – Impact On Price

Shiba Inu (SHIB) was announced by a prominent crypto personality as the most donated meme coin as these type of coins continue to grow in importance for charitable causes. This kind of recognition shows how these digital assets can benefit communities and gain business traction. Meme coin projects have earned praise from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin for donating a percentage of their token supply to charity. He thanked the projects and efforts dedicated to this cause in a post on X. Some “meme coins” were used as examples, including “ebull,” among well-known cryptocurrencies contributing to various charities. I appreciate all the memecoins that donate portions of their supply directly to charity. (eg. I saw ebull sent a bunch to various groups last month) Anything that gets sent to me gets donated to charity too (thanks moodeng! The 10B from today is going to anti-airborne-disease… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) October 7, 2024 Based on comments made by Buterin, Shiba Inu community members have claimed that among meme coins, SHIB leads in charity gifts. According to crypto expert Del Crxpto, no other meme coin can even emulate Shiba Inu’s level of philanthropy. For example, several donations, including to the recent Seungil Hope Foundation in Seoul, Korea which supports the country’s first specialized ALS hospital, reflect this growing dedication to giving. $SHIB is #1 in this regard… No one else comes close. https://t.co/PgnMvn8PYx — Del Crxpto (@DelCrxpto) October 7, 2024 In related news, with good breakout and backtest signs in the very vibrant meme coin space, technical analyst Charting Guy has predicted a possible price spike for Shiba Inu.

Charting Guy thinks the dog-themed meme coin is likely to have a major price pump even if the price action has been disappointing lately. Shiba Inu is in the last waiting period, he pointed out, and expected to show a significant upside.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: The Corporate Transparency Act â The most aggressive domestic spying program since the Patriot Act
URL: https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-10-09-corporate-transparency-act-aggressive-domestic-spying-program.html
Time Published: 2024-10-09T06:00:00Z

(Article by Peter McIlvenna republished from TheGatewayPundit.com) These words reflected the general and growing distrust of the government. Today, this quote could be reinterpreted to say, âIâm from the federal government, give up your personal data, and as long as you donât step out of line, we will keep you safeâ. Not as snappy but truer today than ever before. By the end of this year, every citizen in the United States will be required to hand over the personal data of their small business, S-corp, LLC, HoA, Board of Directors, Trustees, Real Estate Holdings, etc., to the Federal Governmentâs law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) under the Department of Treasury. Welcome to the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com (Article by Peter McIlvenna republished from TheGatewayPundit.com) These words reflected the general and growing distrust of the government. Today, this quote could be reinterpreted to say, âIâm from the federal government, give up your personal data, and as long as you donât step out of line, we will keep you safeâ. Not as snappy but truer today than ever before. By the end of this year, every citizen in the United States will be required to hand over the personal data of their small business, S-corp, LLC, HoA, Board of Directors, Trustees, Real Estate Holdings, etc., to the Federal Governmentâs law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) under the Department of Treasury. Welcome to the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal?

Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com Today, this quote could be reinterpreted to say, âIâm from the federal government, give up your personal data, and as long as you donât step out of line, we will keep you safeâ. Not as snappy but truer today than ever before. By the end of this year, every citizen in the United States will be required to hand over the personal data of their small business, S-corp, LLC, HoA, Board of Directors, Trustees, Real Estate Holdings, etc., to the Federal Governmentâs law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) under the Department of Treasury. Welcome to the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name.

Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but itâs back. In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem âmurkyâ at best. The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists. By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government.

That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCENâs true intent here is to âcatchâ millions of small business owners in ânon-complianceâ so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished. Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison. After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name.

Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com After President Trumpâs veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law. Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day. Failure to self-report to FinCenâs law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation. As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question.

Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions. My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime â and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime â being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime? There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the âMinority Report.â The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act.

Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella. A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government. Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use ofâpre-cogsâ to predict who will commit a crime, and then the âpre-crimeâ bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they donât commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?! So in addition to âdefund the policeâ and the âthought policeâ, we now have the âpre-crimeâ police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didnât the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong? Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury. The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted. Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison.

Itâs time to stand up to this blatant attack on stateâs rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America. Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late. Read more at: TheGatewayPundit.com Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act. The Corporate Transparency Act is the âfor profitâ equivalent of the Department of Treasuryâs partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word âtea partyâ and âpatriotâ were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status. Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for âgunâ, âfirearmâ, âpatriotâ, âfreedomâ â you get the idea â they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it canât happen again with for profit businesses? Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees â you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison. That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate âbusiness as usualâ, but âgrandmaâs donut shopâ will be required to show her âpaperâs pleaseâ, if she wants to make a living. Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations. Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause? This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business. Why arenât the State Attorney Generalâs weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question. CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a âfree marketâ economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight. People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act. But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone. A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law âUnconstitutionalâ, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach. More interesting, still, is that the ruling of âunconstitutionalityâ was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you donât, you lose them. Both camps â republicans and democrats â need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella.

Pay no attention to the global investment corporations that are vying for access to the natural resources—like lithium—in North Carolina’s landscape, and the shadowy business with no substantial presence in the marketplace, whose agents are running the property valuation operations! Confused? Allow me to explain. On the FEMA website, one can navigate to a webpage that discloses the recipients of certain federal FEMA contracts, and what services those contractors provide; here’s an explanation of the relationship between FEMA and the private sector: FEMA Advance Contracts for goods and services are competed [sic] and awarded in advance of major disaster declarations to provide efficient, cost-effective means for rapid delivery of supplies and services for recurring disaster response and recovery requirements. If you search for the private companies with contracts for the “Housing Inspection Services” function, you’ll see two contracts, one to “WSP USA Services, Inc.” and the other to Vanguard Inspection Services. Screenshot from FEMA webpage For context, WSP is a environmental consulting firm based out of Canada, with BlackRock and Vanguard Group being major investors. Here’s a breakdown, from The Wall Street Journal “Markets” page: Screenshot from WSJ Markets Regarding Vanguard Inspection Services, it’s got all the markers of a front company; as far as I can tell, it looks as though VIS exists solely to do business with FEMA. From the homepage of the company website: Vanguard Inspection Services is fully committed to providing complete and compliant Disaster Home Inspections under FEMA’s Housing Inspection Services (HIS) Program. VIS’s committed staff, in partnership with our cadre of Independent Contractors performing disaster housing inspections, provide a quality service to ensure disaster survivors receive the assistance they need in an expedient manner. A number of the site’s other pages appear incomplete, with many displaying random code throughout—with who knows how many millions being funneled into VIS, you’d think they’d produce a legitimate looking website, but it just looks like a hack job. (Vanguard Group is not to be confused with Vanguard Inspection Services.) Now, a Florida county government recently announced that FEMA would be conducting “free” home inspections, which is part of the process to rebuild: After Floridians apply for FEMA assistance following Hurricane Helene, a home inspection may be necessary to help determine whether the home is safe, sanitary, and livable. Per the same announcement, inspectors will consider things like livability, whether or not the utility connections and systems are in “working order,” the “structural soundness” of the domicile, and whether or not the property is “safe” to access. First of all, we need to consider the implications of home inspectors, employed in part by BlackRock and Vanguard investments, surveying the damage and assessing the value of hurricane-stricken North Carolina—especially because of the vast lithium deposits in the ground beneath and around these private properties. According to Straits Research, a major market analyst, the demand for lithium is going to explode over the next few years: The global lithium market size was valued at USD 38.2 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach a value of USD 230.4 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 22.1% during the forecast period (2023-2031). This is a more than 500% increase in less than a decade. Here’s this, from a report less than two weeks ago; Albemarle, a major lithium producer, is pursuing lithium production in North Carolina. Earlier this year, it announced plans to reopen the resource-rich lithium Kings Mountain mine in the state by the end of 2026, supported by $150 million in DoE funding. However, it has faced backlash from environmentalists and indigenous groups looking to block the development, which has led to delays. Albemarle is looking to expand its domestic lithium production. And, wouldn’t you know it, but BlackRock is major investor in Albemarle: On August 31, 2024, BlackRock Inc. (Trades, Portfolio), a prominent investment management firm, expanded its investment portfolio by acquiring an additional 2,220,059 shares of Albemarle Corp (NYSE:ALB). This transaction increased BlackRock's total holdings in the company to 12,183,614 shares, reflecting a significant commitment to Albemarle…. Are company agents essentially working on behalf of BlackRock and Vanguard going to be impartial parties as they value and assess the properties destroyed by Hurricane Helene? Are they going to deem these residences “liveable” and “safe” if their bosses want what’s buried beneath the homes? Is there an incentive for these contracted “home inspectors” to screw the homeowners out of their own property? Will these homes be condemned, so the BlackRock and Vanguard bosses can dole out paltry “fair market value” pennies, and become even wealthier? If I didn’t know any better, I’d reckon this is fixing to be one of the great wealth transfers in the history of the U.S. Image: Public domain.

Title: Cardano Surges In Strength—Now 10x More Powerful, Analyst Says

With new developments and predictions, Cardano (ADA) continues to attract attention in the crypto world, presenting investors with a divided picture. Analyst Dan Gambardello recently expressed a bullish prognosis, asserting that Cardano is now 10 times more robust than it was in previous cycles. The long-term prospects appear promising, however, the short-term market sentiment indicates that a cautious approach is preferable. Gambardello said that the move to a fully decentralized, community-owned blockchain is one of the most important changes that makes him more optimistic. This important change happened after the Chang Upgrade went live on September 1. Gambardello said that the update has strengthened Cardano’s base, making it a more stable and independent network. However, this is only one part of the story. Cardano: 10x Stronger Than Last Cycle At This Moment. 🌐 Owned By Community ❌ IOG Burned Keys ⚡ Hydra Scaling 📈 Higher Market Cap Position 🤝 Massive Partnerships 🛡️ Unmatched L1 Security 💰 DeFi Ecosystem 🐻 Survived The Bear As Top 10 — Dan Gambardello (@cryptorecruitr) October 6, 2024 One of the major steps that Cardano took to signify its full shift into community administration was the termination of its genesis keys. Leading this milestone adds another level of security and decentralization to the blockchain, thanks to the efforts of Input Output Global (IOG). According to Gambardello, these elements make Cardano’s network far more robust than it was in earlier cycles. Furthermore, Cardano’s Hydra, a layer-2 scaling solution, extends the network’s appeal. Hydra’s objective is to enhance transaction throughput while simultaneously preserving high levels of security and decentralization. This solution could provide Cardano with a competitive advantage, particularly in its pursuit of dominating the competition with other top networks such as Ethereum, as scalability is a significant obstacle for many blockchains. Cardano has also experienced a substantial increase in its market position. ADA rated 12th in the crypto market and had a market cap of $2.997 billion in 2020. At the time of writing, Cardano maintains a market capitalization of $12.64 billion. Despite recent underperformance, Cardano’s resilience during the 2022 and 2023 market decline has kept it in the top 10 for an extended period. Meanwhile, with technical indicators suggesting a cautious outlook for investors, Cardano (ADA) is presently in a bearish territory in the market. By November 7, 2024, the price of Cardano is expected to climb by 16.86%, according to CoinCodex, to over $0.412024. At 49, the Fear & Greed Index says traders are neutral even at this potential upward trajectory. The price volatility of Cardano had been at 5.70% with 60% positivity, boasting 18 out of 30 days in the green in the last 30 days. Based on these factors, many analysts believe that today isn’t probably the best time to make investments in Cardano.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin ETFs Investors Flock to Fidelity’s FBTC: $235 Million in Two Days

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reported significant inflows totalling $235 million on Monday. Fidelity’s FBTC led the way with the highest daily inflows. Other prominent ETFs, like BlackRock’s IBIT and Bitwise’s BITB, also saw substantial inflows. Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. experienced a significant inflow of $235 million, marking the second consecutive day of inflows. According to data from SoSoValue, Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack with $103.68 million in inflows. Following close behind, BlackRock’s IBIT, the most prominent spot Bitcoin ETF by net assets, also saw a substantial inflow of $97.88 million. This comes after IBIT reported no inflows on Friday, making Monday’s figures particularly noteworthy. While Fidelity and BlackRock led the inflow race, other Bitcoin ETFs also reported positive results. Bitwise’s BITB recorded net inflows of $13.09 million, further adding to the overall momentum seen on Monday. Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB also posted solid numbers, bringing in $12.63 million in net inflows. VanEck’s HODL was another ETF that saw gains, with inflows of $5.37 million, while Invesco’s BTCO brought in $2.53 million. These smaller inflows still contribute to the broader picture of growing investor interest in BTC ETFs. Interestingly, despite the positive trend for most of these products, Grayscale’s GBTC and six other ETFs saw no inflows on Monday. This might be a temporary pause, as GBTC typically plays a significant role in the ETF market. However, focusing on other products could indicate shifting investor preferences or market strategies. Alongside the significant inflows, the total trading volume for the 12 Bitcoin ETFs rose slightly on Monday. The volume reached $1.22 billion, up from $1.19 billion on Friday and $1.13 billion on Thursday. This steady increase in volume shows continued interest and activity in the Bitcoin ETF market. In contrast to Bitcoin ETFs, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs saw no inflows on Monday. This follows a more mixed performance in the days prior, with $7.39 million in inflows on Friday but $3.2 million in outflows on Thursday. The total trading volume for the nine Ethereum ETFs dropped to $118.43 million on Monday, down from $148.01 million on Friday. While Bitcoin continues attracting investor interest, Ethereum ETFs have seen more volatility recently. This could be due to various market factors, including price movements and broader sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price had dipped 0.80% over the past 24 hours to $62,500. Meanwhile, ether, Ethereum’s native token, declined by 1.51% to trade around $2,442. CoinMarketCap data shows that BTC and ETH’s 24-hour trading volumes are up over 50% and 28%. These price movements explain the lack of inflows for Ethereum ETFs, as investors are more focused on Bitcoin during this period. Despite the dip in bitcoin’s price, the positive inflows and rising trading volumes suggest that investors remain optimistic about its long-term prospects. Your email address will not be published.

Wednesday, 09 Oct 2024 NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended higher on Tuesday, with a surge in technology shares driving a broader market rebound that saw the Nasdaq Composite achieve its strongest performance in nearly three weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 126.13 points, or 0.30 percent, to 42,080.37. The S&P 500 added 55.19 points, or 0.97 percent, to 5,751.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased 259.01 points, or 1.45 percent, to 18,182.92. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with technology and communication services leading the gainers by adding 2.12 percent and 1.07 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, energy and materials led the laggards by losing 2.63 percent and 0.37 percent, respectively. Investors' confidence has grown, as many believe the Federal Reserve is making progress in controlling inflation without triggering a recession. "What we're cautioning investors is not to read too much into each data point," said Todd Walsh, CEO and chief technical analyst at Alpha Cubed Investments. "The Fed seems to be on track from what we're looking at." However, concerns about the potential economic impact of the hurricane season remain. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic warned on Tuesday that the effects of the current hurricane season could extend beyond six months. He cited the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene and expressed the hope that the approaching Hurricane Milton would not cause similar levels of destruction. The easing of rising U.S. Treasury yields provided a boost to tech stocks, but interest rate policy remains the primary driver for traders and the broader U.S. equity markets. Investors are now gearing up for the start of the earnings season, which will gain momentum on Friday with results from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock. In addition, they are closely watching for the next major data release on consumer inflation, expected on Thursday. Report it to us. Thank you for your report!

Title: WoW turns 20 (and we turn 20 years older) this year, with a huge anniversary event — here’s what you need to know about patch 11.0.5

NEXT | With Darkmoon Faire and Timewalking, this week is the best for the ... This year isn’t just another anniversary: with World of Warcraft turning 20, the game is getting a massive anniversary event that will let us relive old glories, collect plenty of loot, and even show off our favorite transmogs. The event is so large that it will take up an entire (minor) patch cycle, with all of patch 11.0.5 dedicated to the anniversary. The patch launches on October 22, and we’ll be able to participate in the anniversary celebration through November and December. But let’s get to the details! Here’s everything that’s happening for World of Warcraft’s 20th birthday: If you prefer, you can consume the above information in video form, though if you do I have to assume that it has not in fact been 20 years for you.Also, while I already liked Holly Longdale, seeing her respond to a comment about how everybody remembers Blackrock Depths fondly by saying “fondly is a word” truly cements her place in my heart. This is a woman who has been in a six-hour Blackrock Depths run with countless deaths that fell apart before making it to the last boss. I feel you here, Holly, though I am hopeful my current guild can handle the new raid’s 13 bosses without falling apart.While this event comprises the majority of patch 11.0.5, there are a couple of new things in the patch that aren’t directly related to the anniversary:More goodies for Dracthyr! The formerly Evoker-only race will get new classes (Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, and Warlock) and a special Skyriding talent that will let them soar in a squadron of their fellow Dracthyr.An update to Shamans’ Ascendance form, with variants themed after different elements.I think it’s looking like a fun patch, with plenty to keep us occupied until whatever Blizzard has planned for 11.0.7. I’ll be seeing you at the Trial of Style.Originally published September 4, 2024; updated October 8, 2024.Blizzard Watch is made possible by people like you.Please consider supporting our Patreon!Filed Under: Dracthyr Classes, Patch 11.0.5, WoW AnniversaryAdvertisement Also, while I already liked Holly Longdale, seeing her respond to a comment about how everybody remembers Blackrock Depths fondly by saying “fondly is a word” truly cements her place in my heart.

Title: Nuveen Sells 701 Brickell for $443M in Near-Record Miami Office Deal
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2024/10/nuveen-701-brickell-morning-calm-management/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T21:08:21Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Nuveen Real Estate sold the 701 Brickell office building for $443 million to Morning Calm Management, marking the second-largest office transaction in Miami history, JLL announced. The deal comes about eight years after Zara founder Amancio Ortega’s $540 million purchase of the Southeast Financial Center, a 55-story building in nearby Downtown Miami, which remains the market’s top office sale. Since at least April, Nuveen had 701 Brickell on the market for $500 million. The New York-based investor purchased the 1.1 million-square-foot tower for $172 million in 2002, according to property records. JLL’s Manny De Zárraga, Matt McCormack, Ike Ojala, Hermen Rodriguez and Mike McDonald brokered the recent sale. Last month, hedge fund Elliott Management was under contract to buy the 32-story tower for about $450 million, Bloomberg reported. Besides Boca Raton-based Morning Calm Management, the new ownership includes an undisclosed partner. Representatives for Morning Calm Management, Nuveen Real Estate, JLL and Elliott Management did not respond to requests for comment. Some of the biggest names in finance — Apollo Global Management, BlackRock and Point72 Asset Management — have set up shop at 701 Brickell since the pandemic. Last year, Pura Vida, a popular fast-casual chain, opened a 5,000-square-foot cafe on the ground floor. The property, which was completed 1986, also recently underwent a $30 million renovation. Thanks to these high-profile, high-flying tenants, Brickell — Miami’s financial district — has been home to large office transactions, despite the rise of remote work. Last year, Nuveen bought the nearby 801 Brickell office for $250 million. The asking rent for office space in the district remains the highest in the city, averaging at $93.73 per square foot per year, according to Avison Young.

Title: BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (MUI) Announces Tender Offer in Conjunction with Conversion to an Unlisted Closed-End Interval Fund Structure
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/blackrock-municipal-income-fund-inc-mui-announces-tender-offer-in-conjunction-with-conversion-to-an-unlisted-closedend-interval-fund-structure-93CH-3654265
Time Published: 2024-10-08T20:48:05Z
Full Content:
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Advisors, LLC (BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)) announced today that on October 15, 2024, BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: MUI, the Fund) will commence a tender offer to purchase up to 50% of the Fund's outstanding common shares at a price per share equal to 98% of the Fund's net asset value (NAV) per common share, as described in further detail below (the Tender Offer). The Tender Offer will expire on November 15, 2024 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, unless otherwise extended. The Fund will purchase its shares from tendering shareholders at a price equal to 98% of the Fund's NAV per share as determined at the close of the regular trading session of the NYSE on November 18, 2024 (or, if the offer is extended, on the next day the NAV is calculated after the day to which the offer is extended). If the Tender Offer is oversubscribed, the Fund will purchase shares from tendering shareholders on a pro rata basis, with the result that shareholders may only be able to have a portion of their shares purchased. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Fund will purchase all of a shareholder's common shares tendered in the Tender Offer. Payment for shares tendered and accepted is expected to be made within approximately five business days after the expiration date. The terms and conditions of the Fund's tender offer will be set forth in an Offer to Purchase, a related Letter of Transmittal, and related documents, which will be distributed to the Fund's common shareholders. The Fund will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), which will include an Offer to Purchase and related Letter of Transmittal. As previously announced, the Fund will be converting from an exchange-listed, closed-end fund to an unlisted closed-end fund that conducts periodic repurchases of its shares, also known as an interval fund (the Conversion). Following completion of the Tender Offer, the Fund's common shares will continue to trade on the NYSE prior to the Conversion until the effective date of the Fund's delisting from the NYSE, which will be announced at a later date. It is currently expected that the Conversion will occur in the first quarter of 2025, on such date as will be announced by the Fund at a later date. Shareholders who continue to hold common shares of the Fund following the completion of the Tender Offer, but who do not wish to hold shares of the Fund following the Conversion to an unlisted interval fund, may sell their shares in the normal course on the NYSE prior to the effective date of the Conversion. Please note that, following the Conversion, the Fund's common shares will no longer trade on a stock exchange and shareholders will therefore have limited options to sell their shares outside of the Fund's quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of the Fund's outstanding shares. IMPORTANT NOTICE This press release is for informational purposes only and is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities of the Fund and the above statements are not intended to constitute an offer to participate in any tender offer. Any offer to purchase Fund common shares will be made pursuant to an offer on Schedule TO. COMMON SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THE TENDER OFFER MATERIALS, INCLUDING THE OFFER TO PURCHASE AND ANY SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT REGARDING THE TENDER OFFER, AS THEY MAY BE AMENDED OR SUPPLEMENTED FROM TIME TO TIME, WHEN THEY ARE FILED AND BECOME AVAILABLE, BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION THAT HOLDERS OF COMMON SHARES SHOULD CONSIDER BEFORE MAKING ANY DECISION REGARDING TENDERING THEIR SHARES. Common shareholders may obtain a free copy of any of these statements and other documents filed with the SEC at the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov or by directing such requests to the Fund.

ERIC KIM Just buy Bitcoin and/or Microstrategy stock (MSTR) First, it seems that making money is best and easiest and also most straightforward, and also has much more upside potential if you’re investing, trading, etc. So what is super interesting is if you want to create real wealth, and make a shitload of money, the market… getting an initial public offering, to be on the public traded market and stock market is your best bet. For example, all the wealthiest people on the planet, it is all universally through their stock options: For example Elon Musk has a net worth of $270 billion, as he holds approximately 13% of Tesla, and his shares are worth at around $821, making his Tesla holdings around $187 billion. Jeff Bezos is $204 billion, as he owns about 10% of Amazon. Assuming that Amazon is trading at around $130 per year, his Amazon share are worth approximately $130 billion. Also a shock I haven’t researched this in a long time, Apple is currently worth $3.43 trillion, and Nvidia at a surprising 3.13 trillion! Even super lame Microsoft, 3.04 trillion! Essentially the reason why this is Social shocking to me is that even in my lifetime as a kid until now… To become a millionaire was supposed to be the dream a big deal, now it is centi billionaire — example, Elon Musk has $270 billion! Blows my mind! The reason why bitcoin is by far the most Apex potential upside on the planet ,,, cause assuming that bitcoin is the first true money, the first true digital money, money perfected, and also because it is the biggest technology innovation of our time, then if that is the case, it should become the most valuable thing for the human race of all time. Once JP Morgan Chase starts to custody bitcoin, the price will explode! JPMorgan Chase has recently shared a positive outlook on Bitcoin’s performance for October 2024, referring to a seasonal trend often called “Uptober,” where Bitcoin typically sees a strong month of gains. JPMorgan analysts have highlighted that more than 70% of Octobers have historically resulted in positive returns for Bitcoin. This trend, coupled with recent macroeconomic shifts, including anticipated impacts from the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts, is expected to fuel Bitcoin’s momentum through Q4 .

US stocks rebounded on Tuesday after Monday's losses, with momentum revived by a tech rally and falling crude prices. The Magnificent 7 tech cohort led the market higher, with Nvidia at the forefront. The AI chipmaker climbed 4% on Tuesday, while Meta, Tesla, and Microsoft all traded more than 1% higher. The surge in oil prices that pressured stocks on Monday, meanwhile, retraced, with international and US crude prices falling more than 4%. Energy traders pulled back on Monday as they continued to await retaliation from Israel over Iran's missile barrage last week, while a disappointing stimulus update in China weighed on the outlook for oil demand. In the US, Wall Street is keeping an eye on the upcoming consumer price index report for September. The inflation data will publish on Thursday, and will inform investors what to expect from the Federal Reserve's next policy meeting in November. Though the market had been anticipating another half-point interest rate cut next month, last Friday's big jobs report erased those forecasts. Bank of America expects any upside surprise in the inflation data may keep rates higher for longer. At the same time, Fed officials have cited optimistic expectations for rate cuts to continue. On Monday, New York Fed president John Williams told the Financial Times that a quarter-point cut is a "very good base case." Economists project consumer inflation for September to come in at 2.3% year-over-year, down from 2.5% in August. Tuesday's session also marked the start of earnings season. In a new report, BofA noted that the bar for third-quarter earnings is low, adding that investors will likely reward firms as long as they express confidence about lower rates. Major US financial firms, including JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and BlackRock, report results on Friday. Among Tuesday's notable movers was Roblox, which briefly fell nearly 10% in intraday trading, after short-seller Hindenburg Research took aim at the gaming platform. Meanwhile, China's sharp equity rally showed signs of slowing down. Beijing's failure to announce new stimulus plans on Tuesday has disappointed investors.

Title: Equitable Holdings, Inc. (EQH): Dirt Cheap Stock to Invest In Now

We recently compiled a list of the 7 dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) stands against the other the Dirt cheap stocks to invest in now. The stock market is at a turning point after one of the longest bull runs in recent history. With major market indices close to all-time highs, valuations are getting out of hand. Likewise, the earnings season has seen increased volatility, though, with some significant selling of semiconductor and artificial intelligence stocks that used to draw investors. Soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are complicating the situation and triggering risk aversions in the market. Investors are becoming increasingly cautious and resorting to safe-haven assets due to concerns about a full-blown war in the Middle East that could seriously impact the global economy. READ ALSO: 10 Stocks That Will Make You Rich in 5-10 Years and Bill Ackman Stock Portfolio: 8 Top Stock Picks. Growing geopolitical tensions have been a factor in the stock market’s erratic start to October. According to Barbara Doran, founder of BD8 Capital Partners, things getting out of hand in the Middle East could cause stocks to decline. Surveys of public opinion already indicate that jitters are rising in the market. A gauge of consumer confidence saw its most significant one-month drop in over three years last week. Furthermore, the National Federation of Independent Business reports that a recent survey of confidence among small-business owners dropped more than anticipated in early September, maintaining the gauge below its 50-year average for 32 straight months. “We’re in a Goldilocks moment for the U.S. economy,” said Rich Nuzum, chief investment strategist at Mercer. “But Goldilocks moments are rare, and they tend not to last long. So when does something go bump in the night?” While the market is priced at a premium due to the artificial intelligence frenzy, it does not mean there are no bargains. There are dozens of dirt cheap stocks to invest in now that are trading at discounted valuations depicted by low price-to-earnings multiple and solid underlying fundamentals. Interest rate reduction was expected to benefit small-cap stocks. That isn’t happening. The Federal Reserve’s dramatic interest rate cut two weeks ago has caused the small-cap-focused Russell 2000 index to fall by 0.5%, lagging behind the S&P 500’s 1.3% gain. According to Bank of America, investors should be aware of a few important US stocks while navigating the current market climate. In a note to clients, strategist Nigel Tupper stated that a combination of improving global earnings cycle, easier monetary policy in the US as inflation returns to the target level, and China’s recent multifaceted stimulus appears supportive of equity markets and cyclicals. It is important to note that not all investments will yield significant returns, considering valuations have gotten out of hand with the S&P 500 at an all-time high. Nevertheless, long-term investors can make substantial gains by selecting solid growth stocks trading at discounted valuations. An undervalued company backed by excellent financial fundamentals, such as robust revenue and earnings growth, will always elicit strong interest from professional investors. Therefore, it is likely to enjoy significant share price appreciations down the line. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicts that declining interest rates and rising real wages will contribute to a modest increase in global economic growth this year and next year, which is one of the reasons to be bullish about dirt-cheap stocks. Our Methodology To compile the list of dirt cheap stocks to invest in now, we sifted through screeners and reports, scanning for high-quality stocks trading at discounted valuations. From an initial list of 20 stocks, we settled on the top seven stocks that were trading under a forward P/E of 10, as of October 7, and were the most widely held by hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds that hold them, as of Q2 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forward Price-to-Earnings Ratio: 6.04 Number of Hedge Fund holders as of Q2: 44 Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) is a dirt cheap stock to invest in to diversify an investment portfolio in the financial services sector. The company has been navigating a challenging environment depicted by changing consumer preferences and changes in monetary policy. To increase cash generation by 50% and EPS growth of 12–15% annually by 2027, Equitable Holdings’ long-term prospects remain solid. Notwithstanding probable obstacles in the financial services industry, the company’s management is still optimistic about accomplishing these objectives. Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) delivered solid second-quarter results driven by Asset under management of $0.9 billion with net inflows of $2.3 billion for Retirement and $1.5 billion in Wealth Management. Net income in the quarter totalled $428 million or $1.23 a share. The company continues to see robust organic growth momentum across businesses, highlighted by record Retirement net inflows. Analysts upgraded their 2025 EPS projections from $7.19 to $7.30 in June 2024, a sign of optimism over the company’s earnings prospects. With this upward revision, Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) appears to be moving closer to its long-term financial goals. Equitable Holdings has taken the initiative to establish strategic alliances to strengthen its market position and expand its range of products. Notable partnerships include AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), which are anticipated to propel growth in the business’s RILA division. Particularly, the BlackRock Life Path Paycheck product has been cited as having the ability to propel Equitable Holdings’ growth. This novel offering addresses the rising consumer demand for retirement security by combining target-date investments with lifetime income guarantees. While Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH) is trading at a price-to-earnings multiple of 6.04, it is trading at a discount, given the combination of robust organic growth and favorable market conditions. Additionally, the company continues to return value to shareholders through dividends with a yield of 2.31%. For their shareholdings during this year’s second quarter, 44 out of the 912 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were Equitable Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EQH)’s shareholders, up from 32 in the previous quarter. Overall EQH ranks 6th on our list of 7 dirt cheap stocks to invest in now.

Title: Bitcoin Price Manipulation Linked To HBO’s Satoshi Revelation, Expert Cautions
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/bitcoin-price-manipulation-linked-to-hbos-satoshi-revelation-expert-cautions/
Time Published: 2024-10-08T19:07:12Z

After days of anticipation, HBO is set to release its highly awaited documentary exploring the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin (BTC). While many are eager to uncover the individual behind this pseudonym, one expert warns that the documentary could lead to significant price manipulation in the Bitcoin market before its release. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), market analyst OxNobler cautioned that while the focus may be on Nakamoto’s identity, the real issue lies in the potential “market manipulation” allegedly orchestrated by HBO’s parent company, Warner Bros. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has long puzzled the cryptocurrency community, with various theories emerging over the past decade. As recently reported by Bitcoinist, one prominent candidate is Len Sassaman, a developer known for his work on remailer technology, a precursor to Bitcoin. Proponents of this theory point to several key facts, such as technical contributions, collaboration with Hal Finney, the first recipient of a BTC transaction, and a memorial to Sassaman encoded in the blockchain. While many previously believed that Hal Finney was the man behind the Nakamoto pseudonym, new evidence has surfaced, prompting an ongoing re-examination of the mystery. However, OxNobler warns that the current media push to reveal Nakamoto’s identity may have another purpose. The expert highlights the documentary’s release date, which coincides with key financial events, including the US Federal Reserve’s recent interest rate cut on September 18, the upcoming US elections and the confirmed $16 billion payout by FTX to creditors affected by its collapse in 2022. These factors, combined with potential changes to China’s cryptocurrency regulations, suggest that the revelation of Nakamoto’s identity could have far-reaching implications beyond mere price fluctuations, according to OxNobler. The expert emphasizes the involvement of large institutional investors such as asset managers BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity, major players in the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) space and Warner Bros. According to OxNobler’s analysis, these entities significantly impact the market, often initiating bull runs or selling off at the peak of excitement, with the upcoming documentary event perhaps having the same results for the Bitcoin price. Ultimately, OxNobler speculates that HBO may adopt one of two bullish approaches in the documentary. In a “moderate scenario,” the film could present several candidates as possible identities for Satoshi Nakamoto without definitively naming one. Alternatively, in an “all-in scenario,” the expert suggests that the HBO documentary might explicitly name the individual behind the Nakamoto alias and reveal that they passed away long ago. The expert believes this revelation would mean that no one would have access to Nakamoto’s substantial holdings, potentially removing over 5% of the total Bitcoin supply from circulation and having a bullish effect on prices. At the time of writing, BTC has managed to consolidate at $62,350 after the volatility at the end of last week saw the largest cryptocurrency on the market retreat to $59,500.

This patch brings the 20th Anniversary celebration for World of Warcraft to Azeroth, and we now know it’s coming out the week of October 22! By coming out on October 22 we have our first strong suggestion that The War Within is going to emulate Dragonflight‘s patch cadence, as eight weeks since the expansion released is right in line with the 10.x.5 patches. While patch 11.0.7 probably won’t arrive until after the anniversary event is over in January it looks like regular updates are still in the offing for TWW.What’s in patch 11.0.5 including the 20th Anniversary celebration?The 20th Anniversary celebration will be running from the release of the patch until January 6, 2025 and is promising to be a huge one, with several new events planned.

So far we know that it will also include:New rotation of Timewalking dungeons from Classic, including both wings of Stratholme, east and west wings of Dire Maul, Deadmines, and Zul’Farrak.Dracthyr will be finally be getting classes besides Evoker; starting with patch 11.0.5 you’ll be able to roll Dracthyr Hunter, Mage, Priest, Rogue, Warlock and Warrior.Shaman will be getting new forms for Ascendance … although it wouldn’t surprise me if glyphs arrive shortly thereafter for those who want to keep the current forms.Originally published January 29, 2024.

Join the 20th Anniversary Celebration near the Caverns of Time, spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock, ascend with a new Shaman Ascendance form, and more. Join the celebration as World of Warcraft celebrates its 20th Anniversary with new activities and myriad ways to earn currency. When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Take part in quests and activities to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens to spend on items during the 20th Anniversary Celebration, including returning items from previous anniversaries and new ones. Join Moira Thaurissan as the bronze dragonflight grants her a look back in history, guiding us all through a journey through eight epic boss raid encounters. Players can queue for this epic raid with the Raid Finder (Group Finder Hotkey I) or create their own groups of 10 to 15 players by speaking with Moira for Normal and Heroic difficulties. Paladin Death Knight, Hunter, Mage Warrior, Druid, Priest Monk, Shaman, Evoker Warlock, Demon Hunter, Rogue We’ve modernized some very classic Tier 2 sets for all classes, including those that didn’t exist at the time these sets were introduced—such as Monks and Evokers—for a total of thirteen class sets! Each set comes as an ensemble of 9 pieces, including a cloak, making sure you look the part from head to toe. Step back in time and show off your class pride when you purchase these appearances with Bronze Celebration Tokens earned during the 20th Anniversary Celebration. Take part in a new Timewalking event that will take you through the original version of Deadmines, Zul’Farrak, Dire Maul (east and west wings), and Stratholme’s living and undead dungeons for epic new rewards. Queue up via the Adventure Journal or the Group Finder with players level 10 and above. Players will have the option to visit special vendors to get new mounts, pets, and transmog appearances. Here are just a few items you will find on the Timewalking vendors starting with the 20th Anniversary: Blizzard employees earn special service awards during their time at the company. We’ve taken inspiration from these awards to create a new mount that is fully armored in a similar style—the Coldflame Tempest mount. This blue-flamed flying mount takes after its fiery cousin, the Ashes of Al’ar, and will let you show off your own years of service to Azeroth. Players can also earn appearances based on the employee sword, shield, and crown to show off in-game, along with a version of the employee ring as a toy. Stand out with a 20-Year balloon toy and two adorable baby doomlord pets—Lil’Kaz and Lil’Doomy— you can add to your collection. For a limited time, you will also see some returning Anniversary items that can be also purchased with Bronze Celebration Tokens when you visit Storekeeper Reginald in the Celebration Pavilion and peruse his inventory. This year’s celebration event has expanded, and the bronze dragonflight have taken the activities just outside the Caverns of Time with various new and exciting things to do. Show off your transmog at the Fashion Frenzy stage hosted by Althaea. Mount up to match Abigail Cyrildotr at the Mount Mania arena and show off your mount collection. Join Lorewalker Cho at the Storyteller stage for an epic tale you can’t help but join in on. Take a photo with guildmates, venture to epic vistas, disguise yourself as your pet, cosplay as famous heroes or villains, skate on the rink, or take a balloon for a lazy ride around the event space. There’s plenty to see and do as you join the celebration in Tanaris, and it’s available to players at level 15 and above. There are gate-crashers at nearly every party, and that’s true of our anniversary celebration. We’re bringing back some classic World Bosses from the past, including Doomwalker, Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and the Dragons of Nightmare, along with a couple of additional party crashers in the sands of Tanaris— the Sha of Anger and Archavon the Stonewatcher. Players can join in bouncing them out of the celebration beginning at level 15 to earn some great rewards and anniversary currency. Chromie is up for any challenge, but due to her unique role, she has not kept her codex in order. When asked to put together time tours of the opening of the Ahn’qiraj gate, she’s discovered things are in a jumble. She’ll need help from Azeroth’s heroes to put things to rights once more and send out of place enemies in the sands of Silithus back to where they belong. Players can queue up using the Group Finder for this 10-20 player scenario beginning at level 15. Often a thankless job, guest relations has a new volunteer, Alyx, stepping into the role with the lofty hopes of doing a better job than their predecessor. As visitors pour into the celebration, Alyx is under pressure and could use a little help making it an event to remember. Thankfully, they have found a secret-sleuthing tuskarr family who have become the perfect helpers in getting players up to speed with the tools of the secrets trade. Assist Alyx each week with resolving new guest mysteries by using your new secret-finding skills, and be on the lookout for stolen celebration goods. Follow the rumors and solve the mystery— if you can. We’re counting on you, secret finders. Players can begin working on the initial secrets beginning on October 28 with additional secrets opening up on November 4. Run down your enemies, raze their fortifications, and exchange the tokens you loot from their corpses to summon mighty reinforcements in Korrak’s Revenge, a throwback Battleground inspired by the earliest days of Alterac Valley. Players who complete the quest, “Korrak’s Revenge,” will be rewarded one of two mounts based on your character’s faction: the Stormpike Battle Ram (Alliance) and the Frostwolf Snarler (Horde). Players taking part in the battlegrounds during the anniversary celebration can also click on the Alliance Armory or the Horde War Supplies located in the starting areas of battlegrounds to don the appearance of PvP sets from times past. Celebrate 30 Years of Warcraft with November’s Trading Post. Players will be able to fill the month’s bar to earn four iconic back appearance shields representing the factions of Warcraft III— Orc, Human, Night Elf, and Scourge. Spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock. Undertaking one of these new classes as a Dracthyr will allow you to choose between fighting as a Dracthyr or fighting in Visage form by activating Visage, which switches you between forms. You can additionally choose to toggle on Chosen Identity, which will automatically shift you into Dracthyr form when entering combat and Visage form when leaving combat. Dracthyr Evokers will continue to use Dracthyr form during combat, as many of their abilities emphasize their draconic nature. With the addition of new classes to Dracthyr, we are making some further adjustments to their racials. Dracthyr players will also be able to learn a new Skyriding talent called Squadron in which up to two additional Dracthyr players can join you to fly in formation as you soar through the skies. But wait, there’s more! Shaman can also look forward to new Ascendance forms to express their elemental mastery. Restoration Shaman will get a new Water form, Elemental will get a new Fire form, and Enhancement will get a new Wind form. 1920x1080, 3840x2160, 1080x1920 We look forward to celebrating all things World of Warcraft with you. We’ll see you in Azeroth!

In today’s dynamic business environment, organizations are overwhelmed by vast amounts of data, yet the challenge remains in effectively leveraging this data to inform strategic decision-making. A recent report indicates that companies lose approximately $5.8 million annually due to inadequate data quality and analytics [1]. This alarming statistic underscores the critical need for accurate financial forecasting methods that are agile and capable of adapting to the rapidly evolving market landscape. According to the findings of a recent survey carried out by Finextra, more than two thirds of financial institutions anticipate that in five years finest artificial intelligence (AI) will have been incorporated towards improving risk management and forecasting. Traditional financial forecasting, which often relies on static spreadsheets and labour-intensive processes, is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of contemporary business operations. Therefore, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into financial forecasting is not merely advantageous but indispensable for organizations striving to navigate these complexities and achieve long-term success. The Evolution of Financial Forecasting The evolution of financial forecasting has shifted from labour-intensive, manual processes to dynamic, AI-powered methodologies Historically, financial professionals relied on the analysis of historical data and market trends to generate forecasts using fixed models. While this approach provided some degree of insight, it was inherently constrained by human error, delayed response times, and the inability to effectively integrate real-time data. AI has fundamentally transformed this landscape, allowing businesses to analyse vast volumes of data instantaneously, uncovering trends and making predictions that were previously unattainable. This transition from retrospective analysis to proactive forecasting is reshaping how organizations formulate their financial strategies. The most recent trend in this transition is the proactive rather than the traditional reactive forecasting approach made possible by making use of real-time predictive analytics and machine learning technologies available today in the financial services sector. For instance, JP Morgan’s AI-based COiN platform analysed billions of data points saving 360,000 hours of human labour in forecasting tasks done by population each year. There are changes in terms of operational excellence and exactness. Simply put, the importance of AI in the financial services industry is very high. (https://superiordatascience.com/jp-morgan-coin-a-case-study-of-ai-in-finance/ ) The Role of Predictive Analytics in Financial Forecasting Predictive analytics is central to this transformation. By utilizing historical data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning techniques, predictive analytics enables businesses to anticipate market trends, identify potential risks, and uncover opportunities before they become evident .A key advantage of predictive analytics lies in its ability to enhance accuracy. Through the automation of extensive dataset analysis, AI significantly reduces the likelihood of human error and progressively improves the precision of forecasts. Moreover, AI-driven dashboards can seamlessly integrate real-time data from various sources, including internal accounting systems and external market indicators, ensuring that organizations have access to the most up-to-date information for informed decision-making. Key Benefits of Al-Driven Predictive Analytics Predictive analytics in financial forecasting offers several key advantages that significantly enhance decision-making processes The Future of Al-Driven Financial Forecasting As we look to the future, several transformative trends are set to shape the trajectory of AI-driven financial forecasting: Applications in Financial Services Several large banks and other financial organizations have gone a step ahead and implemented AI in predictive analytic models for financial forecasting. For example, Goldman Sachs has created an approach towards the trading of shares through the incorporation of an AI platform with machine learning thereby enabling the third part to predict prices in a fast changing market. A similar case applies to Blackrock which employs artificial intelligence to enhance the performance and risks of the holding of the investment various instruments it possesses. This is confirmed by one of the instances that tend to show how global companies are already integrating into their operations AI for sales forecasting, which they deem very important. Whether it is about changing the approach towards the management of the portfolio, or measuring the risk, or going back to the operational excellence that is being expected, or decreasing the risks of fraud, nothing is more effective than AI in financial services. (https://thesciencebrigade.com/btds/article/download/165/165/359 ) Challenges and Considerations Apart from the numerous benefits of AI, its use within the segment of financial forecasting also comes with concerns. One of such restraints is the quality of the data and its integration. This means that the models ensure much data is acquired, and such models perform well whenever the data used for their training is accurate and extensive. For financial institutions, this entails spending money on strong database systems which will permit the vertical aggregation of different types of data. Another challenge is the complexity of AI models. As AI systems become more intricate, some professionals in finance may have challenges grasping the reasoning hypotheses that generate some of the predictions. This highlights the importance of developing more understandable AI models as institutions follow AI-enhanced predictions since it helps customers understand the reasoning behind them. Next Trends in AI Systems for Financial Forecasting When trying to talk about the future, there are a number of aspects that can be able to shift the way we have been forecasting in Finance with the help of AI: (https://ijsret.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IJSRET_V10_issue1_138.pdf ) Conclusion AI-enabled dashboards are quite literally redefining the methods of predicting finances, thanks to advanced analytical abilities. Such enabling tools allow corporations, as well as the financial sectors, to fully utilize data in real-time whilst predicting trends more accurately and with better insight in order to make the decisions required. Even if challenges such as data privacy, data integration and data regulatory compliance still exist, the advantages offered by these technologies cannot be over risks. In a subsequent part of the report, companies that apply AI-enabled dashboards will enhance their competitive edge profitability in the course of trading activities in a market that is highly influenced by data. This will allow not only to enhance their financial operations and risk management but also to act in accordance with those rules. These novel perspectives will enhance the organisational financial decision-making capabilities and mitigate the operational risk associated with noncompliance. In this new age, the application of artificial intelligence tools in the analysis and planning of finances will become the new normal. Illegal barriers will be effectively mitigated by those able to embrace today’s technological changes. References 1.

The mTBILL and mBasis products, launched on Tuesday, have no minimum investment requirements. That opens them up to a wide range of investors, including retail traders who are often unable to shore up large sums of capital like their institutional counterparts. “Retail access to tokenized RWAs, like treasuries, is a game-changer,” Midas co-founder Dennis Dinkelmeyer told Decrypt. “This is about giving retail the same access to high-quality assets that institutions enjoy.” Many real-world asset tokenized funds are targeted toward institutional investors, requiring a minimum investment of $100,000. Midas bills itself as the only RWA issuer with a regulatory-compliant offering that has no minimum investment thresholds and investor accreditation process, however. Midas’ new product based on mBasis—the firm's yield-bearing token that tracks a delta-neutral basis trading strategy—offers investors exposure to a tokenized basis trading strategy that has offered up to 25% year-to-date returns, according to the firm. The product is the first to offer full DeFi composability of a permissionless token that is regulated, the firm said. Meanwhile, the mTBILL product offers holders exposure to a lower-risk investment based on U.S. T-Bills, offering a return of roughly 5%, Midas’ website shows. Both tokenized RWAs have secured regulatory approval in Liechtenstein, making them available to retail and institutional traders in various parts of Europe, according to Midas. Early investors in the mTBill and mBASIS products can participate in an incentive program to maximize their investment returns, according to Midas. The first 100 holders of mTBILL will earn 50% APY for a limited time, which will be paid in USDC stablecoin for the first 100 holders of either mTBILL or mBasis. RWA tokenized funds have exploded in popularity in recent months. Earlier this year, BlackRock launched its BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which holds more than $500 million in assets under management, according to Etherscan data. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton's Franklin On-Chain U.S. Government Money Fund, which launched several years ago, has seen its assets under management balloon to roughly $430 million, according to the investment firm's website. The firm has also expanded the fund to multiple additional chains, most recently Aptos and Avalanche. And beyond those traditional finance titans, other firms are launching RWA funds based on different underlying assets. Guggenheim Treasury Securities launched the first-ever commercialized paper fund on Ethereum earlier this month in partnership with blockchain infrastructure firm Zeconomy.

Title: Should You Buy Apple Stock Before or After a New iPhone is Released?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/apple-stock-and-new-iphone-release-8722477
Time Published: 2024-10-08T15:24:26Z
Full Content:
The launch of the iPhone 16 series in September 2024 once again put Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the spotlight. However, the stock had a muted reaction following slower-than-expected sales of the updated release. This raises an important question for AAPL investors: Does the stock go up when iPhones are released? In this article, we'll explore the relationship between iPhone releases and Apple's stock performance. Historically, Apple's stock has exhibited mixed reactions to iPhone launch events. In the lead up to a new upgrade, the stock may rise, but on the day of the announcement, the stock often underperforms the market or experiences a slight decline. This phenomenon can be attributed to the "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, which reflects the market's tendency to price in expectations before major announcements (even positive ones). However, after the initial dip, product releases serve as catalysts for subsequent stock increases. This pattern suggests that while short-term traders might see volatility around launch dates, long-term holders often benefit from sustained growth following successful product updates or introductions. Investors should pay close attention to the days before and after a new product launch to gauge its demand. Positive reception and strong initial sales figures can drive the stock upward, while disappointment or production issues can lead to declines. Apple iPhone sales account for half of all revenues for the company. As the AAPL price chart above illustrates (using a logarithmic price scale), Apple's stock fluctuated around iPhone launch periods. While not every launch correlates with immediate stock growth, the trajectory has been positive, reflecting the company's continued market dominance. In fact, after some releases, the stock remained flat or declined for several months before continuing its broader bullish trend. This is because, while important to the company, the iPhone is just one part of Apple's overall portfolio. While new iPhone features grab headlines, investors are increasingly focused on Apple's services growth and its potential in emerging technologies like AI. Various products and services beyond the iPhone contribute to Apple's revenue and stock performance. These include the Mac lineup, iPads, Apple Watch, AirPods, and services like the App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+ streaming service. The company's ecosystem creates multiple revenue streams, reducing reliance on any single product. Apple has also been attempting to derive a more significant proportion of its revenues from services since these are less reliant on the physical products that can be snarled by changing economic conditions, technological shifts, as well as inflationary, supply chain, and other pressures. In 2023, Apple services accounted for more than a fifth, 22%, of all revenues. This has helped keep Apple's stock price moving up over the years. The chart below shows its stock price and the change in the value of a $10k investment in Apple over 30 years. While iPhone and other product launches are significant events for Apple, here are other factors that influence the company's stock performance: The top holders of AAPL stock are institutional owners, which include the Vanguard Group, BlackRock Finance Inc. (BLK), State Street Corporation (STT), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A). As of the fourth quarter of 2024, 32 out of 38 analysts covering the stock have a "buy" or "strong buy" recommendation on AAPL stock, with an average near-term price target of around 5% to 7% higher than the present share price. Apple usually releases its newest iPhone series in the Fall (September or October) of each consecutive year. The iPhone 16 was released in September 2024, so the iPhone 17 should be released in the Fall of 2025. For the most accurate information, keep an eye on official announcements from Apple. Apple's annual iPhone release, typically in September, often creates a buzz in the stock market. Investors closely watch these events, as the iPhone remains Apple's flagship product and a significant revenue driver. However, the stock's performance during this period isn't always predictable. While positive reception to new iPhone features can boost share prices, the stock sometimes experiences a "buy the rumor, sell the news" effect, where prices rise in anticipation but dip after the announcement. Several factors influence Apple's stock around iPhone launches. These include pre-order numbers, analyst projections, and broader market conditions. Supply chain issues or production delays can also impact investor sentiment. Apple's stock performance is increasingly tied to its growing services segment and other product lines, not just iPhone sales. Potential investors should consider Apple's overall financial health, competitive position, and long-term strategy rather than focusing solely on iPhone launch events. Michael M.
