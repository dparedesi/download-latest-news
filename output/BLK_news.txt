Title: BlackRock calls Bitcoin one of the biggest investment themes of the year

Share this article BlackRock has named Bitcoin as one of its top investment themes for 2025. The asset manager has featured the crypto asset alongside T-bills and the Magnificent Seven tech stocks on its iShares page. The firm has been a major player in the Bitcoin market since launching its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF last January, which has grown to become the largest spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the US. BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund has reached $68 billion in assets under management as of the latest data. The ETF has attracted nearly $63 billion in net inflows since its trading debut. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has confirmed that sovereign wealth funds are accumulating Bitcoin, signaling a shift from short-term speculation to purpose-driven, long-term investment.

Title: BlackRock names bitcoin ETF a top 2025 theme despite price slump
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/22/blackrock-names-bitcoin-etf-a-top-2025-theme-despite-price-slump

BlackRock named its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund (ETF) one of the top three investment themes for 2025, a striking move given bitcoin’s BTC$87,950.54 slide this year. The firm placed IBIT alongside two more traditional offerings: the iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT). Bitcoin has dropped more than 4% year-to-date, the first decline in three years, and IBIT has mirrored that performance. Even so, the ETF has seen strong investor interest. IBIT ranks sixth among all ETFs by 2025 inflows, pulling in over $25 billion since January. “It's easy to frame this as BlackRock simply promoting its highest-revenue product,” said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. “But I see it more as the firm doubling down on its conviction that bitcoin belongs in diversified portfolios.” Geraci noted that BlackRock has other ETFs, like the gold-focused IAU, that are outperforming IBIT and charge higher fees. Yet the firm is spotlighting a product that underperformed in 2025, a rare move in an industry that typically pushes its top-performing funds. “If the objective were purely revenue generation, BlackRock has no shortage of ETFs with significantly higher fees that it could emphasize instead,” he said. “Asset managers aren’t typically in the business of spotlighting underperforming products, particularly when they have a deep bench of outperforming alternatives they could highlight.” The inclusion of IBIT as a top 2025 theme signals a long-term bet on the crypto asset by the world’s largest asset manager. For investors who still see crypto as speculative or fringe, BlackRock’s positioning of bitcoin alongside cash and stocks may shift that perception.

Title: Crypto in 2025 was defined by two big trends—and only one of them is obvious
URL: https://fortune.com/crypto/2025/12/22/crypto-2025-two-big-trends-wall-street-stablecoins-defi/
Time Published: 2025-12-22T12:52:16Z
Full Content:
‘Tis the season for “biggest story of the year” articles and, when it comes to crypto, the choice in 2025 was not hard. The obvious pick is Wall Street’s full-on embrace of crypto, which saw banks and big companies tripping over each other to show they are down with stablecoins and tokenized assets. But look a little closer and you’ll see 2025 featured another major, but more subtle, trend: the ongoing expansion of DeFi and decentralized technology. This has been reflected in the huge growth of DeFi platforms like Hyperliquid, and in Coinbase’s decision last week to add Jupiter, a leading aggregator for decentralized Solana trading, to its app. Such developments have helped decentralized exchanges nab a bigger share of overall crypto trading volume, with degens now accounting for a double digital share of the spot trading market. The CEO of Maple Finance, one of the leading players in the decentralized space, this week went so far as to claim “DeFi is dead”—implying that on-chain trading has become so big that it is poised to swallow conventional systems altogether. I wouldn’t go that far (at least not for a few years), but you get the point. The CEO’s remark also highlights how, in coming years, we are likely to face confusion over what exactly the term decentralized means. For longtime blockchain enthusiasts, the term implies using blockchain technology to build more democratic alternatives to powerful institutions—including big banks, but also the likes of Google and Facebook. But if this is the promise of crypto, what should we make of JPMorgan and BlackRock launching new on-chain money market funds available to those with $5 million or more to trade?It’s a win, of course, that blockchain technology has proved so good that the most respected names in traditional finance are using it. Still, it’s hard to get excited about giant corporations using blockchains to sling commercial paper when the original goal was to democratize large sections of society and the economy. The situation is reminiscent of the quip: “They promised us flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.” Jeff John Roberts jeff.roberts@fortune.com@jeffjohnroberts Coinbase offers stock trading: The company says its move into equities will let it be a bridge to the era of tokenization. Coinbase also launched prediction markets in a tie-up with Kalshi, intensifying its head-to-head competition with Robinhood. (Fortune) Here come the big banks: The country’s eight largest banks are putting tens of millions into a new non-profit that will “tell the banking industry’s story”—a clear response to crypto firms’ mass lobbying efforts, and one that could complicate the push for new blockchain legislation. (Axios) North Korea’s record haul: The Hermit Kingdom’s notorious military-backed hackers out did themselves in 2025, stealing a record $2 billion in crypto—the lion’s share of the estimated $3.4 billion stolen overall. (Fortune) PayPal’s hard path: The fintech giant’s CEO told Fortune his company is facing a “very classic innovator’s dilemma” as it doubles down on crypto and stablecoins to try to keep pace with competitors. (Fortune) Bitcoin OGs still selling: Longtime Bitcoin holders keep off-loading their positions, which helps explain ongoing pressure on prices. The move may not signal a loss of confidence, but rather a sign of the market maturing as one-time HODLers take advantage of new liquidity supplied by ETFs and institutional funds. (Bloomberg) Caroline Ellison is back in the news after the former CEO of Sam Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund was released from federal prison. Her onetime boyfriend, meanwhile, still faces decades of hard time. The feds arrested a Brooklyn man for impersonating a Coinbase staffer in order to steal $16 million from around 100 traders. The suspect’s “lolimfeelingevil” alias probably won’t help at his sentencing hearing.

Title: BlackRock moves $182M in Bitcoin and $91M in Ethereum to Coinbase Prime

Share this article BlackRock sent 2,019 Bitcoin worth approximately $182 million and 29,928 Ethereum worth around $91 million to Coinbase Prime on Monday, according to blockchain data tracked by Arkham Intelligence. Markets tend to pay close attention to the firm’s on-chain movements, which frequently are followed by large flows later in the day or in subsequent sessions. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETFs saw over $240 million in net outflows last week, while its Ethereum funds shed roughly $558 million without a single day of positive flows, per Farside Investors. Crypto investment products lost $952 million in capital last week. The downturn ended a four-week streak of inflows, largely due to $555 million exiting Ethereum funds and $460 million from Bitcoin funds. After dipping below $85,000 late last week, Bitcoin rebounded past $90,000 ahead of today’s US market open. The recovery boosted sentiment across the board, lifting the total crypto market cap by 1.5% to $3.1 trillion in the last 24 hours, per CoinGecko. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

According to a post shared on X by Keith Grossman, president of crypto payments firm MoonPay, finance is heading toward an onchain future that could unfold over several years. The view comes as large banks and asset managers begin product tokenization, a move that once seemed extreme but is now being treated as a practical step by major institutions. Based on reports cited by Grossman, progress has accelerated because rules are becoming clearer. Legislative efforts, regulatory guidance, bank involvement and accounting standards are starting to line up. That combination reduces uncertainty, which is often what slows large pools of capital. BlackRock has already launched tokenized funds, while Franklin Templeton is running tokenized money market funds on public blockchains. Those actions suggest that tokenization is no longer confined to pilot labs or internal trials. It is being used with real assets and real clients. Bank of America recently said that banks are heading toward a multi-year, onchain future. A few years ago, that would have sounded radical. Today, it sounds inevitable. 20+ years ago, I began my career in media and saw firsthand what happens when an analog industry collides with… — Keith A. Grossman (@KeithGrossman) December 21, 2025 Banks are also taking part. Citi, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have all been linked to onchain settlement tests, tokenized deposits and near real-time asset transfers. These projects focus on reducing friction in back-end processes that have existed for decades. Settlement that once took days could be shortened to minutes if shared ledgers are used. That change alone alters how risk, liquidity and cost are managed across markets. Grossman framed the moment as similar to earlier shifts in other industries. He pointed to how legacy media struggled when distribution moved online more than 20 years ago. At the time, many firms tried to protect old revenue streams instead of adapting. Some survived by changing early. Others lost influence as new platforms took control. In finance, the pressure point sits in areas such as reconciliation, clearing, settlement and custody. These roles have long supported steady margins, partly because they depend on complex and slow systems. Reports have disclosed that software and shared protocols can now handle much of that work. As a result, some services may become cheaper and less profitable over time. That does not mean banks disappear. According to Grossman’s view, they remain central players, much like they did after ATMs reduced teller roles or when voice-over-internet systems cut long-distance call costs for telecom firms. The institutions stayed, but their shape changed. The same pattern is expected here. Banks may rely more on software, fewer manual steps and new forms of infrastructure control. Tokenization is moving faster than expected, according to MoonPay president Keith Grossman. Banks and asset managers are testing tokenized funds and onchain settlement, signaling that what was once experimental is now becoming practical. The lenders and other big players are among the firms pushing the shift, showing the trend is already under way.

Title: Ripple’s RLUSD Breaks Into Top 5 Stablecoins As It Marks Its One-Year Anniversary
URL: https://zycrypto.com/ripples-rlusd-breaks-into-top-5-stablecoins-as-it-marks-its-one-year-anniversary/

Ripple’s RLUSD has marked its first anniversary, rising to the top five stablecoins and securing regulatory approvals across the globe. In the coming years, the team has its sights set on challenging the dominance of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, capitalizing on a streak of regulatory wins. RLUSD, a US dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Ripple, has marked its first anniversary, notching impressive numbers in under 12 months. Launched on December 17, 2024, the RLUSD has inched its way into conversations for leading stablecoins. According to Standard Custody CEO Jack McDonald, Ripple has joined the top five stablecoins, reaching the milestone in “record time.” While not expressly stated, McDonald’s comments in an X post refer to the category of US-regulated stablecoins, specifically those with OCC and NYDFS licenses. Under this subset, Ripple’s RLUSD ranks in third place behind Circle’s USDC and PayPal’s PYUSD with market capitalizations of $78 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. One year after launch, Ripple’s market capitalization sits at $1.3 billion, making it “one of the fastest climbs in the regulated stablecoin space.” “I’m excited to celebrate the one-year anniversary of RLUSD,” said McDonald. “We’ve gone from 0 to a top 5 USD stablecoin in record time.” However, CoinMarketCap data ranks RLUSD eighth by market capitalization, including both US-regulated and offshore stablecoins. Apart from its frenetic surge over one year, RLUSD racked up impressive milestones along the way. Right off the bat, the OCC’s conditional approval of Ripple’s National Trust Bank charter puts RLUSD in pole position for regulatory compliance. To cement its place in the enterprise market, Ripple tapped BNY Global to custody RLUSD reserves and enlisted Deloitte for attestations as an added layer of credibility. Outside the US, RLUSD has received regulatory approvals in key jurisdictions such as Dubai and Abu Dhabi. All year long, RLUSD has been cementing its place as a major bridge for real-world assets (RWA). The stablecoin offers BlackRock and VanEck’s tokenised funds with a 24/7 off-ramp, extending its institutional use case. Meanwhile, plans for multichain expansion are underway with Ripple pursuing interoperability on Optimism, Base, Ink, and Unichain. “It was undeniably the year of the stablecoin, and I can’t wait to see what 2026 has in store,” said McDonald.

Title: When things go right: Happy Christmas stories of the best of customer care

When it comes to highlighting shocking customer care in Ireland and the myriad ways readers have been let down, this page is rarely found wanting. But with it being the season of goodwill and all, we thought we might suspend our giving out for one day and instead celebrate all the soundness we’ve come across in recent times. Here are just some of the stories people have shared with us across social media platforms and via email since the start of this month. One thing that strikes us (and not for the first time) is how little it costs – in financial terms – to go above and beyond and how potentially great the returns are for businesses and people who do right by their customers. One reader, Elva, got in touch to sing the praises of All Seasons Flowers in Lucan Shopping Centre, Co Dublin. “At the beginning of November I placed an online order for a fresh door wreath and a Christmas table arrangement, with collection scheduled for Saturday, December 6th,” she said. “When I arrived, the team realised there had been a mix-up and they had prepared two wreaths instead of the wreath and the table arrangement. “They apologised profusely and immediately refunded the cost of the table arrangement.” She is undergoing cancer treatment and had been driven quite a distance to the shop by her partner as she had recently had surgery, which meant returning another day was not really an option. “I accepted the refund without any issue. However, the following day, Sunday 7th, I received a genuinely thoughtful email from the owner Emily Gaynor, apologising for the oversight and explaining it fell short of the standard they aim for, especially for orders placed well in advance for Christmas. “As a gesture of goodwill, she insisted on creating the table arrangement free of charge and arranging delivery to my home. It arrived today and it’s beautiful. “For a small business to go to such lengths after having already refunded me speaks volumes about their integrity and commitment to their customers. “In a time when good service can often feel rare, All Seasons Flowers in Lucan really stood out.” Niamh contacted us to praise the Christmas-tree sellers outside the Tesco in Newbridge, Co Kildare. “My 75-year-old mum couldn’t make the Christmas tree stand on her own, so they went up and put up the tree for her as well free of charge. I thought that was really sweet.” [ ‘Regift the bejaysus out of it’: 21 tips for a cheaper Christmas, from readers and from us ] Gina, meanwhile, had kind words for Clarkes Bakery in Cabra, Dublin, although it is more of a story of kindness on the double, really. “My husband was recently in the Mater recovering after a heart bypass,” she says. “He heard one of the nurses was celebrating a big birthday, but had to work over the next few days and wasn’t going to get out to celebrate,” she said. So Gina’s husband called Clarkes. “He ordered a large birthday cake and had planned for a taxi to collect it and deliver it to the hospital – on the phone with the bakery when everything was ordered they told him that they are a cash-only business. “But they took the order and delivered the cake on the basis that when he was out he would call in and pay for it. Of course, he couldn’t drive for weeks and when I called in to pay it was ... no big fuss. “Such a lovely kind thing and amazing customer service. They deserve a big shout-out.” Fiona had two stories to share: one from times past and another from recent days. When she was a student about 17 years ago she was getting the Bus Éireann service to Limerick from Galway to visit an aunt. “I lost my ticket and needed to get on the bus. I was really flustered and nervous. I was too broke to get a new ticket and the bus driver saw me looking anxious. When he came over to me, my face was so flushed and I explained that I lost my ticket,” she said. “He must have felt sorry for me and told me he saw me buying a ticket, which I doubted because he had just got off another bus. He said it was OK, took my bag, put it in the luggage area and told me to go on to the bus. “I was so embarrassed and grateful that I welled up when I sat down. I couldn’t believe his kindness.” Fast forward to 2025 and she has another transport story to share, this time involving Aer Lingus. “I was on an Aer Lingus flight and the woman in front of me looked so stressed. She was flying on her own with a baby and a toddler. When the flight took off, the baby kept crying and mother looked increasingly flustered,” Fiona wrote. “Later, she was trying to hold the crying baby with one hand and unzip her bag to get something for the toddler with the other hand. “The air hostess came over with a broad smile and asked if she could take the baby for a while. “She picked up the baby, kept her close to her chest, started rocking her and cooing her for about half an hour. The baby stopped crying and the mother looked so relieved and grateful. “It was lovely witnessing an act of kindness that meant so much to someone in a state of stress and anxiety. “I always find Aer Lingus have brilliant customer service and it’s not the first time I’ve witnessed an act of kindness from their staff.” Margaret, meanwhile, recently had to email Spotlight Oral Care as her toothbrush of less than a year old gave up. “I got an email requesting some details and short video of the toothbrush,” she writes. “I sent the requested info and the next email was to confirm replacement on way. It was so efficient and all within a matter of a few days. Excellent customer service.” We are big fans of the Saw Doctors on this page, so were delighted when the band – or at least someone acting on their behalf – got a shout out. “My wife and I recently brought our 14-year-old son to his first music gig – the Saw Doctors in the Olympia,” Shane wrote. “Our son hadn’t been in the theatre before so when we got in, we brought him down to the front of the standing area so he could look up and back at all the levels and boxes and see how fantastic a venue it is.” As it happens, there was a section cordoned off at the very front where they restrict numbers standing close to the stage. “As we went to make our way back into the general standing area, the floor manager (we think) came over to us and gave us wristbands so we could stand in the priority area at the front, where it would be less crowded and more suitable for our son,” Shane says. “As if that wasn’t enough, the floor manager then sought us out and came over to present our son with one of the handwritten set lists from the band to keep as a memento of his first gig. “I believe his name was Tommy K (apparently a coincidence that it was one of the Saw Doctors songs on the night) – he certainly deserves a shout-out for going above and beyond unprompted on the night.” Grainne from Galway recently needed some ties for her outdoor Christmas lights, so called to O’Higgins in Shantalla. She told the sales assistance what she needed “and he could not have been nicer. He brought me out to a big stockroom at the back of the shop. He went through all the options and said, ‘While these may not be what you are looking for, they will work’. I decided on tile clips, which did the job. “I just want to call out the time, the interest and how helpful this gentleman was. The sale came to €5, so it wasn’t as if I was a big customer with a large order, but he still gave me the time and showed interest.” She also praises Blackthorn Candles and Blazer Candles, two Galway candle companies. “I ordered candles from both above candlemakers in Galway to shop local. The candles from both places were really good quality and well made with a lovely scent. To my surprise both gentlemen arrived at my front door and delivered them personally. “Great service, great candles, great to support local companies.” Staying with fragrances, Paddy wrote in about “a small business called Handsome Scent on Stephen Street in Dublin. They do home-produced fragrances (with “inspiration-from”) some of the higher-priced shop ones. “I bought a set of three fragrances and one of them had leaked in the post. I sent a message on Instagram and they posted a new one that day and I had it the next day. “No messing, quibbles, just really good service.” [ 100 Irish websites for all your Christmas presents, from Claddagh Guinness socks to cheese ] Ciara Kelly – the one on the radio – also got in touch to highlight how a cold Christmas was once averted by the soundness of Ultima Oil in Kilpedder, Co Wicklow. She ran out of home heating oil on Christmas Eve and tells us she “left a message on Ultima Oil’s answering machine (they were finished up for Christmas) asking if we could get a delivery as soon as they reopened. “We went out for lunch and came home to a full tank they had delivered on Christmas Eve afternoon so we wouldn’t be cold. They said we could pay after Christmas. It was unbelievably kind,” Ciara said. She actually has a second story of goodwill. “Another Christmas, it was a week to go and Greystones butcher Des Doyle rang me to say I hadn’t ordered a turkey and no problem if I’d ordered elsewhere, but just in case I’d forgotten he was checking as it was the last chance to get one. I hadn’t ordered elsewhere and Des Doyle saved Christmas.” Last January reader PJ bought an air fryer from Harvey Norman in Rathfarnham, Dublin. “A couple of weeks ago it started to switch off halfway through the cycle. It was still under warranty, so they asked me to bring it in so they could have a look at it,” he says. “The unit was taken away and five minutes later the sales assistant returned with a replacement. The paperwork was sorted in minutes and she put it on a trolley and followed me out to the car. That’s what I call customer service.” Another reader, Richard, says: “There’s the best of small bookshops in Blackrock in Dublin called Raven Books. Louisa runs it and she’s an absolute gem. Helpful, knowledgeable, affable, dedicated, hard working. She’s just brilliant. “But best of all, and although some time ago now, she delivered books on her bicycle to my three kids to the door during Covid, when things were closed. They were utterly delighted by it. “I haven’t bought a book anywhere else since. She more than deserves a mention.” We also heard from a reader called Doreen, who got in touch to praise Global Windows. “The attention to detail, professionalism, courtesy and reliability is way beyond any other company/contractor who worked on our house refurbishment,” she says. “Every single contact I had from the initial sales person to the guys actually fitting the windows were a pleasure to deal with.” [ Beware the ghost of “Buy Now Pay Later” and have a savvy Christmas ] Next up is Ciara, who says she had “some niggly adult-life stuff happen recently and it always really helps when a) people are sound and b) people do what they say they are going to do”. Ciara has three good news stories to share. “During the summer, a large and heavily filled plate drawer under the hob of our fitted kitchen (new house, only three years old) locked while pulled out and refused to close,” she says. “I was away at the time and messaged the original kitchen fitter and supplier, Stuart Malcolm from Onovo. I got a quick text back from him and he confirmed he was out my way and could have a quick look. “He not only fixed the drawer, he confirmed it wasn’t overloaded by weight/amount of plates/bowls etc and continued his way around all the units adjusting the bin drawer and larder press. “Just good workmanship and he refused to take any payment. He was just sound.” That was not the only issue she had with her three-year-old kitchen. Her oven died and she went to Worrells/Expert in Malahide, Co Dublin, where she got “loads of advice and patience from Paul while we considered reconfiguring our oven(s) set-up – amending cabinetry. We didn’t in the end. “After admiring the workings of our brand new oven, I noticed the above fitted microwave door wasn’t closing properly and while he hadn’t moved it during the installation process the same guy came back to tweak the microwave for me free of charge.” And finally she tells us about “an absolute head-the-ball teenager [who] came in the exit gate of my local Dart station on a e-scooter with a girlfriend on the back, dressed in black and with no lights doing at least 30/40kph. “He screamed abuse so loud at me for bumping over his scooter, with such loud cursing that my husband left the platform and saw him leave the scene again, at speed on his scooter all at 7.30am in the dark while my car went into limp mode with sensors beeping and €1,300 worth of damage to the wheel arch, front bumper etc.” The car was repaired by “the lovely lads at Trimtech Santry who said this was a regular occurrence (and interestingly, a lot of parents were paying cash for the damage done by their unlit, uninsured and unregistered e-scooting teenagers – that’s a whole other article). “Picked up car, repaired and fully washed and fully internally valeted – so sound.” To finish, we have some shorter stories shared by users of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Meadbh had a “recent interaction with Virgin Media for TV and broadband. Admitted to the billing error straight up and rectified the situation straight away. People I spoke with were absolutely sound also.” Julie says: “I think Tesco Mobile deserve the recognition for their excellent customer service. I’m with them several years and any issues I’ve ever had were sorted nearly immediately with the utmost professionalism. Their customer service is fantastic.” David applied to renew his passport on a Thursday morning “and it arrived next morning”. You can’t beat that. Denise had praise for Bloomfield Garage on Dublin’s South Circular Road. “I rang them in a panic about warning light on the dashboard of an imported hybrid. My husband was just admitted to hospice, so I was already very emotional. The owner, Paul, said, ‘Right, come in and we’ll have a look’. It was only battery in key fob, but his kindness made my day.” Our weekly personal finance newsletter will give you the insight you need to save money and make smart spending decisions © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: SEC to Open Floodgates for Dual Share Classes

The agency granted approval to dozens of providers last week but reserved the right to bring future hearings. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com The Securities and Exchange Commission finally brought dual share classes to the masses … some of them, anyway. The SEC announced last week that it will allow dozens of issuers to offer ETF share classes of mutual funds and vice versa, so long as the SEC doesn’t order hearings against the applications. The move is the agency’s first announcement on the topic since November, when it approved Dimensional Fund Advisors’s proposal. Despite being largely expected, experts said the decision underscores the ongoing ETF boom and the expectation that ETF adoption by traditional money managers will increase. “Managers who were traditionally not in the ETF space, are now very much so in the ETF space,” said Rich Lee, head of program trading and execution strategy at Baird. “Approval for the share class [is] really going to be a huge igniter … It helps these managers get access to a channel that maybe they’ve not traditionally been in.” The primary benefits of a dual-share-class structure include tax efficiency and liquidity, as the benefits of an ETF wrapper are brought to mutual fund structures, and potentially to retirement accounts. But it won’t all be smooth sailing from here, Lee said, since many logistical and operational hurdles remain for traditional managers who haven’t had to learn the ins and outs of ETFs before. “[Some managers] may not be as familiar, or may not have direct firsthand experience with in-kind custom baskets,” he said, referring to how issuers can create baskets of securities and transfer them directly to whoever is redeeming shares, thus reducing taxes. “That’s going to be something managers are going to have to get comfortable with. It’s a new tool in their arsenal.” While larger managers likely have existing products or the resources in-house, smaller money managers may have to rely on the expertise of others to get their funds off the ground, he added. According to the SEC’s notice: Solid, Gas, Liquidity. Liquidity will be something to watch, Lee said, since many of these funds need to hold more cash or other liquid assets, which could cause an increase in underlying fees. “There’s more listed tickers for ETFs out there in the marketplace than there are actual single stock tickers,” he said. “It will be interesting to see what the impact of this influx of active managers doing custom in-kind baskets … has for balance sheets.” There are 11 ETFs with over 5% of assets allocated to the stock. But most assets are held in gigantic funds with small exposures. Unit investment trust no more, Invesco’s massive ETF will see revenue directed away from marketing — something the company has long wanted. With the average cost of health care regularly outpacing inflation, Americans are struggling to afford it. The fund is State Street’s way of tapping the retail market, but it might be the last new dominant S&P 500 entrant. A new legal standing for marijuana could help change how ETFs track and invest in the cannabis industry. The company is planning to add 10 target-maturity ETFs. Vanguard and State Street have also moved to fill out their bond-ladder lines. With more than $1.4 trillion in flows and more than 1,000 product launches, it’s safe to say the industry is booming. A new proposed ETF would hold bitcoin only after markets close. Wanna bet? ETFs aren’t for gambling, but a rise in risk-on products could prove irresistible to a population obsessed with sports betting. After a dive, the company’s stock is still up 8% in 2025, while both long and short leveraged ETFs are down. The world’s largest asset manager and issuer of the biggest crypto ETF is expanding into staked Ethereum. Is there room for anyone else? Active fixed-income strategies accounted for nearly half of ETF inflows so far this year. © 2025 The Daily Upside

PHOTO: CK HUTCHISON HOLDINGS LIMITED Published Dec 22, 2025, 09:03 AM Updated Dec 22, 2025, 08:28 PM HONG KONG - Mr Li Ka-shing and his family set in motion a series of deals in 2025 that stand to completely transform his business empire. a series of deals in 2025 The Hong Kong billionaire’s flagship conglomerate, CK Hutchison Holdings, is pursuing three major moves: an initial public offering of its retail arm to raise at least US$2 billion (S$2.6 billion) for its largest revenue contributor; a potential listing or partial sale of its global telecommunications operations; and talks to sell 43 port assets – representing the bulk of its global portfolio for more than US$19 billion in cash. The Li family, which controls about 30 per cent of CK Hutchison, believes selling and spinning off these businesses can unlock far greater value than the market currently assigns to them under the existing structure, a person familiar with the plans said. By separating the assets, the family hopes to fetch higher prices and narrow the steep discount at which the company trades relative to its net asset value. If CK Hutchison completes all these deals, it would have shed or spun off most of its core operating businesses, handing Mr Li’s elder son Victor Li – who now chairs the group – a fresh war chest to reshape the company in an era defined by trade tensions and technological disruption, including the rise of artificial intelligence. “The Li family has accumulated massive wealth over the past decades,” said Mr Vincent Lam, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based VL Asset Management. “The most important thing for the family now is to make sure that the wealth is monetised and safeguarded.” The moves mark a generational shift for one of Hong Kong’s most storied business empires. Mr Li Ka-shing built CK Hutchison into the world’s leading port operator and a major player in European telecommunications, leveraging political connections and riding on global expansion. Mr Victor Li, who took over in 2018, faces the challenge of steering the group through a far more volatile environment, where geopolitical sensitivities and regulatory hurdles loom large. In his heyday, Mr Li Ka-shing’s wealth ballooned as Hong Kong grew into an international financial hub, capitalising on China’s opening to a world that embraced collaboration and deepening trade ties. His uncanny sense of timing led to the nickname “Superman”. He expanded aggressively abroad – buying ports in Panama, building mobile networks in Britain and operating oil plants in Canada. By the early 2000s, he had built his group into the world’s largest port operator and the biggest Asian investor in European telecommunications. But the landscape has changed since Chinese President Xi Jinping assumed power, tightening the state’s grip on the private sector and keeping once-powerful tycoons at arm’s length. In Hong Kong, Mr Li Ka-shing and his peers are viewed with growing scepticism by Beijing, while abroad, his perceived ties with China have raised suspicions and created political hurdles for his operations – many of which sit in highly regulated industries. The Li family has lately found itself on the wrong side of the politics. The 97-year-old billionaire, who once rubbed shoulders with China’s top leaders, has fallen out of favour with President Xi. Over the past decade, state media has criticised him for selling assets in China and for remarks seen as sympathetic to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy youth. Beijing’s anger over CK Hutchison’s planned ports sale was so intense that state-owned firms were instructed to pause dealings with the Li family. “Li’s empire was built on intricate political connections he developed in the past,” said Mr Lam. “That’s not easy for Victor to inherit, because the world’s and China’s political environments have changed drastically.” According to people familiar with the family’s thinking, geopolitics was not a factor in the decision to pursue these deals. The Lis believe that restructuring the portfolio is the most effective way to bolster value. But regardless of the family’s motivations, US-China rivalry may now be the biggest obstacle to realising their plans. Talks over the ports sale have slowed amid regulatory hurdles and uncertainty surrounding the buying consortium’s structure, particularly after CK Hutchison invited China Cosco Shipping into negotiations to appease Beijing’s sensitivities over the involvement of US investment firm BlackRock. CK Hutchison invited China Cosco Shipping into negotiations Meanwhile, deliberations on the potential listing of retail arm A.S. Watson Group have been on-again, off-again since 2013, hampered by market volatility, while telecoms mergers frequently encounter intense antitrust scrutiny. CK Hutchison has been advised to move more cautiously with deals due to the delicate geopolitical environment, and to notify Chinese regulators on the potential retail listing because it involves operations in the country, a source said. Still, the potential deals have helped reverse depressed market sentiment, narrowing steep trading discounts to net asset value and driving a 32 per cent stock surge in 2025 – outperforming the benchmark Hang Seng Index. While the Li family is divesting CK Hutchison, it has been increasing its holdings in property arm CK Asset Holdings, now owning a stake of about 49 per cent. The bulk of CK Asset’s projects are located in Hong Kong and mainland China. It also operates British brewer and pub chain Greene King. “The Li family is bold in selling assets when the price is right,” said Natixis senior economist Gary Ng. “The series of moves can be a build-up of cash for acquisitions, leading to a sector shift in the company.” CK Hutchison is not alone in rethinking strategy. With Hong Kong’s global status diminished amid China’s growing influence and rising trade barriers, other storied business groups are also reshaping themselves. Jardine Matheson Holdings, a British-rooted conglomerate in Hong Kong, has been taking measures to modernise its management and accelerate divestments. Controlled for generations by the Keswick family, the 193-year-old group in recent years dismantled its long-criticised cross-shareholding structure and appointed several executives with private equity backgrounds to its top management. Its property unit, Hongkong Land Holdings, aims to raise US$10 billion over the next decade through asset disposals and spin-offs. The company is transitioning from being an owner-operator to a long-term, engaged investor, Jardine’s executive chairman Ben Keswick said in a statement for the group’s 2024 earnings report. Quiddity Advisors analyst David Blennerhassett said: “Both Jardine and CK operate conglomerates with various listed subsidiaries – and arguably they both are being proactive in extracting value.” BLOOMBERG E-paper Newsletters Podcasts RSS Feed About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Need help?

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is encouraging America’s wealthy and large corporations to finance the administration’s Trump Account investment program. “The president is calling on our nation’s business leaders and philanthropic organizations to help us make America great again by securing the financial future of America’s children,” Bessent said Wednesday during a press conference on the initiative. “Given the amazing level of interest and the generous donations we have seen so far, I am confident we will see many more pouring in.” Trump accounts aim to give American citizens born from Jan. 1, 2025, through Dec. 31, 2028, an initial $1,000 in a tax-deferred investment account. That money is intended to give newborns a starter fund by the time they turn 18. It was a key provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, now known as the Working Families Tax Cut Act, that the president signed into law in July. Parents and guardians are permitted to donate up to $5,000 a year, and employees up to $2,500, until children become 18. With a limited long-term federal funding for Trump accounts, Bessent is urging large companies and America’s wealthy to step in and top off the nest egg before the program formally launches next summer. Earlier this month, Michael and Susan Dell committed to donating a massive $6.25 billion to the initiative, ensuring children aged 10 and under who were born before 2025 will get up to $250 in their accounts. Last week, hedge fund manager Ray Dalio announced he will donate $75 million to Trump accounts for children in his home state of Connecticut. Companies such as BlackRock, Charter Communications, Visa, Mastercard and Uber have similarly committed to making donations of their own. Bessent isn’t alone in seeking to nudge the private sector to step up. Earlier this month, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) inked a letter to the CEOs of every Fortune 1000 company pressing them to pony up. “By matching contributions for employees’ families, investing in the communities where you operate, or integrating these accounts into your philanthropic strategy, you can significantly enhance the impact of this historic initiative,” they wrote in the letter. Booker has long proposed setting up an investment account system for America’s youth, similar to Trump’s eponymous initiative. Meanwhile, Bessent is encouraging states to step up as well. “The administration has been working closely with a number of governors to determine the best way states can work with the federal government to expand access to Trump accounts,” Bessent revealed last week. “Thus far, 20 states are considering topping-up the accounts.” Advertisement

Title: Tokenization will disrupt finance faster than digital disrupted media: Crypto exec

Putting real-world assets onchain opens up new markets, increases capital velocity and democratizes access to finance, advocates say. Tokenization will transform the financial industry faster than digital technology disrupted legacy media, such as print newspapers, physical copies of music and other analog formats, according to Keith Grossman, president of crypto payments company MoonPay. “While many feared digitization would destroy media, what it actually did was force its evolution,” Grossman said, adding that real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, the process of representing traditional assets onchain, will force traditional institutions to adapt. He added: Financial incumbents like Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and others will continue to exist in a different form, Grossman said, much like media companies continued to exist after the shift to digital distribution in the late 1990s and early 2000s, which disrupted business models that worked for decades. Ultimately, the survivors and winners of the ongoing shift toward tokenized finance will be those companies that get ahead of the change and not those that attempt to stop the inevitable shift to a global financial system powered through blockchain rails, he said. Related: Wall Street’s $4 quadrillion backbone to roll out tokenized US Treasurys Tokenizing real-world assets carries several benefits, including enabling 24/7 access to markets, making asset classes global in scale, cheaper transaction costs through disintermediation, and lowering settlement times to minutes, instead of days. In September, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued a joint statement on creating a regulatory framework to enable 24/7 capital markets. The financial system shifting to 24/7 trading represents a major departure from how traditional markets, which close on nights, weekends and holidays, currently operate. In December, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a settlement and clearing company that processed about $3.7 quadrillion in settlement volume in 2024, received approval from the SEC to start offering tokenized financial instruments. The DTCC plans to roll out tokenized assets in the second half of 2026, starting with US Treasuries and stock indexes.

Title: Dalkey woman could decide if Netflix-Warner Bros merger goes ahead

With Netflix and Paramount both vying to buy Warner Bros Discovery, the suits of the entertainment industry are on manoeuvres in Washington, seeking a kindly nod from US president Donald Trump for their billion-dollar proposals. An Irish person is involved. Gail Slater, the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division of the all-powerful US Department of Justice is, conveniently for this column, from Dalkey, south Co Dublin. The UCD law graduate retains dual citizenship and is generating increased attention in the US as she wrestles with a slate of high-profile mergers. It’s a mixed picture for corporate bigwigs under Trump 2: some of the tough love dispensed by Joe Biden’s then-32-year-old anti-monopoly watchdog Lina Khan has dissipated and companies have resumed eating each other in pursuit of economies of scale. But that’s not necessarily popular among the meat-and-potatoes Maga masses. Slater is married to a former chief of staff to a Republican congressman from Idaho and worked as an adviser on big tech in the first Trump White House. She cuts a relatively hardline figure and has made clear that she believes in “America First antitrust”, which means standing up for “Main Street not Wall Street”, as Trump has put it in the past. The job is made harder, as the New York Times has pointed out, by the fact that Trump himself keeps taking positions on matters before the court, including saying he would be “involved” in the decision on the proposed Netflix-Warner merger. “I think a big challenge for Gail is, how impulsive will the president be?” William Kovacic, a former mergers watchdog, told Politico in a profile of Slater. “You can’t say, ‘My God, shut up,’ because then you’re fired. So you cross your fingers and hope you’re not a target.” Another person making waves abroad is author Stephen Rea – not the actor, though equally from Belfast – who has just published Ozzy & Me, a memoir of his relationship with Ozzy Osbourne. Rea grew up during the height of the Troubles and amid the chaos, including an incident during which his house was shot at by gunmen, he found refuge in music. Controversial Irish-language electro-rap troupes had not yet been invented at that stage, so he turned to the next best thing: heavy metal. Aged 15, he noticed a music magazine write-up of Rock in Rio, a giant metal festival featuring Ozzy, AC/DC and Queen set to take place in Brazil. His father, in the most magnanimous decision ever made by the father of a teenager, said they should go. Perplexed as to how to go about this, his mother wrote to Osbourne’s secretary, who promptly responded with VIP passes. Rea went, met Osbourne and struck up a 40-year friendship with the family. Rea, whose demonstrable ability to take a leap of faith has most recently taken him to New Orleans, secured a foreword from Jack Osbourne, who watchers of early 2000s MTV reality show The Osbournes will remember as Ozzy’s son, though watchers of a more recent reality TV show, I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, might know him better from that. Through decades of the metal hero’s career, Rea is in the room where it happens. At one point, in 1980s Glasgow, he recounts: “By 4am we were down to Randy [Rhoads, the bombastic lead guitarist], Geezer [Butler, bassist for both Black Sabbath and Ozzy’s solo material] , Ozzy, and me,” with “Randy throwing glasses against the wall and Geezer belting out Irish Catholic rebel tunes, Ozzy joining in though he didn’t know them.” Ozzy promises to write one for Rea. “That would have gone down well with my Protestant friends and family,” he muses. Good news for the groups of English men who often descend on Dublin to drink pints and shout at each other: JD Wetherspoon has cut a deal to supply Guinness to its Irish outlets. The divisive UK pub group, which trades on its low prices and impressive locations, has served the black stuff in Britain for a long time alongside its various curry deals and halves of Old Peculier (correct). But early in its foray into the Irish market in 2014, it decided that St James’s Gate was charging too much for its stout and struck it from the menu at the Three Tun Tavern in Blackrock, south Dublin. Almost 12 years later, the deal has finally been done for its six outlets. Overheard rarely seeks refreshment at such establishments. But Guinness has been on a dramatic upsurge in popularity at home and abroad in recent years, with the Guardian even recently predicting that it will soon lose its cool in the UK – a sure sign it’s on a high. It must be surprising to stag party attendees and lost locals, therefore, to show up to Wetherspoons establishments only to be told they can’t have it, mere miles from its birthplace. A press release promises it’ll be on the menu imminently – although, of course, there are 6,000 other places you could get it all along. One tourist to Dublin this week was Greta Thunberg, the globally famous Swedish climate-and-Gaza activist who visited Áras an Uachtaráin and got up to various other activities related to her Palestinian solidarity activities. Thunberg has had a busy year, having sailed on a flotilla towards Gaza, near which she was intercepted and detained by Israel, alleging harsh treatment. A broad smile and a warm welcome from the President, therefore, given their similar interests. Overheard’s eye was caught by a striking battle scene in a painting behind Catherine Connolly and her activist visitor at Áras an Uachtaráin as they posed together. It depicts the Battle of Ballinahinch, an engagement in the 1798 rebellion. Painted by Thomas Robinson, its original title is Combat Between the King’s Troops and the Peasantry at Ballinahinch, and it is a contemporary depiction of the engagement, which saw the Presbyterian-led Co Down rebels take on the crown. Some 4,000 United Irishmen under Henry Munro lost the battle (and ultimately the war). Robinson – an English painter of Irish subjects who wowed the critics in Belfast and Dublin before dying in Jervis Street in 1810 – painted it up and it was raffled off. The Marquess of Hertford won it, but ultimately it came to the Office of Public Works (OPW) – and to the Áras, where the Lord Lieutentant Marquess Cornwallis might have mulled his troop movements many years ago. Still, despite early defeats the rebels, like President Connolly after her knockback in the Galway Labour Party, claimed victory in the end to some degree. Thunberg, aged just 22, has time yet. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Letters: State funding for penniless artists is always money well spent

Comedians can now apply for . Photo: Getty Madam — I write in response to Aidan Harte’s letter (‘Sinn Féin goes beyond satire by embracing subsidised comedy’, December 14). I have followed efforts by the members of the Irish comedy community, particularly Ailish McCarthy, to have comedy recognised as an art form. Mr Harte referred to “new spending”, but there is as yet no indication of this. What has changed is comedians can now apply for grants, along with playwrights, dancers, sculptors and painters. Until now, they were simply dismissed, because the legislation hadn’t included the word “comedy”. Incidentally, Mr Harte expressed a preference for right-wing comedy. I would encourage him to write a few right-wing zingers and pop along to an open mic and give them a go. The public will let him know if they’re funny. In terms of public funding, it’s true that not every piece of art is going to be a masterpiece, but the fact that the Arts Council supports the attempt is a good inclination towards the society I want to live in. Besides, the most successful music, art, film, video games and so on are built on the backs of fringe, often penniless, artists trying something that might inspire people. The penniless part is important there. The Basic Income for the Arts is a much-needed lifeline for the few individuals who have so far benefited from it. It was not “pushed through with little scrutiny” as Mr Harte suggested; it was trialled over an extended period, with success. There is an organisation called Minding Creative Minds that has data on just how high the rates of depression and suicide are in the arts, and it is staggering. If Basic Income for the Arts will not fix that altogether, but if it lifts the pressure and darkness off a handful of individuals and gives them the space to pay their rent and put food in their bellies and pursue the art that the very heart of them demands they do, then I think it’s an incredibly worthwhile investment. Why make it any harder for the people who just want to paint for you, or dance for you, or make you laugh? Aidan O’Sullivan, Dublin Madam — I am aghast at Ciara Kelly’s column (‘Ceasefire in Gaza may be imperfect, but to what end do we boycott and sanction Israel after the peace plan has been brokered?’, Life, December 14). I am incredulous that anyone believes now is the time to ease pressure on Benjamin Netanya­hu’s regime, simply because there’s a faux ceasefire in place that Israel violates every day. The point of sanctioning and boycotting this regime isn’t about “punishing them” for the last two years. It’s beyond belief that any observer or comment­ator on the Middle East would suggest this. The so-called ceasefire and peace plan are designed to do nothing more than encourage journalists like Ciara to write articles like the one published last week, to encourage people to move on: nothing to see here any more. We can’t move on, because that’s what the Israeli regime wants us to do. We can’t move on because the genocide, ethnic cleansing, apartheid, human rights violations, breaches of international law, building of settlements, terrorism by sett­lers, land grabbing, abuse and torture of hostages (described by our media as “detainees”, including children), controlled starvation of Gazans continues. Sanctions allied with econo­mic, social, cultural and sporting boycotts of this disgusting regime are not just the only way to bring pressure on Netanyahu’s genocidal regime and bring about change in Israel; they are also the only morally respon­sible thing to do. Brendan Farrell, Kildare Madam — Hours after reading Michael Jordan’s egregious letter (December 14), the news came through of the Islamist killings at a Jewish gathering on Bondi Beach in Sydney, celebrating Hanukkah. Michael Jordan has a problem with Jews living in Israel, their biblical homeland, where, in spite of historical expulsions and dispersions, there remained throughout history a Jewish presence. It is not possible to be anti- Zionist, anti-Israel and not be anti-Jewish. Israel, with a 77pc Jewish population, is not “an ethno­cracy”, unless the Republic of Ireland with a non-immigrant population of 78pc can be classed as such. On the contrary, both are democratic states. Ena Keye, Rathfarnham, Dublin Madam — Last Sunday, I read a letter to the editor by Michael Jordan, denying Jews the right to a homeland of their own, followed by learning of another example of “globalising the intifada” on Bondi Beach. It is sad to see the lack of historical knowledge and empathy about why Jews had to establish their own state. Frank Devine, Kenilworth, Warwickshire Madam — While the late justice minister Paddy Cooney was a great “law and order” man during the 1970s (‘Fine Gael TD and Justice Minister renowned for hard line on IRA during Troubles’, December 14), he was also liberal. The prevailing Adoption Act, a relic of 1952 as amended, in effect prevented childless couples in “mixed marriages” where one spouse was Catholic and the other of any other or no religion from adopting a child. It was the product of a very Catholic Ireland and was self-­evidently ­unconstitutional, because the State may not discriminate on grounds of ­religion. As one of a mixed marriage, albeit with our own children, I was conscious of the wounds that would befall couples in childless, mixed marriages who were not permitted to adopt. So, as a newbie to politics, I moved a proposal at the Fine Gael annual conference in Cork in June, 1972, calling for reform of the Adoption Act. It was approved. Two years later, in 1974, Mr Cooney successfully introduced the reforming legislation. Today, the civil act of adopting a child is free of religious impediment. John F Colgan, Leixlip, Co Kildare Madam — I was told in my local pharmacy last week that doses of the flu vaccine were in short supply, due to demand. So why are the HSE and the Medical Council not doing more to advocate the use of face masks and more vigorous hand-sanitising? One of the most effective ways of containing flu or any other infective virus this Christmas is to wear a mask, especial­ly in crowded places or on public transport. Often the most effective solutions are the simplest. Brian Lube, Co Meath Madam — While having sympathy for people who have gender dysphoria, a solely ­activist-led approach to care would be no way to run any medical programme, which should be based on scientific evidence (‘I bear the scars of a healthcare system that fails trans people’, December 7). As the Cass Report noted, social transition is “not a neutral act”. Children do not have the capacity to consent to puberty blockers and opposite sex hormones that will affect their fertility and health for life. Trans activists may claim to want bodily autonomy, and may be supported by “progressive” politicians, but I do not think our poorly resourced health service should be removing breasts and mutilating the genitals of healthy adults, just because someone requests it. Medicine and medical treatments should always be evidence-based and doctors should “do no harm”. Helen Robinson, Blackrock, Dublin Madam — While “peace and goodwill to all men” is the order of the day at Christmas, let us not forget our little feathered friends seeking shelter from the cold wintry winds, severe frost, foggy nights and heavy rain in our garden hedgerows. Looking out at our bird-feeder one day recently and discovering it was empty, I immediately topped it up. Almost instantly, the birds emerged from their many hiding places and descended at speed to gobble up the food. As I sat at a discreet distance, observing them as they ate heartily, a cock robin perched close by, observing the feeding frenzy, master of all he surveyed. So, as the robin adorns our greetings cards at Christmas, let us not forget our little feathered friends who come to stay with us each year, and provide them all with a generous helping of goodies each day. Tom Towey, Cloonacool, Co Sligo Madam — I agree with Sarah Breen that Australia has the right idea with its social media ban for under-16s (‘Let’s follow Australia on social media’, Dec­ember 14). As a clinician for more than 25 years, I have seen that the number of young people att­ending counselling has exponentially risen as a result of the use of phones. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary Madam — Has the role of the RTÉ Guide been usurped by the Sunday Independent? Four articles over three pages (including the front page) in last Sundays paper — are people really interested in the employment arrangements of those highly paid individuals in Montrose? Harry Mulhern, Dublin 13 Madam — It’s impressive for any institution to last 120 years, but for a newspaper it borders on heroic (‘120 years of Sundays — and some things stay the same’, December 14). The Sunday Independent has survived revolutions, censorship, political fury and commercial pressure. That alone deserves congratulations. As a child at Tullysaran Chapel, I remember the papers laid out for sale on a Sunday morning: the Sunday Independent and the Sunday Press, two confident piles. No imported English scandal sheets shouting for attention, just Irish voices arguing loudly with one another. It felt like a small but important civic ritual. Over its 120 years, the Sunday Independent has informed, irritated and occasionally infuriated its readers. I read pieces that make me want to spit. That is the point. Democracy is not meant to be soothing, and freedom of speech rarely is. At a time when governments dodge scrutiny and tech olig­archs would prefer not to be accountable at all, it is journalists, in the Sunday Independent and elsewhere, who continue to ask the awkward questions. They do so under pressure, often under attack, and with diminishing resources. They deserve more credit than they get. Long may the Sunday Independent endure, and long may there be a free, unfettered press that refuses to behave itself. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh Madam — In the vein of former Sunday Independent editor and fellow Kerryman Aengus Fanning’s diktat of “tell it as it is, no matter what the cost”, outlined in Liam Collins’s lively reflection of over a century of publication, I’d like to add my own tuppence worth. A few months ago, an acquaintance asked was I the McElligott that “writes” in the Sunday Indepen­dent. I replied bashfully that I have been known to fire off the odd missive. Wishing all your readers and my fellow wordsmiths a very happy Christmas. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry Madam — Eoin O’Malley’s column (‘When politicians have to plead with judges, democracy is in danger’, December 14) frames the debate about the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) as a “fight” between elected politicians and an “ideologically committed” judiciary. The contention that judiciary activism is at fault for the curr­ent deadlock is to understate the political disagreements between the 46 members of the Council of Europe. A meeting is planned for next for May to discuss the application of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Normally, there would be behind-the-door diplomacy and compromise before the summit. These negotiations would form the basis of a political declaration, which the conference would ratify. The recent politic­al declaration by 26 countries, including Ireland, was high-stakes diplomacy. It is an expli­cit acknowledgment that there is significant discord. It was not a plea to the judges. It was a public power play for the May meeting. It was significant that countries such as France, Germany and Spain did not sign it. The COE statute requires “important matters”, such as political declarations, to be unanimous. A “decision” on the interpretation of the convention by the ECtHR requires a two-thirds majority, or 31 members. Andy Hales, Kenmare, Co Kerry Madam — Bernie Linnane refers to “the compassionate, accepting and kind Irish public who decided to trust women (regarding abortion) to make their own decision about their own bodies” (Letters, December 14). I wonder how these people view the shocking fact that more than 50,000 abortions have taken place here since the 2018 referendum, despite assur­ances by the Yes side that they would be “rare”. Mary Stewart, Ardeskin, Donegal town Madam — The picture of a seated Donald Trump shaking hands with Zohran Mamdanmi accompanying Declan Lynch’s column (‘To stand up to Trump, all we need is a backbone’, December 14) raises two protocol issues. One should not remain seated while shaking hands, nor should one place one’s free hand on top of the one involved in the “shake”. Mind you, I doubt if Donald would even consider holding up his hands and admitting his gaffe. In summary, a whole lot of shaking going wrong. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont Dublin 9 Madam — Like Gerry Hickey (Letters, December 14), I have had my fill of filler phrases like “you know”. But it’s the ubiquitous “in relation to” that comes out tops with me, often occurring multiple times in the same media utterance by seasoned communicators. Tony O’Neill, Bishopstown, Co Cork Madam — I find it bemusing that politicians, chief execut­ives and others of that ilk always seem to find it necessary to start an answer with the phrase: “Let me be quite clear.” I have never heard any interviewer finish a question by stating: “I want total lack of clarity in your response.” So let’s have no more “Let me be quite clear” and just be clear.

Title: Analyzing Ethereum’s price rebound as BlackRock shifts $109M in ETH

Large ETH transfers surfaced after the rally, but conviction across markets stayed thin. Ethereum’s recent rebound attracted institutional and whale attention, with several large holders moving ETH to exchanges after the rally. The activity followed ETH’s sharp move higher after the Bank of Japan’s 25 basis point rate hike. That behavior raised questions over whether large players expected near-term downside or were simply rotating capital after gains. Crypto transaction tracker Onchain Lens reported on X that BlackRock deposited 36,579 ETH, worth about $108.4 million, into Coinbase over the past 24 hours. The post also showed that BitMEX Co-Founder Arthur Hayes sent 680 ETH, valued near $2.03 million, to Binance, a move often associated with potential selling. Whale activity often draws attention because large transfers can influence short-term price direction. Traders frequently track these wallets for clues around sentiment shifts or liquidity needs. At press time, Ethereum [ETH] traded near $2,980, up about 0.85% over 24 hours. Spot market participation, however, weakened during the same period. Trading volume fell 52% to roughly $18.47 billion, suggesting limited conviction behind the move. That slowdown contrasted with derivatives positioning. Even so, Open Interest rose 2.46% to $38.51 billion, indicating traders added leveraged positions despite muted spot activity. That divergence suggested positioning rather than organic demand drove recent price stability. AMBCrypto’s technical analysis on the daily chart revealed that ETH was consolidating in a tight range between $2,790 and $3,000. Meanwhile, the broader market structure remains in a downward trend. Source: TradingView Based on the price action, a major rally in ETH would likely be possible only if it breaks out of this tight consolidation range. If the broader trend continues and the price breaches and closes a daily candle below the $2,790 level, it could trigger strong downside momentum. Conversely, if the trend shifts and the altcoin closes a daily candle above the $3,000 level, it could signal an end to the prolonged downward momentum. Besides these key levels, the momentum strength indicator Average Directional Index (ADX) has reached 30.39, above the key threshold of 25, indicating a strong directional trend in the asset. Meanwhile, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has further reinforced the bearish outlook, as its value dropped to -0.05, signaling rising selling pressure and capital outflows from the asset.

Title: Brazil’s Largest Asset Manager Recommends Investors Put Up to 3% of their Money in Bitcoin to Hedge Against FX, Market Shocks
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/brazils-largest-asset-manager-recommends-investors-put-up-to-3-of-their-money-in-bitcoin-to-hedge-against-fx-market-shocks/
Time Published: 2025-12-20T17:00:00Z

The recommendation is in line with other global asset managers like BlackRock and Bank of America suggesting small portfolio allocations to the largest cryptocurrency. Brazil’s largest privately-owned asset manager, Itáu Asset Management, has recommended investors allocate 1% to 3% of their portfolios to bitcoin. In a year-end note, Renato Eid, head of beta strategies and responsible investment for Itaú Asset Management, argued that bitcoin’s lack of correlation with traditional local assets makes it a useful diversification tool. The note echoes the bitcoin allocations recommended by other major asset managers. Earlier this month, Bank of America greenlit wealth advisors to recommend a BTC allocation of up to 4%, while BlackRock has pointed to 2%. Eid emphasized a measured approach, not turning crypto into the centerpiece of a portfolio but using it as a complementary asset that can help absorb shocks from currency depreciation and global volatility. “The idea is not to make cryptoassets the core of the portfolio but to include them as a complementary component — sized appropriately to the investor’s risk profile,” Eid wrote. This year, bitcoin surged to a record near $125,000 before falling back to around $90,000. For local investors, the ride was even bumpier due to currency fluctuations. Products like BITI11, a bitcoin ETF traded in Brazil, saw their performance in reais affected by the weakening fiat currency. But in periods of stress, such as late 2024, the global nature of BTC provided some insulation. Eid warned against trying to time the market and suggested a disciplined, long-term mindset. A small, steady exposure to bitcoin, he says, can act as a partial hedge and offer access to global returns, especially as traditional asset correlations become less reliable. “It calls for moderation and discipline: set a strategic slice (for example, 1%–3% of the total portfolio), keep a long-term horizon and resist the temptation to react to short-term noise,” Eid wrote.

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF ranked sixth in 2025 ETF inflows despite posting a negative annual return, a signal analysts say reflects long-term conviction. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has ranked sixth in net inflows despite being the only fund in the top cohort posting a negative return for the year. Data shared by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shows IBIT pulling in roughly $25 billion in year-to-date inflows, even as its annual performance sits in the red. By comparison, several traditional equity and bond ETFs ahead of IBIT on the leaderboard posted double-digit gains, while gold-backed ETF GLD, which is up more than 60% on the year, attracted less capital than IBIT. Balchunas described the result as a “really good sign” over the long term, arguing that the flows reveal more about investor behavior than short-term price action. “If you can do $25 billion in a bad year, imagine the flow potential in a good year,” he wrote, pointing to what he called a “HODL clinic” from older, long-term investors. Related: BlackRock IBIT Bitcoin ETF achieves $70B AUM record Meanwhile, one crypto market participant questioned why sustained institutional buying through ETFs has not translated into stronger price performance. In response, Balchunas suggested the market may be behaving more like a mature asset class, where early holders take profits and deploy income strategies, such as selling call options, rather than chasing immediate upside. He also noted Bitcoin had risen more than 120% the previous year, tempering expectations for continuous gains. On Friday, US spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs saw $158 million in net outflows, with Fidelity’s FBTC the only fund to post inflows. Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs recorded $75.9 million in outflows, extending their losing streak to seven consecutive days. Related: BlackRock's most profitable ETF is now a 'hair away' from $100B BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF faced heavy pressure in November, with its flagship IBIT fund recording about $2.34 billion in net outflows, including two large withdrawal days mid-month. Despite the pullback, BlackRock executives downplayed concerns. Speaking at Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo, BlackRock business development director Cristiano Castro said the firm’s Bitcoin ETFs have become one of its largest revenue drivers. He argued that ETFs are designed to facilitate capital allocation and cash-flow management, making periods of compression and outflows normal.

Title: We Have Reached the Emily Litella Moment on Climate Change

It’s been a cold winter so far in the Midwest and much of the Northeast, early-in-the-season snow even in Washington, D.C., and temperatures falling to freezing and below in much of the South. Come to think of it, North America’s 2024-25 winter was pretty cold, too. It’s gotten to the point that “polar vortex” is a phrase on just about everyone’s lips. Of course, you are surely aware—as those of us with doubts about inevitably disastrous global warming were often told—that there’s a difference between weather and climate. Weather is anecdote, climate is longstanding trend. And the longstanding trend in climate, we have been told this entire past quarter-century, is toward a hotter climate all over the world, with multiple catastrophic consequences. Now, we seem to have reached an Emily Litella moment—the moment when, on the now half-century-old “Saturday Night Live” program, the befuddled character realized that she had misheard and misinterpreted some anodyne comment and had been propounding an absurd theory, and dismissed it with a hurried, “Never mind.” Playing the Litella role this October was Bill Gates, who, as a mega-philanthropist, makes serious efforts to gauge whether the causes to which he has contributed have been worth the money. Although “climate change will have serious consequences,” he said, using the two-word phrase that replaced global warming as it was becoming apparent that Earth wasn’t uniformly warming in line with predictions, “it will not lead to humanity’s demise. People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future.” Numbered also among the converts—the use of religious metaphor is not accidental; more below—is Breakthrough Institute research director Ted Nordhaus. “I used to argue that if the world kept burning fossil fuels at current rates, catastrophe was virtually assured,” he wrote this fall in The Free Press. “I no longer believe this hyperbole.” He pointed out that the demographic and physical factors on which he based his predictions two decades ago have not come to pass, and that despite measurable warming, some of which is attributable to human activity, people have adapted, and any damage has been well short of catastrophic. As British science writer Matt Ridley notes, claims such as Al Gore’s 2006 prediction of a 20-foot sea-level rise in 20 years have fallen short—by 19 feet and 9 inches. Meanwhile, the undermining of hyperbolic scenarios has, as Wall Street Journal economics reporter Greg Ip wrote this week, led the likes of Canadian Prime Minister (and former British central banker) Mark Carney and BlackRock DEO Larry Fink to downplay the risks of climate change, as most American voters have done some time ago. In all this, I see elements of religious conversion. Advocates of drastic action to address global warming climate change tend to be secular in religion but religious in their devotion to their cause. We have sinned, with our SUVs and corporate jets frying the Earth; we must atone by reducing our (or others’) standards of living; we must faithfully perform daily rituals, adjusting our thermostats and sorting our trash for recycling. The science writer John Tierney reports that The New York Times received a record number of letters in response to his 1996 article that it was economically and environmentally wasteful. It was like telling traditional Catholics their rosaries were a waste of time. For many Americans of a certain age, any change in the climate they remember from the summer when they were 16 is a change for the worse, just like any change from the playlist of songs they remember from that glorious summer. Satellite radio programmers and canned music providers in shopping malls provide the music from that golden moment, and politicians promising to halt climate change promise to provide the golden weather. But my impression is that those musical offerings are, like the baby boomer generation, getting scarcer, and certainly the demand in the political marketplace for restoration of that golden summer’s weather climate seems to have grown weaker too. This is operating within a larger cultural trend, an increasing skepticism of science and scientists. Earlier this month, as a Wall Street Journal editorial was among the few to emblazon, the journal Nature retracted a study that projected climate change could lead to a 62% economic decline by 2100. Among the factors that skewed the results threefold was the 1995-99 data from Uzbekistan. You can almost hear Litella saying, “Never mind.” Such shoddiness seems amusing, at least until you consider the “replication crisis” in which scientists have been unable to replicate the results of dozens of peer-reviewed and journal-published experiments, some of them famous like the Stanford prison experiment. And then there was the effort, successful during the COVID-19 crisis, by National Institutes of Health official Dr. Anthony Fauci, to suppress the now generally accepted theory that the virus spread because of a leak from the lab in Wuhan, China, whose gain-of-function research, deliberately strengthening viruses, was subsidized despite a ban by former President Barack Obama in 2014. So, the public’s skepticism of science and scientists is not surprising, though it’s surely having some unfortunate effects. People can see that expert recommendations, pushed by teachers unions, to close schools despite children’s negligible COVID-19 risk have resulted in long-lasting learning loss. And they are seeing one prominent preacher after another of environmental doom from climate change suddenly saying, like Litella, “Never mind.” COPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM We publish a variety of perspectives.

(Bloomberg) -- Altice USA lenders have tapped Sullivan & Cromwell to help fight a lawsuit which alleges they worked together to freeze the company out of the US credit market. Sullivan & Cromwell, known for its anti-trust expertise, will work alongside Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld which the creditors had retained earlier, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing a private matter. The US unit of billionaire Patrick Drahi’s telecom empire stunned credit markets when it sued lenders including Apollo Capital Management LP, Ares Management LLC and BlackRock Financial Management Inc. last month, alleging a so-called cooperation agreement that they’d struck amounted to an “illegal cartel.” The lawsuit, the first of its kind to be brought by a borrower, thrust the legality of the pacts, which are designed to give bond and loan holders more leverage by negotiating as a bloc rather than individually, into the spotlight. Representatives for Sullivan & Cromwell, and for the group of lenders to Altice USA, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Altice USA also didn’t immediately respond. Altice USA — which recently rebranded as Optimum Communications Inc. — has struggled under a heavy debt load. The firm has been working with Kellogg, Hansen, Todd, Figel & Frederick, a law firm known for its antitrust expertise and also the architect behind the lawsuit. Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, along with PJT Partners, which is also advising the creditor group being sued, said on a call with lenders last month that the lawsuit has no merit, Bloomberg reported.

Title: Another XRP Milestone: Ripple Exec Celebrates RLUSD Anniversary With $1 Billion Market Cap
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-milestone-ripple-exec-rlusd/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T21:00:08Z
Full Content:
Ripple’s U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin RLUSD has reached a $1 billion market capitalization just one year after launch, marking another milestone for XRP and the broader Ripple ecosystem. The milestone was highlighted by Ripple executive Jack McDonald, who pointed to a combination of regulatory compliance, institutional infrastructure, practical usage, global expansion, and multichain interoperability as the key factors driving RLUSD’s growth. Together, these developments justify the stablecoin’s rapid ascent. RLUSD’s rise to a $1 billion valuation on its first anniversary was shaped by deliberate structural decisions before launch. Ripple designed the stablecoin to operate within U.S. regulatory frameworks, combining state-level licensing with federal oversight via the OCC’s conditional approval of its national trust bank charter. This dual-layer compliance gave financial institutions immediate clarity on governance, reserve management, and operational standards, paving the way for quick adoption. As institutional demand grew, RLUSD issuance expanded in line with actual usage, helping it surpass the $1 billion market cap in November 2025 and secure a position among the top five USD-backed stablecoins globally. Confidence in the stablecoin was reinforced through robust infrastructure choices: Ripple selected BNY Mellon to custody RLUSD reserves, while Deloitte’s independent attestations provided transparency into its backing and operational controls. These measures strengthened institutional trust and enabled RLUSD’s steady expansion into professional financial environments. Moreover, within Ripple’s ecosystem, RLUSD complements XRP by providing a regulated dollar instrument for settlement, liquidity management, and institutional treasury functions, while XRP continues to support cross-border transfers and on-chain liquidity. Together, two assets form an integrated framework that has underpinned RLUSD’s expansion and milestone achievement. Beyond compliance, RLUSD’s growth has been driven by practical adoption and real-world financial usage. The stablecoin serves as a 24/7 off-ramp for tokenized products, including funds issued by BlackRock and VanEck, allowing smooth movement between tokenized assets and traditional cash positions. Its role extends into capital markets activity, with repo trades and money market fund operations enabled through partnerships with global banks and asset managers, embedding RLUSD directly into institutional workflows rather than peripheral use cases. RLUSD’s international footprint has expanded alongside its domestic adoption. Recognition in financial hubs such as Dubai (DFSA) and Abu Dhabi (FSRA) enables cross-border operations while maintaining regulatory consistency. Ripple has also extended RLUSD across multiple layer-two blockchain networks, including Optimism, Base, Ink, and Unichain via Wormhole’s NTT standard, increasing interoperability and access to liquidity throughout the ecosystem. By its one-year anniversary, RLUSD has established itself as a core component of Ripple’s financial infrastructure, demonstrating that trust, compliance, structural design, institutional adoption, and cross-chain expansion can drive rapid, sustainable market growth while achieving a top-five USD stablecoin status.

Title: Christopher Waller has ‘strong interview’ with Trump for Fed chair job: report

President Trump interviewed Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller as the White House zeroes in on a short list of four contenders to succeed Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, according to a report. Waller had a “strong interview” with Trump that focused heavily on the labor market and ways to jump-start job creation, two senior officials familiar with the meeting told the financial news channel CNBC. The interview took place inside the president’s residence and wrapped up shortly before Trump addressed the nation on the economy Wednesday night. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino were also present, officials told CNBC. The positive assessment of Waller’s sit-down did not mean he has emerged as the favorite, officials cautioned, but it underscored that Trump’s decision-making process remains active and structured as he weighs who will replace the current Fed chair. Administration officials told CNBC that the candidate list has narrowed to four: Waller; National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett; former Fed Gov. Kevin Warsh; and BlackRock fixed-income chief Rick Rieder. Rieder is scheduled to interview with Trump at Mar-a-Lago during the last week of the year. Fed Gov. Michelle Bowman is no longer under consideration, officials said. Hassett and Warsh have already been interviewed by Trump, leaving Waller and Rieder as the final two candidates yet to complete the process. Officials told the conversation with Waller centered on jobs and the health of the labor market, pushing back on criticism that Trump is seeking a Fed chair who would simply heed the president’s diktats on interest rates. They told CNBC that Trump’s interviews with candidates as “broad-based across a series of economic issues,” not narrowly focused on rate cuts. That framing contrasts with Trump’s public remarks last week, when he told the Wall Street Journal the Fed chair should consult with him on interest rates. “It doesn’t mean — I don’t think he should do exactly what we say,” Trump said at the time. “But certainly we’re — I’m a smart voice and should be listened to.” Trump again praised Waller on Thursday when asked about the Fed governor in the Oval Office. “I think he’s great. I mean, he’s been a man who has been there a long time, somebody that I was very involved with,” Trump said. Trump interviewed Waller in 2019 and later nominated him to the Federal Reserve Board. In his speech Wednesday night, the president said: “I will soon announce our next chairman of the Federal Reserve, someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot, and mortgage payments will be coming down even further.” Waller has publicly aligned himself with that direction in recent months. Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday at the Yale CEO Summit in New York — before his meeting with Trump — Waller said he believes interest rates could fall by 50 to 100 basis points below current levels. He said he expects inflation to continue easing and expressed concern about a weakening labor market. “President Trump remains committed to nominating the best and most qualified individuals to turn the Biden economic disaster around. Until an announcement is made by President Trump, however, any reporting about the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process is pointless speculation,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. Waller didn’t respond to a request for comment. Advertisement

Title: Unauthorised modular homes in south Dublin must be torn down, judge orders
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/12/19/unauthorised-modular-homes-in-south-dublin-must-be-torn-down-judge-orders/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T18:35:28Z
Full Content:
A builder and a site owner, held to be responsible for an unauthorised residential development at Brittas, Co Dublin, have been directed to tear down all illegally built houses and re-landscape the area to its original condition. In the Circuit Civil Court on Friday, Judge John O’Connor threw out claims by the developers that the works constituted refurbishment of existing properties and said he considered them to be “entirely new” structures. “Even on their own evidence they have demolished the existing structures and taken them down to a concrete base,” he said in a reserved judgment. Judge O’Connor was referring to the building of 29 modular homes which, it had been alleged, appeared to be phase one of an intended development of 71 residential units at Chianti Park and an adjoining site. South Dublin County Council and a local resident, John O’Neill, who lives only 200m from the developments, had claimed it was unauthorised and that all units should be removed with the sites restored. Their applications had been opposed by Branach Developments Ltd, the developer, with a registered address at Thomastown, Caragh, Kildare, and the site owners, Mullnassa Limited and Threshford Limited, both with registered addresses at Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin. Judge O’Connor had initially intended to deliver his judgment next February. However, he brought it forward when a solicitor from Burns Kelly Corrigan, for Mr O’Neill, went into court this week with photographs of continuing development work going on in an alleged breach of an undertaking not to progress building works. About 29 homes had been constructed to date on the site, formerly used for mobile homes and chalets, with foundations laid for at least 12 more. Judge O’Connor said on Friday he did not agree with the developers and site owners’ view that the works were refurbishments and, while they were residential, it was clearly an intensification of the use of the site. He said the developments consisted entirely of new structures. “It is, in fact, a very serious redevelopment and transformation of the site without planning permission,” he said. Photographs alone were sufficient evidence of the transformation of the site to a new development. He said the prior structures may have been dilapidated but that did not mean the work could go ahead without planning permission before the development commenced. He said it was of significant concern to the court that, notwithstanding the local authority having acted promptly in respect of the development, that once the proceedings had been initiated, the respondents in contrast had not only continued their development works but had intensified their building. It must have been abundantly clear to them that they had been taking a very significant risk, he said. Mr Michael O’Donnell SC, counsel for the developer and site owner, told Ms Justice Emily Farrell in the High Court on Friday afternoon that Judge O’Connor’s decision was being appealed. She granted a stay on Judge O’Connor’s directions until 6pm on Monday to facilitate the fitting of a membrane to weather proof stocks of plaster board on the site.

Title: How will tokenised assets change in 2026? The march towards a $35tn market starts now
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/tokenisation-race-to-heat-up-in-2026/
Time Published: 2025-12-19T17:52:35Z

About us Copy link A version of this article appeared in our The Roundup newsletter on December 19. Sign up here. Hi! Eric here. Tokenisation is becoming the next frontier in Wall Street’s aggressive campaign to bulldoze into crypto. In 2025, centralised players like Robinhood, Kraken and Superstate launched tokenised stocks on their platforms, enabling 24/7 trading of digital exposure to company shares. That’s just the beginning, industry insiders tell DL News. “In 2026, the tokenised assets market becomes broader, deeper, and significantly more institutional,” Philipp Pieper, co-founder of tokenisation platform Swarm Markets, told DL News. He and others expect tokenisation to veer more deeply into private markets, which include assets like private equity and credit, and have so far mostly been the purview of institutional players. This will give retail investors access to a market that investment giant BlackRock estimates will grow by 53% to be worth $20 trillion by 2030. Other areas primed for onchain adoption include public market assets such as equities, exchange-traded funds, indices, commodities, and yield-bearing instruments. This combination will drive a thousand-fold growth of tokenised assets, pushing their combined value to $35 trillion by 2030, according to Grayscale. The bullishness around tokenisation highlights how traditional finance has merged with that of crypto. Digital assets were once treated like the unwanted stepchild of finance, but a combination of regulatory clarity, political will, and industry maturity has triggered a wave of institutional buy-in. Wall Street giants have ploughed billions into crypto ETFs, considered launching their own stablecoins, and are tapping into blockchain infrastructure like never before. So far, tokenisation efforts have mainly resulted in walled gardens where traders can only buy and sell digital exposure to assets like shares on each platform. “Fragmentation remains the biggest challenge [to tokenisation],” Mark Greenberg, Kraken’s global head of consumer, told DL News. This, he said, prevents tokenisation from reaching “its full potential when assets are open, interoperable, and easy to move between centralised and decentralised environments, while remaining fully collateralised by the underlying assets.” Another challenge for tokenisation will be regulatory clarity, for instance around geolocking where products have different regulatory requirements depending on where they are in the world. “Once we have a clear regulatory framework for crypto in place, I think we will see faster adoption and innovation across the industry,” Johann Kerbrat, SVP and GM of Robinhood Crypto, told DL News. Even so, most industry insiders DL News spoke to view 2026 with a sense of bullish anticipation. “We’re moving from pilots to infrastructure,” Jim Hiltner, co-founder of Superstate, told DL News. “Tokenised assets will start to look less like a niche category and more like a new operating layer for capital markets.” Artificial intelligence will trigger an economic boom in 2026 not yet captured by official statistics, propelling crypto markets to new highs unlike in previous cycles, Coinbase says. Lance Datskoluo reports. Prediction markets have become a leading indicator for pivotal economic data — and traders are monitoring them to get ahead in the market, Tim Craig reports. Strategy’s chief executive Phong Le predicts 2026 will unleash a wave of Bitcoin buying. The boss of the digital asset treasury firm made that prediction on the back of Strategy buying another $980 million in Bitcoin in the second week of December at an average price of $92,000 per coin. Pump.fun and its partners, including Solana Labs, were sued earlier this year for allegedly operating an unlicensed casino. This week a US federal court turned up the heat a notch by permitting a class-action lawsuit to be amended to include over 5,000 internal chat logs as evidence. https://t.co/YEJ11oimxP pic.twitter.com/KVqrCkLja9 https://t.co/YEJ11oimxP pic.twitter.com/KVqrCkLja9

WEATHER Cooler than recent days with showery rain moving in across the country on an easterly breeze, with the chance of the odd wintry shower. Highest daytime temperatures of 4 to 8 degrees. For more, visit met.ie With one All-Ireland title and just two final appearances between them, Sunday’s All-Ireland hurling semi-finals may appear novel on the surface, but they bring with them a fair bit of familiarity too. Waterford’s Ballygunner are making their fifth appearance at this stage in just eight years – and Covid saw the competition nixed in 2020. Derry’s Sleacht Néill are undoubtedly the kings of Ulster and this is their sixth attempt at reaching a first ever final in the last decade. They’ve come incredibly close on a number of occasions. Galway’s Loughrea were here last season although it is at least a new experience for Wexford’s St Martin’s. Gunner using media for ammunition When Ballygunner eased past Éire Óg in the Munster final to set up a semi-final with St Martin’s, Dessie Hutchinson picked up his latest player of the match award and told TG4 afterwards that "a certain Clareman said we were a dying team". Sherlock Holmes didn’t need to be drafted in to solve that one, with Anthony Daly the obvious culprit. To be fair to 'Dalo’, the quote wasn’t just as pointed as he pondered "are Ballygunner the team they were? They looked to be against Sarsfields but I would argue that they are not quite" before that game with the Clare champions. Daly also listed it a 60-40 final in favour of Ballygunner, but they made a mockery of that with a 0-21 to 1-09 victory to move to the top of the provincial roll of honour. There is no doubting Ballygunner’s brilliance, but five previous Munster wins have been converted into just one All-Ireland title – and even that took that incredible goal from Harry Ruddle in the 2022 final win over Ballyhale. Of the teams just below them in the Munster roll of honour, Blackrock have won three All-Ireland titles from five provincial successes, St Finbarr's two from four and Glen Rovers two from three. Much healthier conversion rates. Manager Jason Ryan will have been targeting the Tommy Moore Cup from the moment he joined the club, even if that remains an internal thought. Some criticism in the media – perhaps even if taken in a slightly different way than intended – can't hurt. That motivation, of course, is supplemented by extreme talent with Hutchinson in supreme form. Since opening his championship season with 1-09 against Abbeyside in July, he has racked up 9-70 in 11 games. Philip Mahony is perhaps the best sweeper in the club game while Patrick Fitzgerald is firing at the right time. Paddy Leavey has been a revelation and the team’s ability to dominate the puc-out has been critical to their success. Ballygunner have never faced Wexford opposition competitively before, but perhaps Ryan – a former Model County football boss – may have a valuable insight or two on the county. St Martin’s won’t be overawed St Martin’s will head to Thurles to face Ballygunner fully convinced that they can end the season of another big-hitter. Ballyhale were the victims last time out as the Wexford side claimed a first-ever Leinster title, and it shouldn’t be forgotten that they took out All-Ireland champions Na Fianna in the provincial quarter-final. Both those wins came by a point – so their grit certainly can’t be questioned. Ben Stafford was the hero last time out, the player coming off the bench to grab the sensational winner against Ballyhale having also plundered a late, late score in the closing surge against Na Fianna. "Ben Stafford, number 21!" A phenomenal late score has won the Leinster title for St Martin's. What an incredible game at Croke Park. Ballyhale are beaten. pic.twitter.com/b78nqhdB9u The O’Connor brothers have been in sensational form too in what has been a busy period for the siblings with Rory marrying former Kilkenny camogie star Grace Walsh a week after the Ballyhale match as Jack took on the best man duties. 'I do’ last week, ‘I believe’ this week, with Rory O’Connor making it very clear that they are not satisfied with their lot. "I think it’s a coming of age for our team," he said ahead of this semi-final. If there was one concern for manager Daithí Hayes, it’s that their goal-scoring rate has plummeted in the Leinster series with three games bringing just one green flag – Barry O’Connor against Na Fianna. In Wexford, they had managed 17 in eight games, so they’ll hope that touch returns at Semple Stadium. Sleacht Néill chasing that final step Sleacht Néill have swept all before them in Derry with 13 straight titles, and they have superseded the Antrim fraternity as Ulster’s top dogs with six of the last nine provincial crowns, but 2025 has always been about scratching one particular itch – making it to an All-Ireland final with Loughrea standing in their way this time around. Some of the squad, including the returning Chrissy McKaigue, have been there twice with the club’s footballers, but when it comes to the small ball, it’s been a series of entertaining losses – no consolation, of course. A Con O’Callaghan-inspired Cuala suggested they were maybe out of their depth on their first visit to this stage in 2016, but 12 months later they gave Na Piarsaigh their fill of it. Ballyhale, Ballygunner and Sarsfields – with Mark McGuigan missing a golden chance at the death to win it - have all been pushed to the pin of their collar in the intervening years and there is a sturdiness about the Robert Emmet’s this term that should worry their opponents. Manager Paul McCormack, a Sam Maguire winner with Armagh in 2002, will understand the significance of McKaigue’s return, one of nine players with six Ulster medals. Part of the Derry football coaching staff, McKaigue has been operating in a much more advanced role than he is accustomed to with fellow dual stars Shane McGuigan and Brendan Rogers providing plenty of class coming from deep. Watch out for Ruairí Ó Mianáin too, a ferocious young talent. This is their first time facing Galway opposition. Three of the last four Ulster sides to reach the final have managed it by beating Tribe opposition at this stage. Loughrea aiming to make amends Twelve months ago, Loughrea hadn’t been behind in their All-Ireland semi-final with Na Fianna for the first 56 minutes. When the whistle went a few minutes later, they’d be one point short. That the Dublin side went on to lift the Tommy Moore Cup – and in comfortable fashion too against Sarsfields – would have been hard to stomach, but the passage of time would have allowed them to turn that feeling into the positive notion that they are not far away. The Galway Championship is one of the most competitive about with five All-Ireland winning clubs involved in 2025 – Portumna and Kiltomer didn’t feature in Senior A this term – so to go back-to-back is a real achievement, especially as it was the first time in the club’s history. They had to come through the preliminary quarter-finals after a group defeat to Craughwell, and there was a one-point quarter-final win over Clarinbridge. Drama in the county final too, as Darren Shaughnessy’s late goal saw them past St Thomas’ as they retained the Tom Callinan Cup for the first time. Loughrea have played Ulster opposition once – back in the 2007 semi-final with Vinny Maher securing safe passage with a late goal. They've had a long wait without competitive action for their second meeting with a side from up north, and they'll need to be sharp from the off against game opposition. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: ‘Think Again’ Before Selling Your XRP; Expert Tells Investors

Crypto pundit Finance Bull has advised XRP investors against selling their holdings now despite the market downturn. This came as the pundit explained that the CLARITY Act could pass next year, which he predicts will positively impact the altcoin’s adoption. In an X post, Finance Bull told XRP investors to think again if they are considering selling their coins right now. He reminded them that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse confirmed that the CLARITY Act is expected in early 2026, which the pundit indicated will benefit the token when that happens. Finance Bull explained that when the CLARITY Act passes, Ripple will be forced to declare the fate of its XRP in escrow, and that when that happens, the company won’t sell its holdings. Instead, he predicts that they will pre-allocate it to bank corridors, sovereign rails, liquidity hubs powering cross-border settlement, institutional infrastructure, and countries integrating next-generation payment rails. Finance Bull further remarked that this flips the entire conversation, as what looks like overhead supply is already reserved, meaning that XRP won’t face a sell-off as some investors may fear. He added that the real move is locked liquidity flowing into banks, FX routes, and custody frameworks, which would boost the altcoin’s adoption. The pundit stated that this isn’t about market-making but about monetary wiring and that once Ripple releases its official escrow roadmap, the re-pricing will be instant, irreversible, and demand-driven. Interestingly, Finance Bull claimed that BlackRock will be one of the institutions that will adopt the altcoin when there is regulatory clarity through the CLARITY Act. Notably, BlackRock is one of the crypto ETF issuers that has yet to file for a spot XRP ETF, but the pundit has suggested that could change soon. In a press release, Ripple announced a strategic partnership with TJM Investments, providing a boost for XRP’s adoption. The crypto firm stated that under the terms of the partnership, it has invested in THM and will continue to provide best-in-class infrastructure to support TJM’s execution and clearing services. This builds on the existing relationship between Ripple’s multi-asset prime brokerage platform, Ripple Prime, and TJM. Ripple stated that the expanded partnership will enable TJM offer its clients improved capital and collateral efficiency as well as enhanced clearing stability and balance-sheet support. This development comes as Ripple continues to explore ways to enhance the utility of RLUSD and XRP. The firm recently announced plans. The firm recently announced plans to begin testing RLUSD on Base, Optimism, Unichain, and Ink. At the time of writing, the altcoin price is trading at around $1.80, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Texas: Why Not Monetize Everything?

Time Published: 2025-12-19T15:00:00Z

In Greg Abbott’s Texas, everything has a price or makes a profit. Mothers Against Greg Abbott posted this video showing how it’s done. A for-profit online charter school is opening in a for-profit prison whose inmates are families arrested by ICE. The school will be supplied by a giant online corporation called Stride, which used to be K-12 Inc. K-12 Inc. was known for low-quality instruction, low graduation rates, and scandals. Its executives are paid multi-million dollar salaries. It’s ironic that the government is paying Stride to provide low-quality online instruction to hapless children whose families are about to be ousted from America. Peter Greene has the story here. The detention center in Dilley is operated byCoreCivic, a Tennessee-based for-profit operator of prisons, jails, and detention centers. In 2025, they scored $300 million in ICE contracts. CoreCivic was founded as Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) in 1983, by Thomas W. Beasley, Robert Crants and T. Don Hutto. Beasley served as the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party; Crants was the chief financial officer of a real estate company in Nashville; Hutto was the president-elect of the American Correctional Association, and according to a 2018 Time Magazine investigation, ran a Manhattan-sized Tennessee cotton plantation where Black convicts picked cotton for no pay… One of its first big investors was Michael Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” In 1996, he had established Knowledge Universe, an organization he created with his brother Lowell and Larry Ellison (Oracle), who both kicked in money for K12. Steve Fink, a trusted Milliken confidant and lead independent director of Stride, is the brother of Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of Blackrock, which has been a longtime investor in Stride. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, “despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.” In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about“the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their “epic series of tech errors.” K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” Well, who cares? Who cares if Stride-K12 provides high-quality education? So what if it’s a waste of taxpayer money? The “students” are children who are being deported. Their parents are being deported too. Who cares? Thank you, Diane – the real question is how to stop these people so that they can’t revive, like some Dracula. Martha Ture Mt.

The convict lease system was the order of the day when labor was never enough. The labor required to pick enough cotton to be profitable created a permanent underclass n the cotton belt until the advent of the mechanical harvesting of cotton. That underclass included newly freed slaves, whose fate was often to be arrested for misdemeanors and pit into a system designed to trap them and use them for either county finance or personal gain or both. This system largely survived any attempts at reform on a governmental level, but buckled as labor became unneeded. Today a single man sitting in a million dollar machine harvests acres per hour, which makes the use of slave labor and its companion, the worker kept on penury, obsolete. What we have replaced this system with in Core Civic is the monetization of warehousing human beings. If you know a bunch of people on your community, you will probably know someone caught in the web of the system that makes some people wealthy. When it is profitable for people to be put in jail, more people will go to jail. Their presence in jail puts money in a thick wallet, and does not reward the private prison for doing a good job.

Title: A 10-Hour Data Center Outage Is Testing the Ambitions of KKR, GIP

Time Published: 2025-12-19T14:15:54Z

Data center operators are fixated on the “five nines” — an expectation that they’ll keep the infrastructure behind financial markets, e-commerce and artificial intelligence running 99.999% of the time. So as news rippled out last month that a CyrusOne facility in Aurora, Illinois, that handles trillions of dollars in trading volume each day went down for 10 hours, industry insiders were stunned. To them, it was an eternity, and the failure at the data center outside Chicago is a black eye for CyrusOne’s backers. KKR & Co. and Global Infrastructure Partners, now a unit of BlackRock Inc., announced their acquisition of CyrusOne in 2021 for $15 billion. They secured billions more in financing for the firm as they deepened their foothold in a booming industry increasingly dominated by the likes of Blackstone Inc. and Blue Owl Capital Inc. Data centers, the physical embodiment of the AI revolution, are one of the hottest bets in private markets. But as the debate rages over whether the boom is a bubble — debt levels and valuations are climbing — the challenges for Wall Street can be much more tangible: from cooling the space to literally keeping the lights on. KKR pursued the investment for years and was the driving force behind the deal as it worked to rope in various bidding partners. CyrusOne touches several of the private equity firm’s major units. Last year, KKR led part of a $7.9 billion loan to the data center operator, co-arranged by its own capital markets team and funded by its Global Atlantic insurance arm alongside some of its clients. And KKR owns its CyrusOne stake through its infrastructure and real estate funds, as well as Strategic Holdings, a unit that holds long-term investments on the firm’s balance sheet. All that cash wasn’t enough to stave off disaster at Aurora, an older property in CyrusOne’s portfolio of more than 55 operational data centers. A series of missteps by facilities workers at a site running on older systems led to a major outage for CME Group Inc. Such incidents typically require the data center operator to compensate the client, according to people familiar with the industry. CME entered a 15-year lease at the Aurora data center in 2016, according to a prior announcement. “They will need to double down on becoming a resilient data center because this is a failure that happened and shouldn’t have,” said Andrej Danis, head of AlixPartners’ Americas telecommunications and digital infrastructure practice. KKR and GIP said they’re confident in CyrusOne’s strategy and that it’s poised to benefit from growing demand. “Under our ownership, CyrusOne has accelerated its expansion, enhanced its competitive position while deepening its commitment to innovation, and reinforced its standing as a premier developer and operator of mission-critical data centers,” Waldemar Szlezak, KKR’s global head of digital infrastructure and a CyrusOne board member, said in an emailed statement. Will Brilliant, GIP’s global head of digital infrastructure and a CyrusOne board member, echoed Szlezak’s remarks in a separate statement. “We fully support CyrusOne, as we have done throughout our ownership, to invest significant resources to maintain a leading position as a provider of critical data center development and operations services for its customers,” Brilliant said. For Wall Street, the stakes are high. Data centers are a key focus for KKR’s infrastructure business, one of the fastest-growing and best-performing strategies for the firm, which is led by Co-Chief Executive Officers Joe Bae and Scott Nuttall. GIP, which announced in October that it was making a bet on developerAligned Data Centers, is central to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s ambitions to expand the $13.5 trillion money manager beyond its stock-and-bond roots into more lucrative realms. n backing CyrusOne, KKR and GIP took on a dot-com-era company with a complex history. Cincinnati Bell acquired the firm from Abry Partners, before spinning it off. CyrusOne then made strategic takeovers of data centers from other companies through deals with firms including Cervalis, Sentinel Data Centers and Zenium. The Aurora data center, acquired through a sale-leaseback transaction with CME, gave CyrusOne a foothold in financial services. Knitting together assets from various deals was a complicated undertaking. As a public company, CyrusOne was wrestling with activist investor Jana Partners and leadership turnover. After longtime CEO Gary Wojtaszek departed in 2020, the company was run by a variety of successors with short tenures. They include Tesh Durvasula, an interim CEO for less than a year; Bruce Duncan, who had no prior data center experience; and David Ferdman, a co-founder who was asked to return to lead the company through the latest ownership transition. While CyrusOne received interest at various points from about a dozen parties, some prospective investors were discouraged by the management churn. Blackstone evaluated the company but never entered serious discussions, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks were confidential. Blackstone declined to comment. After KKR and GIP swooped in, they took board seats and installed Eric Schwartz as CEO. Schwartz was comfortable maintaining a lower profile than other data center CEOs, industry associates said. And he stuck with decisions that had been made before him, including one to outsource facilities operations at roughly 50 North American data centers to Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. That move, set in motion by Wojtaszek, divided top executives, according to a person familiar with the matter. Some argued it would help the firm offer a standardized playbook across properties, while others worried it would erode the quality of service, people said. Rivals such as QTS don’t outsource facility operations, other people said. Wojtaszek didn’t reply to messages seeking comment. Some would-be tenants opted to take their business elsewhere in part because they weren’t comfortable with CyrusOne having fewer in-house boots on the ground in case of an emergency. CyrusOne maintains oversight of operations at its data centers while tapping third-party personnel for support, another person said. Other data center companies have such arrangements, too. Industry executives said the shift showed how CyrusOne was moving further away from its roots as a data center operator to become more of an asset-gathering operation to benefit financial backers. KKR and GIP’s arrival accelerated changes at CyrusOne. The company focused on building from the ground up — and at scale. It benefited from a push by big technology firms to tap data center landlords for infrastructure and power to train AI models. But even with the AI boom in full swing, CyrusOne fell behind in market share to more dominant players like QTS in recent years, according to some industry rankings. Things came to a head at the Aurora data center on Thanksgiving, when a cascade of missteps by workers there collided with the reality that the roughly two-decade-old facility ran on outmoded architecture and didn’t automate critical functions. A day earlier, onsite staff and contractors switched the data center’s cooling towers, which keep the machines from overheating, to a new operating mode to prepare them for cold weather, according to a confidential report reviewed by Bloomberg. That transition failed to adhere with protocol and higher temperatures overwhelmed the cooling system. A spokesperson for JLL did not have immediate comment when reached by email. Initial remediation work only made the problem worse, according to the report. As heat built up, the chips and computers powering critical market functions couldn’t operate. Industry executives said the incident shows what can happen when data centers use outdated cooling technology and lack both the basic automatic controls for temperature and automation systems that can override human lapses. Meanwhile, CME didn’t have the ability to keep trading functions up and running seamlessly and opted against initiating a complex disaster recovery plan to shift operations to a secondary data center in the New York area. The money managers behind CyrusOne remain all-in on the AI boom. KKR recently struck a deal with Compass Datacenters to take a stake in a pool of data centers. Last year, the firm reached a $50 billion pact with Energy Capital Partners to develop data centers decked out with power sources so they can reduce their reliance on the grid. The duo announced earlier this year that their first project would be a $4 billion data center in Bosque County, Texas, built by CyrusOne and ECP.

Title: Here’s How Much % Of Bitcoin Supply Is Currently Sitting In Losses

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On-chain analytics platform Glassnode has revealed the number of Bitcoin supply that is currently sitting at a loss. This comes as the BTC price continues to trade below the psychological $90,000 level following its crash, which began last month. In a report, Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin supply in loss has risen to 6.7 million BTC, marking the highest level of loss-bearing supply observed in this cycle. The analytics platform further noted that this represents 23.7% of the circulating supply, which is currently underwater. 10.2% of this supply is held by long-term holders and 13.5% by short-term holders. Glassnode stated that this distribution suggests that, much like in prior cycle transitions into deeper bearish regimes, the loss-bearing Bitcoin supply accumulated by recent buyers is gradually maturing into the long-term cohort. Meanwhile, the analytics platform noted that the 6-7 million range, which has been at a loss since mid-November, mirrors early transitional phases of prior cycles, where mounting investor frustration came before a shift toward more bearish conditions and intensified capitulation at lower Bitcoin prices. Notably, the Bitcoin price has dropped to levels last seen in 2024, erasing its year-to-date (YTD) gains. Glassnode stated that this has left behind a dense supply cluster accumulated by top buyers in the $93,000 to $120,000 range. The resulting supply distribution is said to reflect a top-heavy market structure where recovery attempts are capped by heavy overhead sell pressure, especially in the early stages of a bearish phase. Glassnode declared that as long as the Bitcoin price remains below this range and fails to reclaim key thresholds, most notably the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis at $101,500, the risk of further corrective downside persists. Glassnode revealed that the Bitcoin spot market flows continue to reflect an uneven demand profile across major venues. The Cumulative Volume Delta bias is said to show periodic bursts of buy-side activity, but has failed to develop into sustained accumulation, especially during the recent BTC price pullbacks. The on-chain analytics platform noted that the Coinbase spot CVD remains relatively constructive, indicating steadier participation from US-based investors. On the other hand, Binance and aggregate Bitcoin flows remain choppy and largely directionless. Glassnode stated that these dispersion points point to selective engagement rather than coordinated spot demand. Meanwhile, the platform alluded to recent Bitcoin price declines, which it pointed out have not triggered decisive expansion in positive CVD. Glassnode noted that this suggests dip-buying remains tactical and short-term. In the absence of sustained accumulation across all venues, Bitcoin’s price action continues to rely more on activity in the derivatives market and liquidity conditions rather than organic spot demand. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $86,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
