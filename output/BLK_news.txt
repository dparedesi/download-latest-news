We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) stands against the other multibagger stocks. The US equities continued their upward movement in 2024 and fueled the S&P 500 to record highs. Much of this optimism in the broader market was backed by the strong US economy and the Federal Reserve’s stance to cut interest rates. As per PBS News, 2024 saw several familiar winners, like big technology stocks. These stocks got even bigger due to continuous increases in their stock prices. Apart from certain tech giants, strong momentum was also seen in Bitcoin, gold, and other investments. Ameriprise Financial reported that 2024 had a strong start, with the S&P 500 Index concluding the Q1 on a high note due to a healthy US economic backdrop, moderating inflation, improvement in profit conditions, and anticipations of rate cuts from the US Fed. The strong growth momentum continued in Q2 as the S&P 500 Index saw its strongest three-quarter run since mid-2021. Ameriprise Financial highlighted that an AI boom again drove healthy gains throughout IT and communication services. However, increased rates and a pause by the US Fed capped broader market gains. In September, the US Fed reduced its policy rate for the first time since 2020, concluding its aggressive rate-hiking cycle to control inflation. Therefore, it began a new monetary policy stance that supported economic growth and the labor market. Additionally, since the election, investors’ confidence has been further boosted towards risky assets, including equities.

The US is expected to remain a global growth engine with the expansionary business cycle, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-associated capital spending, and the prospect of strong capital markets and dealmaking activity. Furthermore, BlackRock sees several factors expected to support stocks in 2025. The decisive election result removed key uncertainty hanging over the broader US market. The rally that was seen after the results might continue into the start of 2025 primarily because of prospects of tax cuts and deregulation throughout key industries. While the impact of some policies remains uncertain, history has a long-term record of positive returns in 1st year of a Presidential term. The firm also believes that earnings and valuations hint at healthy potential for a continued broadening of the market. Its analysis of the S&P 500 data reflects that earnings for Mag 7 stocks outperformed the broader market by 37% in 2023. This earnings gap was narrowed across 2024. Now, it expects it to decline to 7.5% in 2025. Our Methodology To list the 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Right Now, we used a screener to shortlist the stocks that have gained over 100% over the past year and have healthy average upside potential. Finally, the stocks are arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of 30th December 2024. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, as of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A biopharmaceutical research team taking notes in front of a laboratory's microscope. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 67 One-year Return: ~130% Average Upside Potential: ~32.4% Market Cap as of 30th December: $12.3 billion Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) is a biopharmaceutical company, which is engaged in developing and commercializing therapies for patients with serious and rare diseases. Expected for launch in mid-2025, Brensocatib represents a major near-term catalyst for Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM). The successful commercialization of this drug can significantly impact the company's financial outlook. Brensocatib targets the underlying cause of inflammation in NCFBE (Non-Cystic Fibrosis Bronchiectasis) by inhibiting neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs). Current treatments only manage symptoms, and there are no approved therapies to address the underlying inflammation. If Brensocatib achieves rapid market adoption and meets or surpasses sales projections, it can fuel substantial top-line growth for Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM). This will offer immediate financial benefits and will also validate the company's R&D capabilities. Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) believes Brensocatib and non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis alone to be a $5 billion-plus peak sales operating opportunity. The success in the bronchiectasis market can offer the company a platform to expand into associated respiratory conditions or rare diseases. As per Wall Street, the expertise and infrastructure developed for bronchiectasis can be used to ramp up the development and commercialization of treatments for other indications, multiplying Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM)’s addressable market. TimesSquare Capital Management, an equity investment management company, sees material upside to Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM)’s stock on the back of optimism around Brensocatib. Here's what the firm said in its Q3 2024 letter: “Vaxcyte, Inc. (developer of vaccines) and Insmed Incorporated (NASDAQ:INSM) (developer of treatments for various pulmonary diseases). Insmed has one commercially approved treatment for lung infections that is under review for expanded use. Recently another treatment reported positive clinical data that paves the way for a commercial launch in 2025. The latter, Brensocatib, will be the first approved to treat directly chronic bronchial issues that currently only have symptom mitigation methods.” Overall INSM ranks 12th on our list of the best multibagger stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of INSM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than INSM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Trump's billionaires will have to navigate a complex web of possible conflicts of interest
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-billionaires-conflicts-of-interest-elon-musk-cabinet-ethics-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-01T11:11:01Z
Full Content:
President-elect Donald Trump is stocking his administration and broader orbit with billionaires and titans of industry. Their résumés and portfolios also come with a bevy of potential conflicts of interest that could overshadow their actual jobs. Elon Musk may receive the lion's share of the attention, but he's far from the only billionaire in Trump's orbit who has benefited from government contracts. "This Trump administration is just chocked full of billionaires, millionaires, and lobbyists," Craig Holman, a lobbyist for government watchdog Public Citizen, recently told Business Insider. Trump tapped private equity billionaire Stephen Feinberg to become his second-highest-ranking official at the Pentagon. Feinberg's firm, Cerberus Capital Management, has significant interests in military defense contractors, which, as deputy director of defense, could pose a conflict given that the Pentagon's No. 2 is typically responsible for the Defense Department's massive budget. Earlier this year, Cerberus acquired a controlling interest in M1 Support Services, an aircraft maintenance contractor. In fiscal year 2024 alone, M1 has been awarded over $630.7 million in federal contracts, according to USASpending.gov contract data. Cerberus also has a large stake in Navistar Defense, a specialized military vehicle manufacturer. In 2021, Navistar paid a $50 million fine to resolve a complaint that accused the company of inflating the prices of mine-resistant vehicles it sold to the US Marine Corps from 2007 to 2012, before Feinberg's firm bought a 70% stake in 2018. Musk has an even wider portfolio of responsibilities. Unlike Feinberg, the Tesla CEO is set to remain outside the Trump administration — meaning the world's richest man would not be subject to the potential divestment full-time administration officials may be asked to do. "He definitely has a vision for humanity and he views himself as a world historic figure, and he knows his wealth is necessary to fulfilling his vision," Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a public interest group, told Business Insider earlier this month. "So I am frightened by what government by people like that looks like." All of Trump's appointees who enter the government will have to comply with the criminal conflict of interest law. Congress did not apply that law to the president or vice president, in part due to constitutional concerns. Congressional Democrats have raised concern about Musk's ties to China. He called for the expulsion of Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, after she and other liberal lawmakers questioned whether Musk helped kill a sweeping government funding bill due to its inclusion of restrictions on certain US investments in China. Trump told Time Magazine that he's seen Musk put the country ahead of his financial interests. "I think he's one of the very few people that would have the credibility to do it, but he puts the country before, and I've seen it, before he puts his company," Trump said. In response to questions about potential conflicts of interest, Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance Transition spokesperson, said in a statement to Business Insider "All nominees and appointees will comply with the ethical obligations of their respective agencies and offices." Divestment can be difficult to navigate. In 2017, Florida Panthers owner Vincent Viola, a billionaire, withdrew from consideration to become Trump's first Army secretary. According to The New York Times, Viola had too much difficulty untangling his financial interests. Others have been able to broker deals allowing them to cash out early. Former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson had to work out a special $180 million retirement package with the oil giant because some of his holdings included restricted shares that hadn't been fully vested. Goldman Sachs accelerated its payout to Gary Cohn, who left the firm to become Trump's chief economic advisor, leaving him with a roughly $285 million exit package. In order to entice talent out of the private sector, the government also allows officials to defer some tax liabilities when they are directed to sell shares or other assets. Tillerson and Cohn both used this perk. So too has current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Government watchdogs have long expressed unease about top officials entering the government with private-sector ties. Biden advisors' ties to BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, were the subject of significant attention during the 2020 transition. Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo was once interim chief of staff to Larry Fink. Brian Deese, who was Biden's top economic aide, led BlackRock's sustainable investing before joining the Biden administration. Adeyemo agreed to recuse himself from any potential BlackRock-related business until he sold off his interests. As a political appointee, Deese's ethics agreement is not public information, though ethics-focused groups previously asked the White House to disclose it. (The White House did not respond to Business Insider's request for comment about Deese's agreement. He left the administration last year.) It remains to be seen whether the president-elect will impose additional ethics requirements as he did shortly after taking office in 2017. Trump's first cabinet was the wealthiest in modern history. His incoming team is likely to be even richer. The influx of billionaires extends from the cabinet down through US ambassadors. So far, Trump's tapped at least two additional billionaires to represent the US abroad, Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and investment banker Warren Stephens, to be US ambassadors. And that list doesn't even include the likes of Musk, who has Trump's attention without the hassle of selling off his vast interests. "He is going to have the ear of President Trump anyway, even though he's serving in an advisory capacity," Holman said of Musk. Jump to

Title: Altcoin Season 2025: A Crypto Bull Run Guide
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/clorischen/2024/12/31/altcoin-season-2025-a-crypto-bull-run-guide/
Time Published: 2025-01-01T02:16:57Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin halving, all-time high, and altcoin season—the recipe for a bull run, or is it? First, Bitcoin's halving reduces its issuance rate, which sparks supply scarcity. After that, BTC rallies into its ATHs and is followed by a horde of pumped altcoins driven by investors who prefer higher, albeit riskier, returns. The altcoin season is then full on. Bitcoin had its most recent halving in May of this year, and soon after that, it smashed through the $100k mark—a historic milestone. Yet, the altcoin market is bleeding. Where is the usual rally? Is the golden recipe broken? The surge of institutional capital and the liquidity crunch from high interest rates, coupled with Trump’s positive yet bold take on crypto, have made one thing certain: this cycle will be unlike any we’ve seen before. Every cycle has four stages: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. Even though the mechanism behind these stages is well-known, timing the market is one of the most sought-after skills. You try to predict when we enter a given stage to strategize your trades. However, even though cycles follow a predictable pattern, we must not forget the wider market context–and crypto has seen a lot in the past year. The growing presence of institutional investors in the Bitcoin market has reshaped its dynamics. Having taken 7th place as the biggest asset in the world, Bitcoin has become a new asset of choice for institutions, supported by the emergence and growth of crypto ETFs. Their increased involvement often brings greater price stability. Yet, for altcoins, it may not be good news. After all, fluctuations and big corrections redirect capital flow into altcoins. Less volatility means fewer returns that could circle back into the altcoin market. This year has been special. The launch of Bitcoin spot ETFs has brought a significant capital inflow from traditional finance onto the crypto market. Institutional inflows into these ETFs have triggered a Bitcoin supply shock, strengthening its dominance. The demand for Bitcoin caused by ETFs directly influences Bitcoin dominance, currently sitting at around 56%, a meaningful metric often overlooked by novice traders. It measures BTC's market share relative to altcoins, offering insights into whether we're in a Bitcoin season (BTC outperforms) or an altcoin season (altcoins outperform). What does a strong BTC dominance with a stable Bitcoin price mean? Altcoins dumping. And in this cycle, Bitcoin spot ETFs prolonged Bitcoin dominance. This new variable was absent in previous bull runs and will make the 2025 altcoin season undeniably unique. Bitcoin: The Cycle of Dominancce TradingView If you ask any financial executive about the most important financial metric, they’ll tell you it’s liquidity. In 2023 and 2024, the US interest rates hiked to one of the highest numbers in a long while. Even though it’s dropped from 5.25% a year ago to 4.19% now, it’s still a relatively attractive yield for a risk-free asset. On the other hand, cutting interest rates often fuels crypto bull runs for a very simple reason–they create a favorable environment for riskier assets to thrive. After all, risk-free government debt at a 0.11% yield, like in 2021, is as attractive as losing your capital due to inflation. Low rates equal cheaper borrowing and increased liquidity, which, in turn, pushes investors to park their money for higher returns. Where? Yes, you’ve guessed it. Crypto. The winning of Trump’s administration in the US has undoubtedly shaken the crypto world. The Bitcoin Act sparked a lively debate across the crypto and non-crypto circles. If passed, the Senate legislation would require the Treasury and the Federal Reserve to purchase 200,000 bitcoins annually within a period of five years to accumulate one million bitcoins. In other words–about 5% of the global supply. Needless to say, pro-crypto regulations are a very meaningful step for the widespread adoption of crypto assets, and Trump’s stance has proven to ignite a positive sentiment, with BTC hitting its ATH shortly after the future President confirmed his plans to create a BTC federal reserve. With BTC keeping its dominance, high interest rates, and pro-crypto regulations in the US, should we expect a full-blown altcoin supercycle in 2025? That’s a billion-dollar question. If history has taught us anything, it’s that altcoin pumps often follow major Bitcoin moves. Yet, estimating just how big those price movements will be - or exactly how long after Bitcoin’s new all-time highs altcoins will moon–is impossible. David Siemer, the CEO of Wave Digital Assets, says: “I don't think we'll see such a dramatic altcoin season as 2021 in the near future, meaning BTC dominance falling below 40%. But we will see a huge increase in altcoin values as BTC continues to rise.” Siemer then adds that “for alts to break out like 2021 relative to BTC, the use (adoption) and value (revenue capture) of altcoins needs to increase by many orders of magnitude”, emphasizing that it may happen in at least 3 years. But once it begins, altcoin season itself can be easily recognized because of some quite bullish signals: Cane Island Digital Research has shared in its “Proof of Altseason” findings about the seasonality of altcoin rallies, showing ETH as a proxy for altcoin to experience a bullish market. In addition, it mentions a repeated pattern of the January-May altseason period. Although the upcoming altcoin season may differ significantly from what we’re used to, certain sectors have secured their spots within the crypto space. After the $VIRTUAL token experienced a 24908.4% pump (that’s 249x), it’s safe to say that we’ve entered a new level of narrative dominance. While memecoins could outpace sectors like real-world assets or AI, AI agents are in a league of their own, often regarded as the driving force behind the next supercycle. Artificial Intelligence is still at the top of its game, and with the progress of AI agents, the onchain AI economy has garnered a big chunk of mindshare, hitting its peak at 50% in 2024, according to Kaito AI. This trend will likely follow in 2025, driven by the unprecedented demand for AI services. Institutional adoption, ignited by big names like BlackRock, has also impacted sectors like real-world assets, legitimizing tokenization as a fundamental component of the crypto world. While most of the attention is on AI and AI agents, traditional finance is exploring tokenization as a viable business option, with major banks like J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs trying to disrupt the financial market. As we enter 2025, we must keep several things in mind before the altcoin season. First, Bitcoin dominance is your friend, so use it wisely to time your trades. Websites like BlockchainCenter.net can help you assess whether we’re in an altcoin or Bitcoin season. What’s important to keep in mind is: The crypto market is maturing. Each cycle is a stepping stone and should be considered a learning lesson. While memecoins are still harvesting their fruits, new narratives are becoming more and more influential. But here is the most interesting part–the narratives trending right now, like AI agents, are not just passing trends. To top it all off, we now face a greater impact from macros and institutional adoption than any previous bull run. Does it mean we should expect different altcoin dynamics this time around? To some extent. We shouldn’t blindly follow the pattern from previous years, either. The question isn’t whether altcoin season will happen—it’s when and how different it will be from previous years.

Title: Citigroup joins US lenders in exiting Net-Zero Banking Alliance

(Reuters) - U.S. banks Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America said on Tuesday they are exiting the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a group of global banks that have pledged to curb greenhouse gas emissions. They follow Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs, which both left the alliance earlier this month. Financial firms, historically criticized for their connections to the fossil fuel industry, have made efforts to incorporate net-zero standards more prominently into their operations. However, they have begun scaling back on some initiatives to avoid irking Republican policymakers who are opposed to limiting the financing of fossil fuels. Citi said it had made progress toward its own net-zero goals and decided to leave the NZBA. BofA, in an emailed statement to Reuters, said: "We will continue to work with clients on this issue and meet their needs." The NZBA aims to bring down carbon emissions from the lending and investment portfolios of its members to zero on a net basis by 2050. Last month, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) were sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states, which said the large asset managers violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF sets massive standard! Good news for BTC?

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF redefines the market, hitting $50B AUM while Bitcoin tops $100K. BlackRock Inc’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has set a new standard in the exchange-traded fund (ETF) industry. Launched in January 2024, the fund achieved $50 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 11 months. Meanwhile, this growth has made it the fastest-growing ETF of all time, surpassing records across all asset classes, according to Bloomberg. The iShares Bitcoin Trust has reached milestones at a pace no ETF has matched before. Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities, noted that IBIT’s asset size now equals the combined AUM of over 50 long-established European ETFs. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, described IBIT’s launch as “the greatest in ETF history.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart estimated that with its current AUM and a 0.25% expense ratio, the fund is projected to generate $112 million annually in revenue for BlackRock. The launch of IBIT also marked a major shift for Bitcoin. With BlackRock’s support, Bitcoin’s [BTC] price surged past $100,000 for the first time. The world’s largest asset manager, overseeing more than $11 trillion, brought institutional legitimacy to the cryptocurrency, attracting both traditional investors and individuals who had previously been cautious. The road to IBIT’s launch followed years of regulatory hurdles. Efforts to secure approval for a spot-Bitcoin ETF began as far back as 2013, with repeated rejections from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). A breakthrough came in 2023 when Grayscale Investments won a federal court ruling overturning the SEC’s rejection of its Bitcoin trust conversion application. Soon after, BlackRock entered the scene, leveraging its regulatory expertise and reputation to gain approval in early 2024. IBIT has become a leader in the crowded Bitcoin ETF market, which now holds $107 billion in assets across 12 funds. BlackRock’s offering accounts for more than half of the daily trading volume among these funds. Since its launch, IBIT has experienced outflows on only nine days, reflecting consistent investor interest. The fund’s introduction of options trading on the 19th of November strengthened its appeal. Research firm Asym500 reported that IBIT’s Options have become some of the most traded among ETFs, with an average daily volume of $1.7 billion. Competing products, including those from Fidelity and Grayscale, trail far behind, averaging just 1% of IBIT’s volume. While BlackRock has embraced Bitcoin ETFs, its competitor Vanguard has stayed out of the space. Vanguard has also restricted trading of Bitcoin ETFs on its brokerage platform. Analysts suggest this could alienate younger investors who view cryptocurrency as a core asset class. Nate Geraci noted that this decision may give BlackRock a strategic edge, “Younger investors are increasingly including crypto in their portfolios, and BlackRock’s move positions it as a forward-thinking leader,” he said. As IBIT continues to grow, it has established itself as a defining player in the ongoing expansion of Bitcoin into mainstream financial markets.

Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Overtake Satoshi Holdings as Weekly Inflows Surpass $2 Billion

US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have surpassed more than 1.1 billion BTC in holdings, and they now collectively hold more Bitcoin than Satoshi Nakamoto. According to X user Shaun Edmondson, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs trading on US exchanges hold 1,104,354 BTC after aggressive buying since their January launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF holds the most coins with 521,375 BTC, more than double the assets of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. BlackRock now ranks as the third-largest Bitcoin holder. Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold $109 billion in assets, equivalent to 5.57% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. This week has boded well for spot Bitcoin ETFs, with the data so far showing that the weekly inflows are at the second-highest level since January. This comes after the products posted positive flows for six consecutive days. The total inflows to these products have already surpassed $2.35 billion so far this week. On December 5, inflows totaled $766M, with BlackRock’s IBIT posting $770M in inflows. These strong inflows coincided with a rally in BTC price above $100,000 to an all-time high of $103,670. Besides Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) ETFs have also recorded their best week since launch after total weekly inflows surpassed $752M. Spot ETH ETFs have been under pressure from persistent outflows from the Grayscale ETF. However, for the last nine days, these products have recorded positive netflows. Inflows to spot Ethereum ETFs also hit a record high of $428M on December 5, their highest level since their launch. These ETFs now hold $12.51 billion worth of Ether, equivalent to 2.71% of the altcoin’s market capitalization. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas has opined that the performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs, especially BlackRock’s IBIT, has broken previous records in the US ETF market. “$IBIT is now over $50b. It took it 228 days to reach this milestone, the next fastest ETF to reach 50b was $IEFA in 1,329 days. So over 5x faster than any ETF ever launched,” he stated. Balchunas further added that while he was not a Bitcoin maximalist, BTC was a “special asset” compared to other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, at press time, traded at $93,787 after a 2% drop in 24 hours.

There’s little doubt that the industry has progressed this year. From regulatory clarity to a thriving startup culture, here are nine cities that helped shape the crypto landscape in 2024. 1.Berlin, Germany This year, Germany clarified tax rules for staking and lending, reducing uncertainty for retail and institutional investors. The city's collaborative culture, bolstered by events like the Berlin Blockchain Week, attracts developers and entrepreneurs alike. “Berlin is solidifying its place as Europe’s premier crypto hub for 2025,” Hannes Graah, founder of digital wallet Zeal,” told Decrypt. “With a deep-seated crypto culture and a vibrant developer community, the city is leading the charge in integrating blockchain into daily life.” The tax on crypto gains aligns with the regular income tax rate, which can be as high as 45%, plus an additional 5.5% Solidarity Tax. However, if a user holds their crypto for at least a year, then their gains are tax-free. 2.Singapore Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) expanded its regulatory sandbox in 2024, creating new opportunities for fintech startups to explore tokenized assets, decentralized finance or DeFi, and other blockchain-based solutions in a controlled environment. This year, MAS also streamlined licensing processes and introduced clearer guidelines for digital payment token service providers, reducing entry barriers for companies. With its forward-thinking crypto framework and strategic location in Asia, Singapore remains a pivotal gateway for businesses targeting both Eastern and Western markets. “Singapore maintains a slight edge due to its established financial reputation and regulatory framework,” Danny Chong, co-founder of Tranchess, a yield and multi-chain staking protocol, told Decrypt. “Singapore’s complementary strengths can create a transformative economic zone for the crypto industry.” 3.Dubai, United Arab Emirates Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) issued comprehensive crypto guidelines in 2024, solidifying the region's position as a crypto powerhouse. Initiatives like the DMCC Crypto Center and zero-tax policies continue to attract global exchanges and venture capital. “Streamlined licensing processes and investments in high-profile events like Token2049 have attracted prominent virtual asset providers and financial institutions, cementing Dubai and Abu Dhabi as magnets for institutional investors seeking clear regulations and a supportive environment for digital asset innovation,” Brandon Truong, co-founder of layer-1 blockchain ZetaChain, told Decrypt. In October, Vara implemented a comprehensive framework covering marketing, consumer protection, prohibited activities, and international compliance for virtual assets, adding to existing frameworks implemented last year. That’s helped pull outside crypto firms in. 4.Tokyo, Japan In 2024, Japan doubled down on its efforts to balance innovation and consumer protection for crypto. In April, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) implemented tax reforms approved the year prior that eliminated levies on unrealized corporate gains for crypto holdings. The move effectively incentivizes institutional investments, harboring a friendlier environment for blockchain and crypto businesses. Tokyo continues to be a global hub for blockchain gaming and NFTs, thanks to its tech-forward infrastructure and regulatory clarity. The city’s vibrant startup ecosystem, combined with government support for Web3 innovation, has made it a hub for developers and entrepreneurs. 5.Sydney, Australia While regulations have been slow to develop in Australia—and even as Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock continues to thumb her nose at the industry—Sydney plays host to a vibrant crypto community. This year’s Aus Crypto Con, held at the International Conference Center, showcased a vast array of domestic and neighboring countries’ latest crypto innovations, as well as some old familiar ones. The Australian and Investment Commission is also exploring regulations for the near future that seek to define when and how crypto should be classified as financial products. Should it be implemented, the guidance would mark the first comprehensive policy geared specifically towards Australia’s budding crypto industry. Still, some lingering questions remain, and local industry leaders are pushing back over concerns about when crypto products, such as yield-bearing stablecoins and tokenized assets, should be considered financial products. 6.San Francisco, United States San Francisco's Silicon Valley continues to foster disruptive crypto projects despite a challenging U.S. regulatory environment. In 2024, venture funding for Web3 startups surged, particularly in decentralized social platforms. Notably, Bluesky Social, a decentralized social media company, secured a $15 million Series A investment in October to expand its user base and develop subscription models. The investment reflects renewed optimism about decentralized networks. Venture capitalists are increasingly backing projects that promote user autonomy and data privacy. 7.Miami, United States Miami continues to be a dynamic center for crypto entrepreneurs. In May 2024, the University of Miami hosted the 2nd Annual Business of Blockchain Technology Conference, which provided a platform for academics, professionals, and policymakers to discuss blockchain research and practices. While Mayor Francis Suarez has long been a proponent of blockchain innovation, no significant new initiatives aimed at broadening blockchain education were widely reported this year. However, the city organized events like WAGMI Miami, a major Web3 and blockchain conference that attracted thousands of participants, while the annual Art Basel convention again attracted a slew of crypto artists and creators to the city. Such events and others only reinforced Miami's status as a crypto hub and center of influence. 8.New York City, United States New York City strengthened its position as a blockchain hub in 2024 with tightened crypto regulations and industry advancements. The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) introduced stricter requirements for crypto firms, including enhanced coin-listing policies and updated customer service guidelines to improve consumer protections. In November, Circle, the issuer of USDC stablecoin, announced its move to New York ahead of a planned IPO. New York's balance between regulatory oversight and fostering blockchain innovation highlights the city’s growing appeal as Wall Street firms, including BlackRock, continue to move on the asset class. 9.Hong Kong Hong Kong is ramping up efforts to become a leading crypto and wealth management hub by proposing tax exemptions for cryptocurrency investment gains. The Financial Services and Treasury Bureau has suggested expanding capital gains tax exemptions to include crypto, overseas properties, and carbon credits, targeting sophisticated investors and private funds. The city is also tightening regulations on stablecoins, requiring issuers to hold reserves locally and establish a physical presence. These measures, combined with its existing tax breaks for family offices, aim to attract institutional capital and foster blockchain innovation. Hong Kong is positioning itself to compete as a major player in the global digital asset market.

Title: Is Exxon Mobil (XOM) the Best Dividend Stock of 2024?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxon-mobil-xom-best-dividend-190425978.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Dividend Stocks of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other dividend stocks. Macroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation. Improved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve’s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024. Dividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019—a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates—dividends contributed 75% to the market’s overall returns. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company’s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not. Reflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers. This broader adoption of dividends has expanded the range of options for equity income investors, offering greater access to dynamic and high-growth companies. For instance, major tech companies that are market leaders have recently introduced dividends. Meanwhile, established tech giants demonstrate that dividend payments can coexist with innovation and reinvestment, proving that companies can excel at both. For this list, we reviewed a selection of dividend stocks and identified those that have provided positive returns in 2024. From this group, we focused on companies offering yields above 2% as of December 30. We then narrowed down the list by selecting companies with the most hedge fund investments, based on Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Aerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is an American multinational energy company. It described its Q3 performance as "industry-leading" and intends to keep investing in 2025 to sustain that position, while also continuing to buy back its stock to reward shareholders. For 2025, the company plans to increase capital investments to between $27 billion and $29 billion, alongside an additional $20 billion for share repurchases, which will reduce the number of shares in circulation, benefiting shareholders. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) reported revenue of $90.02 billion in Q3 2024, exceeding analysts’ expectations by $1.66 billion. It remains a leader in carbon capture and storage, having secured a new agreement that increases its annual CO2 offtake commitments to 6.7 million metric tons, surpassing all its competitors in the sector. Exxon also demonstrated strong financial performance, generating $17.6 billion in operating cash flow and $11.3 billion in free cash flow for the quarter. Additionally, it returned $9.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is renowned for its reliability as a dividend payer, having increased its payouts for 42 consecutive years. The company currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.99 per share and has a dividend yield of 3.74%, as of December 30. At the end of Q3 2024, 86 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database held stakes in Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), compared with 92 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is roughly $7 billion. First Eagle Investment Management was one of the company’s leading stakeholders. Overall XOM ranks 3rd on our list of the best dividend stocks of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of XOM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Bitcoin more than doubles in 2024 on spot ETF approval, Trump euphoria

Business FILE PHOTO: Representation of the bitcoin cryptocurrency and a price chart are seen in this illustration taken October 24, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Bitcoin more than doubled in 2024 driven by the U.S. markets regulator's approval for exchange-traded funds tied to its spot price, and optimism over easing regulatory hurdles with Donald Trump set to return to the White House. The world's largest and most well-known cryptocurrency hit $100,000 earlier this month, a milestone that has ignited 'animal spirits' among supporters of the once-nascent asset class. A more than 120 per cent surge in bitcoin this year and a nearly 50 per cent jump in ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, have propelled the sector's market value to roughly $3.5 trillion, according to CoinGecko data. More gains are in store for 2025, according to analysts. "We remain convinced $100,000 is not the final milestone. We expect Bitcoin to hit a cycle-high of $200,000 in late 2025," analysts at brokerage Bernstein wrote in a client note earlier this month. MicroStrategy, a software firm that has become the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin, has seen its shares surge nearly five-fold in 2024. The stock, which joined the benchmark Nasdaq-100 index recently, is now seen as a proxy for bitcoin, with its movement closely tied to sentiment towards the digital asset. Several smaller companies are following its playbook and allocating portions of their cash to bitcoin. "We expect bitcoin to emerge as the new-age premier 'store of value' asset eventually replacing gold over the next decade and becoming a permanent part of institutional multi-asset allocation and a standard for corporate treasury management," the Bernstein note said. Much of the optimism began in January when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first ETFs to track the spot price of bitcoin, marking a watershed moment for the broader crypto industry. The move gave the sector institutional legitimacy and improved its mainstream appeal as traditional finance heavyweights including BlackRock and Fidelity launched the products. The victory of Trump, who has promised to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet," further bolstered the industry's position later this year. Crypto advocates donated millions during the election, hoping to elect candidates that favor the sector. Most crypto stocks have also benefited from the industry-wide rally. The big winners of 2024 are MicroStrategy, crypto exchange Coinbase and bitcoin miner Hut 8 On the other hand, several other crypto miners have reeled under shrinking margins due to higher energy and hardware costs, missing the year's rally. Shares of Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital and Bit Digital lost between 26 per cent and 32 per cent this year.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Take on NVIDIA (NVDA): The King of AI GPUs Under Pressure

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 9 Semiconductor Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. As 2024 comes to a close, the semiconductor industry has seen its fair share of fireworks. While firms like Wall Street’s favorite AI GPU stock are the ones that have caught investor attention, not all chip stocks have performed well. Just like the economy, where firms exposed to AI-driven data center spending have performed well, semiconductor stocks that are geared towards AI have also seen their fortunes soar while others haven’t been so lucky. As an example, consider the stock price performance of two of the most well-known semiconductor stocks in the world. The first ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks while the second ranks 12th. The first stock is the GPU stock we mentioned above while the second is the world’s largest integrated chip manufacturer. An integrated chip manufacturer, for those out of the loop, is a firm capable of designing and manufacturing its chips. Looking at their share price performance, the first stock has gained 184% year-to-date while the second is down by 57.5% over the same time period. So why does their performance lie on the opposite ends of the spectrum? Well, the first company has sustained investor optimism because its products are market leaders in terms of computing AI workloads. Even so, while the shares are up by 184%, they had already gained 173% by mid-October. Since then, the stock has added just 4% as Wall Street is in wait-and-watch mode regarding the demand for AI services among businesses and users and the GPU supply chain of the company. However, while the GPU maker hasn’t impressed in terms of returns in the final quarter, the integrated chip manufacturer has stunned with its fall from grace. From the start of the year to July-end, its shares had lost 36%. While that was bad on its own, the firm’s second-quarter earnings report led to nothing but a bloodbath. It caused a whopping 34.6% share price drop over the next couple of days. So what happened? Well, starting from the financial figures, its Q2 earnings per share of two cents fell way short of consensus analyst estimates of $10 cents. The revenue wasn’t great either, as while the firm earned $12.83 in the second quarter, analysts had expected it to bring in $12.94 billion. But an earnings and revenue miss rarely wipes a third of a stock’s value. Along with the dismal financial results, the firm also revealed that not only would it cut 15% of its workforce, but it would also stop paying a dividend in Q4. Naturally, investors weren’t impressed and they weren’t optimistic about the firm’s future trajectory either. Since the earnings, the stock is up by 2.5% though as its CEO’s sudden exit and whispers of a divestiture of the costly chip manufacturing business to ease costs seemed to have piqued investor attention. The start of December has also seen another interesting, albeit long-term, development for the semiconductor industry. The semiconductors, or chips, that currently power our computers and phones rely on classical computing which uses bits for computing. Quantum computing, on the other hand, expands the processing power significantly over classical computing by relying on qubits instead. In December, Google revealed its Willow quantum computing chip which it claims is capable of processing a problem that would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion years in less than five minutes. More importantly, Google claimed to have manufactured the chip itself – a development that broadens the number of companies capable of manufacturing advanced processors. The announcement injected fresh life into quantum computing stocks which have gained as much as 281% since Willow was revealed. This is despite the fact that no semiconductor foundry is capable of manufacturing quantum computing chips at scale. And why would they? After all, the use cases for quantum computers are limited as well, as opposed to the billions of chips used in personal computing applications. For his part, Cramer isn’t a fan of quantum computing either. Commenting on the negative share price movements following the Federal Reserve’s well-televised conference earlier this month, he likened the sentiment in quantum computing to a hype bubble. The market won’t recover quickly according to Cramer as “rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing” pushed stocks higher than their fundamentals would justify. Further commenting on the industry, he stated: “How are these companies going to, how is D-Wave Quantum by the way, how is that going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is? It’s a nonfungible token, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” To compile our list of Jim Cramer’s bold predictions about semiconductor stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out semiconductor stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 8-20-24 Performance Since Then: 7.73% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world’s leading AI GPU designer. Since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT, the firm’s shares have gained more than 700%. Yet, since their July peak, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s shares have added just 1.62% as investors wait to see how its Blackwell GPUs perform and whether any rivals pop up. The stock has also been hit with speculation of rivals stealing NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s AI GPU market share due to supply constraints and high prices. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock dipped by 3% in December after Broadcom shared that it can earn as much as $90 billion in AI revenue by 2027. Here’s what Cramer said about the firm in August: “I almost feel like you can guess it—it’s Nvidia. It’s the king, and the rest of the market is made up of its pawns, marching to Nvidia’s drum. Remember this morning when I was on the call and said, “Look, Nvidia is almost too important. There’s too much pressure on Nvidia—can it sustain it? I don’t want Nvidia to be Samson. Overall, NVDA ranks 1st on our list of semiconductor stocks that Jim Cramer has boldly predicted. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Why Array Technologies (ARRY) Is Among the Best Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 11 Best Renewable Energy Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) stands against the other best renewable energy stocks to buy now. The future of President Joe Biden’s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) plays a significant role in promoting renewable energy by offering a wide range of tax incentives and funding mechanisms to encourage investment in clean energy technologies, including solar, wind, and geothermal power, hangs in the balance as the incoming Republican-controlled White House, Senate, and House of Representatives prepare to take office in 2025. However, an area of concern is the future of the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), which provides financing for green energy projects. The LPO has been instrumental in funding large-scale renewable energy projects and it expanded significantly under the IRA. However, Trump’s appointees, particularly Wright, who has expressed skepticism about the climate crisis, may be inclined to scale back or dismantle this program entirely, which could have a significant impact on the green energy sector. READ ALSO: 12 Best Technology Penny Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds and 12 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In Now. In an interview with Bloomberg on December 23, Tom Steyer, Co-Founder of Galvanize Climate Solutions, a climate-focused global investment firm, discussed the role of renewable energy in the United States. Steyer emphasized that while the year 2025 is often discussed in the context of climate regulations, it is more accurately about meeting the growing energy demand. He argued that renewable energy should be at the center of any energy bill, regardless of political persuasion. Steyer highlighted that market costs are the primary drivers of the energy transition to renewables. He cited the fact that in 2023, 86% of new electricity generation was predominantly from renewable sources, driven by economic rather than purely environmental considerations. Steyer pointed out that the phrase “drill, baby, drill” might still be part of the political conversation, but the cost differential between renewable and fossil fuels drives the reality. He noted that renewables are now cheaper than fossil fuels and are becoming increasingly cost-effective. For instance, the cost of natural gas in the U.S. has risen to nearly double its previous levels, while in Europe, it is even higher. However, the cheapest electricity is increasingly coming from renewable sources, both in the U.S. and globally. This economic reality is driving business decisions, international competitiveness, and national security by industries such as tech, that require large amounts of electricity and are increasingly turning to renewables to meet their energy needs. When asked about the potential impact of deregulation in the energy sector, Steyer suggested that deregulation could help accelerate the adoption of renewables if it includes faster permitting and lower oversight for all energy projects, including renewables. He noted that the Trump administration’s push for faster permits and reduced oversight for oil and gas drilling could extended to renewables, and will lead to a significant expansion of low-cost, abundant renewable energy. Regarding nuclear energy, Steyer acknowledged its potential but noted the challenges associated with cost, safety, and public perception. He pointed out that nuclear energy has historically been expensive, with the last nuclear plant in Georgia costing at least four times its original estimate. While nuclear energy could provide a stable baseload power source, the high costs and safety concerns have made it a less attractive option compared to renewables. As the United States enters 2025, the future of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) remains uncertain under a Republican government. However, the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy compared to fossil fuels makes it increasingly dominant in the global energy mix.

To compile our list of the 11 best renewable energy stocks to buy now, we used clean energy ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 renewable energy stocks. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 11 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company’s flagship products, including the DuraTrack and OmniTrack series, are designed to maximize energy production and minimize operational risks, making them ideal for a wide range of terrains and climates. Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) generates revenue through hardware sales and post-installation services, serving utility-scale solar developers and independent power producers.

In Brazil, the company has achieved a leading market share in distributed generation, demonstrating its ability to adapt to diverse market conditions. In Europe, despite modest market demand, Array Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARRY) is confident in its targeted customer activities and is poised for share growth in the coming quarters. Overall, ARRY ranks 7th on our list of best renewable energy stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of ARRY to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: A standoff between BlackRock and the FDIC is dragging into 2025

A clash between BlackRock (BLK) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over the money manager’s holdings of US banks will now play out in the waning days of President Joe Biden’s administration. The FDIC has asked BlackRock to sign by Jan. 10 a "passivity agreement" that would codify greater checks on the money manager’s holdings of FDIC-supervised lenders, according to people familiar with the matter, pushing back a deadline that was previously Dec. 31 of this year. The agreement FDIC has asked BlackRock to sign is similar to one announced last week with another giant money manager, Vanguard Group, that imposes new compliance requirements when the manager amasses more than 10% of all outstanding stock in an FDIC-supervised bank. BlackRock spent much of 2024 resisting the FDIC’s push for greater oversight, denying that the asset manager exerts undue control over companies through its investment stewardship activities. As recently as December, the giant Wall Street firm proposed an arrangement with the FDIC that didn't include the same level of oversight agreed to by Vanguard. The FDIC did not respond to BlackRock's proposal until announcing its Vanguard settlement, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The tug of war between BlackRock and FDIC is the latest example of rising D.C. scrutiny of BlackRock, which oversees $11 trillion in assets. For years, the financial giant has been a target of GOP attacks about "woke" investing. Republicans have raised concerns about whether BlackRock’s massive holdings in US corporations force companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. And Democrats have for years also been leery about whether the heft of BlackRock could pose risks to the financial system. The "passivity" agreement FDIC wants BlackRock to sign is designed to assure bank regulators that the giant money manager will remain a "passive" owner of an FDIC-supervised bank and won’t exert control over a bank’s board. Currently, BlackRock only has such an agreement with the Federal Reserve. Now the FDIC wants its own agreement with the money manager, which is also permitted under law. In July, FDIC board member Rohit Chopra described the FDIC's lack of oversight of passive asset manager stakes as "highly inappropriate" and a shirking of "the responsibility Congress entrusted to us." "Certain sectors of our economy are critical infrastructure for our country," added Chopra, who is also the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "We don’t let just anyone own a nuclear power plant or operate a bridge." BlackRock has been public about its viewpoint that such additional oversight is unfounded and ultimately detrimental. Its head of regulatory affairs, Benjamin Tecmire, told the FDIC the increased oversight would duplicate what the Fed already does, according to an October letter to the agency. Tecmire said such duplication would make it more difficult for BlackRock fund investors to invest in banks, thereby harming investors, crimping banks' access to equity, and slowing capital flow across the US economy. The FDIC inquired about BlackRock’s stake in 39 bank holding companies where it held a more than 10% position. Since taking those positions, BlackRock said it voted on just two of a total of 1,304 occasions against what management recommended. BlackRock also engaged with 12 of those lenders 19 times in the past three years “and most of these engagements were initiated by the banking institutions themselves, not BlackRock,” Tecimire told the FDIC. If BlackRock doesn't agree by Jan. 10 to the same level of scrutiny approved by Vanguard, the FDIC can take other options, according to another person familiar with the situation. Those options range from further extending the deadline to sending BlackRock a formal inquiry or even a subpoena for more information on selective communications between its stewardship team and the executives of US banks. It is not known how the Trump administration may decide to handle the BlackRock situation if it is not resolved by Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. One Republican member of the FDIC board appointed by Biden, Jonathan McKernan, called the agreement signed last week with Vanguard "a good step in the right direction," saying in a statement it addressed concerns he had raised about FDIC monitoring of “the purported passivity of the largest index fund complexes.” "Those concerns have some urgency given the rapid growth of these index fund complexes and the growing body of academic work and other evidence raising doubt about whether these index fund complexes are truly passive."

Title: AI And The Municipal Bond Market: Algorithmic Trading And Predictions

Computational Finance The term algorithmic trading is tossed around a lot these days. But what does it mean? Let’s break it down into its components. It’s not that defining an algorithm is all that complex. If anything, it is very simple. An algorithm is a set of instructions enabling a computer program to put together different sources of information [data] and generate a result. If you’re talking algorithms, you’re also talking AI and data. Both are equally straightforward. At its core AI is simply a way to organize, analyze, and apply data for an outcome. Data is anything that is or can be digitized and tagged with a number. And anything—photographs, text, speech—can be digitized and numerically tagged. Outcomes can be as basic as determining the mean of a data set or as complex as the predictive analytics needed for a self-driving car. Analyzing outcomes and then refining and adjusting the program and data inputs for a better outcome is what machine learning or deep learning are all about. As for trading, it's a safe assumption that if you are reading a Forbes.com investment column, you know that it means buying and selling bonds, stocks, options, and other financial instruments. Fun Fact! Algorithm is an eponym derived from the last name of Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi, a ... [+] Persian mathematical genius who lived around AD780. So how does all this come together as algorithmic trading? James Pruskowski, Chief Investment Officer & Co-Founder at 16Rock Asset Management offered a general example. Integrating AI and algorithms, the firm’s municipal bond trading models regularly monitor market data—inputs like trades, volume, spreads, bid wanteds, request for quotes. One model is programmed to seek out arbitrage opportunities based on pricing anomalies discerned by analyzing market data. With regularly updated buy and sell parameters, the computer bids/buys and asks/sells. A fully automated process, all of this can happen in a few seconds. The new trade data gets uploaded, is analyzed, and the model is updated to determine what the best opportunities might be given the new information. And the cycle continues. Noting AI and algorithmic trading are liquifying the municipal odd lot market (an odd lot trade is comprised of a $100,000 par or less block of bonds), James also observed that separately managed account (SMA) asset growth as well as municipal ETFs were compelling many market participants to be price takers. Be it a Financial Advisor or ETF fund manager, when faced with a pressing need to invest or sell, operational complexities force both—and their executing traders at large retail wire houses—to be price takers. These prices tend to reflect the higher yielding asking price versus the lower yielding bid price. Correspondingly, levels on market benchmark curves (such as the ICE US Municipal AAA Curve) derived from these trades reflect these price takers’ lower price, higher yielding trades. This is how, in his view, price takers define the opportunity set in today’s market. USA, New York, New York City, Trading desk with computers and phones Josh Rosenblum, Head of Algorithmic Trading at Brownstone Investment Group (he was formerly head of Municipal Trading Strategies at the firm), offered a different take. Combine the billions of assets under management held by mutual funds and SMA advisors with electronic trading platforms, he sees buy side firms moving from price takers to price makers. Moreover, with those platforms buy side firms could trade with each other directly. The relationship between broker and the client is evolving into more of a partnership to develop mutually beneficial workflows. He has seen evidence of tighter spreads in the odd lot market due to algorithmic trading, also noting that AI-generated predictive pricing analytics creates a self-fulfilling pricing prophecy. If the model says the next trade on bond has a high probability to be valued at a certain amount, the maximum buy or sell price an investor would be willing take is going to be at that price or within a hair’s-breadth from it. Prediction is driving reality. Moreover, the counterparty “investor” is increasingly likely to be another AI-driven model. While a positive implication of this may be more market liquidity, computer and model dependence has its own pitfalls. While speaking independently, James and Josh concurred that AI, electronic trading platforms, and algorithmic trading is creating a technological arms race. If you’re not the lead, you’re falling behind, which is accelerating technological adoption because absolutely no one wants to be left behind. This is particularly true when it comes to execution speeds. If you aren’t trading faster than your worthy competitor, you weren’t going to get bonds. No bonds, no performance. No performance, no investors. Pretty simple. Buy Now Button and Cursor. Vector Stock Illustration It isn’t just proprietary funds using algorithmic trading. For broker dealers who want to stay active in the municipal bond market, it’s a classic build-or-buy decision. Perhaps first out of the box was Toronto-Dominion Bank’s (NYSE-TD) acquisition of Headland Tech Holdings, LLC in 2021. Barely a year later, Raymond James (NYSE-RJF) bought SumRidge Partners, LLC in the firm’s ongoing strategy applying technology as the backbone to build out their trading business. Larger broker dealers and asset management firms such as Goldman Sachs and Blackrock, respectively, have generally pursued internal builds to remain competitive, although hiring top software engineers to do so might be interpreted as a form of buying. Then again, at least one bracket firm has thrown in the muni towel: Citigroup exited the municipal bond business in 2023. Bond Talk Given its direct market impacts, the market’s focus on algorithmic trading is understandable and justifiable. But there is another algorithm-based technology that might prove equally impactful on the market. ChatGPT is based on an algorithm, specifically a type of machine learning model called a language model. More precisely, it is built on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture, which is a deep learning model designed to understand and generate human-like text. It is not a single algorithm but a complex system involving many components. The overall process can be described as an algorithm that uses machine learning to generate responses based on patterns in the data it has seen. In fact, that entire prior paragraph was written by ChatGPT. ChatGPT is a fascinating technology. From planning a Caribbean cruise to generating Python code to the latest procedures in hip replacement surgery, just about anything you can imagine is available at your fingertips. Enter a question and, in a few seconds, ChatGPT replies with an answer. But interactive technology goes beyond typing in text for a response, as anyone who has talked to Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa can attest. Flipping that around, Speechify can turn anything into audio—text, pdf, email—and read it to you in high quality digital voices, including Snoop Dogg or Gwyneth Paltrow. In fact, Forbes.com offers an audio of this article for your listening pleasure. (No, it is not my voice.) Prefer video? Pictory offers text to video, URL to video, PPT to video, and several other to-video abilities. You can copy-paste this entire article into Pictory to see how the technology transforms my jottings into a Hollywood-esque video. (Again, no, I am not featured in it. Sigh. I really need a new agent.) In short, the abilities of interactivity are boundless. If you can imagine it, it can be done with AI in any communications medium. Chat bot concept with 3d rendering humanoid robot with headset That includes talking to municipal bonds. If you are wondering why you would want to talk to your bonds, ask Robert Kane and Saul Tessler of Munibonds.ai. Founded in 2024, the firm has an AI chat function where you enter a question on a bond and the app generates a very thorough response. This user driven input functionality is far more robust than the limited, predetermined drop-down menu list. If it has been disclosed, from the Preliminary Official Statement to the most recent quarterly financials, the app finds the data and generates an answer. It’s as close to making the municipal bond market’s PDF-laden disclosure documents into something machine readable as technology will allow. For now. Munibonds.ai is more than just an interactive search function. Tracking both user queries and other external market data, the firm offers market sentiment analysis on any bond. Or a portfolio of bonds. Or a bid-wanted list. You get the idea. It also offers a numerical “bond ranking”. While short of a credit rating, with the right user prompts, the report generated by the chat technology—including some fundamental analysis—is pretty close to a standard credit rating report. Creating the customized need parameters and automating that function, everyone from portfolio managers, traders, analysts, to compliance officers can have credit, structure, use of proceeds, market sentiment, and any other decision-making or reporting information on any bond or portfolio of bonds in nearly real time at any time. All they have to do is ask. Predicting the Future Imagine a perfect Laplace AI model. Possessing complete knowledge of every piece of data in the universe, past and present, to achieve a state of omniscience, it could predict the future with perfect accuracy. Whether or not the result would be an angel or a demon is up for debate, but read enough about AI and one comes away with the sense this is the ultimate state those developing and applying AI would like to achieve. It's impossible, of course. But for the municipal bond market, even if knowledge gleaned from AI leads to asymptotic results, it’s a far better result than what exists now. So here are the top AI predictions as to what the municipal bond market can expect going forward. 1. The rate of technological advancement and adoption across the market is going to accelerate. 2. Any market processes that can be automated will be. 3. From broker dealers to investment advisors to trading platforms, there will be further market consolidation. 4. The market will become far less opaque and fragmented. 5. A primary market electronic shelf-financing mechanism will develop for municipal bond issuers. 6. The market will adopt standardized, digital official statements, a consistent reporting taxonomy using an XBRL format, and ongoing disclosures will be in a machine readable or similarly algorithmically accessible format. 7. The pricing differential due to the current structural imbalance between odd-lot trade and institutional trade valuation will dissipate. 8. To stay relevant, credit ratings will be attached to numerical rankings that are more probabilistically based. 9. Climate change metrics will have a far greater impact on credit analysis and ratings. 10. These market evolutions will come far faster than many are expecting or are prepared for. UNITED KINGDOM - MARCH 30: Niels Bohr, Danish theoretical physicist, c 1950s. Noting Nobel laureate physicist Niels Bohr’s observation that predictions are difficult, particularly about the future, it is tempting to dismiss any one or all of these or any others that can be thought of with a “that can never happen” hand wave. Those who would do so are urged to keep in mind that, in technology, the question is not “can it be done” but “how can it be done” and then “how fast can it be done”. Because if history shows us anything, it is that, in the end, one thing has proven consistently true: Technology wins.

In this article, let’s look at why some of the relatively larger-cap companies declined and what dragged down the performance of their shares. A modern computer datacenter, running an advanced quantum computer system. Shares in D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE:QBTS) decreased by 6.16 percent on Monday to end at $9.30 apiece, as investors sold off positions while waiting for further catalysts to bolster trading appetite. Despite the decline, the company’s current valuation still marked a 16.32-percent increase in the past five days and an impressive 237-percent jump in the past 30 days, bolstered by quantum advancements led by Google’s Willow chips and Amazon’s Quantum Embark. Analysts believe that prospects for the company remained robust especially with the quantum computing sector expected to be at the forefront of technological advancements, particularly AI, over the next few years. US lawmakers also announced support for quantum computing development, recently promising $2.7 billion in government funding to supercharge quantum innovation across computing, sensing, and communications. Overall, QBTS ranks 9th on our list of firms that mirror broader market downturn ahead of 2025.

(NASDAQ:MARA) registered a 6.24-percent decrease in its share prices on Monday to close at $17.29 each. Investors appeared to be cautious about the company's prospects, as seen in its past five and 30-day trading, having booked significant losses of 13.38 percent and 32.54 percent, respectively. The company was also down 24.6 percent year-to-date. According to analysts, investor appetite was dampened by disappointing third-quarter results announced recently, including a $124.8 million net loss compared to a $64.1 million net income in the same period last year.

Title: Is Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (CCU) the Best Brewery Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Brewery Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) stands against other best brewery stocks to buy according to hedge funds. The global alcohol industry is currently grappling with strict regulations, high taxes, inflation, and rising costs, which are likely to persist and may squeeze the profit margins of alcohol producers. The global brewing industry had been hit particularly hard as beer production worldwide fell to 1.88 billion hectoliters last year, representing a YoY decline of 0.9 %. Peter Hintermeier, Managing Director of BarthHaas, commented: “After we had managed to post modest growth in 2022 despite unfavorable conditions, we were expecting another small increase in 2023. However, energy, raw materials, packaging, logistics, and labor costs remained at a high level, which put pressure on the brewing business in many countries.” READ ALSO: 10 Best Marijuana Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds The American brewing industry is also faced with a declining demand, as beer consumption in the US last year fell to its lowest level since the 1970s, according to the Brewers’ Association. In fact, in 2022, the American spirits industry surpassed beer in revenue for the first time ever. The trend then continued in 2023, driven primarily by the spirits RTD category. Nevertheless, the country’s major brewers were still in good financial health, thanks to rising prices and a consumer shift towards more expensive, often imported beers. A major factor behind the decreasing demand is also global drinking habits have shifted dramatically over the last few years. The modern consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness and seek alternatives to traditional alcoholic beverages, giving rise to the rapidly growing low and no-alcohol trend. To make sure they don’t miss out on the opportunity, several industry behemoths have hopped on the zero-alcohol bandwagon and are now offering products with all of the taste and none of the booze. Despite the aforementioned challenges, the alcohol sector can be an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios, simply because of the buffer it provides during tough economic times. An analysis by Goldman Sachs has revealed that beer and spirits volumes in the American market have shown little correlation with economic growth. Their sales are more related to the general trends of alcohol consumption per capita rather than the general state of the economy. This is because beer and spirits are often seen as affordable luxuries or even staples. According to a study by Cambridge University, the decreasing levels of average per capita income lead to very small changes in gross alcohol, wine, and beer consumption. In fact, the surge in unemployment during recessions could instead trigger an increase in the average alcohol intake. A great example of this is how Americans drank more alcohol during the pandemic and this was also reflected in the resultant imposts collected by the national kitty. Alcohol tax revenues collected by the U.S. Treasury Department rose by 8% in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30, 2021, compared to the previous year, and remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Another popular investment vehicle in the alcohol industry is rare whiskeys. Aptly named ‘Liquid Gold’, this beloved liquor can preserve and even increase in value during economic instabilities, inflationary periods, and recessions. One simply cannot forget about the bottle of The Emerald Isle Collection that sold in auction earlier this year for $2.8 million, or the 1975 cask of Ardbeg single malt which was acquired by a private collector in Asia in 2022 for over $20 million, more than double the amount Glenmorangie paid for the entire Ardbeg distillery and all its stock in 1997. The Rare Whisky 101 Apex 1000 Index tracks whiskeys that are highly sought after for collection. It has gained over 384% since 2013, against almost 301% gains by S&P’s famous benchmark of the top 500 companies for the same period. The RW Japanese 100 Index, which includes 100 collector’s bottles from Japan, has seen gains of around 350% since 2015. The index includes bottles like Ichiro’s Malt ‘Card’ Ace of Spades, Ace of Diamonds, and King of Hearts, among others. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 12 companies operating in the brewing sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Beer Alcohol Stocks Held by the Most Hedge Funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:CCU) is a beverage giant that operates in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The company, known for its Cristal brand, is one of the biggest brewers in its home country of Chile. It was announced in October that Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU), which distributes PepsiCo products in Chile, has struck a deal for its rights also in Paraguay. The company has acquired a 51% stake in Bebidas del Paraguay, Distribuidora del Paraguay, and AV, in association with Vierci Group. This marks Paraguay as the second country where CCU holds the PepsiCo license, promising growth and investment opportunities. Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) had a mixed Q3 2024 as organic volumes were down 6.9%, mostly due to a weakened demand in Argentina. However, its Chilean segment saw a 7% revenue increase, driven by a 5.2% rise in prices and improved volumes. All in all, the company managed to achieve a net profit of CLP 29.55 million ($29.77 million) during the quarter, a significant 211% increase from the same period last year. CCU also offers an above-average annual dividend yield of 3.67% as of December 28, 2024. Compañía Cervecerías Unidas S.A. (NYSE:CCU) continues its focus on expanding its product line and recently launched Escudo Maki, a limited-edition variety produced with wild maquis collected by an agricultural cooperative in the south of Chile.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 20 Dividend Stocks of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) stands against the other dividend stocks. Macroeconomic factors have weighed on US stocks in the final days of the year, with the broader market declining by over 1% in the past week. Despite this post-Christmas slowdown, US financial markets are on the verge of closing out another exceptional year. The broader market index is projected to post a roughly 25% gain for 2024, marking the first back-to-back annual increases of more than 20% since 1997-1998. This strong performance has been supported by positive economic indicators, including resilient consumer spending and a robust labor market. Inflation, though still elevated, has shown consistent signs of moderation. Improved economic data and easing inflation have also influenced the Federal Reserve’s policy shift this year. Anticipation of rate cuts contributed to market growth, with the central bank implementing its third rate reduction in 2024. Dividend stocks have had a relatively weak performance this year, with the Dividend Aristocrats Index achieving a modest return of about 4%, widening the gap between its performance and that of the broader market. The index tracks the performance of companies that have raised their payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. However, investors shouldn't lose confidence in these results, as the value of dividend stocks becomes more apparent over the long term. A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that, since 1926, dividends have accounted for nearly one-third of the total equity returns of US stocks. Additionally, from 1980 to 2019—a period marked by a sharp decline in interest rates—dividends contributed 75% to the market’s overall returns. Investors are often drawn to dividend growth stocks because dividend payments are generally viewed as a sign of long-term commitment. Maintaining these payments demands profitability, strong returns, and consistent cash flow generation, making them a valuable indicator of a company’s quality. Businesses that regularly raise their dividends showcase their ability to consistently generate profits, which can also signal greater resilience during economic or market downturns. According to research, companies within the broader market that pay dividends have historically been more profitable compared to those that do not. Reflecting investors' preference for dividend stocks, many US companies are increasing their payouts and implementing dividend policies. As of September 30, 2024, around 80% of companies in the Index paid dividends, a figure consistent with a decade ago. Notably, 24% of these dividend-paying companies now belong to the technology sector, a significant rise from 13% ten years earlier, as reported by Franklin Templeton. Other innovative industries, such as healthcare and industrials, have also seen growth in dividend payers. This broader adoption of dividends has expanded the range of options for equity income investors, offering greater access to dynamic and high-growth companies. For instance, major tech companies that are market leaders have recently introduced dividends. Meanwhile, established tech giants demonstrate that dividend payments can coexist with innovation and reinvestment, proving that companies can excel at both. Our Methodology: For this list, we reviewed a selection of dividend stocks and identified those that have provided positive returns in 2024. From this group, we focused on companies offering yields above 2% as of December 30. We then narrowed down the list by selecting companies with the most hedge fund investments, based on Insider Monkey's Q3 2024 database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A group of business people discussing plans around a boardroom table adorned with a financial services company logo. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 105 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) is a New York-based multinational investment banking company. The company's diverse revenue streams make it an attractive investment option. With operations spanning consumer and commercial banking, capital markets, and asset management, its diversification enables strength in one sector to offset weaknesses in others, enhancing overall stability. In the past 12 months, the stock has delivered an over 39% return to shareholders. In the third quarter of 2024, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) reported revenue of $42.7 billion, marking a 7% increase from the same period last year. The company showed strong financial and operational results, with a net income of $12.9 billion and a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 19%. The Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB) division performed well, with a 31% rise in investment banking fees and an 8% increase in the Market's revenue. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) also proved to be a generous dividend payer, distributing around $3.06 billion in dividends to shareholders during the quarter. The company currently pays a quarterly dividend of $1.25 per share, yielding 2.09% as of December 30. At the end of Q3 2024, 105 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held stakes in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), compared with 111 in the previous quarter. The consolidated value of these stakes is more than $8.6 billion. Overall JPM ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of JPM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Here’s Why Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (CGDV) Is One of the Best Performing Dividend ETFs in 2024

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) stands against the other dividend ETFs. By the end of 2023, the global ETF market had reached $11.1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and expanded to include 9,149 funds. This growth was driven by several milestones and the diversification of ETF offerings, which now cover equity, fixed income, active management, and alternative strategies. Despite unpredictable factors such as the rise of AI or policy changes, ETFs continue to be a vital investment tool. According to State Street Global Advisors, although only 45% of individual investors in the US use ETFs, nearly 70% of financial advisors and 67% of institutional investors recommend or use them frequently. However, ETFs still make up only 11.25% of the total global investable assets, suggesting there is significant potential for further growth. Interest in ETFs is rising, particularly among retail investors, with 63% of US investors planning to purchase ETFs in 2024, a sharp increase from 37% during 2022. Active ETFs are experiencing considerable growth, with global inflows hitting a record $166 billion in 2023 and continuing to rise in 2024. Much of this growth is driven by fixed income and alternative investments, while AI-related ETFs, especially in robotics and semiconductors, are attracting large amounts of investment. These trends reflect the growing demand for ETFs as investors seek more flexible and efficient ways to respond to market changes. A Reuters report from October 2024 highlighted that US ETFs focused on dividend-paying stocks have experienced a significant increase in inflows since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle the prior month. In September, 135 US dividend ETFs tracked by Morningstar saw $3.05 billion in inflows, far higher than the average $424 million per month in the first eight months of 2024. However, this trend may slow as US Treasury yields have risen recently, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting a two-month high following strong employment data that suggests the economy is resilient and may not need further large rate cuts. Dividend ETFs tend to offer stable payouts and potential for growth, addressing challenges regarding unpredictable yields and limited principal growth. However, high-dividend ETFs vary in stability. Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the year-to-date (YTD) share price performance of each ETF as of December 30, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A close-up of a wealth manager's hands hovering over a laptop presenting a customer with investment options. YTD Share Price Performance as of December 30: 20.14% Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) aims to generate consistent income that surpasses the average yield of the S&P 500 by investing in dividend-paying companies or those with the potential to pay dividends. As of December 27, 2024, the ETF manages nearly $12.4 billion in assets, with a 0.33% expense ratio and a 1.74% 30-day SEC yield. Launched on February 22, 2022, Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV) holds 52 stocks in its portfolio as of November 2024. CGDV ranks 1st on our list of the best performing ETFs. Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) is one of the top stocks in the Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (NYSE:CGDV)’s portfolio. Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) provides HVAC, refrigeration, fire, security, and building automation technologies globally. It operates in three segments – HVAC, offering heating, cooling, and ventilation products and services; Refrigeration, providing transport refrigeration and commercial cooling solutions; and Fire & Security, offering fire detection, suppression, and security technologies. In Q3 2024, Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR) reported a 20% increase in organic orders, positioning the company for continued growth in 2025. Despite challenges in residential and light commercial HVAC in Europe and China, the company achieved 4% organic sales growth. Strong aftermarket performance is set to deliver double-digit growth for the fourth consecutive year. CARR repurchased $400 million in shares in Q3 and plans to repurchase $5 billion in shares by the end of next year. Carrier Global's adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.77, up 3% year-over-year, driven by organic growth, pricing, and productivity, partially offset by higher interest expenses, tax rates, and share count. Insider Monkey’s Q3 database indicates that 45 hedge funds were bullish on Carrier Global Corporation (NYSE:CARR), the same as the prior quarter. Fisher Asset Management is the leading stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.15 billion. Overall CGDV ranks 1st on our list of the best performing dividend ETFs of 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of CGDV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CGDV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Although the company’s overall volume remained flat, its organic revenue grew 2% due to higher prices. In the US, P&G saw volume growth in most categories, but Greater China struggled, particularly in hair and oral care. On the positive side, grooming and fabric & home care segments showed growth.

Title: Why Aptiv PLC (APTV) Is One of the Best Environmental Stocks to Invest in Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Environmental Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stands against the other best environmental stocks to invest in right now. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded on November 24, with a landmark agreement that sets a new collective goal for climate finance. The agreement, which aims to triple the annual finance to developing countries from the previous goal of $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035, marks a significant step forward in global efforts to combat climate change and support vulnerable nations. Furthermore, this new finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) also aims to scale up collaboration among all actors including governments, private sector entities, and international financial institutions to finance developing countries to reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2035. The progress made at COP29 builds on the global climate action achieved at previous conferences. COP27 established a historic Loss and Damage Fund, while COP28 delivered a global agreement to transition away from all fossil fuels in energy systems swiftly and fairly, tripling renewable energy and boosting climate resilience. The new finance goal at COP29 is a crucial step in ensuring that these commitments are met and that the global community remains on track to limit global warming. According to a report by McKinsey, the $300 billion annual goal for climate financing falls drastically short of the estimated $1 trillion needed annually to meet global targets. On a broader scale, McKinsey estimates that up to $9 trillion per year will be required globally by 2050 to decarbonize physical assets and transition towards a sustainable future. The report highlights that private capital is widely seen as a key enabler in bridging this financing gap. However, many investors remain cautious, not just due to a lack of funds, but due to a shortage of credible, scalable investment opportunities, execution challenges, insufficient risk management, and delays in scaling operations. The geopolitical and macroeconomic environment further complicates the sustainability landscape. Higher interest rates, inflation, and energy supply disruptions have created an environment where cost assumptions from just a few years ago no longer hold true. In light of these dynamics, McKinsey identifies three key strategies for businesses to navigate the complex investment landscape in sustainability. First, companies must reevaluate and refresh sustainability strategies as past assumptions may no longer be valid, and companies must take a pragmatic approach to align their strategies with current realities. Second, businesses must accelerate climate technology industrialization. While renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in cost competitiveness, other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and precision fermentation, require further industrialization. Third, companies must address execution risks, streamline supply chains, and ensure they have experienced teams capable of managing large-scale sustainable projects. The report concluded by emphasizing that companies who will act decisively, embrace innovative financing mechanisms, and prioritize operational excellence will not only contribute to global sustainability goals but also position themselves for future growth in an evolving economic landscape. The journey towards a sustainable future requires collaboration, innovation, and accountability across all sectors. While the challenges are significant, the opportunities for growth, resilience, and value creation are even greater. To compile our list of the 10 best environmental stocks to invest in right now, we used environmental ETFs plus online rankings to compile an initial list of 20 environment-friendly companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Environmental Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:SFM) stands against the other best environmental stocks to invest in right now. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded on November 24, with a landmark agreement that sets a new collective goal for climate finance. The agreement, which aims to triple the annual finance to developing countries from the previous goal of $100 billion to $300 billion by 2035, marks a significant step forward in global efforts to combat climate change and support vulnerable nations. Furthermore, this new finance goal, known as the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) also aims to scale up collaboration among all actors including governments, private sector entities, and international financial institutions to finance developing countries to reach $1.3 trillion annually by 2035. The progress made at COP29 builds on the global climate action achieved at previous conferences. COP27 established a historic Loss and Damage Fund, while COP28 delivered a global agreement to transition away from all fossil fuels in energy systems swiftly and fairly, tripling renewable energy and boosting climate resilience. The new finance goal at COP29 is a crucial step in ensuring that these commitments are met and that the global community remains on track to limit global warming. According to a report by McKinsey, the $300 billion annual goal for climate financing falls drastically short of the estimated $1 trillion needed annually to meet global targets. On a broader scale, McKinsey estimates that up to $9 trillion per year will be required globally by 2050 to decarbonize physical assets and transition towards a sustainable future. The report highlights that private capital is widely seen as a key enabler in bridging this financing gap. However, many investors remain cautious, not just due to a lack of funds, but due to a shortage of credible, scalable investment opportunities, execution challenges, insufficient risk management, and delays in scaling operations. The geopolitical and macroeconomic environment further complicates the sustainability landscape. Higher interest rates, inflation, and energy supply disruptions have created an environment where cost assumptions from just a few years ago no longer hold true. In light of these dynamics, McKinsey identifies three key strategies for businesses to navigate the complex investment landscape in sustainability. First, companies must reevaluate and refresh sustainability strategies as past assumptions may no longer be valid, and companies must take a pragmatic approach to align their strategies with current realities. Second, businesses must accelerate climate technology industrialization. While renewable energy technologies have made significant progress in cost competitiveness, other emerging technologies, such as hydrogen, long-duration energy storage, and precision fermentation, require further industrialization. Third, companies must address execution risks, streamline supply chains, and ensure they have experienced teams capable of managing large-scale sustainable projects. The report concluded by emphasizing that companies who will act decisively, embrace innovative financing mechanisms, and prioritize operational excellence will not only contribute to global sustainability goals but also position themselves for future growth in an evolving economic landscape. The journey towards a sustainable future requires collaboration, innovation, and accountability across all sectors. While the challenges are significant, the opportunities for growth, resilience, and value creation are even greater. A bright, colorful display of fresh produce in a grocery store.

Title: 2024 The Year Of Crypto: From Bitcoin ETFs To Memecoins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/lawrencewintermeyer/2024/12/31/2024-the-year-of-crypto-from-bitcoin-etfs-to-memecoins/

Cryptocurrency on trading app, Bitcoin BTC with altcoin digital coin crypto currency, BNB, Ethereum, ... [+] Dogecoin, Cardano, defi p2p decentralized fintech market As the best year in crypto’s history comes to a close, it’s worth looking back at how it went and where it leaves us for 2025. BTC led the show this year. It began with the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving spot bitcoin ETFs from Blackrock, Fidelity, and other top institutions. Then the fourth Bitcoin Halving happened in April. Options contracts went on spot bitcoin ETFs, catalyzing mass adoption. American and Russian lawmakers proposed strategic bitcoin reserves, and then, the big milestone, bitcoin crossed the much-awaited $100,000 mark in early December. But 2024 wasn’t only about Bitcoin’s success. It was also about key infrastructural upgrades and cutting-edge innovations across Layer-2s, Real-World Assets (RWAs), and Crypto AI. Stablecoins, the the killer app in digital assets delivering the fiat on and off ramps to Web3.0 exploded in 2024 with a number of new issuers and a market cap of over $200 billion, and memecoins had a great run this year, garnering much interest from retail users and investors. Both retail and institutional interest led to holistic industry growth in 2024, driving new use cases and solving for real-world problems. Bitcoin ETFs have reached a market cap of over $132 billion, with more than $10 billion inflows since Donald Trump won the American presidential election. 2024 was also about the winds of political change and a new pro-crypto administration in the U.S. The appointment of former PayPal exec David Sacks as AI and crypto czar, and the appointment of former college football player and Republican congressional candidate Bo Hines to the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, chaired by Sacks, is helping 2025 to take shape rapidly. Add Paul Atkins who will become the new SEC Chair role, replacing Gary Gensler who will resign on January 20th, and the anticipated appointment of Brian Quintenz, a16z exec and the crypto policy right hand of former CFTC Commissioner Chris Giancarlo, crypto dad and uber crypto policy czar - the team that delivered the bitcoin future market, and it looks as if the U.S. is positioning to dominate crypto, globally. Ryan Chow, co-founder and ceo of Solv Protocol, says, “The approval of bitcoin ETFs has legitimized the asset class as an institutional grade investment. Besides the incoming liquidity and positive price activity, bitcoin ETFs have increased BTC’s popularity. It’s not surprising that Bitcoin DeFi has attracted more than $3 billion in TVL, despite its nascency.” Alongside bitcoin, AI emerged as a leading narrative, dominating crypto mindshare with an all-time high of 48 percent by November. Currently, the crypto-AI sector has a market cap of over $34 billion with a strong growth potential. Tiancheng Xie, co-founder and cto of Polyhedra Network, explained, “AI’s biggest challenges revolve around trust, transparency, and accountability, by utilizing blockchain in-particular zero knowledge proofs we can ensure verifiable data, fair contributor compensation, and a trustless builder ecosystem, which in-turn creates scalable innovation in a more trusted environment.” According to a16z’s Builder Energy dashboard as well, crypto developers are heavily focussing on AI with over 34 percent of projects using AI in 2024. The dashboard also shows building blockchain infrastructure is the second most popular category this year with over 19 percent builder activity. According to a16z’s Builder Energy dashboard as well, crypto developers are heavily focussing on AI with over 34 percent of projects using AI in 2024. The dashboard also shows building blockchain infrastructure is the second most popular category this year with over 19 percent builder activity. Ben Wynn, cmo at House of ZK, echoed how infrastructure developments have been a major focus for the industry to increase overall capacity, saying, "Blockchain development continues to grow significantly, with over 23,000 monthly active developers globally in 2024 - a roughly 40 percent annual increase since 2015 - and ZK is growing even faster, with over a 50 percent annual growth over the past four years. ZK deployments have surged from 40 in 2020 to approximately 640 in 2024 - a 16x increase - reflecting its transition from mostly theoretical to more practical use, and it's becoming widely recognized as the foundation for solving the pressing challenges of scalability, privacy, interoperability, and more. "Its potential to transform every facet of blockchain is clear and, with adoption quickly accelerating, we expect developer activity in ZK to grow exponentially in the coming years" Overall, infrastructural improvements on the back-end are having a big positive effect in onboarding new users to crypto. In September 2024, a record-breaking 220 million wallet addresses interacted with a blockchain at least once, the highest ever in crypto’s history. On average, there are 30-60 million monthly active crypto users currently, or around 5-10 percent of the 617 million global crypto owners. The surge in on-chain interactions has been primarily driven by Solana, NEAR, and Base. Interestingly, Solana and Base also lead the list of chains in builder interest. Meanwhile Base, with a 10.7 percent builder interest, has some of the most popular memecoin projects like Brett and Goose.run driving user adoption. Memecoins are now a $130 billion industry, despite all the controversies surrounding this asset class. Many analysts consider the sudden rise of memecoins in 2024 as a speculative fad and aberration, with others considering it the epitome of digital culture and successfully leveraging speculation as a use case. As Riva Tez of LayerZero Labs said at Consensys 2024, memes have helped crypto win the "narrative war". Likewise, Momin Saqib, Brett ambassador, emphasized the memecoin narrative while noting, “Memecoins capture the spirit of the internet—playful, inclusive, and dynamic while their communities provide a rare sense of belonging in a day and age where loneliness is an epidemic in modern society. Brett for me stands out as a beacon of connection—uniting people through humor, vibrant communities, and shared experiences. It has become a movement that transforms digital engagement into joy, purpose, and inclusivity, all while driving real-world impact through its inspiring charitable initiatives in water and education.” Besides community formation, Ryan, core contributor of Goose.run, explained how memecoins create novel wealth-generating opportunities saying, “By monetizing meme’s virality, memecoins have shown how speculation can be a utility in itself. If memecoins, however, stay isolated in speculative trading, they’ll miss out on enormous untapped liquidity. It’s important to create a sub-sector of Meme Finance (MemeFi) to leverage memecoins in DeFi to maximize their use cases.” Despite not being blue chip assets, memecoins are the second-most popular category dominating market narrative mindshare. Drew Cohen, marketing lead of GME on Ethereum, considers the spectacular success of memecoins as a revolt against VC-backed coins. Cohen explains, “Retail investors don’t have free and fair entry points for VC-backed tokens because the coins already have high valuations at launch. Memecoins create an equitable opportunity for everyone that challenges the VCs as gatekeepers of crypto finance. Thus, memecoins give power back to the masses.” Hatu Sheikh of Ape Terminal, also emphasizes the importance of retail investors in the crypto economy saying, “No industry can flourish until the general public invests in your projects. After all, institutional investors can only do so much. Protocols need to have a strong and diverse user base who will invest and become your most vocal marketing support in the long run.” As 2024 draws to a close, we see a simultaneous rise in bitcoin, infrastructure investment, institutional liquidity, and memecoings. Perhaps for the first time in fifteen years, there’s no one winner - in 2024, everyone's a winner - this time, it is appears very different. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: The businesses that didn't make it through 2024

SPQR closed its doors in July. Photo: RNZ / Melanie Earley It's been a tough year for businesses around the country. In November, company liquidations were up 27 percent year-on-year, according to Centrix. Businesses large and small suffered - and even some big names did not make it. Here are some of the prominent businesses that did not survive 2024. Aucklanders were shocked in July when Ponsonby favourite SPQR closed its doors. The restaurant opened in 1992. "The hospitality industry is struggling and has been since the Covid-19 pandemic. Globally, it's hard out there for people and when the dollar is tight, this sector suffers," liquidator Stephen Lawrence told RNZ at the time. The fallout from SolarZero's liquidation continues. Owned by international asset manager BlackRock, SolarZero provided leased solar energy systems to about 15,000 houses around New Zealand. But it was placed into liquidation because the business was not sustainable, BlackRock said. The problem for the government is that the NZ Green investment Fund had set up a taxpayer-funded lending facility of $145m for SolarZero, of which it said about $115m had been drawn down. Maketū Pies went into liquidation, but was saved by new owners. Photo: Laura Smith There was some good news in this story for pie lovers. Maketū Pies went into liquidation in November after years of losses, but was saved by new owners. Privately owned catering business Montana Group took over the 42-year-old brand and its about 20 employees in early December. Organic and wholefoods grocer Huckleberry went into liquidation in the middle of the year. In their report, liquidators said the failure was driven by a downturn in customer numbers and spending, as well as a reduction in turnover. "The result of this was he revenue was no longer able to sustain the company's outgoings or expenses." Ezibuy hit trouble again this year. Its parent company, Mosaic Brands, appointed administrators. Its other brands, such as Katies and Millers, were also affected. Mosaic told the ASX that a "small number of stakeholders" did not support its proposals for restructure, or negotiating a commercial outcome, and Mosaic could not reach an acceptable resolution with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over proceedings relating to the late or non-delivery of goods during the pandemic. Last year, voluntary administrators were appointed to Ezibuy, which owed more than $100 million to creditors. At the time, Mosaic said its significant decline in sales through 2022 was at odds with the rest of the business. But Mosaic bought it back earlier this year, planning a simplified online-only operation. Wellington co-working space Digital Nomad did not make it until the end of the year, either. Liquidators said the main reason was that it was too difficult to maintain a sustainable level of tenants and revenue to make the operation profitable. "The working landscape has been changing in Wellington for the last few years since Covid-19 and the shift to working from home has made it particularly challenging to secure tenants." Auckland-based plumbing supplies business Franklins went into liquidation. It had been owned by the Smith family for 69 years. But it said the "changing landscape of the building industry and the current state of the economy" had led the director to make the decision to shut the business. Economist Shamubeel Eaqub said he hoped the year ahead would be an easier one. "But business failures is a lagging indicator. Many businesses that limp through the recession are not in good shape for the recovery, so there will be a tail of businesses which will continue to fail for the next year or so. "But many other businesses will benefit from a cyclical recovery. The key risks are when the economic recovery takes hold: two headwinds from sharply slowing net migration and prospect of more intense fiscal austerity. "Both could delay the positive effects of lower interest rates and returning hope among consumers and businesses.

Copyright © 2024, Radio New Zealand Chris Rupe has thanked Aucklanders for their 27 years of patronage and urged them to support other locally owned hospitality businesses.

Title: Here’s Why Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM) Is One of the Best Performing Dividend ETFs in 2024

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM) stands against the other dividend ETFs. By the end of 2023, the global ETF market had reached $11.1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and expanded to include 9,149 funds. This growth was driven by several milestones and the diversification of ETF offerings, which now cover equity, fixed income, active management, and alternative strategies. Despite unpredictable factors such as the rise of AI or policy changes, ETFs continue to be a vital investment tool. According to State Street Global Advisors, although only 45% of individual investors in the US use ETFs, nearly 70% of financial advisors and 67% of institutional investors recommend or use them frequently. However, ETFs still make up only 11.25% of the total global investable assets, suggesting there is significant potential for further growth. Interest in ETFs is rising, particularly among retail investors, with 63% of US investors planning to purchase ETFs in 2024, a sharp increase from 37% during 2022. Active ETFs are experiencing considerable growth, with global inflows hitting a record $166 billion in 2023 and continuing to rise in 2024. Much of this growth is driven by fixed income and alternative investments, while AI-related ETFs, especially in robotics and semiconductors, are attracting large amounts of investment. These trends reflect the growing demand for ETFs as investors seek more flexible and efficient ways to respond to market changes. A Reuters report from October 2024 highlighted that US ETFs focused on dividend-paying stocks have experienced a significant increase in inflows since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle the prior month. In September, 135 US dividend ETFs tracked by Morningstar saw $3.05 billion in inflows, far higher than the average $424 million per month in the first eight months of 2024. However, this trend may slow as US Treasury yields have risen recently, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting a two-month high following strong employment data that suggests the economy is resilient and may not need further large rate cuts. Dividend ETFs tend to offer stable payouts and potential for growth, addressing challenges regarding unpredictable yields and limited principal growth. However, high-dividend ETFs vary in stability. Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the year-to-date (YTD) share price performance of each ETF as of December 30, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Invest in Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stands against the other logistics stocks. Logistics companies transporting goods around the world continue to navigate uncertainty as Donald Trump plans to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. As reported by CNBC, Dave Bozeman, the new CEO of C.H. Robinson, sees an opportunity in Trump tariffs. The logistics giant is a top 3 carrier on the China-U.S. freight lane also carrying nearly 10% of the freight on the US-Mexico lane. Citi transportation analyst Ari Rosa considers the company’s business diversified enough to work through tariffs despite its global forwarding business being very exposed to China. The CEO’s stance on the tariffs was quite positive as well, as he stated: “The freight still has to move. It might just move at a different starting point, and we would still be there to move that.” In an interview with CNBC, Ravi Jakhar of the firm Allcargo Group, the world’s LCL consolidation leader and India’s largest integrated logistics solutions provider, reiterated optimism regarding the Trump tariff risks. He mentioned how over 4 years ago when sanctions came in from the Trump administration, the firm saw an increased import into its Vietnam offices from China and improved export out of Vietnam, alongside increased momentum in Indonesia and the Philippines. In his opinion, whether it is a short-term tariff sanction or a long-term structural trend, trade flows could change in terms of origins and destinations but the overall trade flows would remain robust as long as manufacturing and consumption are there. As of what’s recent in the logistics landscape, the holiday season is in full swing, with holiday surcharges playing a crucial role in profitability for logistics companies since they charge their big retail customers extra fees on a per-package basis compared to their June volume during the busy holiday season. The increase in e-commerce is also benefitting such logistics providers and full truckload carriers. Simultaneously, an increase in freight in anticipation of future tariffs is also being seen. A survey from Merchants Fleet and Atomik Research of decision-makers in organizations that typically transport freights of consumer-packaged goods throughout the US revealed that 88% saw AI as useful in alleviating pressures on their fleets this peak delivery season. AI’s data-driven capabilities are to streamline operations and decision-making, with the majority of the respondents citing supply chain optimization as a primary benefit. Other advantages mentioned were improved route optimization, enhanced inventory management, and reduced downtime by identifying maintenance issues with fleet vehicles. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now, we went through stock screeners, ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 11 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024.

The company is uniquely positioned as it serves many of the fastest-growing population centers in the United States while operating from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways and seamlessly connecting with Canada's rail systems. It is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has already laid the foundation for its success as it posted year-over-year improvements for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2024, in reportable injury rates, freight car velocity, and locomotive productivity among other major metrics. Recently, the company closed 2024’s third quarter, demonstrating strategic success. Improved safety and service performance drove solid revenue growth which translated into third-quarter earnings per diluted share up 10% and operating income up 11%. Hence, the firm is positioned well to lead in safety, service, and operational excellence. Overall UNP ranks 1st on our list of the best logistics stocks to invest in right now.

Title: The Vanguard-FDIC Agreement On Passive Investing And Bank Ownership

Banks In a landmark development last week, Vanguard, one of the world’s largest asset managers with nearly $9 trillion assets under management, agreed to new terms with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to clarify its role as a passive investor in U.S. banks. This decision, while important for Vanguard, may have broader implications for asset managers, the banking sector, and financial regulation. FDIC’s Push for Accountability The prominence of index fund managers like Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street, collectively overseeing more than $23 trillion in assets, has grown significantly over the past decades. These firms often hold substantial stakes in public companies, including banks, through their passive investment strategies. By mimicking indices such as the S&P 500, they have amassed considerable influence without actively managing or directing company operations​​. Historically, the regulatory framework has allowed asset managers to bypass stringent shareholder banking regulations, provided the asset managers do not influence management decisions. However, concerns have mounted the last few years about whether “self-certification” by these asset managers genuinely supported maintenance of their passive roles. With stakes exceeding 10 percent in many banks, questions arose about potential conflicts of interest and undue influence over critical financial institutions. Notably, FDIC board members, including Jonathan McKernan and Rohit Chopra, argued for more rigorous oversight. They highlighted the risks of concentrated ownership in a few hands and the implications for competitive fairness and economic stability​​. The FDIC began revising its approach in mid-2024, proposing tighter controls on investment firms crossing the 10 percent ownership threshold. Focusses included enhanced disclosure requirements and greater scrutiny of informal interactions between asset managers and bank executives​​. Vanguard’s Landmark Agreement On December 27, 2024, Vanguard finalized an agreement with the FDIC, addressing these regulatory concerns. Key provisions include: Implications for the Industry and Regulation This agreement signals a turning point in how passive investment giants operate within regulated sectors. By setting a precedent with Vanguard, the FDIC may ask other firms, notably BlackRock and State Street, to adopt similar agreements. Such measures aim to balance the benefits of passive investing—like broad market access and lower costs for investors—with the need for transparency and accountability in sensitive sectors like banking​​. Critics argue that increased regulatory oversight might discourage investments in banks, potentially harming the sector’s growth. Industry representatives contend that the FDIC’s actions lack a clear demonstration of harm, raising concerns about regulatory overreach​​. Conclusion Vanguard’s deal with the FDIC underscores the evolving relationship between regulators and financial powerhouses holding significant bank shares. The action could reshape the landscape of passive investing and its interplay with accountability and regulatory oversight. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Bitcoin Traders Monitor Key Technical Levels Including $100,000

Bitcoin traders are watching several technical levels. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin traders who leverage technical analysis have been monitoring important levels of support and resistance, singling out $100,000 in particular as being psychologically significant. The world’s most prominent digital currency appears to be following a downward trend since reaching an all-time high of more than $108,000 on December 17, Coinbase data from TradingView reveals. On Monday, December 30, the cryptocurrency fell below $91,500, reaching its lowest level since late November, additional Coinbase figures show. In spite of this recent price activity, bitcoin is still in a strong, upward trend that has propelled it to multiple fresh, all-time highs over the last several months. Several analysts have noted this strong performance, including the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O. The market observer emphasized such developments in emailed comments, stating that “We are still in a crypto bull market, even though it feels a bit different than previous cycles and we will see a lot of bullish price action in the crypto markets, primarily with Bitcoin.” “Closing 2024 Bitcoin is currently in a downtrend on the daily chart since hitting all-time high of $108,000 on 12/17/2024,” she noted. “I’m personally watching psychological levels like $100,000 and $90,000. These areas are important as most are not trading full-time and passive investors,” Wendy O clarified. “Those numbers spark excitement.” “When we look at $100,000 as resistance, it seems to be an area the masses may see as a good value to sell, and that could also be why we have been in a downtrend since hitting all-time high of $108,000,” she stated. Further, the analyst emphasized the strong institutional demand stemming from both BlackRock and MicroStrategy, and noted that as countries grow increasingly interested in using bitcoin as a strategic reserve, the digital asset’s price could easily push higher. Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, also weighed in, highlighting several technical levels. “On the downside, support could emerge around the $85,000–$86,000 zone, followed by the $80,000 level, and deeper at $75,000 if the market continues to decline,” he noted via emailed comments. “On the upside, resistance is likely to be encountered near $95,000–$96,000, with the $100,000 mark acting as a significant psychological barrier,” said DiPasquale. “If Bitcoin manages to break above $100,000, the $105,000 area could become the next key resistance level,” he pointed out. “Traders should also monitor volume around these levels to gauge the strength of any price action, while broader macroeconomic factors and sentiment will play a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s medium-to-long-term direction,” the analyst emphasized. Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, offered a different point of view. “Bitcoin has been truly range-bound, while showing more action to the downside, since December 20, three days after the most recent ATH,” he stated via email. “Counting today, it’s bounced off the $92k area three times. That level is also the bottom of a channel which started in November 2022, which has provided major support in the past (although not without fail),” said Enneking. “If $90k breaks, and the odds are about even that it will, there is some support of $88k, but the next bottom will probably be lower (although almost certainly still with an ‘8’ handle),” he stated. “By the time that plays out, inauguration euphoria will probably kick in with Bitcoiners licking their chops at the prospect of a pro-crypto administration and BTC turning into a reserve asset (N.B. Not a reserve currency) – and BTC will be primed for the next ATH,” Enneking predicted. Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL. One Community. Many Voices.

The Nasdaq had reached 4000, a nearly sixfold increase in seven years. Unemployment in the world’s largest economy had shrunk to 3 per cent, the lowest in more than a generation. Having borne the burden of the Cold War, the American people were reaping the peace dividend. Xi Jinping, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin all seek radical change to the current world order.Credit: AP In other countries, the news was equally bright. The Europeans had introduced both a single market and a single currency and were well on their way to becoming a “United States of Europe”. The once-mighty communist international had dwindled to Cuba, North Korea and a few university departments. World trade in manufactured goods had doubled in the 1990s and would double again in the 2000s. Global poverty was receding faster than ever. A quarter of a century later, the mood could not be more different. A sizeable majority of the global population – three in five people – believe the world is getting worse. This is as true in traditionally optimistic America (which has just elected an irascible 78-year-old to succeed a faltering 82-year-old) as it is in stagnating Europe. The world’s second-biggest economy, China, is run by a proud Marxist-Leninist, Xi Jinping, whose achievements include removing limits on his time in power. The world’s most populous country, India, is in the hands of an illiberal strongman, Narendra Modi. China and Russia have built an axis of authoritarian states that are determined to push back against Western liberalism. Vladimir Putin’s “war on the West” has involved not just the invasion of Crimea and Ukraine and the dispatching of private militia across Africa, but numerous sorties, by plane and submarine, into Western territory. Xi has declared that any foreign power that tries to “bully, oppress, or enslave us” will “be battered and blooded from colliding with a great wall of steel forged by more than 1.4 billion Chinese people using flesh and blood”. In the 1990s, we looked forward to a world of entrepreneurial vigour, public sector discipline and spreading peace. Optimists might point out that the first quarter of the 21st century has been better than the first quarter of the 20th, when the Great War took the lives of 15 million people and provided the material for both communism and fascism, not to mention World War II. But the contrast with the optimism of the 1990s is nevertheless astonishing. And worse is almost certain to come. Some security officials believe we are engaged in an undeclared war with the “axis of autocracy”. Donald Trump, elected with a clear majority, has hinted he will pursue a policy of America First and may well destroy the institutions that undergirded postwar security. The EU is in a state of paralysis, with the leaders of the two most powerful countries, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz, discredited and their economies stagnant. And tens of millions of people are likely to flee Africa and Latin America in coming years, driven by a combination of economic stagnation, political fragility and climate change, empowering the far right and undermining the stability of the West. As for the miracle of technology, one survey of AI researchers discovered that 48 per cent thought there was at least a 10 per cent chance that its impact would be “extremely bad”, that is, lead to human extinction. What has gone wrong with the 21st century? Let’s start by acknowledging that there have been successes. We have created an entire virtual world. Today, more than half the world’s population has some sort of internet access, and there are about as many mobile phones in the world as people – 8 billion-plus. This has ushered in a world of information and entertainment that never existed. There are more than a billion fewer people living on less than $US2.25 a day than there were in 2000, thanks to catch-up growth in developing countries. In 2012-13, the global poverty headcount fell by 130 million people, marking it as one of the most remarkable years in history. In December 2020, China declared it had eliminated extreme poverty completely. Yet even these positives contain negatives. The information revolution has undermined the business models of “old media” companies that put a premium on checking facts while, at the same time, empowering rumourmongers who depend on polarisation and misinformation. There has been no significant impact in reducing global poverty in the decade since 2015.Credit: Getty Images The spread of smartphones has coincided with the spread of psychological problems, particularly among the young. The war against poverty is going into reverse. In China, economic growth has slowed to a crawl. In Latin America and Africa, poverty rates are again rising, thanks to economic stagnation, political instability and rapid population growth. In all, the number of people living in absolute poverty has barely declined since 2015. The West has made a succession of policy errors that both weakened its elites and emboldened its autocratic critics. George W. Bush invaded Iraq based on false information and then bungled the occupation. Angela Merkel, Germany’s powerful chancellor from 2005 to 2021, failed to address her country’s two biggest weaknesses: its dependence on Russian energy supplies and its failure to invest in its own defences. In the UK, David Cameron dealt with a feud within the Conservative Party by holding a popular referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, plunging the country into chaos and reducing its economic growth rate. The world has also lived through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, which deepened the growing sense of economic injustice and paved the way for the rise of populism. The problem lies with more than just a handful of policy mistakes. It lies with the broader development of the global economy-cum-polity. In the 1990s, we looked forward to a world of entrepreneurial vigour, public sector discipline and spreading peace. What we got was the very opposite: oligopoly, government splurge and militarised blocs. The consolidation of capitalism is most advanced in the US, the leading economic power, and in tech and finance, suggesting that oligopoly is the way of the future. Five tech companies are each worth more than $US1 trillion ($1.6 trillion), and one, Apple, is worth more than $US3 trillion. Three big investment houses, BlackRock, the Vanguard Group and State Street, collectively manage around $US22 trillion in assets. Over the past two decades, industries have grown more concentrated. This may be the result of excellence: Google and Apple are superbly run, and Microsoft is undergoing a renaissance after a period in the doldrums. But would anyone argue that America’s airline industry is a model of innovation and customer service? The success of the superstar companies slows the rate of innovation and thwarts competition; the success of second-rate companies contributes to a general sense of frustration. It’s notable that the world’s first great age of populism, before World War I, coincided with the rise of giant companies, particularly in the US and Germany. Bill Clinton’s pronouncement in 1996 that the era of big government was “over” has proved hollow.Credit: AP Meanwhile, Clinton’s pronouncement in another State of the Union Address, in 1996, that the era of big government was “over” has proved hollow. Americans tax themselves like a small-government country but behave like a big-government one. The US deficit is roughly 6 per cent of GDP, twice the average of recent decades and the US government stepped in to save failing companies such as Citigroup and General Motors in 2008. The situation is worse in the EU, where government sprawl is not balanced by economic vigour. European countries spend beyond their means on welfare while the bureaucracy in Brussels prides itself on its role as “regulatory giant” rather than its ability to ignite growth. Putin put paid to talk of the “peace dividend” with his invasion of Crimea in 2014 and Ukraine in 2022. But, in truth, the most serious threat to the global order comes from China, which has an economy 10 times the size of Russia and a much more disciplined leadership. From its admission into the World Trade Organisation in 2000, but gathering pace with the rise of Xi to the top job in 2013, China poured a portion of the “globalisation dividend” into building up its military might. China’s navy is the biggest in the world, and its nuclear arsenal may reach 1000 warheads by 2030, according to the US Department of Defence. It is also roaring ahead in tech. China has overtaken the West in hypersonic missiles – those capable of travelling at five times the speed of sound and evading air defences – and is pioneering lasers, orbiting space robots and high-altitude balloons. What are the chances that the next 25 years will be better than the last? The 21st century has seen the two most compelling ideologies of the 1990s malfunction horrendously. These are neoliberalism, the belief that, overall, markets are more efficient than governments in organising economic life, and neo-conservatism, what started as a corrective to the left’s overconfidence in the power of the state to fix everything. The great danger in coming years is that we will see the further decline of a third ideology: liberalism. Across the West, liberal leaders are flailing. Kamala Harris decisively lost to a candidate who has broken one of the most important liberal rules: giving up power graciously when you lose an election. The two most flamboyant liberal politicians of the past decade – Macron in France and Justin Trudeau in Canada – are flailing. Keir Starmer won a landslide election victory in the UK on the promise of reviving the pragmatic centre only to make a mess of governing. Liberal elites have prepared the way for a populist backlash by a combination of commission and omission. They have fixated on cultural issues such as pronouns at a time when regular people are suffering from stagnant living standards. They have betrayed the principle of race-blind meritocracy by embracing race-conscious policies. And they have paid too little attention to growing worries about immigration even as expanding populations put pressure on housing and public services. The result has been to cede ground to populists such as Trump, Nigel Farage in Britain and Marine Le Pen in France. Which future we choose depends, above all, on whether liberals can once again revitalise their beliefs. There are some reasons for optimism about the future. The AI revolution has the potential to cut administrative costs while giving everyone the equivalent of a smart assistant. The collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria is a serious setback for the “axis of autocracy”, reducing Russia’s influence in the Middle East and suggesting that even the most vicious dictators can be overthrown. The Republicans’ triumph in 2024 could prove self-correcting, creating opportunities for a new generation of middle-of-the-road Democrats. Yet all this potential could go the other way. AI may destroy the jobs of millions of knowledge workers, creating a radicalised middle class, while handing more power to a few tech giants. A newly liberated Syria may break up into warring territories or fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. Trump and his allies may well destroy the rules-based international order that has largely kept the peace since 1945. An intriguing study of 120 years of populist governments suggests that the most common reaction to the failure of populism is for voters to demand yet more populism. Which future we choose depends, above all, on whether liberals can once again revitalise their beliefs or whether they will continue to drift and dither. Can they address the causes of populism, or will they continue to repeat empty phrases? Can they think like regular people, or will they continue to act like members of a global elite? Can they adapt classic liberal ideas about open competition and freedom of speech to radically new circumstances? What happens this next quarter-century depends on how well we answer these questions.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Logistics Stocks to Invest in Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) stands against the other logistics stocks. Logistics companies transporting goods around the world continue to navigate uncertainty as Donald Trump plans to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada. As reported by CNBC, Dave Bozeman, the new CEO of C.H. Robinson, sees an opportunity in Trump tariffs. The logistics giant is a top 3 carrier on the China-U.S. freight lane also carrying nearly 10% of the freight on the US-Mexico lane. Citi transportation analyst Ari Rosa considers the company’s business diversified enough to work through tariffs despite its global forwarding business being very exposed to China. The CEO’s stance on the tariffs was quite positive as well, as he stated: “The freight still has to move. It might just move at a different starting point, and we would still be there to move that.” In an interview with CNBC, Ravi Jakhar of the firm Allcargo Group, the world’s LCL consolidation leader and India’s largest integrated logistics solutions provider, reiterated optimism regarding the Trump tariff risks. He mentioned how over 4 years ago when sanctions came in from the Trump administration, the firm saw an increased import into its Vietnam offices from China and improved export out of Vietnam, alongside increased momentum in Indonesia and the Philippines. In his opinion, whether it is a short-term tariff sanction or a long-term structural trend, trade flows could change in terms of origins and destinations but the overall trade flows would remain robust as long as manufacturing and consumption are there. As of what’s recent in the logistics landscape, the holiday season is in full swing, with holiday surcharges playing a crucial role in profitability for logistics companies since they charge their big retail customers extra fees on a per-package basis compared to their June volume during the busy holiday season. The increase in e-commerce is also benefitting such logistics providers and full truckload carriers. Simultaneously, an increase in freight in anticipation of future tariffs is also being seen. A survey from Merchants Fleet and Atomik Research of decision-makers in organizations that typically transport freights of consumer-packaged goods throughout the US revealed that 88% saw AI as useful in alleviating pressures on their fleets this peak delivery season. AI’s data-driven capabilities are to streamline operations and decision-making, with the majority of the respondents citing supply chain optimization as a primary benefit. Other advantages mentioned were improved route optimization, enhanced inventory management, and reduced downtime by identifying maintenance issues with fleet vehicles. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now, we went through stock screeners, ETFs, and media reports to make a list of relevant stocks. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 11 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 11 best logistics stocks to invest in right now have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024.
