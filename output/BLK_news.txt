It's looking like the AI hype will continue for a third consecutive year. The technology has polarized investors and market experts across Wall Street, with some believing it'll completely transform the economy and others believing it's creating a stock-market bubble ripe for popping. Regardless of what you think about AI, it's had an undeniable impact on the market. Hardware, Big Tech, anything data-center-related — investors who bet on these areas of the market this year reaped handsome rewards. But technology advances fast, and today's AI playbook may very well become outdated in the new year. Business Insider compiled views from four Wall Street firms to see what some of the most influential financial institutions think about the future of AI. Here's what Wall Street is predicting about the technology and how you can update your portfolio. If there's one thing that AI proponents and naysayers can agree on, it's that the technology is expensive to produce. Building data centers, stocking up on GPUs, powering AI — all of that doesn't come cheap. In 2024, Big Tech companies poured mind-boggling amounts of capital into building out AI infrastructure. By the end of the year, it's likely that Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft will have spent $222 billion on AI capital expenditures, which is a 50% increase from last year, according to UBS. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, according to some Wall Street firms. According to BlackRock's 2025 outlook, "major tech companies are starting to rival the U.S. government on research and development spending." "We estimate spending on this infrastructure could top $700 billion by 2030, equivalent to 2% of U.S. GDP," the asset manager added. Expect continued investment in data centers, chips, and power systems as AI models become more complex. That means investors who bought into the picks and shovels AI trade in 2024 should stay invested, UBS argues. Going into next year, the bank recommends looking into utilities, as the electricity providers fueling AI data centers are seeing a steady uptick in demand. Examples of utilities funds include the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) and the Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF (FUTY). AI investing in 2024 was largely defined by what Goldman Sachs calls the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trades of AI infrastructure. Investors flocked to Nvidia, the superstar Phase 1 stock, as well as the Phase 2 AI picks and shovels, including data centers and other semiconductor companies. While those trades are clearly still hot, there'll be new opportunities to invest in AI as more use cases emerge, many on Wall Street believe. 2025 will see a widening field of investment opportunities, particularly in so-called Phase 3 companies that are monetizing AI and using it to boost their revenue streams, Goldman Sachs says. The bank has identified 11 stocks that are using AI to increase their revenues, per their last quarterly earnings calls. They include ACV Auctions, Commvault Systems, Cloudflare, Datadog, DigitalOcean, Dynatrace, Fortinet, Gartner, Hubspot, Mastercard, and ServiceNow. UBS also highlights a few areas of the market in particular for investors to keep an eye out for in the coming years. "We expect successful generative AI applications across a range of industries, including in health care, cybersecurity, and fintech," UBS said. US stocks have outperformed global markets in 2024 thanks in large part to AI. The large sums being spent on AI are paying off for US companies. According to Apollo, the US has more data centers than all other major countries combined, giving it a significant advantage in the industry. "The US is experiencing a surge in corporate and research spending on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution—a dynamic not seen in other developing nations or even China," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo, wrote in the firm's 2025 outlook. Robust AI investment may be part of the reason why the overall US economy has performed so well. "The federal government's investments in green energy and infrastructure, along with private sector investments in AI, have been crucial to the nation's economic resilience," Sløk added. The boom in construction from building AI infrastructure, as well as the ongoing energy transition to power data centers, is a powerful tailwind for the US economy and the AI trade going into 2025. For that reason, BlackRock is betting on US equities going into 2025. "We think the AI mega force will benefit U.S. stocks more and that's why we stay overweight, particularly relative to international peers such as European stocks," the asset manager wrote in its 2025 outlook. Some examples of US-based AI funds include the Xtrackers Artificial Intelligence and Big Data ETF (XAIX) and the iShares US Technology ETF (IYW). AI could have an overlooked benefit to the stocks in your portfolio: it could lower inflation. The technology has the potential to usher in a new era of labor and productivity gains for the economy, according to BlackRock and UBS. As more companies adopt AI tools, routine tasks will be automated and new business models will be implemented. That'll lead to decreasing inflation as the supply of goods and services increases, thanks to automation. This won't be an instantaneous change, but rather one that slowly emerges over the next few years, UBS said in its 2025 outlook. That's a promising side effect of AI, especially as the Federal Reserve has battled to bring inflation down in 2024 and some economists speculate that inflation could remain elevated in the long term. "If AI's potential can be realized, we believe it could augur a productivity revolution and contribute to lower prices for various goods and services and higher rates of economic growth," UBS said. "For investors, at a macroeconomic level, we believe the AI revolution is likely to help lower inflation, boost growth, and therefore result in higher real interest rates in the years ahead," the bank added.

Title: More Reasons for Cautious Optimism About the Demise of The Green Energy Fantasy
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2024/12/25/more-reasons-for-cautious-optimism-about-the-demise-of-the-green-energy-fantasy/
Time Published: 2024-12-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the MANHATTAN CONTRARIAN Francis Menton My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances” On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel” On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New Jersey Also on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe It looks as if the green energy bandwagon may be slowing in America. However, in Europe, it’s still full steam ahead. Ed Miliband is utterly determined that Britain will be the first lemming off the edge of the cliff and will do absolutely anything to achieve this. He wouldn’t care if a million Britons froze to death in winter if his insane climate goals were achieved. Miliband is not dictator for life. The UK is still a democracy and the voters will be heard. The outcome of the Labour foolishness is predetermined – it is only a matter of time before the voters demand change. The support for Net Zero will only end in the UK when the actual electricity grid cannot support the population and randomly fails during the coldest weather. Therefore Labour/Conservative/LibDem alliance is in not danger at the moment. It’s probably going to be more problematic as Rachel from Complaints will have to raise more taxes in April at the current rate of progress. In the mean time percentage on ZE vehicles being sold rises as total sales of cars falls. That part of the plan is working well. The UK is not a functional democracy since the choices we have are limited and as many already know, the Davos Uniparty have infected our system so all the main parties are variants of socialism. But the fastest growing party Reform gives us hope as while they may have got only 5 MPs, their proportion of the vote was higher than the LimpDumbs who got the third highest number of MPs. Reform were very close to winning a lot of seats that went to Labour in the north and are close to Tory seats in the south. The local council elections in May will be a popularity poll on our Student Union government and the signs are they will get hammered. That could bring about a new leader for Labour. As for the inexperienced Rachel from Accounts/Complaints? She might be toast come the spring as the UK will be in recession with inflation rising and interest rates stuck, but more importantly government bond rates will be high and that drives the mortgage interest rates which ‘working people’ – something Labour have struggled to define – will be feeling. You are almost right. actually, all political parties are variants of socialism and this includes Reform. I see a small chink of light growing as the notion of independents takes root. This is where the future of the right lays. Eventually, we will see democracy by the people, of the people, and for the people. Aren’t lemmings closely related to ‘rats’? RATS was the last UK coal fired power station (Ratcliffe on Soar). A target of 50% “green” energy – in itself, difficult to achieve – would have reduced CO2 emissions by, errr… 50%, but zealots are never happy, for them it’s 100% or nothing – except, of course, that it never can be 100%. That’s why I doubt the sanity of people like Red Ed Miliband. The most dangerous man since that bloke in Germany some while back… Happy Christmas everyone! Actually, it is doubtful that “green energy” (whatever that is**) reduces CO2 emission much at all The US reduced its CO2 emissions by converting coal to gas. Germany and the UK have reduced their emissions by destroying their manufacturing base and sending it to China , India etc, probably increasing the overall CO2 released. ** wind and solar are the exact opposite of “green”.. Both are hugely environmentally polluting at every stage… mining , manufacture (absolutely horrendous), installation (environmentally destructive), usage (avian destruction), and final disposal in landfill , or left to rot in place. I don’t disagree, Brice, I was just arguing on the “Even if one accepts that “green” energy is desireable…” basis in order to underline Miliband’s madness in trying to get to 100%. I agree Bnice, Green and Energy do not belong together as the result is an oxymoron! The Greens have had enough say about what they want about energy, now it’s time for the rest of us ordinary people-90% to demand, cheap reliable electricity by whatever means are available, be it fossil fuels, hydro, nuclear and even solar in moderation. None of this energy business has anything to do with climate change, so people get over this non- existent fake environmental climate crisis. If we don’t get a positive response about our cheap energy requirements from responsible governments, we will vote them out sooner rather than later. First was the US then Germany and Australia will follow if they are smart enough in 2025! However, in the UK, Labour is totally delusional about energy, so the process will take longer unless the people riot or occupy the House of Commons. Just yesterday in another thread that Warren Beeton fool was trying gaslight me, claiming that steel manufacturing with electric blast furnaces was feasible. They can’t even keep the lights on now, how is uninterrupted power for molten steel possible with wind turbines? Any manufacturer trying this insanity would be quickly out-of-business. Swedish SSAB plans to be the first steel company in the world to deliver ‘fossil free steel’ to the market on a commercial scale in 2026. How successful and competitively priced it will be remains to be seen. Access to plentiful hydro electric power is probably essential. I want to see what the metallurgy reports on this hydrogen-reduced steel say. How they overcome the embrittlement problem has been mostly a hand-wave in the press releases. I am not sure I want to live on the 12th floor of a high-rise made with H2Steel. According to current data, around 70% of steel in the United States is manufactured using electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which are considered electric furnaces; this means a significant majority of American steel production relies on electric furnaces. Big River Steel In 2024, this facility in Osceola, Arkansas became the first steel plant in the world to receive ResponsibleSteel certification. ResponsibleSteel is a nonprofit that audits companies’ progress toward “net-zero steel” production. Big River Steel also gets more than 60% of its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources. THAT IS THE CLOSEST TO GREEN STEEL IN THE US. I did a Bing search on electric arc furnaces and found that these are used for recycling scrap steel. Blast furnaces are still used for smelting iron ore. Didn’t find any info on use of hydrogen for smelting iron ore. I recall reading awhile back that a pilot process for smelting iron ore with hydrogen malfunctioned, resulting in an explosion that killed a worker and injured several other workers. I doubt that Millivolt is insane, atticman. But he has a very low (and alas accurate) assessment of how well British education prepares the population for critical thinking. In plain sight, he and Sir Stalin are obliterating the ancient rights of Englishmen along with the utter replacement of Englishmen. I don’t believe that it is the accidental outcome of insanity. But indeed, happy Christmas! Turn to thoughts of hope and joy. ancient rights- maybe time for a constitution and bill of rights? nobody pitching for that? Perhaps not – we wouldn’t be $34T in debt if our Federales had actually been constrained by our Constitution. How often is it even 50% in Germany? Under ideal conditions only? At night in windy weather? If it’s only under ideal conditions- it would be useful to get the average for all the hours in a year. Even if “green energy” was to reach 50%, the CO2 “reduction” wouldn’t be anywhere close to 50%. This is because fossil fuel plants need to kept on warm standby, at a minimum, so that they can take over whenever “green energy” fails. I’ve seen no blowback from Microsoft’s announcement that they will be reopening Three Mile Island — certainly a good sign. Yes, I agree it’s a good thing. I hope Microsoft has employed some experienced “restart” experts who know what they are getting into. I have no knowledge of Three Mile Island’s current mechanical condition. However, recommissioning equipment that has sat idle, unpowered and/or unmaintained for any number of years can quickly become uneconomical. I’m not sure you just walk back in and flip on the switches. Microsoft isn’t restarting Three Mile Island, they contracted to use the electricity, if I’m not mistaken. Doesn’t someone have to restart it first? Reactor 1 was running until 2019. Thanks Bob. Those that haven’t kept up could start here: Restarting Three Mile Island: Quick Facts “Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both.” The myopic obsession with the physics of the so-called “greenhouse effect” must come to an end one way or another. And the physics of electrical power generation and hydrocarbon fuels cannot be faked. It may take a few more years for this to be fully realized, but it is from the physics of the general circulation that the claims of GHG “warming” are directly refuted. Are rising concentrations of CO2 capable of “forcing” absorbed energy to accumulate down here (i.e. “warming.”) as sensible heat gain in the land + ocean + atmosphere system? No. Energy conversion explains why not. [internal energy + potential energy] is constantly being converted to/from [kinetic energy]. Lorenz described this concept. The ERA5 reanalysis model explicitly computes it. More here. Please read the full text description of this very short time-lapse video. I will paste that full text in a reply. In my view, this is important for skeptics of the climate movement to understand. https://youtu.be/hDurP-4gVrY The text description for that video. ************ Are CO2 emissions a risk to the climate? No. The static “warming” effect of incremental CO2 (~4 W/m^2 for 2XCO2) disappears as kinetic energy (wind) is converted to/from internal energy (including temperature) + potential energy (altitude). This time lapse video shows the daily minimum, median, and maximum values of the computed “vertical integral of energy conversion” hourly parameter from the ERA5 reanalysis for 2022. Values for each 1/4 degree longitude gridpoint at 45N latitude are given. The vertical scale is from -10,000 to +10,000 W/m^2. The minor incremental radiative absorbing power of non-condensing GHGs such as CO2, CH4, and N2O vanishes on the vertical scale as the rapidly changing energy conversion in both directions is tens to thousands of times greater. So what? The assumed GHG “forcings” cannot be isolated for reliable attribution of reported surface warming. And with all the circulation and energy conversion throughout the depth of the troposphere, heat energy need not be expected to accumulate on land and in the oceans to harmful effect from incremental non-condensing GHGs. The GHGs add no energy to the land + ocean + atmosphere system. Therefore the radiative properties of CO2, CH4, and N2O, and other molecules of similar nature, should not be assumed to produce a perturbing climate “forcing.” The concept of energy conversion helps us understand the self-regulating delivery of energy to high altitude for just enough longwave radiation to be emitted to space. References: The ERA5 reanalysis model is a product of ECMWF, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The computed parameters “vertical integral of potential + internal energy” and “vertical integral of energy conversion” are described at these links. https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162061 https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162064 Further comment: This is for just one latitude band at 45N. Similar results were observed for 45S, 10N/S, 23.5N/S, and 66N/S. More Background: From Edward N. Lorenz (1960) “Energy and Numerical Weather Prediction” https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v12i4.9420 “2. Energy, available potential energy, and gross static stability Of the various forms of energy present in the atmosphere, kinetic energy has often received the most attention. Often the total kinetic energy of a weather system is regarded as a measure of its intensity. The only other forms of atmospheric energy which appear to play a major role in the kinetic energy budget of the troposphere and lower stratosphere are potential energy, internal energy, and the latent energy of water vapor. Potential and internal energy may be transformed directly into kinetic energy, while latent energy may be transformed directly into internal energy, which is then transformed into kinetic energy. It is easily shown by means of the hydrostatic approximation that the changes of the potential energy P and the internal energy l of the whole atmosphere are approximately proportional, so that it is convenient to regard potential and internal energy as constituting a single form of energy. This form has been called total potential energy by Margules (1903). … In the long run, there must be a net depletionof kinetic energy by dissipative processes. It follows that there must be an equal net generation of kinetic energy by reversible adiabatic processes; this generation must occur at the expense of total potential energy. It follows in turn that there must be an equal net generation of total potential energy by heating of all kinds. These three steps comprise the basic energy cycle of the atmosphere. The rate at which these steps proceed is a fundamental characteristic of the general circulation.” ************** Yep, as I keep saying, “There are no free lunches in physics.” I concur. It seems to me the most realistic mechanism. The uncertainty comes w the attribution equations which rely on assumed mechanisms that cannot be properly equated as in essense one cannot separate the signals as one could in a lab. That guesswork is fine as far as im concerned. The issue is w politics in regards to ‘settled science’. I understand that particular mechanism. In order to implement impactful policies you A: create a narrative of ‘settled science’ and act like a religious group w a control/ comply structure, coupled w B: a fear of Armageddon and percecution of heretics. People are fed up with woke left wing insanity. There’s some evidence that led to Trump’s election, and the Republicans taking both senate and house. Peter Zeihan points out that the voting patterns in the election weren’t typical. … it means the culture war is a big determining factor on how people vote … Folks who have enough education can convince themselves that CAGW is a serious problem, that Anthony Fauci is a hero, and that a woman can have a penis. Fortunately, the majority of voters know better. Defund the universities. This video, Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things, is worth a look. I don’t think it’s clear that Republicans have a firm grip on the Senate. Too many RINOs can still spoil the soup. And isn’t the House majority even narrower than it was before the election? True but even just a one seat majority means control of all the committees which means bad democrat legislative junk will seldom get to the floor for a vote. Why sources always brag on renewable wind and solar Capacity rather than actual production? 2023 annual World wind production 2.33 milllion GWh; wind capacity 1017.2 GW ((2,330,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1017.2)) equals actual production of 26.14% of Capacity. 2023 annual World Solar production 1.64 milllion GWh; solar capacity 1419.0 GW ((1.640,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1419.0)) equals actual production of 13.2% of Capacity. 2023 annual combined World production 3.97 milllion GWh; combined capacity 2436.2 GW ((3.970,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/2436.2)) equals actual production of 18.6% of Capacity. 2023 Wind and Solar renewable production was 18.6% of capacity and I suspect that 2024 will be some what lower. Depending on the source wind and Solar contributed 11-13.4% of total world electricity production during 2023. Forgot the sources: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-vs-installed-wind-energy-capacity https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-energy-consumption-vs-solar-pv-capacity And specifically for Germany:  Wind Energy: Around 142.1 TWh, which accounted for approximately 27% of Germany’s total electricity consumption in 2023.  Solar Energy: Approximately 59.9 TWh, which should account for roughly 11-12% of the total electricity consumption. Germany wind and solar are both grid saturated according to “The Pollack Limit” discussed at length a couple years ago here on WUWT. The Wind CF in Germany is right at 27% and Solar at 12%.Time to give it up, it was an irresponsible waste of capital up to this point, continuing the insanity is well, insane. The new German ruling Coalition after The February 2025 will surely early on end the energewende.. Leftist fantasies never end but eventually they run out of other people’s money to waste. In the US the investment growth rate for wind power is slow. But solar power and EV investment growth rates still far too high: The United States’ solar energy capacity has been growing rapidly in recent years, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting a 75% increase in solar power capacity from 2023 to 2025 In 2023, the United States’ wind capacity increased by 4% from 2022, reaching a total of 147.5 gigawatts (GW). This is a 10% average annual increase since 2010, when the capacity was 45 GW. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind capacity to increase by 7 gigawatts (GW) in 2024, which is a 5% increase from the previous year. This would bring the total wind capacity in the U.S. to 153.8 GW by the end of 2024. In 2024, the US is expected to invest $312 billion in EV manufacturing, with $223 billion already allocated to specific initiatives. This is a nearly $66 billion increase from January 2023 All cash down the crapper. Oh, and “capacity” does not equal production. The percentage increase of investment correlates with the percentage increase of capacity. Exactly. It has absolutely nothing to do with electricity actually generated that can be used when generated. Yes — Greene can’t read. Germany may have fatally damaged its manufacturing base as companies close or announce job cuts or relocations out of Germany virtually every week. Sky high energy costs mean that a twelfth of the population are not able to fund a full year forcing consideration to be given to banning disconnections for non-payment even if only during the winter months. Energy companies in the UK are facing an increasing amount of customers in debt and these may be pushed on to those of us who are paying, as if our costs were not high enough already. Many of the companies that haven’t moved or downsized already, are having trouble finding enough money to maintain their equipment, much less modernize it. This will hamper those companies in the future. Germany is poised to begin repairing Merkel’s damage: (It won’t be easy and it won’t be quick). Christoph Strack 4 hours ago4 hours ago Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany’s leader. Merz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as “ugly” wind turbines. He drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. Merz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees. He represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).(We’ll see about that, I think he’ll change his mind, he must IMHO) Shortly after Germany’s center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz’s coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming. Merz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government. The renewable energy business has been built on lies pure and simple. If we had the strength to hold government, media and academia accountable we wouldn’t be in this mess. If we held individuals accountable and didn’t allow them to hide behind their organizations all of this would end. Remove the free money, remove the commitment. The clear indicator of a specious cause. RE has always been a means for the wealthy to extract public money through subsidies, never about reducing CO2 emissions. I am optimistic for a different reason. For years, it seemed like the climate skeptics spoke alone, and in a disjointed fashion, making no headway with GQ public. Now, I’m watching organizations pull together, and some even coordinate their efforts. Recently, someone told me that 20% of people are hypnotized idiots, 20% question everything, and 60% can be convinced with logic but mostly they just go along with whichever group is loudest. By coordinating efforts, we can appear to be the winners and pull in the 60%.

RAIN, HAIL, OR snow, every Christmas Day troves of people across the country take to bodies of water for a Christmas Day swim. Luckily, today you don’t need to worry about hail or snow if you are planning on participating. According to the Met Éireann forecast, today will be mild and quite cloudy, though some brighter breaks will develop. Speaking to The Journal, meteorologist Brandon Creagh said that it is unseasonably mild, and this morning will have temperatures of between 10 and 11 degrees across the whole country. “The sea is actually going to be pretty much fairly close to that as well,” he said. “The sea surface temperatures are forecast to be around 10 or 11 degrees. “But I would encourage people to keep an eye on the advice from water safety Ireland and the Irish coast guard, which has been circling around on Christmas Day.” Advertisement Creagh said that the unseasonable weather is the result of mild air that has been pushed up from the south due to a high pressure system centered around Europe. “So the whole country is going to experience fairly similar conditions tomorrow, some places might get a little bit more sun than others, but exactly where that will be remains to be seen,” he said. Most places will be dry but a few patches of light rain and drizzle will affect the western half of the country. Highest temperatures of 11 to 13 degrees in moderate southwest winds, fresh at times on west and northwest coasts.

Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo COPE Galway has issued a list of precautions for swimmers to be aware of as they take on the Christmas Day swim. The charity is organising the swim, which takes place this morning at Blackrock Pier in Salthill. Last year, over 850 people took place in the swim. COPE Galway said for swimmers to stay visible, not to swim alone, avoid diving and swimming after consuming alcohol or a large meal. It also said to avoid staying in the water for too long and to bring a warm drink and warm clothes to change into. Lifeguards will be present at the swim, but it warned that participants should be aware of the safety guidelines. Organised swims are taking place all across the country today. Despite the mild weather, it is still recommended to wrap up warm and not too spend too long in the water. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

We recently published a list of 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Are Watching Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against other AI news and ratings investors are watching right now. At CNBC’s ‘Money Movers’, Jack Hidary, CEO of Sandbox AQ, emphasized the shift towards B2B-focused AI, positioning it as the next major evolution in artificial intelligence. While language models like those from OpenAI have excelled in consumer applications, Hidary highlighted the untapped potential of quantitative AI (QAI) in driving innovation across industries like pharmaceuticals, automotive, and energy. QAI uses fundamental equations to generate new data, which enables advancements in drug development, materials for energy storage, and aerospace. Hidary pointed out that large quantitative models are set to transform product development by creating significant economic value, unlike large language models, which primarily reduce operational costs. He predicts that 2025 and beyond will see a growing focus on AI’s role in addressing critical challenges in B2B sectors, from building better batteries to accelerating medical breakthroughs.

Title: Elon Musk’s xAI raises $6B to bolster battle against OpenAI: ‘Gonna need a bigger compute!’
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/12/24/business/elon-musks-xai-raises-6b-to-bolster-battle-against-openai/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T19:16:04Z

Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI revealed that it raised $6 billion in its latest funding round as the startup continues to ramp up in its battle against bitter rival OpenAI. Musk took a victory lap after announcing Monday on his social media platform X that the company concluded its Series C funding round — which is usually the final stage of venture capital financing. “We are gonna need a bigger compute!” Musk wrote, in an apparent reference to the famous line from “Jaws.” The need for a “bigger compute” is likely an indication that Musk plans to use the investment to build larger processing centers to warehouse super computers that will be needed to train and run more sophisticated AI models. The company had raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round in May at a post-money valuation of $24 billion. In late November, xAI raised another $5 billion at a $50 billion valuation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now, it appears xAI raised a bigger round of $6 billion, but Musk didn’t disclose the valuation. Investors in the latest funding round included Sequoia Capital, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Fidelity, Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holdings, the sovereign wealth funds of Oman and Qatar, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Valor Equity Partners, Dubai-based Vy Capital and UAE-based MGX, the company said. In its latest announcement, xAI said that it is training Grok 3, the latest version of its chatbot, which was originally scheduled to be available by the end of this year. The infusion of cash comes as Musk is engaged in an AI arms race against ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the company he co-founded and which is now run by Sam Altman. Musk, who left OpenAI after losing a power struggle against Altman and other co-founders, is suing the company and its key financial backer Microsoft. He is alleging that Microsoft and OpenAI, which as of October was valued at around $157 billion, illegally sought to monopolize the market for generative artificial intelligence and sideline competitors.

Title: My Top Retirement Strategy For 14% Dividends In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/24/my-top-retirement-strategy-for-14-dividends-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T18:38:00Z
Full Content:
Adirondack chairs on a wooden dock on a calm lake in Muskoka, Ontario Canada. Cottages nestled ... [+] between trees are visible across the water. Not many people know this, but if you really want to diversify—deftly balancing and rebalancing to maximize (and protect) your gains, you need to invest in closed-end funds (CEFs). Doing this with CEFs, which yield around 8% on average, gives you two key advantages: First, you get a much bigger income stream. That’s great on its own. But if you’re reinvesting your income, you get an even bigger edge because you can easily redirect your dividends from one CEF to another in a different sector. You just can’t do this with an index fund. Let’s dig into how that works in practice. While 2024 has been a great year for stocks, some sectors are lagging, as is always the case. And right now, as we look ahead to 2025, is a good time to reallocate a bit from your winners into the stragglers. That’s because, over time, these laggards will likely revert to their long-term average performance. A look at the sectors making up the S&P 500 tells us that the biggest winners this year have been the communication services, finance, consumer discretionary and tech sectors. These firms are picking up the slack we’ve seen in materials, energy and healthcare. I want to focus on healthcare, because the gap between this year’s performance (up just around 1.1% following last week’s selloff) and what the sector has done in the long run is striking. With about a 9% annualized return over the last decade, healthcare has performed relatively well, making it a good target for rebalancing by moving profits (or CEF dividends) into it from the stronger-performing sectors of 2024. The highest-yielding healthcare CEF is the abrdn Healthcare Investors Fund (HQH), a 14.2% payer whose portfolio includes key pharma names like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY). It would take just $705,000 invested in this fund to get $100,000 per year in income. Plus, HQH’s focus on healthcare means we could pair it with other sector-specific CEFs and rebalance to ensure we aren’t overexposed to any particular industry—and also profit from the performance differences between those sectors. But to make certain HQH is the best CEF for this strategy, we need to dig deeper. As of this writing, HQH has beaten the healthcare sector as a whole, with a 7.9% total NAV return year to date (this is a CEF-specific measure that examines the performance of a fund’s underlying portfolio, rather than its price on the open market), about seven times the return of the benchmark Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV). However, on the open market, the fund has returned 10.6%, including dividends paid out. This gap largely stems from the fund’s big discount to NAV (or the difference between the NAV- and market price–based return), which was over 15% at the start of the year and has now returned to that overly generous discount following the big selloff last week. This is a new buying opportunity, and momentum could drive that discount smaller still over the coming months if the market’s recent panic subsides, pulling up the fund’s market price with it. And if HQH doesn’t cut its payout, we may indeed see that discount get smaller still. There are two problems, however: Obviously, the market pullback might not yet be done and, more importantly, HQH raised its dividend in May, which means it’s now paying a 12.6% yield on NAV, much higher than that 7.9% total NAV return we just talked about. This means the dividend might need to be cut. Or HQH will need to pay out shareholder capital, shrinking the fund’s size—and its gain potential. That’s a tough situation, made worse by management’s decision to raise the payout. Now let’s consider the BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (BME), whose 7% yield is half that of HQH. BME trades at a less generous 10.3% discount, but the trend in this discount (in orange below) is very different than that of HQH (in purple). BME Discount HQH went from being priced at par to a huge discount to going back toward par over the last three years to plummeting last week. BME, meantime, has been on a steady descent toward a bigger discount (although the vector of decline has flattened out significantly in 2024, and it didn’t change all that much with the recent selloff). This would suggest BME is at risk of getting cheaper, but there’s a key detail: The fund is part of BlackRock’s “discount management program,” under which the company buys a certain amount of some CEFs (including BME) if their average discount is more than 7.5% during a three-month measurement period. HQH has no such initiative, which is why its discount grew so large late last year and why its discount could grow so massively. This means BME is unlikely to see its discount go much lower. And even if it does, BlackRock’s discount-management program means the firm will buy back shares on a quarterly basis at a 2% discount. If you tender your shares during this offer after buying at the fund’s current price, the result would be an instant 9.3% profit. There’s one more reason to prefer BME over HQH, despite its lower yield. BME Total Returns Over the last five years, BME (in orange above) has outperformed HQH on a total-NAV-return basis. This suggests it should be priced at a much smaller discount than HQH, on the strength of its stronger management. This also suggests BME is the better buy when its discount gets unusually wide. Thus, while HQH’s huge dividends make it look like the better choice, if you want to buy and hold a sector fund for the long term, BME is likely to outperform HQH, especially if BlackRock continues its discount-management program. However, if abrdn were to start its own discount-management program, HQH might have the edge. Until that happens, though, my money’s on BME.

From crypto CEOs who advocate for the industry to NFT project founders who use their good fortune to help others, several Web3 workhorses made their way onto Saint Nick's “nice list” this year. Here's who can expect presents under the tree when Santa comes to town. Brian Armstrong is the face of the digital assets industry's fight for more favorable regulations in the U.S. The soft-spoken CEO of Coinbase spent ample time in Washington this year, participating in discussions with Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike on the future of crypto in the U.S. Meanwhile, Armstrong’s team led initiatives to center digital assets-related issues in the 2024 U.S. elections, sponsoring studies on crypto holders' political leanings and facilitating Republican candidate Donald Trump's push to accept campaign donations in crypto. Armstrong and his team were instrumental in building up pro-crypto super PAC Fairshake's $200 million war chest. Coinbase donated roughly $50 million each to Fairshake between 2023 and 2024, helping secure the election of the most pro-crypto U.S. Congress ever. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo is the face of the crypto industry’s tokenization craze—a trend that has helped catapult digital asset prices to new heights in 2024. In June, the executive delivered testimony on Capitol Hill about the importance of real-world asset tokenization and its implications for the future of finance. Domingo is also an important ally to institutional investors looking to pour funds into crypto. Earlier this year, the Spanish founder's tokenization platform partnered with BlackRock to launch the investment titan's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has continued to be a fierce advocate for Bitcoin, adding more than $15 billion worth of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to his company’s balance sheet in the last few weeks, according to the company’s filing with U.S. regulators. Saylor’s firm holds 423,650 Bitcoin (worth $41.5 billion) as of publication time, the company’s financial statements show. Despite HODLing roughly 2% of all the Bitcoin that will ever be mined, Saylor has contributed to the future of the cryptocurrency in another big way—by encouraging other tech giants to hold the asset. Earlier this month, Saylor pitched Microsoft’s directors on a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet—a proposal its shareholders ultimately rejected.

NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has continued to advocate for privacy rights at a time when cryptocurrency and blockchain network adoption is accelerating. The vector of development that the internet and society is traveling leads away from extraordinary people sharing unique beliefs, and toward a tyranny of mediocrity. It is a preference for "normal" so strong that it extinguishes excellence; a ruthless allegiance to the average. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 16, 2024 At the annual Bitcoin conference in Nashville, TN, this summer, Snowden warned the conference’s attendees to vote independently in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which posed major consequences for the future of the crypto industry. He also flagged that governments could use artificial intelligence-powered tools to mine people’s metadata—a much-needed warning at a time when the use of AI tools is gaining traction.

Title: Why NextEra Energy (NEE) Is Among the Best Solar Energy Stocks to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Solar Energy Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best solar energy stocks to buy now. During Joe Biden’s presidency, the U.S. solar industry experienced a significant boost, primarily driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This $369 billion package, signed into law in 2022, has been a game-changer for the renewable energy sector. The IRA provided substantial incentives for renewable energy, including tax credits, grants, and investments in clean energy infrastructure. The IRA has also reduced the U.S. reliance on imported energy resources. The economic benefits of the IRA have been widely recognized, with bipartisan support from both Democratic and Republican leaders. According to a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published on December 4, the US solar market installed 8.6 GW of capacity in Q3, continuing the trend of record-setting quarterly volumes this year and marking a notable 21% increase compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The report also highlights significant growth in domestic solar module manufacturing capacity, which increased by over 9 GW in Q3, reaching nearly 40 GW. This marks a substantial rise from less than 7 GW at the end of Q2 2022, before the introduction of domestic manufacturing and procurement tax credits under the IRA. Additionally, the first US cell manufacturing facility opened in Q3 marking a significant milestone in reshoring cell production for the first time since 2019. Utility-scale solar remained the largest contributor, with 6.6 GW installed in Q3, which signifies a 44% increase year-over-year and marks the highest third-quarter performance on record for the segment. As Donald Trump prepares for a second term as president, the future of the U.S. solar industry is a topic of significant interest. Trump’s campaign rhetoric has signaled intentions to bolster the fossil fuel industry, repeal Biden-era policies such as the IRA, and increase trade tariffs. In an interview with CNBC on November 9, John Berger, CEO of Sunnova, discussed the impact of a potential second Trump administration on the solar industry. Berger emphasized that the market is currently driven by wild speculation and emotional responses, but he believes that the fundamentals of the solar industry remain strong and the demand for energy is increasing, suggesting it could bring even more success and growth for the solar industry and his company. Berger addressed the speculation about future policy changes, particularly regarding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). He stated that the IRA is unlikely to change significantly, noting its success and the bipartisan support for domestic manufacturing, especially in the production of solar panels, batteries, inverters, and electric vehicles. He also stated that 85% of the plants that manufacture solar panels and batteries are located in Republican districts. Berger concluded by praising the IRA, particularly the tax credit for manufacturing (45X), which has played an instrumental role in growing and building domestic manufacturing plants in the U.S. Despite the potential for federal policy changes, the solar industry will undoubtedly play an increasingly vital role in global energy systems. To compile our list of the 10 best solar energy stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners, clean energy ETFs, and online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 solar energy stocks. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 69 NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a global leader in renewable energy, specializing in wind and solar power generation. The company operates through its subsidiaries, including Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is recognized for its massive investments in clean energy infrastructure and commitment to a sustainable future. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is expanding its renewable energy portfolio by partnering with Phillips 66 to power its refinery in Rodeo, California with a new solar facility. This 30.2-megawatt solar plant, set to begin operations in January 2025, will be built on 88 acres of land adjacent to Phillips 66’s facility in the San Francisco Bay Area. The facility, consisting of more than 70,000 solar modules, is expected to generate around 60,000 megawatt hours of electricity annually. By reducing the refinery’s grid power demand by half and lowering carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 33,000 metric tons per year, the solar plant will play a crucial role in Phillips 66’s transition to more sustainable and renewable energy sources. NextEra Energy Inc.’s (NYSE:NEE) expertise in developing and operating large-scale solar projects positions it as a leader in the industry. The company is investing heavily in the development of new solar projects, with a focus on low-cost and battery storage. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has also announced incremental framework agreements with two Fortune 50 customers for the potential development of renewables and storage projects, totaling up to 10.5 gigawatts till 2030. Overall, NEE ranks 2nd on our list of best solar energy stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: BlackRock Bets on Bitcoin: Is the US Dollar Era Over?

"The rewiring of globalization is also playing out in reserve currencies," writes Tom Donilon, Chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute. "As the world divides into competing blocs, and the US and Western governments lean on sanctions and other restrictions, some countries are shifting their reserves out of US dollars into gold and other assets, while increasingly conducting trade finance in non-dollar currencies." "As others have learned through history it is dangerous for private investors to challenge governments. That said, George Soros broke the Bank of England [in 1992] so, perhaps, a firm like BlackRock will believe it can profit from breaking over-leveraged nations that today still have 'hard' fiat currencies," Ortel concludes, referring to the 1992 sterling crisis which was estimated to have cost the British Treasury over $3.7 billion.

Title: Fintech Wrapped: Three Surprising Things That Happened In Fintech In 2024

Fintech wrapped for 2024 It’s always fun to do a retrospective on the year. 2024 was a year of surprises for the fintech sector. Some trends cooled. Others reignited with fervor. From a crypto renaissance in recent months, a continued slow exit environment and important shifts in emerging markets, 2024 was also a year of transformation. Here are three trends that stood out. 2024 witnessed a dramatic rebound in the cryptocurrency market. Despite a recent pull-back, bitcoin hit $100K, shattering previous highs, driven by institutional interest, macroeconomic factors and the US election. Beyond political speculation, one real driver is growing institutional interest. Nearly half of traditional hedge funds reported exposure to digital assets in 2024, up from 29% in 2023. Among these, 33% plan to increase their crypto investments by year's end. Retail investors can now access crypto more easily. U.S. regulators approved several Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock recommends bitcoin portfolio weighting of up to 2% for interested investors. Central banks are also continuing to experiment in the space. Approximately 134 countries, including across the G20, are exploring digital versions of their currencies. Major economies like India and Brazil moved from pilots to early-stage implementation of CBDCs. Perhaps most interesting is that blockchain technology may be finding its first real use case (beyond speculation of future use cases): stablecoins. The market cap of commodity-backed stablecoins hit $1.3 billion as of August 1, 2024. This is being driven by use in ecommerce, remittances and treasury. This was one of the big stories coming out of Money 2020 this year. 2024 was certainly the year crypto came back, with new real applications emerging. Despite signs of economic recovery, fintech IPOs were nearly non-existent. Companies like Stripe and Klarna, expected to go public, opted to delay due to market volatility. However, things might change. A number of companies are predicted to go public in 2025. At Money2020 this year, one of the buzziest topics was who would be the most likely next IPO. Scott Sanborn predicted Stripe and Chime (which received a few other votes) as likely candidates, while Sandy Kimura of Money Forward suggested Klarna and Plaid (note Chime is a former portfolio company). Despite the dearth of IPOs, the exit markets were still active, particularly in strategically minded M&A transactions and other deals. The most significant deals were in the payments sector, including Capital One Financial Corp.'s $35 billion proposal to acquire Discover Financial Services and an investor group's $5.04 billion plan to take Canadian payments firm Nuvei Corp. private. Crypto & stable coins were also not left out. BRD-GE, a stablecoin infrastructure provider was acquired by Stripe for over a billion. 2024 reaffirmed that innovation thrives outside traditional hubs, particularly in emerging ecosystems. Emerging market fintech innovation is arguably most strongly seen today by the government. Real-time money transfers continue their march forward in emerging market – like India, Brazil and now a handful of other markets. The impact is clear. McKinsey & Co predicts the cash economy in many emerging markets like India, will decline from 23% today to less than 10% within this decade. Emerging markets have created regional powerhouses. Nubank is among the largest neobanks. Jio is building a multibillion-dollar ecosystem in India. Many are expanding across markets. Dlocal for example has scaled across South America, Africa, and Asia. We will see more of this over time. A number of sectors cooled, while others heated up. ESG-focused fintechs struggled as investor focus shifted away from sustainable investments, particularly in light of disappointing financial returns in 2023. Conversely, generative AI became fintech’s darling, driving personalized financial services, fraud detection, and operational automation. Examples include OpenAI’s collaboration with major banks for automated underwriting models. What I enjoyed was the comeback stories. For example, companies like Root and Dave, once fintech darlings, found themselves in the doldrums at the beginning of the year. In January, Root traded under $10/share (down from over $350 at its peak). The company grew its stock price 7x this year to over $70 as of writing. Hippo, the home insurance provider, similarly scaled from under 10 to nearly $30 today (source Yahoo Finance). 2024 was a year of unexpected twists in fintech. But like some of the stock and crypto prices, fintech has gone from down-and-out category, to a core investment area. As we look to 2025, the stage is set for further surprises in an industry that never stays static for long. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to look at where New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) stands against other best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. The U.S. Federal Reserve now anticipates just two interest rate cuts next year, a reduction from the four previously forecasted in September, due to inflation concerns and the potential economic impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs. On November 18, in the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s announcement, the U.S. dollar surged, with the dollar index reaching a two-year high. This rally placed downward pressure on gold prices, which fell 2% to their lowest levels in a month. Traditionally, a stronger dollar and higher U.S. Treasury yields make gold less attractive as an investment. However, analysts suggest that these traditional relationships between gold, the dollar, and interest rates have become less predictable in recent years. In an interview with CNBC on December 18, Thomas Rupf, Chief Investment Officer and Head of Trading at VP Bank Asia provided detailed insights into the current market conditions and future projections for the U.S. dollar and gold. Rupf acknowledged the resilience of the U.S. dollar and attributed it to the perception of the continued strength of the U.S. economy. However, he also pointed out that the U.S. dollar is currently overvalued and expects the US economy to slow down, which could contribute to a weaker US dollar by the end of next year. Regarding gold, Rupf is optimistic and noted that the potential slowdown in the US economy and dollar as well as the ongoing trend of de-dollarization are all bullish factors for gold prices. He mentioned that ETF flows, which are still 20% below historical levels, indicate that there is significant room for retail investors to increase their investment in gold ETFs. Rupf concluded by agreeing that gold prices could realistically reach $2,800 to $2,900. He also mentioned the possibility of gold reaching up to $3,000, which he considers the top end of his forecast. Gold has historically been recognized as a reliable investment, known for its enduring value and resilience against economic uncertainties. This precious metal has been a cornerstone in many diversified investment portfolios, offering a sense of security and stability in times of financial turmoil. To compile our list of the 10 best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, financing, or sale of gold and have a market capitalization between $200 million and $10 billion as of December 23. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 23 Market Capitalization as of December 23: $1.98 Billion New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is a prominent intermediate gold mining company with a diversified portfolio of high-quality assets across North America. The company operates two flagship mines: Rainy River in Ontario, Canada, and New Afton in British Columbia, Canada. New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) prioritizes exploration to generate additional value and extend the operational life of its mines. At Rainy River, the company has identified promising opportunities in the main pit and several smaller satellite pits. These prospects could further extend the open-pit mine’s life while minimizing capital expenditures. At New Afton mine, New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is focusing on optimizing the C-Zone, the fourth block cave at the mine, and advancing the technical study for the East Extension, which has the potential to introduce a high-grade zone in the mine’s eastern section. New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is also advancing several critical projects aimed at boosting production capacity and improving cost efficiency. At the C-Zone, the company has successfully commissioned the gyratory crusher and conveyor system, eliminating the need for truck haulage. At the Rainy River Mine, efforts are concentrated on developing the Underground Main Zone, the second and much larger sector of the mine compared to Intrepid. The Underground Main Zone is slated to begin production in the first half of 2025 and is expected to ramp up to processing 5,500 tonnes of gold ore per day by 2027. Overall, NGD ranks 2nd on our list of best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NGD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NGD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

However, analysts suggest that these traditional relationships between gold, the dollar, and interest rates have become less predictable in recent years. In an interview with CNBC on December 18, Thomas Rupf, Chief Investment Officer and Head of Trading at VP Bank Asia provided detailed insights into the current market conditions and future projections for the U.S. dollar and gold. Rupf acknowledged the resilience of the U.S. dollar and attributed it to the perception of the continued strength of the U.S. economy. However, he also pointed out that the U.S. dollar is currently overvalued and expects the US economy to slow down, which could contribute to a weaker US dollar by the end of next year. Regarding gold, Rupf is optimistic and noted that the potential slowdown in the US economy and dollar as well as the ongoing trend of de-dollarization are all bullish factors for gold prices. He mentioned that ETF flows, which are still 20% below historical levels, indicate that there is significant room for retail investors to increase their investment in gold ETFs. Rupf concluded by agreeing that gold prices could realistically reach $2,800 to $2,900. He also mentioned the possibility of gold reaching up to $3,000, which he considers the top end of his forecast. Gold has historically been recognized as a reliable investment, known for its enduring value and resilience against economic uncertainties. This precious metal has been a cornerstone in many diversified investment portfolios, offering a sense of security and stability in times of financial turmoil. To compile our list of the 10 best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, financing, or sale of gold and have a market capitalization between $200 million and $10 billion as of December 23. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 17 Market Capitalization as of December 23: $3.41 Billion Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (NYSE:OR) is a leading gold royalty and streaming company with a diversified portfolio of high-quality assets. The company’s portfolio includes a mix of producing and development-stage assets, primarily Canada, the United States, and Australia. Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (NYSE:OR) is actively pursuing strategic acquisitions to expand its portfolio and enhance its revenue streams. One notable recent acquisition is the 1.8% gross revenue royalty on Spartan Resources’ Dalgaranga Gold Project in Western Australia. This acquisition also aligns with the company’s aim to generate near-term cash flow. The Dalgaranga Gold Project has a mineral resource estimate of 1.9 million ounces at 8.7 grams per tonne, with significant exploration potential. Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (NYSE:OR) expects a maiden reserve estimate and project feasibility study, to be completed and released in Q2 2025, which will potentially lead to the start of mining and milling operations by late 2026. This acquisition is expected to contribute over 2,500 gold Equivalent Ounces (GEOs) annually over the life of the mine. Furthermore, the East Gouldie deposit, where Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (NYSE:OR) holds a 5% Net Smelter Return (NSR) royalty, highlighted the potential for additional mineral reserves and extended mine life. The company expects to benefit from its increased production in the coming years. Overall, OR ranks 5th on our list of best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of OR to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than OR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Serious $4.1 Trillion 2025 Fed Warning Sparks $20,000 Bitcoin Price Crash Fear

Bitcoin has dropped back from its all-time high of over $100,000 in the last week as BlackRock quietly confirmed a worrying bitcoin bombshell. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has plunged toward $90,000 per bitcoin, with the Federal Reserve's "biggest nightmare" weighing on the crypto market. Now, as Donald Trump confirms he has huge plans for bitcoin, a financial analyst has warned a $4.1 trillion drop in the global money supply could be about to trigger a bitcoin price crash of $20,000. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has overseen a $4.1 trillion drop in the global money supply, ... [+] something some fear could cause a bitcoin price crash. "In the past, bitcoin prices have followed global money supply with ~10 week lag," analysts with The Kobeissi Letter posted to X, asking: "Is bitcoin overdue for a correction?" Kobeissi analysts pointed to the money supply dropping by $4.1 trillion, to $104.4 trillion, the lowest since August, after hitting a peak of $108.5 trillion in October. "If the relationship still holds, this suggests that bitcoin prices could fall as much as $20,000 over the next few weeks. Bitcoin's red hot run may take a pause." The Federal Reserve, which controls the money supply through monetary policy, has been fighting to keep a lid on inflation this year while also attempting to bring down interest rates to prevent the economy falling into recession. Last week, the Fed cut interest rates by a well-telegraphed 25 basis points despite prices beginning to rise again but signaled it will move more slowly along next year's expected path of rate cuts. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged to record highs of over $100,000 per bitcoin this year, a huge rally ... [+] that's led to fears of a looming bitcoin price crash. The Fed's "economic outlook and chair Powell's press conference suggested that inflation is going to be stickier than previously thought. This means that they will proceed with the current rate cut cycle slowly and with caution to inflation, which seems to be re-accelerating for the past couple of months," Yuya Hasegawa, bitcoin and crypto market analyst with Tokyo-based Bitbank, said in emailed comments. "There also is a chance for Fed to stop cutting rates sometime during 2025 if inflation becomes too hot, and in the worst case scenario, they might start raising again. Monetary easing has almost always favored the price of bitcoin, and the opposite has negative impact on the price." U.S. debt has soared over recent years, topping $34 trillion at the beginning of 2024, with Covid and lockdown stimulus measures contributing to massive government spending and helping to send inflation spiraling out of control in 2022. Inflation of over 10% forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip, pushing up debt interest payments and fueling fears of a "death spiral." "While Fed's potential policy shift will likely put pressure on bitcoin, high interest rates will keep pressure on the government's debt payments as well," Hasegawa said. "The ballooning Federal government debt is already raising the question about its sustainability and the government's credibility could gradually become one of the topics that the market will pay attention to in 2025."

Title: Elon Musk's xAI raises $6 billion in fresh funding: 'We are gonna need a bigger compute!'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-xai-series-c-funding-round-grok-nvidia-microchips-2024-12

Elon Musk's xAI has completed its Series C funding round, raising a total of $6 billion, it revealed in a Monday blog post. Musk's artificial intelligence company said the participants included a16z, Sequoia Capital, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Fidelity, Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holdings, Oman and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds, California-based Lightspeed Venture Partners, Chicago-based Valor Equity Partners, Dubai-based Vy Capital, and UAE-based tech investor MGX. xAI added that chipmakers Nvidia and AMD took part as strategic investors and "continue to support xAI in rapidly scaling our infrastructure." Musk shared the news on his X platform, writing, "A lot of compute is needed." He also tagged xAI in a meme generated by xAI's Grok chatbot that riffed on a famous line from the movie "Jaws." “We are gonna need a bigger compute!”@xAI https://t.co/ckc78vJhL6 Musk was likely underscoring the vast amount of processing power needed to train and run AI models, which has fueled enormous demand for microchips and underpinned a roughly eightfold rise in Nvidia stock since the start of 2023. xAI, founded in March last year, raised $6 billion at a post-money valuation of $24 billion in its Series B round in May. The Wall Street Journal reported in late November that it had raised a further $5 billion at a $50 billion valuation. It appears xAI ultimately raised a bigger round of $6 billion, but the valuation wasn't disclosed. The startup highlighted its progress since May in its blog post, including its launch of Colossus — the world's largest AI supercomputer powered by 100,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, which xAI plans to double in size to 200,000 chips soon. xAI also released version two of Grok, an application programming interface (API) for developers to build on its platform, its Aurora image generation model for Grok, and Grok on X. The company said it's training Grok 3 and "focused on launching innovative new consumer and enterprise products that will leverage the power of Grok, Colossus, and X to transform the way we live, work, and play." Musk's fledgling business said it would use the Series C funds to accelerate its infrastructure growth, ship new products, and speed up its research and development of tech that will enable its "mission to understand the true nature of the universe."

Title: House Judiciary Committee sends letters to investment firms tied to ‘woke ESG cartel’

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/24/2024 2:23:00 AM PST by Libloather The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee took aim at a group of US asset managers over their involvement with a “woke ESG cartel” — adding pressure against environmental efforts by large investors. The committee, chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, sent letters to 60 firms — including BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — that are members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, or NZAM, an international group of investors that signed on to a pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The letters, sent Friday, made claims in line with a committee report released on Dec. 13 that Republicans say showed fund firms colluded to cut emissions. That report found that top asset managers in the US were concerned that signing up for an industry climate initiative would make them look like they worked too closely together and attract regulatory scrutiny. The committee’s Democrats have dismissed such claims, and big fund firms have denied similar charges. Jordan alleges in the letter that that companies’ efforts with NZAM and the affiliated Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero “may violate U.S. antitrust law,” citing the earlier report. It asks for information such as how companies’ participation in NZAM changed their stewardship strategies. GOP Judiciary Committee members claim that investor preoccupation with environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies takes the focus away from delivering profits for shareholders and imposes unnecessary restrictions on business. Republicans previously have taken credit for prompting three fund managers — BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — to step back from another investor group, the Climate Action 100+.

Jim Jordan, sent letters to 60 firms — including BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — that are members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, or NZAM, an international group of investors that signed on to a pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The letters, sent Friday, made claims in line with a committee report released on Dec. 13 that Republicans say showed fund firms colluded to cut emissions. That report found that top asset managers in the US were concerned that signing up for an industry climate initiative would make them look like they worked too closely together and attract regulatory scrutiny. The committee’s Democrats have dismissed such claims, and big fund firms have denied similar charges. Jordan alleges in the letter that that companies’ efforts with NZAM and the affiliated Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero “may violate U.S. antitrust law,” citing the earlier report. It asks for information such as how companies’ participation in NZAM changed their stewardship strategies. GOP Judiciary Committee members claim that investor preoccupation with environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies takes the focus away from delivering profits for shareholders and imposes unnecessary restrictions on business.

Title: Jim Cramer on Reddit (RDDT): ‘I Don’t Know What To Do About It’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 52 Jim Cramer has been bullish on Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) but the stock’s bull run has him recommending investors to wait for a pullback. In a latest program, Cramer said: “I like Reddit, but you know what? Reddit now has a parabolic chart, and I don’t know what to do about it. It’s just going bonkers, and I wish it had a pullback before I could recommend it. It’s an extraordinary chart, but it has just moved up too much.” With over 80 million daily active users, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) remains one of the fastest-growing social media platforms in the world. While Facebook and Twitter show signs of maturing growth, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) still has huge upside potential as more and more people flock to Reddit discussion boards for authentic opinions and discussion. User input from millions of people on various topics freely accessible to anyone is Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT)’s moat. As of 2023, users posted 16 billion comments on the platform, according to the company. That’s why companies are flocking to pay money to Reddit to use its data to train their AI models. Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) has a licensing agreement with Alphabet Inc.’s Google worth $60 million to help train large language models. Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) has signed licensing agreements totaling $203 million, with terms lasting two to three years.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 Jim Cramer in a latest program analyzed why Wall Street missed the Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PLTR) rally and how the company defies conventional valuation models. “It has a tremendous business model that could change the entire Defense Department budget, but in some ways, Palantir is a renegade company playing by its own rules. Like AMC, the theater chain, the CEO actually caters not to Wall Street but to Main Street individual investors. What makes Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Untimely ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) (+47%) also hurt the fund’s relative result. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. We established a sizable holding in Palantir Technologies during the quarter, and at quarter end it was the second-largest position and a slight overweight.” Overall, PLTR ranks 8th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC expressed his concerns over rising warranty costs of Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and said the stock does not have a lot of “MOJO.” “Ford does not have a lot of mojo in this note by Jefferies. This is one of the reasons—what can save the Fed when they cut. Ford has an inventory drifting up to 96 days. That says to me price cut, way too much, way too much. And by the way, that’s far more than GM—26. Wow. I mean, GM and Stellantis have much lower inventories.” Ford shares have gained about 10% over the past 10 years, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s 250%. Legacy automakers like Ford are grappling with challenges from newer competitors, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and the rapid rise of autonomous technology. Ford’s Model e segment continues to drain cash as Ford works to strengthen its EV business. While the company has some strong products, it faces stiff competition from Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), and other EV makers, leading to significant losses. Year-to-date, Ford’s EBIT has dropped to $8.1 billion, down from $9.4 billion in the same period last year. Ford’s struggle to reduce warranty costs remains a concern. The company issued 62 recalls in 2024, far surpassing General Motors Company (GM), which had 33. Since 2021, Ford has had the industry’s highest recall rate, reflecting poorly on management’s efforts to lower warranty expenses and damaging the brand’s reputation. Overall, F ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of F, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than F but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: People With Extreme Wealth Should Give It Away—or Be Penalized

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED In 2024, wealth concentration rose to an all-time high. According to Forbes’ Billionaires List, not only are there more billionaires than ever—2,781—but those billionaires are also richer than ever, with an aggregate worth of $14.2 trillion. This is a trend that looks set to continue unabated. A recent report from the financial data company Altrata estimated that about 1.2 million individuals who are worth more than $5 million will pass on a collective wealth of almost $31 trillion over the next decade. Discontentment and concern over the consequences of extreme wealth in our society is growing. Senator Bernie Sanders, for instance, stated that the “obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue.” In a joint op-ed for CNN in 2023, Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee and Disney heiress Abigail Disney wrote that “extreme wealth inequality is a threat to our economy and democracy.” In 2024, when the board of Tesla put to vote a $56 billion pay package for Elon Musk, some major shareholders voted against it, declaring that such a compensation level was “absurd” and “ridiculous.” In 2025, the fight against rising wealth inequality will be high on the political agenda. In July 2024, the G20—the world’s 20 biggest economies—agreed to work on a proposal by Brazil to introduce a new global “billionaire tax” that would levy a 2 percent tax on assets worth more than $1 billion. This would raise an estimated $250 billion a year. While this specific proposal was not endorsed in the Rio declaration, the G20 countries agreed that the super rich should be taxed more. Progressive politicians won’t be the only ones trying to address this problem. In 2025, millionaires themselves will increasingly mobilize and put pressure on political leaders. One such movement is Patriotic Millionaires, a nonpartisan group of multimillionaires who are already publicly campaigning and privately lobbying the American Congress for a guaranteed living wage for all, a fair tax system, and the protection of equal representation. “Millionaires and large corporations—who have benefited most from our country’s assets—should pay a larger percentage of the tab for running the country,” reads their value statement. Members include Abigail Disney, former BlackRock executive Morris Pearl, legal scholar Lawrence Lessig, screenwriter Norman Lear, and investor Lawrence Benenson. This story is from the WIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing. Another example is TaxMeNow, a lobby group founded in 2021 by young multimillionaires in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland which also advocates for higher wealth taxation. Its most famous member is the 32-year old Marlene Engelhorn, descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, founder of German pharma giant BASF. She recently set up a council made up of 50 randomly selected Austrian citizens to decide what should happen to her €25 million inheritance. “I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,” she said in a statement. “If politicians don’t do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself.” Earlier this year, Patriotic Millionaires, TaxMeNow, Oxfam, and another activist group called Millionaires For Humanity formed a coalition called Proud to Pay More, and addressed a letter to global leaders during the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Signed by hundreds of high-net-worth individuals—including heiress Valerie Rockefeller, actor Simon Pegg, and filmmaker Richard Curtis—the letter stated: “We all know that ‘trickle down economics’ has not translated into reality. Instead it has given us stagnating wages, crumbling infrastructure, failing public services, and destabilized the very institution of democracy.” It concluded: “We ask you to take this necessary and inevitable step before it’s too late. Make your countries proud. Tax extreme wealth.” In 2025, thanks to the nascent movement of activist millionaires, these calls will grow even louder.

After failing to convince OpenAI executives of his plans, Elon Musk started his own AI startup, xAI. Over the past several months, xAI has aggressively pursued funding to support its rapid growth and ambitious goals in the competitive AI landscape. In May, xAI announced its Series B funding round of $6 billion. Last night, xAI announced that it had closed its Series C funding round of $6 billion. Popular VC firms including A16Z, Blackrock, Fidelity, Kingdom Holdings, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Vy Capital participated in this funding round. xAI also announced that NVIDIA and AMD participated in the round as strategic investors that will help them rapidly scale their AI infrastructure. As expected, xAI will use the funds to further improve its computing infrastructure, develop products, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies. xAI is also hiring aggressively to pursue its mission. Since its Series B announcement in May of this year, xAI has made the following progress: With this substantial investment, xAI is well-positioned to compete with other major players including OpenAI, Google and Meta in the AI landscape. It will be interesting to see how they utilize these funds to innovate and advance their technology in the coming months.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 17 Stocks After The Fed's Rate Cut. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. The Federal Reserve created quite a bit of turmoil in the stock market on Wednesday when despite cutting interest rates, it signaled to investors that the journey to low rates was far from over and would take longer than initially expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that "We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation," and used the data observation to project two rate cuts in 2025 instead of the earlier four. In Squawk on the Street's episode the day after the Fed's rate cut, Cramer called the latest Fed outcome"a new phase in the process." He outlined that the Fed might have missed the mark in being data-dependent. According to him "Look I think that they are data dependent. But they made a prediction and the prediction was not right. They should have just stayed data-dependent. They could've looked at the long bond and realized, you know wait a second, we're on the wrong track here. And signal that. And they didn't signal it." Cramer was pressed about what Chair Powell got wrong, and in response, he shared that it was "The messaging. Right, because what happened is this that . . .we have a data-dependent Fed, and they chose not to be data-dependant." Cramer added that the apparent miss from being data-dependant meant that the Fed's "message was off. They're not wrong, but all the people who thought that they were gonna be kind and dovish, I mean they were, uh, black dovish." The morning show host also shared his thoughts about the current tussle in Congress related to spending bills and electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk's role in it. "Look they got a real guy, Musk. Do you want to mess with Musk? I'm not messing with Musk. I tried it once. I was pantsed. You don't want to be pantsed by this man," said Cramer. He added "But I do want to make a point that there are a lot of people who are hopeful that he can do something about that. The $36 trillion that we have." According to Cramer, to achieve the cut maybe Musk and his team "shame people, maybe he shames people who are giveaway guys," as he believes that "he [MUSK] represents this chain of thought in this country that there's hope. That this government can get its act together." Cramer's remarks in the morning show weren't the only ones covering the rate cut. Immediately after the cut, in Mad Money, he commented on Chair Powell "Because he seemed to get caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn't back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today's meltdown." Building on the comments, the next day he outlined "There were some very cogent questions at the press conference about whether, when you study it, after his statement, did they really need a cut? By their own admission? And, I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates. David, this is that same problem that I keep saying which is that, if they had not set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut, and then they kind of like regretted it. And they regretted it because business is so strong, like GDP, inflation is a little bit higher." Cramer concluded by stating that he believes the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped." As for China, the CNBC host didn't mince any words either. According to him, China has "done nothing but build up" its military. Cramer does not trust the Chinese either. Quoting from the former Trump Administration's Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis' book, Cramer shared that where "the Chinese meet with Obama and they agree to everything and it's really terrific and then they, a day later, they violate everything with the South China Sea." Situations like these make him "think that we've been taken advantage of." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired the day after the Fed's rate cut. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

(see more details here). Potatoes being sorted on a conveyor belt in a modern packing facility. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 37 Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) is a well-known American firm that sells french fries. It is one of the worst-performing stocks on the market in 2024 as the shares are down 42% year-to-date. Like Conagra, the firm has struggled with declining volumes due to consumers struggling with high inflation. However, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) has also dealt with rising potato prices, which a lawsuit claims stems from due actions of a 'potato cartel.' The firm is also purportedly part of this cartel. US potato production dropped to a new low since 2010 by June 2024 and prices had surged by 36%. Cramer's comments around Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) revolved around management changes forced by activist investor Jana Partners: "What do they think the financial results are? What are the financial results of this man coming in. . . .of this change, the COO coming in [AS CEO]? . . . Disastrous! "Look, this company was doing better than its spin-off would have been, the company was spun off from Conagra. Uh, and I always felt, but hold on, wait a second, maybe Conagra should have kept french fries but in the end this is a company that is now worth $9 billion versus $12 billion when Conagra completely reversed. There was some way to make this company better. And you don't pick the guy who is part of the regime. Overall LW ranks 13th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of LW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

And you know what, NUKK is a punchline. Alright? It's a punchline." Overall NUKK ranks 17th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NUKK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI announced Monday it had raised $6 billion in a Series C funding round, with backing from major investors including BlackRock, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and other high-profile investors. Strategic investors NVIDIA and AMD also participated in the round, continuing their support for xAI’s infrastructure scaling efforts. The funding round was exclusive to xAI’s existing investors, many of whom had previously supported Musk’s acquisition of X, according to Financial Times. The latest financing, first revealed through a SEC filing last week, brings xAI’s total funding to $12 billion. It follows a previous $6 billion round completed earlier in 2024. According to CNBC, Musk’s AI business targets a valuation of around $50 billion, which would double its valuation six months ago. The fresh capital will be used to support the research and development of xAI’s generative AI model, Grok, and to expand its infrastructure, the team shared in the announcement. Since its Series B funding in May 2024, xAI has launched several key initiatives, including Colossus, which it describes as “the world’s largest AI supercomputer,” Grok 2, and the xAI API for developers. The company also introduced Aurora, its proprietary image generation model, and integrated Grok with the X platform to provide real-time information processing capabilities. xAI is currently training Grok 3, which it calls its “most powerful model yet.” The company aims for it to be comparable to or even surpass OpenAI’s GPT-5, with a focus on enhancing its capabilities in natural language understanding, image generation, and coding tasks. Musk anticipates that Grok 3 will be launched by the end of this year. Following its release, xAI plans to expand its infrastructure to include 200,000 GPUs, with the potential to scale up to as many as 300,000 GPUs in the future.

Title: Christmas walks: 10 family-friendly trails around Ireland, from easy to challenging

Expensive and demanding, Christmas sells itself by creating expectations of a relaxing time coalescing seamlessly with everyone. In reality, there is pressure to finish work, find the right gifts, remember every relative, and then being cooped with family for days. Yet, few would be without it, for it is also when we step off the treadmill to put family, friends and simpler things before competition and achievement. This is when quietness envelopes the landscape as nature takes a breather at a time when the outdoors are mostly shrouded in moody but atmospheric half-light. It makes it the perfect time to escape the embrace of domesticity and let your seasonal stresses melt away on one of the bracing family walks listed below. The town, which possesses some of Ireland’s finest medieval walls, is undergoing a transformation in recent times with the captivating Fethard Horse Country Experience and the spanking new dining destination at Sadler’s Restaurant and Bar. An innovative sports and recreation campus has also been created that offers 4G and grass pitches along with a gym and cosy cafe. Titled Fethard Town Park, it also boasts a 2km walkway around the perimeter. With an excellent surface for buggies or wheelchairs, this makes a perfect outdoor excursion for even the most inclement December day. Another outing offering a good surface, this walk is entirely within Cork city. This may seem off-putting, but it shouldn’t, for this is a varied outing offering much to fascinate. Starting from the riverside Marina car park, continue through Marina Park and on by Páirc Uí Chaoimh and Holland Park. Join a public road with the slow-flowing river Lee to your left. After a short distance, follow Castle Road left to reach Blackrock Castle, a 16th-century fortification, which is now an observatory. Onward next along a lovely riverside path for about 3km with sublime views across the water. Pass Joe McHugh Park and then cross a causeway. Go right along a sylvan path following the track bed of the old Passage Railway. Cross a footbridge above the South Ring Road and finish along an attractive 3km greenway leading back to Marina Park. Despite the hordes who descend on it year-round, Glendalough still exudes a mysterious and haunting quality that unmistakably denotes it as a special place. For a gentle introduction to this deep and sheltered valley, start from the Visitor Centre car park, by crossing a stream and following a green road past the famous monastery founded by St Kevin. Push past the Lower Lake to Glendalough’s upper car park. Turn right and follow the supremely tranquil waterside before going right again, and continuing along a boardwalk. Follow the north shore of the lower lake and finish on a Green Road leading to your start point, having walked just over 3km in about one hour. Located just off the N77 Kilkenny-to-Ballyragget road, Jenkinstown Estate, is where Thomas Moore penned his most famous poem The Last Rose of Summer. Despite its rather melancholic final verse, it became hugely popular and was soon being performed more often as a song. [ Winter walks: Eight picturesque trails with places to eat and drink at the endOpens in new window ] The great house, where Moore stayed is just a memory, but within the surrounding parklands you can still discover where the bard found inspiration by exploring the atmospheric woodlands that provide shelter on an imperfect day. The Walled Garden Loop (2km) and the slightly longer Jenkinstown Loop (3km) offer the perfect outing for families, with young children or buggies, wishing to wrap up and get out on an easy Christmas stroll. The distinctive landscape of Co Sligo has drawn visitors for generations to its multitude of accessible visitor attractions. But there is something especially rewarding about getting off the obvious tourist trail and capturing a modest hilltop. Located just west of Sligo town, Knocknarea is an eminence that simply drips with history and takes just a half-hour to ascend on an easy path. But the rewards are out of proportion to effort. The summit is adorned by a huge cairn, which is reputedly the burial pace of Connacht’s Queen Maeve and also offers a wonderful 360 view to Donegal Bay, Ben Bulben and the timeless Sligo landscape with Strandhill immediately below. Returning from the summit, you can regale the family with stories of the Táin Bó Cúailnge, when Maeve attempted to steal Ulster’s prize bull, Donn Cúailnge. This gentle 4.5km outing starts from Cadamstown by following the Slieve Bloom Way and blue arrows uphill along an old coach road before swinging to a rustic track known as Paul’s Lane. Onwards past the sombre remnants of the deserted Bordingstown village before parting company with the Slieve Bloom Way at a point offering views towards the deliciously named Wolftrap Mountain. Right and downhill, following the blue arrows and then through a gateway to continue across a Mass path that once conveyed mountain folk to worship. Next, tag a stream known locally as Purcell’s Brook to reach a beguiling little weir. Beyond, a stile leads to a spectacular path traversing the banks of the Silver river. Here the hurrying waters descend over pretty waterfalls and eddies, which can be viewed from the trail. Eventually abandoning the river, the path ascends to a wooden stile accessing farmland before turning left on to a bucolic laneway that ambles downhill to the trailhead. From the Nire Valley car park, which is located about 10km east of Ballymacarbery Village, follow the white poles marking an ancient trade route that once bisected the Comeraghs. Gain a low saddle between Knockanaffrin (Mass Mountain) and the immense Comeragh plateau, which is known locally as the Gap. Here, enchanting views will open up over the great flatlands of Waterford and Kilkenny to the distant outline of the Blackstairs Mountains. If you have enough for today, you can now retrace your steps to the Nire Valley car park after a two-hour outing. If you want to segue to a more challenging outing, swing northwest and ascend the Knockanaffrin Ridge, which rises in undemanding steps like a benign staircase to reach a level section above an attractive tear-shaped tarn known as Coumduala. From here, swing left and descend southwest by following a helpful fence and purple arrows to regain the trailhead after about three hours. [ Markets in Vienna or Christmas at The Shelbourne? 10 holiday escapes over the festive seasonOpens in new window ] If you really want to get the heart rate going, head for the parking place by the Graves of Leinstermen, lying about 6km north from the Tipperary village of Ballina. This unusual conclave of stones reputedly dates from Brian Boru’s kingship of Munster, when he supposedly showed himself the ultimate father-in-law from hell by massacring the King of Leinster’s entourage as they travelled to request Brian’s daughter in matrimony. Myths rearrange facts, however; this site is actually Bronze Age and predates Brian by about 2,000 years. Here, a zigzag path labours steeply up Tountinna (Hill of the Wave) – named after a biblical flood that reputedly drowned Ireland’s first inhabitants. One survivor was Fionntán, who cannily took refuge high on Tountinna. You will reach the ugly communications masts that adorn the summit in a little over a half-hour. Look beyond these, however, and you are compensated with mesmeric views over the opalescent waters of Lough Derg to the shimmering Clare Hills beyond. Return by your route of ascent. A magnificent swirl of naked limestone, Mullaghmore is a jewel even within the Burren’s rich treasury. From Corofin, take the Kilfenora Road, go right at Kilnaboy and right again at a parking place. Start your walk by following arrows from the roadside at Lough Gealáin where fossilised skeletons embedded within the limestone will fascinate younger folk and prove that the Burren originated as an ocean floor aeons ago. As you ascend, point to an isolated house; the kids will instantly recognise this as Father Ted’s bleakly unadorned dwelling from the eponymous soap opera. An enjoyable scramble leads to the summit, where a great panorama unfolds. Mullaghmore could truthfully be described as Ireland’s biggest little mountain; despite its modest stature, it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the views from loftier eminences such as Carrauntoohil and Errigal. Return to the trailhead by your ascent route after about 2.5 hours. Another mountain that punches above its modest height by offering panromantic views along with rocky summit tors. Begin from the car park on Sandbank Road, lying southeast of Hilltown off the Kilkeel Road. Cross the road and follow the lane for 500m and then go through a gate and tag an informal, grassy track to the left as it rises to a conversation-killing 220m. It’s a short upward flog, however, and soon two tors signal your approach to the summit. Pass left of these and continue straight ahead to gain the Summit Tor. Here, young people will love scrambling (with supervision) to the top, which is renowned for its sublime views, particularly at sunset. Afterwards, descend to the trailhead after an outing of about 1.5 hours. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with ˜yield' or ˜income'.

(NYSE: HYT), BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (NYSE: BTZ), BlackRock Limited Duration Income Trust (NYSE: BLW), BlackRock Core Bond Trust (NYSE: BHK) and BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust (NYSE: BIT) have adopted a Plan to support a level monthly distribution of income, capital gains and/or return of capital. The fixed amounts distributed per share are subject to change at the discretion of each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Under its Plan, each Fund will distribute all available net income to its shareholders, consistent with its investment objectives and as required by the Code. If sufficient income (inclusive of net investment income and short-term capital gains) is not available on a monthly basis, a Fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return capital to its stockholders in order to maintain a level distribution. Each of the above-listed Funds is currently not relying on any exemptive relief from Section 19(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). Each Fund expects that distributions under the Plan will exceed current income and capital gains and therefore will likely include a return of capital. Each Fund may make additional distributions from time to time, including additional capital gain distributions at the end of the taxable year, if required to meet requirements imposed by the Code and/or the 1940 Act.

Full Content:
NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--BlackRock Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NYSE: MUI, the Fund) is providing additional information related to the Fund's upcoming conversion from an exchange-listed closed-end fund to an unlisted continuously-offered closed-end fund that conducts quarterly repurchases of its shares (the Conversion) and will operate under the name BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Municipal Credit Alpha Portfolio, Inc. (the Interval Fund). It is currently anticipated that the Conversion will take place after the close of business on March 21, 2025, and be effective on March 24, 2025 (the Conversion Date). Delisting From the New York Stock Exchange In connection with the Conversion, the Fund intends to delist its shares of common stock (MUI Shares) from the New York Stock Exchange effective as of the close of business on February 14, 2025 (the Delisting Date). Please note that, effective as of the Delisting Date, the MUI Shares will no longer trade on the NYSE or any other securities exchange. The Conversion Date and the Delisting Date are subject to change. Any such changes will be announced via press release. Conversion and First Periodic Repurchase MUI Shares held on the Conversion Date will be redesignated as Institutional Shares of the Interval Fund (Interval Fund Shares). The Interval Fund Shares will not be listed for trading on any securities exchange and a secondary market is not expected to develop for the Interval Fund Shares. As a result, an investment in the Interval Fund is not a liquid investment. Shareholders will generally only be able to sell their Interval Fund Shares through the Interval Fund's quarterly offers to repurchase between 5% and 25% of the outstanding Interval Fund Shares. The Interval Fund currently intends to commence the initial repurchase offer in the second quarter of 2025. Although the Interval Fund intends to conduct quarterly repurchase offers, such repurchase offers may be oversubscribed. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed, the Interval Fund will repurchase the shares tendered on a pro rata basis, and shareholders will have to wait until the next repurchase offer to make another repurchase request. As a result, shareholders may be unable to liquidate all or a given percentage of their investment in the Interval Fund through a particular repurchase offer. Shareholders will be subject to the risk of NAV fluctuations and other investment-related risks during that period. Important Notice to Shareholders Who Hold Shares Through a Financial Intermediary Following the Conversion, the Interval Fund will offer one or more classes of shares through select financial intermediaries. Shareholders should be aware that not all financial intermediaries will offer to sell shares of the Interval Fund or support quarterly repurchase offers by the Interval Fund. SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD CONTACT THEIR FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO CONFIRM WHETHER THEIR INTERMEDIARY WILL SUPPORT QUARTERLY REPURCHASE OFFERS AND WHAT, IF ANY, EFFECT THE CONVERSION WILL HAVE ON THE SHAREHOLDER'S ACCOUNT.

Title: XAI Valuation Reaches Over $40 Billion After $6 Billion Funding Round

Elon Musk’s xAI announced Monday it raised $6 billion in a Series C funding round, putting the company’s value at more than $40 billion as it continues to strengthen its AI products and infrastructure. The funding round was announced Monday. (Photo by Muhammed Selim Korkutata/Anadolu via Getty Images) The company closed the $6 billion round and said the funding would be allocated toward products and infrastructure, likely referring to its Grok AI model and the multibillion-dollar supercomputer site in Memphis, Tennessee, used to train its AI models. Investors included Blackrock, A16Z, Saudi conglomerate holding company Kingdom Holding, Fidelity and Sequoia Capital, the latter three of which participated in xAI’s $6 billion Series B funding round in May. The latest funding round puts xAI’s valuation over $40 billion at least, as multiple reports have placed the value of Musk’s company at $40 billion or $50 billion. xAI said in its funding announcement it is training Grok 3, which is not yet available and was slated for release by the end of the year, according to a tweet from Musk in June.

Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. $12 billion. That is how much money xAI has raised this year from their Series B and Series C funding rounds, which included investors such as Morgan Stanley, Kingdom Holding, Andreessen Horowitz, chip designer Nvidia and semiconductor firm AMD. xAI has spent 2024 building its AI language models and the supercomputer used to train them. The computer, dubbed “Colossus,” features 100,000 Nvidia graphics processing units used to train AI and will eventually be doubled in size, allowing it to take on a significantly high training workload. Sam Altman, the CEO of xAI competitor OpenAI, lauded the short time needed to get the supercomputer operational and said during The New York Times DealBook Summit he assumes Musk’s firm will become “a really serious competitor” (OpenAI so far exceeds xAI’s value with a massive $157 billion valuation). Grok 2, xAI’s AI model, is available to users on X, formerly known as Twitter, though it does not yet operate on a standalone app the same way OpenAI’s ChatGPT does. Grok 3 will reportedly boast more computing power and improved responsiveness of its predecessor, according to the chatbot.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Updated December 25, 12:21 p.m. Pacific: Added details of xAI’s valuation and Kingdom Holdings’ contribution. xAI, Elon Musk’s AI company, has raised $6 billion in a Series C financing round. The company announced this week that Andreessen Horowitz , Blackrock, Fidelity, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, Nvidia, AMD, and others participated. Kingdom Holdings, the Saudi conglomerate holding company, invested roughly $400 million in the round, according to a public filing. The filing also revealed that xAI is now valued at $45 billion, close to double its previous valuation. The new cash brings xAI’s total raised to $12 billion, adding to the $6 billion tranche xAI raised in May. According to the Financial Times, only investors who’d backed xAI in its previous fundraising round were permitted to participate in this one. Reportedly, investors who helped finance Musk’s Twitter acquisition were given access to up to 25% of xAI’s shares. “xAI’s most powerful model yet … is currently training and we are now focused on launching innovative new consumer and enterprise products,” xAI said in a statement. “The funds from this financing round will be used to further accelerate our advanced infrastructure, ship groundbreaking products … and accelerate … research and development.” Musk formed xAI last year. Soon after, the company released Grok, a flagship generative AI model that now powers a number of features on X, including a chatbot accessible to X Premium subscribers and free users in some regions. Grok has what Musk has described as “a rebellious streak” — a willingness to answer “spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems.” Told to be vulgar, for example, Grok will happily oblige, spewing profanities and colorful language you won’t hear from ChatGPT. Musk has derided ChatGPT and other AI systems for being too “woke” and “politically correct,” despite Grok’s own unwillingness to cross certain boundaries and hedge on political subjects. He’s also referred to Grok as “maximally truth-seeking” and less biased than competing models, although there’s evidence to suggest that Grok leans to the left. Over the past year, Grok has become increasingly ingrained in X, the social network formerly known as Twitter. At launch, Grok was only available to X users — and developers skilled enough to get the “open source” edition up and running. Thanks to an integration with xAI’s in-house image generation model, Aurora, Grok can generate images on X (without guardrails, controversially). The model can analyze images as well, and summarize news and trending events — imperfectly, mind. Reports indicate that Grok may handle even more X functions in the future, from enhancing X’s search capabilities and account bios to helping with post analytics and reply settings. X recently got a “Grok button” designed to help users discover “relevant context” and dive deeper into trending discussions and real-time events. xAI is sprinting to catch up to formidable competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic in the generative AI race. The company launched an API in October, allowing customers to build Grok into third-party apps, platforms, and services. And it just rolled out a standalone Grok iOS app to a test audience. Musk asserts that it hasn’t been a fair fight. In a lawsuit filed against OpenAI and Microsoft, OpenAI’s close collaborator, attorneys for Musk accuse OpenAI of “actively trying to eliminate competitors” like xAI by “extracting promises from investors not to fund them.” OpenAI, Musk’s counsel says, also unfairly benefits from Microsoft’s infrastructure and expertise in what the attorneys describe as a “de facto merger.” Yet Musk often says that X’s data gives xAI a leg up compared to rivals. Last month, X changed its privacy policy to allow third parties, including xAI, to train models on X posts. Musk, it’s worth noting, was one of the original founders of OpenAI, and left the company in 2018 after disagreements over its direction. He’s argued in previous suits that OpenAI profited from his early involvement yet reneged on its nonprofit pledge to make the fruits of its AI research available to all. OpenAI, unsurprisingly, disagrees with Musk’s interpretation of events. In a mid-December press release, the company characterized Musk’s lawsuit as misleading, baseless, and a case of sour grapes. xAI has outlined a vision according to which its models would be trained on data from Musk’s various companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and the models could then improve technology across those companies. xAI is already powering customer support for SpaceX’s Starlink internet service, according to The Wall Street Journal, and the startup is said to be in talks with Tesla to provide R&D in exchange for some of the carmaker’s revenue. Tesla shareholders, for one, object to these plans. Several have sued Musk over his decision to start xAI, arguing that Musk has diverted both talent and resources from Tesla to what’s essentially a competing venture. Nevertheless, the deals — and xAI’s developer and consumer-facing products — have driven xAI’s revenue to around $100 million a year. For comparison, Anthropic is reportedly on pace to generate $1 billion in revenue this year, and OpenAI is targeting $4 billion by the end of 2024. Musk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its Memphis data center, which was apparently built in just 122 days and is currently powered partly by portable diesel generators. The company hopes to upgrade the server farm, which contains 100,000 Nvidia GPUs, next year; in a press release, xAI said it plans to fully double that number. (Because of their ability to perform many calculations in parallel, GPUs are the favored chips for training and running models.) In November, xAI won approval from the regional power authority in Memphis for 150MW of additional power — enough to power roughly 100,000 homes. To win the agency over, xAI pledged to improve the quality of the city’s drinking water and provide the Memphis grid with discounted Tesla-manufactured batteries. But some residents criticized the move, arguing it would strain the grid and worsen the area’s air quality. Tesla is also expected to use the upgraded data center to improve its autonomous driving technologies. xAI has expanded quite rapidly from an operations standpoint in the year since its founding, growing from just a dozen employees in March 2023 to over 100 today. In October, the startup moved into OpenAI’s old corporate offices in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. xAI has reportedly told investors it plans to raise more money next year. It won’t be the only AI lab raising immense cash. Anthropic recently secured $4 billion from Amazon, bringing its total raised to $13.7 billion, while OpenAI raised $6.6 billion in October to grow its war chest to $17.9 billion. Megadeals like OpenAI’s and Anthropic’s drove AI venture capital activity to $31.1 billion across over 2,000 deals in Q3 2024, per PitchBook data. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter!

Title: The Protocol: Trump Makes More Pro-Crypto Appointments

Welcome to The Protocol, CoinDesk's weekly wrap-up of the most important stories in cryptocurrency tech development. In this week’s issue of the Protocol newsletter: This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. TRUMP CRYPTO APPOINTMENTS: President-elect Donald Trump continues to make high-profile appointments embracing cryptocurrency and emerging technologies in his second term. 1) Stephen Miran, tapped as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, is a pro-crypto advocate who aims to integrate blockchain and decentralized finance into the U.S. economy. 2) Bo Hines, a former college football player, will head the newly formed Crypto Council. Hines is tasked with balancing innovation and consumer protection as he builds a regulatory framework for digital assets. 3) David Sacks, a veteran of Silicon Valley and vocal blockchain supporter, is stepping in as AI and Crypto Czar. Sacks plans to merge blockchain with AI while bolstering U.S. dominance in both sectors. These appointments signal a clear shift from Trump’s earlier skepticism of digital assets. The big question now is how these moves translate into meaningful policy amid regulatory gridlock and political friction. APTOS LEADERSHIP SHIFT: Aptos Labs CEO and co-founder Mo Shaikh has stepped down, with co-founder Avery Ching taking over as CEO. Shaikh, who will remain a strategic adviser, highlighted the company's achievements, including raising $400 million in venture funding and building a thriving ecosystem supported by partners like BlackRock, Google, Mastercard, and PayPal. Known for its layer-1 blockchain leveraging the Move programming language from Facebook's Diem project, Aptos Labs is expanding into finance and AI applications with the help of advisers like former Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and OpenAI’s Kevin Weil. The leadership transition underscores the company’s ongoing focus on scalability, security, and innovation in blockchain technology. SONIC TO AIRDROP TIKTOK: Sonic, a Layer 2 solution on the Solana blockchain, has announced plans to airdrop its native token, SONIC, to TikTok users. This initiative aims to introduce TikTok's vast user base to decentralized finance (DeFi) by integrating blockchain technology with social media platforms. The airdrop is part of Sonic's strategy to enhance user engagement and promote the adoption of Layer 2 solutions for improved scalability and reduced transaction costs on the Solana network. By targeting TikTok users, Sonic seeks to bridge the gap between mainstream social media audiences and the DeFi ecosystem, fostering broader participation in decentralized financial services. ALSO: Kraken, the seventh-largest crypto exchange, said its layer-2 rollup network, built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, has gone live. The network, called Ink, is based on the OP stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build their own rollups using Optimism’s technology. The team had originally planned for Ink to go live in early 2025, so the launch of its main network is ahead of schedule. Kraken agreed to receive 25 million OP tokens (worth about $58 million) as part of a deal to build on the OP Stack. Optimism has acknowledged that handing out developer grants for participants building on the stack is part of its strategy, which in turn contributes back to the wider “Superchain” ecosystem.Kraken competitor Coinbase said in August 2023 that it would build a layer-2 network with OP Stack. The product, called Base, is now the second-largest rollup network according to L2beat. At the time, Optimism said the Base team would receive up to 118 million OP tokens and, in return, would contribute the higher of 2.5% of its sequencer revenue or 15% of its profits to the Optimism Collective. Read the full story by Margaux Nijkerk here Fundraising Deals & Grants Data & Tokens Hyper Liquid, a cryptocurrency exchange focused on perpetual contracts, has reported a record outflow of $60 million in USDC amid speculation that North Korea is investigating the platform. The sudden exodus of funds raises questions about the exchange’s liquidity and the stability of its operations. This highlights the growing tension of crypto markets with geopolitical issues, as regulatory scrutiny and potential misuse of platforms by state actors come into focus. The incident underscores the vulnerabilities in crypto markets, particularly for exchanges dealing with high-risk financial products like perpetual contracts. Hyper Liquid’s situation may prompt further scrutiny of similar platforms, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards in the face of increasing global regulatory pressure.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Biggest Gainers of Last Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) stands against other biggest gainers of last week. Investors gobbled up shares of predominantly technology companies last week, following announcements of multi-billion dollars of investments, quantum technology backing, and new contracts, among others. Let’s take a look at last week’s Top 10 Gainers and explore the reasons behind their impressive performance. To come up with the biggest winners of last week, we considered only the stocks that have at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A quantum computer on a countertop in an engineering laboratory with a technician at work. Similar to Rigetti, quantum computing investors continued to watch out closely for clues on industry developments. Over the past year, IonQ’s stock prices registered a jump of 226 percent, sparking interest from investors. In addition, various Wall Street analysts weighed in positively on the technology and on IonQ, specifically. Last Monday, Morgan Stanley Joseph Moore increased his price target for IonQ to $37 from $14.90, saying, “We can’t identify a clear catalyst for this kind of equity appreciation in the space over that time, but we do see continued indications that investment in quantum should continue growing at a rapid pace.” Additionally, Google unveiled its new chip Willo, which also appeared to have had a bullish effect on quantum stocks. Overall, IONQ ranks 4th on our list of biggest gainers of last week.

Title: The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL): Among the Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Biggest Dividend Cuts and Suspensions of 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) stands against the other stocks. Dividends hold great appeal for investors—they appreciate receiving them and strongly dislike reductions. Despite this, numerous major companies have reduced their dividend payments over time for various reasons. This trend, which gained momentum in 2020, persists as many companies continue to recover from the financial impact of the pandemic, leading to further dividend cuts. According to research by McKinsey, outside of financial crises, only 1% to 2% of dividend-paying companies reduce their payouts annually, typically involving seven or eight major firms. The key for investors is to identify such companies in advance and avoid them until after the dividend has been reduced, which can present new opportunities. However, predicting which companies might cut dividends can be challenging. Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek highlighted three warning signs: excessively high yields, which may indicate underlying problems; high debt levels, which divert cash flow to interest payments rather than shareholders; and a high payout of free cash flow, leaving little cushion for the company in times of economic downturns or recessions. Also read: 10 Dividend Stocks For Steady Income While dividend cuts are generally disappointing for investors, Morgan Stanley offers an interesting perspective on them. Although dividend stocks typically suffer when payouts are reduced, some of these stocks might still present opportunities, according to the firm. Companies often cut dividends due to financial difficulties or economic challenges. Research from Morgan Stanley shows that investors usually sell off these stocks in the six months after the cuts are announced. However, once the initial negative reaction is factored in, there may be attractive buying opportunities in certain cases, as noted by strategist Todd Castagno. Here are some comments from the analyst: “In the 6-months following a change in regular quarterly dividend policy, we found companies that announced a dividend cut of more than -25% underperformed the market by -1,200 bps, on average, while smaller dividend reductions outperformed by +480 bps, on average.” According to Castagno, one year after announcing a dividend reduction, companies that cut their payouts by 30% or less outperformed the market by 1,900 basis points, while those with cuts deeper than 30% lagged the market by 1,800 basis points on average. Morgan Stanley analyzed Russell 1000 dividend-paying companies that reduced their dividends between 1962 and 2024. Over the past year, numerous companies have lowered their payouts, and the firm compiled a list of 30 such companies, excluding those in the financial, utilities, and real estate sectors. While many firms implemented significant dividend cuts, several reduced their dividends by 30% or less. That said, many companies have regained strong footing and recovered quickly after the pandemic, which has led to a decline in the number of dividend cuts over the years. A report by S&P Dow Jones Indices revealed that only 27 companies reduced their dividends in Q3 2024, marking a 56.5% decrease from 62 companies in Q3 2023. The total value of these cuts was $4.6 billion in Q3 2024, down from $9.2 billion in the same quarter the previous year. Over the 12 months ending in September 2024, 140 companies reduced their dividend payments, a significant 70.8% drop from 479 cuts in the prior 12-month period. The overall value of dividend decreases for the current period was $19.5 billion, a 26.4% reduction compared to $26.4 billion during the previous 12 months. Despite these encouraging numbers, many major companies have disappointed investors by reducing their dividend payouts in 2024. Our Methodology: For this list, we checked companies that have announced dividend reductions in 2024 due to the current market conditions and other factors and picked 10 prominent names from that list. Next, we ranked these stocks according to the number of hedge fund investors having stakes in them at the end of Q3 2024, according to Insider Monkey's database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NYSE:EL) is an American multinational cosmetics company that offers a wide range of related products and services. Due to the complexities of the prestige beauty market, including the challenges in predicting the timing of recovery in mainland China and Asia travel retail, the company slashed its dividend to a more suitable payout ratio. This reduction also provides greater financial flexibility for the incoming leadership team to accelerate the company's profitable growth. The company still considers dividends an important part of its capital allocation strategy, provided the payout ratio is appropriate. In fiscal Q1 2025, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) reported revenue of $3.36 billion, down by 4.5% from the same period last year. Despite its challenges, the company is working to overcome its struggles. It has seen strong organic sales growth in the Skin Care category, particularly in the EMEA markets, driven by the popularity of its night-time innovations. In addition, the company achieved significant share gains in prestige Skin Care in China for the second consecutive quarter, led by La Mer. The company has also advanced its strategy to capitalize on the growth opportunities in Fragrance. It expanded the reach of its luxury and artisanal portfolio and launched BALMAIN Beauty, aiming to solidify its strategic position in the luxury Fragrance market. This was reflected in the quarter when the company became the top-ranked player in Japan’s Fragrance category, driven by Le Labo and Jo Malone London. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) ended the quarter with $2.35 billion available in cash and cash equivalents. During the quarter, it returned $0.24 billion to shareholders through dividends. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share for a dividend yield of 1.88%, as of December 22. As per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 49 hedge funds owned stakes in The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), up from 47 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a consolidated value of over $1.87 billion. Among these hedge funds, D E Shaw was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall EL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks with the biggest dividend cuts in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of EL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21 Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is a Missouri-based manufacturing company that mainly specializes in products found in homes and automobiles. Before slashing its dividend this year, the company was a Dividend King with 52 consecutive years of dividend growth under its belt. Unfortunately, the company can no longer be considered a dividend grower following its decision to implement an 89% dividend cut earlier this year. This move wasn’t unexpected, as the company's cash flow had been persistently volatile, putting pressure on its balance sheet. Free cash flow, which stood at over $602 million in 2020, declined to $497.2 million by 2023. As a result, the stock is down by over 63% since the start of 2024. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) reported mixed earnings in the third quarter of 2024. The company's revenue of $1.10 billion fell by 6.27% from the same period last year. The revenue also missed analysts' estimates by $2.12 million. Despite this, the company managed to reduce its debt by $124 million, and its adjusted EBIT margin improved by 60 basis points sequentially during the quarter. That said, Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) is not completely out of the woods as management indicated that weak demand in residential end markets is likely to continue into the fourth quarter, driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and reduced consumer spending. Furthermore, the Automotive segment remains under pressure due to challenges associated with the shift to electric vehicles, affordability concerns among consumers, and economic weakness in Europe. Consequently, the company has revised its sales and earnings per share (EPS) guidance downward. Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.06%, as recorded on December 22. As per Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024, 21 hedge funds held stakes in Leggett & Platt, Incorporated (NYSE:LEG), the same as in the previous quarter. The overall value of these stakes is over $127.7 million. With over 2.1 million shares, D E Shaw was the company's leading stakeholder in Q3. Overall LEG ranks 7th on our list of the stocks with the biggest dividend cuts in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of LEG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LEG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Time Published: 2024-12-23T17:26:53Z

The recently-released 2025 Crypto Market Outlook report by Coinbase Institutional provides a comprehensive analysis of the cryptocurrency industry’s trajectory. Cryptocurrencies are evolving beyond their speculative origins, with the total market capitalization surging 96% in 2024 to reach $3.4 trillion by December. Coinbase attributes this growth to significant milestones such as the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. and the rapid proliferation of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Coinbase highlights the pivotal role of institutional players in driving crypto adoption. Inflows into spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, led by BlackRock and Fidelity, totaled $30.7 billion in 2024, illustrating the confidence of traditional asset managers in digital assets. Beyond ETFs, tokenized government securities and private credit have been embraced by firms such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. Tokenized RWAs grew by 60% in 2024 to a market size of $13.5 billion, with projections suggesting growth could exceed $30 trillion over the next five years. This transformation is expected to streamline cross-border settlements and create 24/7 markets for traditionally illiquid assetshe “Killer App” of Crypto** Coinbase calls stablecoins the “killer app” of the crypto ecosystem, noting their 48% market cap growth in 2024 to $193 billion. Stablecoins settled $27.1 trillion in transactions during the year, triple the amount in 2023. According to Coinbase, innovations in programmable stablecoins and their integration into global payment systems are unlocking unprecedented efficiencies for remittances and cross-border commerce. Coinbase looks at the role of stablecoins in addressing systemic challenges like the U.S. debt burden, and says policymakers are increasingly recognizing their potential . The report sheds light on groundbreaking innovations such as Ethereum’s Dencun upgrade in March 2024, which cut rollup transaction costs by up to 90%. The adoption of layer-2 solutions has surged, with daily transactions on Ethereum-based rollups growing by 289% in 2024. These advancements are making blockchain technology more scalable, cost-effective, and user-friendly. Further upgrades, like Ethereum’s Pectra fork planned for early 2025, aim to enhance network efficiency while laying the groundwork for smart wallet adoption . Regulatory clarity is highlighted as a key driver for crypto market growth in 2025. Coinbase notes that progress in global regulatory frameworks has improved institutional confidence in the asset class. Developments in major jurisdictions, including the United States, Europe, and Asia, are expected to shape a more predictable environment for both investors and developers. Coinbase emphasizes that clearer regulations will foster greater consumer trust and accelerate mainstream adoption of digital assets. The integration of arlligence (AI) and blockchain technology is identified as a major trend. Coinbase describes the emergence of autonomous AI agents capable of managing crypto wallets and facilitating transactions as a potential game-changer. While the long-term implications remain uncertain, the convergence of AI and crypto could unlock novel use cases and drive further adoption .

According to Global Market Insights, the growing urbanization and infrastructure development are expected to fuel the global freight trucking industry, which was valued at $2.5 trillion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 4.2% between 2024 and 2032. The market is divided into local and long-haul groups based on distance. The local segment’s market share was approximately 55% in 2023, and by 2032, it is anticipated to surpass $1.5 trillion. The freight trucking market is divided into many segments based on trucks, including refrigerated trucks, flatbed trucks, truck trailers, and lorry tanks. In 2023, the truck trailer segment’s market share was approximately 36%. In terms of revenue share, the North American freight trucking market had a 35% position in 2023. Connectivity is anticipated to be crucial in changing these market segments as the industry develops further. Rupert Stuetzle, general manager of EMEA manufacturing and mobility, stated, “When we look at full logistics-as-a-service solutions, connected services could support higher-level services beyond road transport.” According to a research report by McKinsey & Company, improvements in fleet management, driver assistance, and the adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) could open up a profit pool of over $3 billion by 2035 because of connected, data-enabled services in commercial vehicles. For instance, fleet management systems already assist big retailers in reducing their diesel usage by up to 8%, and linked ZEVs allow for charge planning and route optimization. By 2030, it is projected that 20–25% of new vehicle sales in the US and 40% in Europe will be ZEVs. Additionally, generative AI is simplifying aftermarket services and vehicle design, with OEM-neutral solutions and new data marketplaces opening up new revenue streams. Initiatives like Eclipse SDV and COVESA are building open data standards, which will improve fleet connection and operational efficiency. The truck sales industry is anticipated to stay stable in 2024 as a result of these standards. According to the S&P Mobility report, truck sales are likely to stay unchanged in 2024, but due to better economic conditions and the incentive to purchase before 2027 diesel-truck pollution regulations take effect, momentum is anticipated to rise toward a record-setting 2026. Through the midterm, the industry’s adoption of electric cars will be shaped by federal Greenhouse Gas Phase 3 emission regulations and California’s Advanced Clean Trucks law. As per S&P Mobility, the industry’s zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) ambitions and aspirations are at a crossroads in the next 36 months. However, recently, the American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) claimed that the trucking business is suffering greatly as a result of traffic congestion on US highways. According to ATRI’s Cost of Congestion research, operating expenses soared despite fewer hours of congestion, costing the U.S. trucking industry $108.8 billion in 2022—a 15% increase from 2021. This translates to $7,588 per registered truck and more than 430,000 truck drivers sitting idle for a year. Texas, California, and Florida led state costs with $9.17 billion, $8.77 billion, and $8.44 billion, respectively, accounting for 52% of overall costs. The cities with the largest urban delays were Chicago ($3.14 billion), Miami ($3.2 billion), and New York City ($6.68 billion). Fuel expenses rose by $32.1 billion due to the waste of 6.4 billion gallons of diesel. With the holiday season around the corner, the trucking and logistics industry is experiencing strong Christmas demand, fueled by high consumer spending and e-commerce. According to the National Retail Federation, retail sales are projected to surge by 2.5% to 3.5% over 2023, with a near-record 197 million shoppers expected over Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. In addition, According to a survey, 48% of small and medium-sized businesses anticipate more holiday sales than they did the year before. “Despite negative expectations, the U.S. consumer is still in healthy shape,” remarked Mazen Danaf, staff applied scientist and economist at Uber Freight. Despite supply chain issues and port disruptions, growth has been fueled by investments in fulfillment and route optimization, record Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales, and faster delivery times.

(see more details here) Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 30 One of the Best Freight Stocks, Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX), is the largest truckload carrier in the United States, delivering a wide range of transportation services. According to the company’s asset-based trucking business, approximately 82% of revenue comes from the U.S. Xpress deal pro forma. Full truckload (for-hire dry van, refrigerated, and dedicated contract) accounts for 69% of revenue, while less than truckload accounts for 13%. Intermodal accounts for around 6% of revenue, while truck brokerage and other asset-light logistics services account for 9%. The firm’s intermodal operations comprise drayage (regional trucking services to and from inland intermodal ramps/terminals) and the underlying movement of its shipping containers on Class I railroads. Services provided to shippers and third-party truckers, such as equipment leasing and maintenance, make up the remaining revenue. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX)’s bull case is its rising less-than-truckload (LTL) business, which had a 16.7% revenue increase yearly in Q3 of 2024, due to network development with 16 new locations and the DHE purchase. Improvements in the operating ratio also indicate operational efficiency, and the logistics segment’s increased revenue per load by 13.6% YoY shows pricing power. Additionally, in Q3 of 2024, the operating cash increased by 41.46% yearly. Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KNX) price objective was increased from $62 to $68. According to the company, significantly higher less-than-truckload multiples indicate that the market is excited about opportunities beyond the current slowdown.

The company argues that an upcycle study reveals the group has a lot of volume potential, which is strengthened by share increases in addition to demand recovery.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Diamondback Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) stands against other oil and gas stocks to invest in according to hedge funds. With a record average production of 12.9 million barrels per day in 2023, the United States is the Biggest Oil Producing Country in the World. Every year, the indigenous production of oil and gas helps save American consumers an estimated $203 billion, or $2,500 for each family of four. Moreover, the oil and gas industry supports over 12 million American jobs, provides billions of dollars in tax revenue, and ensures energy security. READ ALSO: 11 Best Cannabis Stocks to Invest In According to OPEC, the global oil demand increased by 2.5 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2023 to average 102.2 mb/d, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the first time. The major part of this uptick came from the non-OECD countries, which posted YoY growth of about 2.4 mb/d to average 56.4 mb/d, surpassing pre-pandemic levels for the second consecutive year. As per the IEA’s recent market outlook, growth in the global demand for oil is expected to slow down in the coming years as energy transitions advance. However, despite the sluggish growth, the world oil demand is still forecast to be 3.2 mb/d higher in 2030 than in 2023, unless stronger policy measures are implemented or changes in behavior take hold. As 2024 comes to a close, oil prices have moved in the narrowest range this year since 2019, with Brent crude oil prices exhibiting a minimal average monthly change and a monthly range-bound movement between $69 and $90. The general opinion is that a soft demand, coupled with an abundant supply, even on hold, has contributed to the relative stability we witnessed this year. China’s faltering economy and its shift towards electric vehicles and LNG-fueled trucks weighed heavily on the crude oil demand this year. According to a recent report by the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, the world’s largest oil-importing country may see its demand peak in 2025, five years earlier than expected, as the shift away from fossil fuels accelerates. The report reveals that China’s oil demand could reach 770 million tons next year, before gradually falling to 240 million tons by 2060. As a consequence of the slowdown in the global oil demand, Brent futures prices have shed more than 5% so far this year, setting up a second consecutive annual loss. J.P. Morgan analysts have predicted that the global oil market is widely expected to be in a surplus in 2025, as supply will outpace demand to the tune of 1.2 million b/d. Brent crude prices are forecast to average around $73 a barrel next year, according to a Reuters tally of 11 brokerages that have issued price targets. The bleak outlook has inevitably caused the oil and gas stocks to tumble and the broader market’s Energy sector has dropped by 13.42% over the last month, while the overall market has stayed relatively stable and lost only 0.3% during the same period. However, despite the falling prices and decreasing margins, the oil and gas industry is contributing massively to the global economy and shareholder return. A recent report from Deloitte has revealed that the O&G sector distributed nearly $213 billion in dividends and $136 billion in buybacks between January 2024 and mid-November 2024. Also, over the last four years, the industry’s capital expenditures have increased by 53%, while its net profit has risen by nearly 16%. Moreover, an increasing number of oil majors are now investing in low-carbon technology projects to help balance the risks associated with the traditional fossil fuel market. To collect data for this article, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds and picked the top 8 companies operating in the oil and gas sector with the highest number of hedge fund investors. When two or more companies had the same number of hedge funds investing in them, we ranked them by the revenue of their last financial year instead. Following are the Best Energy Stocks Held by the Most Hedge Funds. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Title: House Judiciary Committee sends letters to investment firms tied to ‘woke ESG cartel’
URL: https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/business/house-judiciary-committee-probes-investment-firms-over-esg-ties/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T15:01:28Z
Full Content:
The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee took aim at a group of US asset managers over their involvement with a “woke ESG cartel” — adding pressure against environmental efforts by large investors. The committee, chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, sent letters to 60 firms — including BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — that are members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, or NZAM, an international group of investors that signed on to a pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The letters, sent Friday, made claims in line with a committee report released on Dec. 13 that Republicans say showed fund firms colluded to cut emissions. That report found that top asset managers in the US were concerned that signing up for an industry climate initiative would make them look like they worked too closely together and attract regulatory scrutiny. The committee’s Democrats have dismissed such claims, and big fund firms have denied similar charges. Jordan alleges in the letter that that companies’ efforts with NZAM and the affiliated Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero “may violate U.S. antitrust law,” citing the earlier report. It asks for information such as how companies’ participation in NZAM changed their stewardship strategies. GOP Judiciary Committee members claim that investor preoccupation with environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies takes the focus away from delivering profits for shareholders and imposes unnecessary restrictions on business. Republicans previously have taken credit for prompting three fund managers — BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — to step back from another investor group, the Climate Action 100+. Mindy Lubber, CEO of Boston-based environmental advocacy group Ceres, an organizing partner of NZAM, said in an interview that the letters were “consistent with other efforts to suggest that investors ought not to consider climate risk, when of course they should be aware of climate risk as part of their fiduciary duty.” NZAM says that its initiative has attracted some 325 signatories managing $57.5 trillion globally, according to its website.

Title: 7 Predictions For Crypto In 2025: Bitcoin, ETFs & Global Adoption
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeorshimron/2024/12/23/7-predictions-for-crypto-in-2025-bitcoin-etfs--global-adoption/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T15:00:23Z
Full Content:
7 Predictions for Crypto in 2025: Bitcoin, ETFs & Global Adoption The year 2024 marked a historic turning point for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. It saw the launch of the first Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, signaling genuine institutional adoption. Bitcoin shattered the $100,000 milestone for the first time, while stablecoins continued to reinforce the global dominance of the US dollar. Adding to this momentum, the winning U.S. presidential candidate made support for Bitcoin a central pillar of his campaign. Collectively, these milestones cemented 2024 as the year the crypto industry proved itself to be an unstoppable force on the global stage. As the industry shifts its focus to 2025, here are my seven predictions of major events we can expect to take place next year. 1) A major G7 or BRICS nation will establish and announce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The Trump administration’s proposal to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) for the United States has sparked widespread debate and speculation. While adding Bitcoin to the U.S. Treasury’s balance sheet would require considerable political willpower and congressional approval, the mere suggestion of such an initiative carries profound implications. By signaling the possibility of an SBR, the U.S. effectively invites other major nations to consider a similar move. Game theory suggests that these countries may feel incentivized to preemptively act, potentially front-running the U.S. to secure a strategic advantage in diversifying their national reserves. Bitcoin’s limited supply and its emerging role as a digital store of value could heighten the urgency for nations to act quickly. The race is now on for the first major country to integrate Bitcoin into its reserve strategy, diversifying alongside traditional holdings like gold, foreign currencies, and sovereign bonds. Such a move would not only solidify Bitcoin’s status as a global reserve asset but could also reshape the dynamics of international finance, with far-reaching implications for economic and geopolitical power structures. The establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by any leading economy could mark the beginning of a new era in sovereign wealth management. 2) Stablecoin growth will continue, doubling to exceed $400 billion Stablecoins have emerged as one of crypto's most successful mainstream use cases, offering a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto ecosystem. Across the globe, millions use stablecoins for remittance payments, everyday transactions, and as a hedge against the volatility of local currencies by accessing the relative stability of the U.S. dollar. In 2024, stablecoins reached an all-time high of $200 billion in circulating supply, dominated by market leaders Tether and Circle. These digital currencies rely on blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Solana, and Tron to facilitate seamless, borderless transactions. Looking ahead, stablecoin growth is poised to accelerate in 2025, potentially doubling to exceed $400 billion. This growth will be fueled by the likely passage of stablecoin-specific legislation, which could provide much-needed regulatory clarity and foster innovation within the sector. U.S. regulators are increasingly recognizing the strategic importance of stablecoins in strengthening the global dominance of the U.S. dollar, reinforcing its status as the world’s reserve currency. Stablecoins reached a new all time high this year exceeding $200 billion in total supply for the ... [+] first time. The growth was led by Tether and Circle's USDC. 3) Bitcoin DeFi enabled by L2s will be a dominant growth trend Bitcoin is evolving beyond its role as a store of value, with Layer 2 (L2) networks like Stacks, BOB, Babylon, CoreDAO, and others unlocking the potential for a thriving Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. These L2s enhance Bitcoin's scalability and programmability, enabling decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to flourish on the most secure and decentralized blockchain. In 2024, Stacks had a transformative year with the launch of the Nakamoto Upgrade and sBTC. The Nakamoto Upgrade allowed Stacks to inherit 100% Bitcoin finality and introduced faster block speeds, significantly improving user experience. Meanwhile, sBTC, a trustless Bitcoin-pegged asset launched in December, enabled seamless participation in DeFi activities such as lending, borrowing, swapping, and staking—all anchored to Bitcoin’s security. Previously, Bitcoin holders seeking DeFi opportunities were forced to wrap their Bitcoin on other networks like Ethereum. This process relies on centralized custodians such as WBTC (BitGo), BTCB (Binance), and cbBTC (Coinbase), exposing users to centralization and censorship risks. Bitcoin L2s reduce these risks, offering a more decentralized alternative to put Bitcoin to work natively within its own ecosystem. Looking ahead to 2025, Bitcoin DeFi is poised for exponential growth. I predict that the total value locked (TVL) on Bitcoin L2s will surpass the $24 billion currently represented by wrapped Bitcoin derivatives, which accounts for about 1.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. With Bitcoin’s market cap at $2 trillion, L2 networks will enable users to more securely and efficiently unlock this immense latent value, solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a cornerstone of decentralized finance. Wrapped Bitcoin derivative tokens on other blockchains make up over $24 billion or about 1.2% of the ... [+] total Bitcoin supply. 4) Bitcoin ETFs will continue their surge and new crypto-focused ETFs will emerge The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a historic milestone, becoming the most successful ETF debut in history. Attracting over $108 billion in assets under management (AUM) within its first year, these ETFs demonstrated unparalleled demand from both retail and institutional investors. Major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest played pivotal roles in bringing regulated Bitcoin exposure to traditional financial markets, setting the stage for a wave of innovation in crypto-focused ETFs. The Bitcoin ETFs were the most successful ETF launch ever. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, almost ... [+] doubled its Gold ETF, IAU, just in its first year. Following the success of Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs debuted, offering investors exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Looking ahead, I anticipate that staking will be integrated into Ethereum ETFs for the first time in 2025. This feature would enable investors to earn staking rewards, further enhancing the appeal and utility of these funds. I anticipate that ETFs will soon launch for other leading crypto protocols such as Solana, which has gained prominence for its high-performance blockchain, thriving DeFi ecosystem, and rapid growth in gaming, NFTs and memecoins. Additionally, we are likely to see the introduction of weighted crypto index ETFs designed to offer diversified exposure across the broader crypto market. These indices could include a mix of top-performing assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and others, along with emerging protocols, providing investors with a balanced portfolio that captures the growth potential of the entire ecosystem. Such innovations will make crypto investing more accessible, efficient, and appealing to a wide range of investors, further driving capital into the space. 5) A “Magnificent Seven” company will add Bitcoin to its balance sheet (beyond Tesla) The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has introduced fair value accounting rules for cryptocurrencies, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. These new standards require companies to report their crypto holdings, such as Bitcoin, at fair market value, capturing both gains and losses from market fluctuations in real-time. Previously, digital assets were classified as intangible assets, which forced companies to write down impaired holdings while prohibiting the recognition of unrealized gains. This conservative approach often understated the true value of crypto holdings on corporate balance sheets. The updated rules address these limitations, enabling more accurate financial reporting and making cryptocurrencies a more attractive asset for corporate treasuries. The Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla, and Meta—together hold over $600 billion in cash reserves, offering them significant flexibility to allocate a portion of their capital to Bitcoin. With the enhanced accounting framework and increasing regulatory clarity, it’s highly plausible that one of these tech giants, beyond Tesla, will add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Such a move would reflect prudent financial management by: As the new accounting rules take effect and corporate treasuries adapt, Bitcoin could emerge as a key reserve asset for the world’s largest tech companies, further legitimizing its role in the global financial system. 6) Total crypto market cap will exceed $8 trillion In 2024, the total cryptocurrency market cap surged to an all-time high of $3.8 trillion, encompassing a broad array of use cases, including Bitcoin as a store of value, stablecoins, DeFi, NFTs, memecoins, GameFi, SocialFi, and beyond. This explosive growth reflects the sector's expanding influence and the growing adoption of blockchain-based solutions across diverse industries. By 2025, the influx of developer talent into the crypto ecosystem is expected to accelerate, driving the creation of new applications that achieve product-market fit and onboard millions of additional users. This wave of innovation is likely to spawn breakthrough decentralized applications (dApps) in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), and other emerging fields still in their infancy. These transformative dApps, offering tangible utility and solving real-world problems, will fuel increased adoption and economic activity within the ecosystem. As user bases expand and capital flows into the space, asset prices will follow suit, pushing the overall market capitalization to unprecedented heights. With this momentum, the crypto market is on track to surpass $8 trillion, marking continued growth and innovation for the industry. 7) A renaissance for crypto startups, the US will return as the global crypto powerhouse The U.S. crypto industry is on the brink of a transformative resurgence. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s controversial “regulation by enforcement” approach, which stifled innovation and drove many crypto startups offshore, will conclude with his departure in January. His successor, Paul Atkins, brings a starkly different perspective. A former SEC commissioner (2002–2008), Atkins is renowned for his pro-crypto stance, support for deregulation, and leadership in initiatives like the Token Alliance, a pro-crypto advocacy group. His approach promises a more collaborative regulatory framework, fostering innovation rather than suppressing it. The end of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a covert initiative that limited crypto startups’ access to the U.S. banking system, further sets the stage for a renaissance. By restoring equitable access to banking infrastructure, the U.S. is creating an environment where blockchain developers and entrepreneurs can thrive without undue constraints. The improved regulatory clarity and renewed support for innovation will also lead to a significant increase in token launches within the U.S. Startups will feel empowered to issue tokens as part of their fundraising and ecosystem-building efforts without the fear of regulatory backlash. These tokens, ranging from utility tokens for decentralized applications to governance tokens for protocols, will attract domestic and international capital while encouraging participation in U.S.-based projects. Conclusion As we look ahead to 2025, it’s clear that the crypto industry is entering a new era of growth and maturity. With Bitcoin solidifying its role as a global reserve asset, the rise of ETFs, and the exponential growth of DeFi and stablecoins, the groundwork is being laid for widespread adoption and mainstream attention. Supported by clearer regulations and groundbreaking technologies, the crypto ecosystem is set to push boundaries and shape the future of global finance. These predictions highlight a year brimming with potential, as the industry continues to prove itself as an unstoppable force. One Community. Many Voices.
