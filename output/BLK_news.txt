Title: Reimagined 1970s three-bed apartment in the heart of Ballsbridge for €800,000

One of Dublin 4’s most sought after addresses, Pembroke Road, is a short stroll to cafes and restaurants on Baggot Street Upper and a short walk up the two bridges in either direction on the Grand Canal will take you to local Dart and Luas stops. A 15-minute stroll will have you in the centre of St Stephen’s Green, the Aviva Stadium for rugby internationals and the villages of Ranelagh, Donnybrook and Sandymount, all of which have a great selection of pubs and restaurants. Number 75 Pembroke Road is set well back from the road itself. It originally had an office block to one side, which was replaced in the 1970s with a set of apartments, though is accessed through the original period doorway. Located just off the junction triangle of Northumberland, Lansdowne and Pembroke Roads, it’s as smack bang in the centre of Ballsbridge as you can get. Sharing its site with 30 other units, number 21 Pembroke Court is a second-floor dual aspect apartment that has just been released to the market through estate agent Owen Reilly. It has three bedrooms and a generous 97sq m (1,044sq ft) of floor space that has undergone a recent transformation since its owner purchased the unit in early 2021, for €525,000, according to the Property Price Register. It’s a smashing renovation of a 1970s unit that had little in the way of features until its owners gave it a stylish upgrade: “It was easy to see its potential, even though nothing had been done since the 1970s,” says its owner, adding “you don’t always get the luxury of all-square rooms, with proper windows that overlook a garden, but that, and the location made us buy”. With the help of Belgradian architectural duo Tihomir Dicic and Iva Njunic, the entire space has been reimagined to a superb, spacious three-bedroom contemporary apartment in the heart of one of the most desirable addresses in Dublin. By removing small hallways, the entire unit was opened up to give a lovely internal flow with the benefit of lots of light from large windows, all of which have been replaced with more energy-efficient aluclad units. When the walls were being insulated and upgraded, builders discovered the original brick walls of the period property next door. With advice from the architects that it could be exposed, and though it took “lots of cleaning and sealing” it is now a standout feature in the apartment, which owners have highlighted with the use of smart LED lights in an overhead shadow gap. In fact, thoughtful lighting – as 1970s ceilings are rarely high – was one of the many considerations when this unit was being refurbished. Central to the living space – off the dining and kitchen area – is a modular unit the family sourced from Nordic Elements in Blackrock, which sits so well around the television that you would think it was custom made for the room. Solid oak floors run through the C1-rated apartment, which has a streamlined kitchen with Bosch appliances and the focus on storage at design stage, allows the whole place to be streamlined and clutter free – despite this being home to a family with young children. Its three bedrooms comprise of two doubles and a single, and the family who live here say they were amazed at how the architects managed to rearrange the space to accommodate an en suite and so much storage in their home. Even the bathrooms are luxuriously subtle in a pared back kind of way, with focus on storage and illuminating soft tones from the wood. The owners, who are moving due to a growing family, have loved their time here – especially the garden out front where their children play – and say they live a mostly car-free life due to the location. This unit shows what a 1970s apartment can become with a bit of thought, and is now seeking €800,000 through Owen Reilly.

Share this article Bitcoin whales executed around $3 billion in ETF trades through BlackRock’s $IBIT, a spot Bitcoin ETF, using portfolio trade mechanisms that offer significant portfolio benefits, Bloomberg reported today. The trades allow large Bitcoin holders to convert their holdings directly into ETF shares through custom creation processes. BlackRock has been facilitating these in-kind creations for $IBIT, enabling Bitcoin whales to seamlessly integrate their holdings into traditional finance portfolios. The structure mirrors portfolio trades commonly used in bond markets, where assets are exchanged directly rather than through cash transactions. The portfolio trade mechanism provides Bitcoin whales with benefits including enhanced liquidity and tax efficiencies. These custom ETF creation methods have gained traction in crypto markets as institutional investors seek regulated investment vehicles for their digital asset holdings. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has seen heightened institutional interest as traditional finance firms adapt to cryptocurrency integrations through ETF structures. The asset management giant has been expanding its crypto offerings in response to evolving investor demands for regulated Bitcoin exposure. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

PHOTO: GIC Published Oct 22, 2025, 08:44 AM Updated Oct 22, 2025, 05:57 PM London – Deep-pocketed sovereign wealth funds are helping drive a resurgence in dealmaking that has taken global merger and acquisition (M&A) volumes past US$3.5 trillion (S$4.5 trillion) in 2025. The M&A volume is now up 34 per cent this year, putting 2025 on track to be the best year since 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More than US$1.3 trillion in transactions were recorded in the third quarter, driven by a few mega deals. State-backed funds from the Middle East and Asia, including Singapore, provided firepower for some of 2025’s biggest transactions. Blackstone and TPG agreed on Oct 21 to acquire medical-device maker Hologic for as much as US$18.3 billion including debt, with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (Adia) and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC taking minority stakes. Last week, BlackRock teamed up with Singapore’s investment company Temasek and MGX, an artificial intelligence investment firm set up by Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment, on a US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres. US$40 billion deal for Aligned Data Centres The week before, Carlyle Group partnered with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) to buy control of BASF’s coatings business in a deal valuing the unit at €7.7 billion (S$11.6 billion). It was only in September that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign fund agreed to take video-game maker Electronic Arts private in a US$55 billion leveraged buyout – the biggest ever. Sovereign wealth funds have been building out their internal deal teams as they seek to do more direct investments, giving them a chance to profit without having to pay fees to Wall Street. They are among the biggest backers of private equity funds, and have squeezed out concessions that force the buyout firms to give them opportunities to invest alongside them in return for the cash they provide. The funds have been particularly active in tech. In August, private equity giant Thoma Bravo got backing from Adia for its roughly US$12 billion acquisition of human-resource software provider Dayforce. Abu Dhabi’s state-backed MGX has invested in OpenAI at a US$500 billion valuation. It has also backed Mr Elon Musk’s xAI and plans to contribute to US President Donald Trump’s Stargate venture. GIC and QIA have put money into rival AI start-up Anthropic. Rainmakers at the top investment banks said they expect the flurry of takeovers to continue. Goldman Sachs Group is predicting a major ramp-up in dealmaking towards the end of 2025, with a chance that 2026 will be a record year for M&A. Sovereign investors are on the hunt for more deals. Mubadala’s asset management arm is exploring an acquisition of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, the billboard operator with a market value of around US$930 million. And they are looking beyond takeovers, with the Qatari sovereign fund joining a more than US$2 billion fundraising for Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel’s new company, alongside other investors like Apollo Global Management and Ares Management Corporation.

Title: Trump rebukes “young lady” reporter questioning Argentina bailout as farmers rips his beef deal
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/viral-politics/trump-backlash-beef-trade-deal-argentina/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T18:00:00Z
Full Content:
Rachel Kiley President Donald Trump is facing renewed backlash for his support of Argentina following a tone deaf comment he made about a potential beef trade deal with the country. Trump has been publicly mulling over the possibility of beginning to import beef from Argentina as a way to bring down prices at U.S. grocery stores. “If we buy some beef now—I’m not talking about that much—from Argentina, it would help Argentina, which we consider a very good country, a very good ally,” he said over the weekend. No deal has officially been made as of yet, but even the idea of it is causing an uproar among farmers who already feel betrayed and misled by the allegedly “America First” president. A reporter recently questioned Trump about this backlash, asking, “What do you have to say to U.S. farmers who feel that the deal is benefiting Argentina more than it does them—” “Look, Argentina’s fighting for its life, young lady,” he said, cutting her off. “You don’t know anything about it. They’re fighting for their life.” He went on to claim that “nothing’s benefiting Argentina” and that he wants to “help them survive in a free world,” before letting his true motivation slip. “I happen to like the president of Argentina,” he said. “I think he’s trying to do the best he can. But don’t make it sound like they’re doing great. They’re dying, alright? They’re dying.” The reporter’s identity could not immediately be confirmed. Q: What do you have to say to farmers who feel that the deal is benefitting Argentina more than it is them?TRUMP: Look, Argentina is fighting for its life, young lady. You don’t know anything about it. You understand what that means? They are dying pic.twitter.com/1DMyaHtcTR Trade wars have led to China, previously the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans, halting its purchases. Instead, they’re now getting soybeans from Brazil and Argentina. Adding insult to injury, the Trump administration has authorized a $20 billion currency swap for Argentina while U.S. farmers continue to struggle. And Trump himself has repeatedly made it clear that this help is motivated by his ideological allyship with Argentina’s president, Javier Milei. “Just helping a great philosophy take over a great country,” he recently said, while warning U.S. financial support for the country would drop if Argentinian politics shift left. Putting this relationship and Argentina’s economy above struggling Americans has angered some farmers, with many worrying that creating a beef deal with Argentina will only exacerbate an already bad situation for rural Americans. “President Trump’s plan to buy beef from Argentina is a betrayal of the American rancher,” Farm Action’s Senior Director of Programs, Christian Lovell, said in a press release. “The U.S. beef industry is dominated by four major meatpackers that control roughly 85% of the market. This consolidation allows them to suppress prices paid to ranchers while keeping consumer prices high. Importing more beef into this rigged system will not lower costs for families or restore fair markets for producers.” As frustrated as farmers may be, there’s been a fair amount of frustration aimed at them from other Americans, as well, considering many of them voted for him despite being warned that it would hurt the economy and their own bottom line. Still, that doesn’t mean people are keen on Trump throwing money at Argentina while gutting American programs—or that anyone was impressed by his condescending response to the reporter who actually asked him about it. The tone of “young lady” here then calling the reporter stupid is quite the combo https://t.co/dC6GDoDXts it’s quite funny that argentina’s current situation is a direct result of Milei’s policy. Farmers: We’re struggling. Trump: Okay, but have you tried being Argentina?MAGA farmers voted for the guy who bankrupted casinos, and they’re shocked he’s bankrupting them too. https://t.co/4Rw1LVBB8c I think the media should be doing a better job of explaining that Argentina is “fighting for it’s life” because they followed right wing policies which caused their economy to collapse. https://t.co/g2sxwYlaKY Why would Trump buy beef from Argentina while US farmers struggle?Maybe it’s because the Trump-connected fund managers at BlackRock, Fidelity and Pimco, and his mega-wealthy friends are heavily invested in Argentina.Always follow the money and you’ll find Trump’s corruption. https://t.co/4SM5nFaP4q Just found out that the first A in MAGA stands for Argentina. I could’ve sworn it was America before the election. https://t.co/BuPyMooLKU Make Argentina Great Again! By the way, when is our government opening back up?

Backed by unwavering support from asset managers like JPMorgan and exchanges, the momentum is rising constantly.

This page gives you the inside edge—live updates on trending meme coins, alpha from crypto degens, and whispers from FOMO-driven trading circles. If you’re hunting for the next 10x or 100x gem, you’re in the right place. We update this page frequently throughout the day, as we get the latest insider insights on the best meme coins, so keep refreshing! October 21, 2025 • 15:00 UTC Bitcoin’s resilience, following the October 10 market crash, which wiped out $19B in leveraged positions and more than $450B in market cap, hints at a coming bull run. According to analysts at TD Cowen, Bitcoin could reach $141K by December if the asset regains its lost momentum. Following the brutal market crash, Bitcoin lost 10% in a matter of hours and dipped below $105K over the course of a week. A $141K prediction is more than feasible given Bitcoin’s resilience to such a devastating hit, and thanks to Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale, currently at $24.4M. As Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Solution, Hyper aims to enhance the Bitcoin network by making it faster, cheaper, more performant, and more scalable, thereby accommodating institutional investors who require high throughput and near-instant finality. Learn how to buy $HYPER right here. October 21, 2025 • 14:00 UTC Global investment management firm VanEck recently filed an application with the SEC for an ETF that tracks the price of Lido Staked $ETH ($stETH). If approved, it would be the first of its kind in the US. The firm also stated in a blog post that its ETF would give institutional investors ‘a compliant, tax-efficient way to gain Ethereum staking exposure within a regulated investment structure.’ While ETFs, such as those proposed by VanEck, offer investors a way to profit from crypto without owning the asset directly, others prefer to hold their investment directly. These investors, however, understand the challenge of finding promising assets to buy, especially if they’re in the market for the best meme coins. This is where Snorter Token ($SNORT) comes in with its proposed Snorter Bot. When launched, it’ll be a Telegram-based crypto trading bot that facilitates features such as sniping, copying trades, and managing wallets. Find out more about Snorter Token here. October 21, 2025 • 13:00 UTC Tom Lee’s BitMine Immersion continued with its Ethereum ($ETH) buying spree as the second-largest crypto’s price slid over the past few days. The world’s top Ethereum corporate treasury bought an additional 203,826 $ETH yesterday, which brought its total holdings to 3,236,014 $ETH. Lee said in a statement yesterday that with the expected Ethereum Supercycle, the currently low price of the coin represents an attractive risk/reward.’ Like Lee, other crypto traders are looking for alternative digital assets that are promising yet reasonably priced, such as Maxi Doge ($MAXI). The project aims to position $MAXI as one of the market’s best meme coins and dethrone its distant cousin Doge. To date, the $MAXI presale has raised over $3.7M, as it continues to attract fellow degens to the fold. Get the full details in ‘What is Maxi Doge?’ October 21, 2025 • 12:00 UTC Strategy (MSTR), the largest corporate to hold Bitcoin, recently purchased 168 $BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The recent purchase brings up strategy’s total $BTC holdings to 640,418 (worth $71B), with an overall average purchase price of $74,010. $BTC prices have been on a rollercoaster since the market crash on October 10th. The OG crypto rebounded to $111K on Monday after falling to as low as $103,500, helping MSTR shares climb by 3% in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. While institutional giants like Strategy continue to expand their $BTC reserves, retail investors remain cautious amid market volatility, redirecting capital toward promising presale opportunities with strong upside potential. One such rising contender is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) — a Layer-2 scalability solution that employs Solana Virtual Machine to bring lightning-fast transactions and cross-chain operability to Bitcoin’s Layer 1. Check out our expert $HYPER price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:47 UTC Binance founder Changpeng Zhao believes that the crypto captain has what it takes to flip gold’s market cap, although it might take some time. Currently, gold is the world’s largest asset, but that is likely to change soon, as the $BTC price soars over the coming cycles. Currently ranked eighth, $BTC has a market cap of $2.2T. CZ’s post also serves as a reminder that the long-term crypto projection looks strong, despite brief corrections. This is further evident from Bitcoin Hyper’s sizzling hot presale, ready to smash through $25M. The project is building a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin, bringing more speed and programmability to the network. Could $HYPER be the next meme coin to explode? Read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction to find out. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Elon Musk reignites meme coin manis with his new viral post ‘Flōki is back on the job as 𝕏 CEO!’ His post sent $FLOKI soaring over 20% within hours, causing the token to climb from $0.00006689 to $0.00007456. $FLOKI’s derivatives volume spiked by 663% and open interest rose by 165%, all indicating strong retail speculation surrounding the asset. $FLOKI did not soar alone; Musk’s post helped the entire meme coin market cap to rise by 5.8% to $55.2B, once again highlighting his unmatched influence on dog-themed tokens. FLOKI’s official X account declared it the ‘#1 trending token on CxoinGecko,’ branding itself as ‘Elon’s dog.’ With $FLOKI riding Musk’s viral wave, the newest contender in the block is quietly stealing the spotlight – Maxi Doge ($MAXI). A meme token built on a body-building trading doge that represents gym pumps, raw strength, and the grind of the bull market. Beyond the high-octane meme appeal, the project is already building a loyal community united by its bold ‘crush the charts’ motto. Check out our in-depth $MAXI price prediction here. October 21, 2025 • 10:00 UTC BlackRock just launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) on the London Stock Exchange with the starting price of $11.10. As the official press release states, the goal is to expose ‘retail investors (i) with specific knowledge and/or experience of investing in similar products’ to Bitcoin and other digital assets in a regulated ecosystem. BlackRock’s IB1T is now available in 12 registered locations, including Austria, Spain, Portugal, UK, and Germany.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs record fourth consecutive day of outflows
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-etfs-record-fourth-consecutive-day-of-outflows/
Time Published: 2025-10-21T08:16:05Z

Bitcoin ETFs post $40.5 million outflow, fourth straight day of losses. Bitcoin falls nearly 3% to $108,112 as crypto sentiment weakens. BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London amid market turbulence. US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $40.4 million in net outflows on Monday, marking their fourth straight day of negative flows, according to data from Farside Investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was the only spot Bitcoin ETF to register outflows during the session, with $100.7 million exiting the fund. The losses were partly offset by inflows into five other ETFs managed by Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Invesco. The latest outflow follows Friday’s $366.6 million and Thursday’s $536.4 million withdrawals, extending a streak of negative sentiment that has persisted across digital asset funds since last week. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs also recorded continued weakness, with $145.7 million in net outflows on Monday — their third consecutive day of redemptions. Bitcoin fell sharply on Tuesday, reversing its weekend rebound as cryptocurrencies lagged behind other risk assets that benefited from easing US-China trade tensions. The world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped nearly 3% to $108,112.30, struggling to maintain the $110,000 level after a volatile start to October that erased roughly $500 billion in total crypto market capitalisation. Traders cited the lingering impact of the early-October flash crash — which triggered widespread liquidations and heightened risk aversion — as a key reason for the muted recovery. Market participants appeared hesitant to re-enter positions amid ongoing volatility and renewed concerns over ETF outflows. Optimism surrounding “Uptober,” a term describing the crypto market’s historical tendency to perform strongly in October, has faded rapidly. Bitcoin is now down more than 2% for the month, underscoring the loss of bullish momentum. The broader crypto market mirrored Bitcoin’s slide, with most major altcoins trading lower. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, fell 5.3% to $3,859.65, slipping below the key $4,000 threshold. XRP declined 2.2% to $2.4145, showing little reaction to the announcement of a new treasury backed by issuer Ripple Labs. Binance’s BNB token dropped 5.7%, while Cardano and Solana shed between 4% and 6%. Among memecoins, Dogecoin fell 4.3%, and $TRUMP lost 3.1%, reflecting a broad-based retreat across the digital asset space. Amid the downturn, BlackRock announced the launch of a new Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, following the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax restrictions on crypto-based investment vehicles. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, listed on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, is structured as a Bitcoin-linked security that allows investors to purchase fractional units of Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. The product is designed to closely track BTC prices while operating within a regulated investment framework. According to The Sunday Times, the entry price for the product will allow investors to buy fractions of Bitcoin for about $11 per unit, providing retail investors with exposure to the digital asset without direct ownership or the need to trade on crypto exchanges. BlackRock remains one of the most successful issuers of Bitcoin-linked products, with its US-listed iShares Bitcoin ETF holding more than $85 billion in net assets, according to SoSoValue data.

Title: $2B to flow into BlackRock’s UK Bitcoin ETF: How UK traders could recycle into IBIT

IBIT wrapper launch in the UK opens a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) began trading in the UK on Oct. 20, opening a market that could funnel between $1.5 billion and $2 billion into the fund over time as UK retail investors gain regulated access to Bitcoin (BTC) exposure. The launch capitalizes on the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) recent reversal of its ban on crypto-based exchange-traded products (ETPs). BlackRock’s US Bitcoin ETF, which launched two years ago and has nearly $65 billion in lifetime inflows, now offers British investors entry at approximately $11 per unit. This is a fraction of Bitcoin’s current $110,365 price. BlackRock reported $17 billion in net inflows to its digital asset products during the third quarter alone, part of $205 billion in total net inflows as the firm crossed $13 trillion in assets under management. The UK crypto market holds an estimated £13.3 billion across 7 million investors, per FCA data from March 2025. An IG report from early October projected the market could expand 20% following the FCA’s policy shift, translating to £2.4 billion to £3.2 billion in new capital, or roughly $3.2 billion to $4.3 billion. Bitcoin products have captured 60.6% of crypto investment flows globally, according to CoinShares’ latest report. Applied to UK projections, Bitcoin-focused vehicles could draw $1.93 billion to $2.6 billion. IBIT’s dominance in the US market, where it commands 75.5% of all Bitcoin ETF inflows since launch, suggests the fund could secure $1.5 billion to $2 billion from British investors. The fund’s structure removes traditional barriers that kept mainstream investors on the sidelines. Rather than navigating crypto exchanges, managing private keys, or purchasing entire coins, investors buy regulated shares through familiar brokerage accounts. The low entry threshold, roughly $11 per unit, democratizes access to an asset that trades above $100,000. BlackRock’s survey data supports aggressive growth projections. The firm expects a 21$ increase in UK adults investing in crypto for the first time over the next 12 months, with Britain ranking third in European crypto investment growth. The company predicts 4 million Bitcoin investors in the UK by year-end. Interest concentrates among younger demographics. IG’s research found 50% of 18-24-year-olds and 49% of 25-34-year-olds would consider investing in crypto via exchange-traded notes. Additionally, 32%of prospective investors cite regulatory oversight and safety as primary motivations, while 19% value the ability to hold crypto within tax-efficient Individual Savings Accounts and Self-Invested Personal Pensions. Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, with 95% already mined, creates scarcity dynamics that amplify demand pressures. BTC’s price grew 120% last year, and is up by nearly 20% in 2025, driven partly by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance following his return to the White House. The UK government outlined plans last month for a comprehensive crypto-asset regulatory regime overseen by the FCA, positioning Britain to compete with jurisdictions that moved faster on digital asset frameworks. BlackRock’s launch transforms that regulatory shift into accessible products for millions of retail investors who previously faced exclusion or complexity barriers.

Title: Ethereum Whale BitMine Buys 203,800 ETH – Now Holds 2.7% Of Circulating Supply

Time Published: 2025-10-21T07:00:44Z

Ethereum (ETH) treasury firm BitMine Immersion Technologies today announced that it had bought another 203,800 ETH last week. Following its latest purchase, the firm’s total ETH holdings now stand 3.24 million tokens. According to a press release issued earlier today, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a leading Ethereum treasury firm has further increased its ETH holdings. The firm added another 203,800 ETH over the last week, worth approximately $820 million. Last week’s purchase has increased BitMine’s total ETH holdings to 3.24 million ETH, representing roughly 2.7% of the active circulating supply. In addition, the company holds 192 Bitcoin (BTC) and $219 in cash. The firm has $1.34 billion in combined crypto and cash holdings. BitMine’s frequent ETH purchases have propelled it as the leading public company in terms of ETH held on its balance sheet. Earlier this month, the firm had reported that its total ETH holdings had surpassed 3 million tokens. Commenting, Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine said: The crypto market saw one of its largest deleveraging events ever last week and this put downward pressure on ETH prices. Open interest for ETH sits at the same levels as seen on June 30th of this year. Given the expected Supercycle for ethereum, this price dislocation represents an attractive risk/reward. We acquired 203,826 ETH tokens over the past week pushing our ETH holdings to 3.24 million, or 2.7% of the supply of ETH. We are now more than halfway towards our initial pursuit of the ‘alchemy of 5%’ of ETH. Lee added that he sees Ethereum as a “truly neutral” blockchain which is likely to witness growing institutional adoption. He added that BitMine remains committed to accumulating 5% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply. Following today’s announcement, the NYSE-listed firm’s stock BMNR surged an impressive 7.76%, trading at $53.72 at the time of writing. The stock is up an astonishing 640.87% over the past six months. As institutional adoption of Ethereum grows, analysts are predicting new all-time highs (ATH) for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to crypto analyst HAMED_AZ, ETH can surge to $6,400 on the back of a new bullish wave. Recent trends show that some institutional investors are even replacing BTC with ETH, due to the latter’s greater flexibility and wider variety of uses. Major asset manager, BlackRock recently shifted some of its BTC holdings to ETH. That said, some analysts are cautious of the trend of Ethereum treasury firms adding ETH on their balance sheets. At press time, ETH trades at $4,019, up 1.2% in the past 24 hours. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Time Published: 2025-10-20T21:55:04Z
Full Content:
AI startup Anthropic is bringing its AI coding assistant Claude Code to the web and iOS, giving developers a way to run coding jobs straight from their browser or phone. The new tool, now in beta, lets users offload tasks like bug fixes, backend tweaks, or documentation updates—all handled in the cloud. Developers can connect GitHub repositories, describe what they need, and watch as Claude codes in real time inside a secure, isolated sandbox. Each task runs independently with live progress updates, and multiple jobs can run in parallel across different projects. When done, Claude automatically generates pull requests and change summaries. The iOS version offers a mobile-friendly way to steer code sessions on the go, though Anthropic says it’s an early preview meant for testing and feedback. Security-wise, all sessions are locked down in sandboxed environments with strict network limits. Git actions go through a secure proxy to ensure Claude only touches approved repositories. Developers can even whitelist domains—for example, to allow package downloads for testing. With this release, Anthropic is clearly signaling it wants Claude Code to become more than a chat-based helper—it’s positioning it as a full-fledged AI pair programmer in the cloud, available anywhere you work. Check out the promo video below: Anthropic has raised billions in funding, with its most recent $13 billion US Series F round in September 2025—valuing it at whopping $183 billion US—led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research, and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Key earlier backers include $4 billion from Amazon in 2023 and $2 billion from Google, alongside investors like Bessemer Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, General Catalyst, Cisco Investments, and over 80 others such as BlackRock.

Title: BlackRock launches Bitcoin ETP in London

Full Content:
BlackRock’s latest move brings regulated Bitcoin exposure to UK investors for the first time. The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) opened strong on the LSE. BlackRock’s IB1T launched on the London Stock Exchange, giving UK retail investors direct access to Bitcoin. The launch follows the FCA’s policy shift, allowing retail access to crypto-linked products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETP [IB1T] is now live on the London Stock Exchange [LSE]. This marks a key milestone for retail investors seeking regulated exposure to Bitcoin in the UK. The move signals both a policy shift from British regulators and BlackRock’s growing dominance in the digital-asset investment space. According to data from BlackRock’s official listing page, IB1T opened trading on 20 October 2025 at $11.10, climbing 5.54% on its first day. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is physically backed by Bitcoin. It offers investors direct exposure to the asset’s spot price without needing to hold or custody BTC themselves. BlackRock said the product carries a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.15% per annum until 31 December 2025, after which it will rise to 0.25%. The firm confirmed the ETP complies with UK regulatory requirements and maintains its reserves through regulated custodians. The launch follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to relax rules that had previously blocked retail participation in crypto-linked products. By approving products like IB1T, the UK is signaling a more pragmatic approach toward digital-asset investment. This aligns it with the U.S. and European markets that already allow similar instruments. The move also comes as Bitcoin trades around $110,000, recovering from recent volatility that briefly sent prices below $104,000. The renewed institutional inflows from newly launched products could help stabilize BTC’s trajectory and re-anchor market confidence. BlackRock’s debut places it among a growing list of European Bitcoin ETP issuers, including WisdomTree, 21Shares, and CoinShares, all of which operate similar products across Germany, Switzerland, and France. Traditional financial heavyweights are now competing head-to-head in Europe’s maturing digital-asset market, where regulation is fast becoming a competitive advantage. The new listing adds to BlackRock’s expanding digital-asset portfolio. Its portfolio includes a U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETF, an Ethereum ETP, and the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). With the UK now opening the door to mainstream crypto investing, BlackRock’s move shows the growing convergence between traditional finance and blockchain-based assets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP could become a benchmark product for retail Bitcoin exposure in one of the world’s oldest and most influential financial centers.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have listed Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) ETPs on the London Stock Exchange as FCA lifts the ban. Top global asset managers like BlackRock, 21Shares, WisdomTree, and Bitwise have opened access to Bitcoin BTC $106 970 24h volatility: 3.5% Market cap: $2.13 T Vol. 24h: $90.46 B and Ethereum ETH $3 741 24h volatility: 5.3% Market cap: $451.52 B Vol. 24h: $42.75 B exchange-traded products that are available to UK retail investors. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF will be listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), with its shares physically backed by BTC and held via Coinbase. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has already been a massive success in the US, becoming the fastest ETF in history to approach $100 billion AUM, within 18 months of launch. Speaking on the development, Jane Sloan, EMEA head of global product solutions at BlackRock, said: “Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight.” The development comes 12 days after the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its four-year ban on retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). As a result, this has opened the market to a wider investor base. Apart from BlackRock, other asset managers have also joined the listing race. On Monday, October 20, 21Shares listed two physically backed products for Bitcoin and Ethereum on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). It also includes a staking component for its Ethereum ETPs and a reduced 0.1% management fee for select offerings. The announcement comes as the asset manager also pushes for spot Dogecoin ETF approval in the US. 21Shares first launched its crypto ETPs for institutional investors in the UK last year, capturing 70% of total turnover on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), according to the company. Meanwhile, WisdomTree has listed its physically backed Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE with fees of 0.15% and 0.35%. This also follows its earlier institutional offering in the UK. Asset manager Bitwise also announced plans to list its Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs on the LSE on Tuesday, with a reduced 0.05% fee on its Core Bitcoin ETP for at least six months. Back in 2021, UK’s top financial regulator FCA, had banned the sale, marketing, and distribution of crypto derivatives and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) to retail investors. With the latest policy shift, retail investors can now access these products through UK-regulated brokers and investment platforms, such as standard brokerage accounts and tax-efficient wrappers like ISAs and SIPPs, WisdomTree said on Monday. The update brings the UK’s regulatory framework closer in line with markets such as the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, and the EU. However, the prohibition on retail access to broader crypto derivatives remains in effect. Disclaimer: Coinspeaker is committed to providing unbiased and transparent reporting.

Title: $1.2B exits US Bitcoin ETFs just as London makes crypto comeback

$600B in futures inflow could be on the horizon as analysts say Europe’s new ETNs could ignite the next wave of mainstream inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The 12 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETFs) in the United States reversed sharply last week, recording $1.2 billion in net outflows. According to SoSoValue data, this was their second-largest weekly setback since launching in January 2024. The pullback snapped a two-week run of inflows that had brought in more than $5 billion, a period many read as proof of deepening institutional conviction. Data from SoSoValue show that investors pulled capital from nearly every major issuer. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a $276 million outflow, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw $169 million leave. Other major issuers, such as ARK Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB, lost $290 million and $128 million, respectively, while Grayscale’s two funds shed $321 million. The reversal followed a volatile week for Bitcoin, which briefly dipped below $104,000 during the reporting period. Notably, this was its lowest price level since June. Industry experts linked the drawdown to macroeconomic conditions triggered by US-China tariff wars, that shook confidence in risk assets like Bitcoin. However, the flagship digital crypto asset has rebounded strongly above $110,000 as of press time amid recent developments in the market. While US flows turned defensive, a different story that would reshape retail access for Bitcoin was unfolding across the Atlantic. On Oct. 20, Bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) officially began trading on the London Stock Exchange. This marks the end of the UK’s three-year retail ban on crypto investment products. BlackRock led the debut with its iShares Bitcoin ETP, joined by other leading issuers like Bitwise. Meanwhile, early feedback about these products has been mixed, but they have still shown promising signs. ByteTree founder Charlie Morris said initial trading activity showed “success with platforms such as Interactive Investor, Swissquote, and Trading 212,” though some brokers like AJ Bell were slower to support access. Still, Bradley Duke, Bitwise’s head of Europe, opined that the launch of these products would mark a “big week” for retail investors because the “direction of travel is clear for crypto.” With a new wave of adoption emerging across the Atlantic and renewed institutional focus on Bitcoin, Galaxy Research believes that crypto investment products could attract up to $600 billion in new inflows as traditional financial institutions broaden distribution. According to the firm, the US advisory market represents a vast, largely untapped opportunity that would drive significant flows into BTC. It stated: “Roughly 300,000 financial advisors manage about $30 trillion in client assets. If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows.” These wave of flows would would rival the entire global gold ETF market, now worth about $472 billion, and quadruple the combined $146 billion in assets under management (AUM) across US spot Bitcoin funds. The asset management firm pointed out that recent policy moves by leading traditional financial institiutions like Morgan Stanley and Vanguard support that thesis. Notably, Morgan Stanley recently recommended up to a 4% allocation to digital assets, while Vanguard is reportedly looking to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients. These developments are expected to drive fresh capital into the emerging industry and further drive Bitcoin’s adoption. Galaxy Research argued that the full opening of large advisory platforms could mark a structural shift in how digital assets are integrated into mainstream finance. Once this access is fully enabled, financial advisors will be able to include crypto directly within traditional balanced portfolios, moving the asset class from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction. It noted: “The impact could be substantial. New inflows may follow as wealth managers begin allocating to the asset class, potentially pushing total bitcoin ETF AUM to $500 billion within a few years, assuming just a 1% average allocation across managed portfolios. Such flows would reshape market dynamics and reinforce bitcoin’s position as a mainstream, investable asset.” Galaxy’s analysis further suggested that this transition could also bring a more mature form of liquidity. According to the firm, advisory-driven allocations tend to follow longer holding periods and stricter compliance frameworks, reducing the short-term turnover that has defined retail crypto trading. Over time, that discipline could enhance price stability, deepen liquidity, and align Bitcoin more closely with traditional asset classes such as equities, bonds, and gold.

Title: Ethereum In, Bitcoin Out: BlackRock Rebalancing Its Digital Asset Portfolio In Major Crypto Shift
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-bitcoin-out/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T15:00:15Z
Full Content:
Following the recent market crash due to Donald Trump’s tariff order, the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced a sharp decline below key support levels. While both coins fell strongly, ETH has emerged as the leading choice among major corporations, as these institutions swap their BTC for the altcoin leader. Major crypto assets such as Ethereum and Bitcoin are beginning to recover lost ground once again. Meanwhile, Ethereum appears to be leading the charge in terms of institutional adoption, reflecting the long-term potential of the leading altcoin. In a move that has triggered a frenzy across the crypto and traditional finance sectors, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is reportedly shifting a portion of its Bitcoin holdings into ETH. Coin Bureau shared this institutional pivot on the social media platform X, which has captured the attention of the crypto community. This daring rotation indicates a significant shift in institutional opinion and a rising belief in Ethereum’s sustained price growth. BlackRock‘s shift to ETH highlights the asset’s developing importance as the cornerstone of decentralized finance and next-generation financial infrastructure, even though Bitcoin keeps dominating as a store of value. Data shared by Coin Bureau reveals that the leading asset manager firm transferred about 272.4 BTC, valued at approximately $28.3 million, to Coinbase Prime. A few hours later, BlackRock was observed pulling out over 12,098 ETH worth $45.4 million. Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. has also been accumulating ETH at a significant and rapid rate. A recent report from BMNR Bullz shows that the leading treasury company purchased thousands of ETH within the past week to strengthen its digital asset treasury. Despite the recent market crash, the firm continues to double down on the altcoin, scooping up a total of 379,271 ETH, valued at $1.5 billion. With the massive purchase of Ethereum, Bitmine is demonstrating its conviction in the network’s expanding role in blockchain innovation. During the dip on Friday, Bitmine bought over 72,898 ETH worth $281 million. Three days prior to this acquisition, the firm purchased more than 104,336 ETH, valued at $417 million. Finally, a +202,037 ETH was made after the weekend crash, bringing the total to 379,271 ETH within a week. Bitmine’s persistent acquisition of the altcoin reflects the firm’s Co-CEO Tom Lee’s bold declaration that Ethereum will be the backbone of the digital economy. According to BMNR Bullz, this is not a buy signal, but a seismic shift. Prominent figures in the financial landscape are currently endorsing Ethereum. Robert Kiyosaki, a billionaire and author of the “Rich Dad Poor Dad” book, has included ETH as one of the key assets to hedge against the rising inflation across the world. While inflation keeps increasing and making it difficult for the poor and middle class, the billionaire has urged this set of people not to rely on government fake money or fiat currency. Instead, they should invest in Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, which he labels the real money. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Time Published: 2025-10-20T14:28:45Z

On Oct. 15, two Wall Street titans offered radically different visions of the private credit market. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned investors that recent bankruptcies in private credit could be just the beginning: “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Hours later, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink struck a defiant tone on his firm’s earnings call: “I’ve never been more excited about the future of BlackRock,” he said. BlackRock has bet $12 billion on private credit through its acquisition of HPS Investment Partners. So who is right? Investors have been so worried about the stability of private credit recently that their frantic selling drove up the VIX “fear” index by 35% over the past month. They are spooked by the collapse in September of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender and dealer, revealing allegations of fraud in which the company allegedly pledged the same collateral to multiple banks. Private credit was dealt another blow late last month when First Brands, an auto parts supplier, collapsed into bankruptcy, owing $10 billion, triggering federal investigations into $2.3 billion in missing funds. Then on Oct. 16, regional banks Zions Bancorporation disclosed fraud-related losses and Western Alliance flagged nearly nearly $100 million in alleged fraud, catalyzing a market rout that erased $100 billion in market cap from U.S. bank stocks and pushed market volatility to four-month highs. Major institutions tallied their damage: JPMorgan took $170 million in Tricolor losses; UBS disclosed over $500 million in First Brands exposure; and Jefferies revealed $715 million in questionable receivables. The private credit market—which has grown from $200 billion to $3 trillion globally in 15 years—suddenly looked vulnerable. But credit analysts and executives who spoke to Fortune have mixed views on Wall Street’s panic. Several argue that the failures aren’t private credit problems at all. According to them, these instances are traditional bank lending blowups, and the mislabeling reveals more about competitive tensions between old-guard banks and private credit disrupters than genuine systemic risk. The question, however, is whether these analysts are right, or whether they’re dangerously downplaying cracks in a $3 trillion market that is systemically important to global finance. The definition problem “First Brands, if it was rated by us, would not have been considered in any way, shape, or form a private credit transaction,” said Bill Cox, chief rating officer at Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA), which tracks thousands of private credit loans. “Its main debt was full-on public, broadly syndicated loans.” This distinction matters. The broadly syndicated loan (BSL) market—dominated by large commercial banks—operates differently from the direct lending market that defines private credit. BSL loans are originated by banks, syndicated to multiple investors, and traded in public markets with daily pricing. Private credit loans, by contrast, are bilateral transactions between a lender and borrower, held to maturity in a “buy and hold” strategy with no secondary market trading. First Brands’ bankruptcy involved primarily BSL debt and receivables “factoring,” a form of lending where banks purchase a company’s accounts receivable at a discount in hopes of profiting later when clients pay their bills in full. Neither activity represents the core direct lending business that firms like Ares, Apollo, and Blackstone have built. “None of them do factoring,” Cox said of the dozens of private credit platforms his firm rates. “We looked at the entire universe of our CLOs, BDCs, and other facilities for exposure to First Brands. The exposure was de minimis,” he said, referring to collateralized loan obligations (bundles of loans sold to other investors) and business development companies (which are set up as investment bets on struggling or distressed companies). Brian Garfield, who heads U.S. portfolio valuation at investment banking firm Lincoln International, which performs over 6,500 quarterly valuations of private companies, echoed this view: “First Brands [largely had BSL facilities, and] that’s not the direct lending market. I think it’s important that we understand that alone in itself is really important, because there’s this whole combination of things that everyone is just putting … in one basket,” he told Fortune. The real state of private credit This isn’t to say private credit faces no challenges. Lincoln International’s proprietary data tracking the direct lending market shows covenant defaults—technical breaches of loan terms rather than payment failures—have risen from 2.2% in 2024 to 3.5% currently. Payment-in-kind (PIK) usage, where struggling borrowers defer cash interest payments, increased from 6.5% of deals in Q4 2021 to 11% today, with “bad PIKs” (repriced mid-deal) rising from 33% to over 50% of that total. “Are there cracks? Yes,” Garfield acknowledged. “But on average, are we seeing strong fundamental Ebitda growth? Yes.” His data shows last-12-months year-over-year Ebitda growth of 6% to 7%—the highest level since Q1 2021. KBRA’s analysis of 2,400 middle-market companies representing roughly $1 trillion in debt tells a similar story. Cox’s team projects defaults could peak at 5%, which he admitted is “a lot more than this industry has seen,” but he said was “relatively” low for public market comparables, the measure through which private company valuations can be derived by comparing the businesses to other similar companies that are already publicly traded on the stock market. Why the panic? Given the fundamentals aren’t catastrophic, analysts point to several factors beyond credit quality to explain investor anxiety, namely less stringent guardrails and documentation processes. “If something grows like a weed, maybe it is one,” Timur Braziler, who covers regional banks at Wells Fargo, told Fortune. “The availability of credit over the last five years, when you have more than one source competing for that same loan, maybe the underwriting isn’t as stringent.” Andrew Milgram, managing partner and chief investment officer of Marblegate Asset Management, an alternative investment firm focused on middle-market distressed and special situation investments, offered a more pointed critique: The competitive dynamics of unregulated lending inevitably lead to deteriorating standards. “When loans were done by banks, they were subject to oversight,” he explained. “As those loans moved out of the banking system into an unregulated environment, they began competing for business by loosening documentation, loosening underwriting standards.” Private credit loans are typically given out by nonbank lenders such as alternative asset managers, private equity firms, and pension funds. Without the guardrails and protections provided by traditional banks, who are beholden to regulators and the federal government, disaster can ensue, according to Milgram, who has long been skeptical of the private credit market. “Lending has been regulated in societies for all time. In fact, the Code of Hammurabi contemplated regulating lenders because every society, everywhere for all time has recognized that durable, responsible lending is central to the proper functioning of the economy,” he added. Cox sees a different dynamic at work: Competitive tensions between traditional banks and private credit upstarts have led to, in his opinion, a rise in misconstruing the overall risk of private credit and direct lending. “If your neighbor is saying it’s your dog that’s relieving itself on the lawn, and you know it’s not your dog, it’s pretty frustrating,” he says, noting that both Tricolor and First Brands were primarily bank lending failures, not private credit issues. He admits, however, that there are corners of the private credit market that are more exposed and involved in “riskier parts of credit,” where lenders provide loans at high risk in hopes of high returns. Private credit has a reputation for being directed at smaller, middle-market companies that are highly leveraged and potentially unable to secure traditional bank financing. While these firms may offer higher yields to offset the risk, they are more vulnerable to financial shocks. What comes next The debate over private credit’s risks won’t end with these bankruptcies. Braziler expects more fraud cases to emerge: “Just the abundance of credit, it makes sense that you’re going to have more of these bad characters.” However, he doesn’t see systemic risk to the banking sector. Tim Hynes, global head of credit research at Debtwire, expects continued stress but not catastrophe: “The weakest companies are starting to get hit as a result of the tariffs and economic slowdown. You’re going to see an increase in bankruptcies, but there isn’t systemic risk.” The real test may be transparency. Unlike BSL loans with daily market pricing, private credit valuations are less transparent, being updated quarterly using subjective methodologies. “It is really opaque,” Braziler notes. “It’s really hard to get a good understanding of who the end borrower is.” As BlackRock doubles down with its $12 billion HPS acquisition and Dimon warns of “cockroaches,” the private credit industry faces a credibility test. The question isn’t whether some loans will default—they will. It’s whether the industry’s risk management, documentation standards, and valuation practices can pass a financial stress test. “Anyone who has any amount of meaningful exposure to corporate credit markets, and in particular the leverage loan corporate credit markets, should be reexamining their portfolio in excruciating detail at this moment and really thinking hard about the quality of the underwriting that has gone into making those loans and the veracity of the reporting that supports their understanding of the performance of the business,” Milgram said. For now, the analysts who track private credit most closely see warning signs, not apocalypse. But in a market where definitional confusion obscures risk and competitive tensions drive narratives, distinguishing signal from noise is increasingly critical and difficult.

Title: BlackRock brings Bitcoin ETP to UK as regulator opens door for crypto products
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/blackrock-brings-bitcoin-etp-to-uk-as-regulator-opens-door-for-crypto-products/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T13:52:32Z
Full Content:
The investment giant BlackRock has launched its first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded product (ETP) in the United Kingdom, signalling a major step in bridging traditional finance with the crypto sector. The move follows the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) decision to ease restrictions on crypto investment vehicles, allowing investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly holding it. The launch not only widens access to digital assets for UK investors but also highlights a growing convergence between global asset managers and regulators in adapting to the evolution of financial markets. The iShares Bitcoin ETP, now listed on the London Stock Exchange, is designed to mirror the price of bitcoin and offer exposure within a regulated structure. The product allows investors to buy fractions of bitcoin through units starting at about $11, making participation in the asset class more accessible. Unlike holding bitcoin directly, investors can trade the ETP through standard brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of digital wallets or private key management. The product’s underlying assets are securely held by regulated custodians, ensuring compliance and oversight under the UK’s financial rules. BlackRock’s UK-listed ETP builds on the firm’s earlier success with its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, which has accumulated over $85 billion in net assets. It also adds to its European range, complementing listings in Switzerland, Paris, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. The launch comes shortly after the FCA lifted its four-year ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) on 9 October 2025. The regulator stated that UK investors could now access such products through approved exchanges, reflecting a broader acceptance of crypto-linked investment options. The decision marks a turning point for crypto regulation in the UK. It suggests a shift from outright restrictions to a more measured approach that balances investor protection with innovation. The FCA’s announcement followed months of consultation with industry players and international regulators. BlackRock’s move is expected to encourage other global asset managers to follow suit, as the UK repositions itself as a hub for financial innovation post-Brexit. The FCA’s approval has opened the door for firms such as VanEck, DWS, and WisdomTree to explore similar launches. For retail investors, the product offers exposure to bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional investment wrapper. It eliminates the need for managing crypto wallets and navigating unregulated exchanges, while allowing investment through familiar platforms. The regulator’s decision also aligns with the UK Treasury’s ambition to make the country a global centre for digital assets. It supports ongoing efforts to integrate blockchain into traditional finance, paving the way for tokenised funds and blockchain-based asset management in the future. Despite the easing of rules, the FCA maintained that its ban on crypto derivatives for retail investors will remain. While the ETP operates under a regulated structure, exposure to Bitcoin still carries the same volatility and market risks associated with the underlying asset. In parallel, the UK is exploring broader blockchain adoption across financial services. On 14 October 2025, the FCA announced new provisions allowing asset managers to use distributed ledger technology for fund tokenisation. The move is intended to foster innovation and efficiency, signalling that the regulator sees long-term potential in blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrencies. By facilitating regulated access to bitcoin and promoting tokenisation, the UK is gradually laying the groundwork for a digital financial ecosystem where traditional and decentralised finance coexist. BlackRock’s ETP marks a key milestone in this transition, setting the stage for more institutional crypto products in one of the world’s leading financial markets.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP began trading on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, with securities physically backed by Bitcoin held through Coinbase, as per the Financial Times report. "As the UK crypto investor base is projected to approach 4 million over the next year, today's listing of exchange-traded products like iShares Bitcoin ETP unlock a securer gateway to digital assets through traditional investment platforms,” the firm's EMEA head of global product Jane Sloan said, speaking to the FT. "Built on institutional-grade infrastructure, [the product] enables UK investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin with the confidence of robust custody and regulatory oversight," Sloan added. The product features institutional-grade security protocols, with Coinbase transferring Bitcoin from trading wallets into segregated, offline cold storage by day's end. The UK launch follows the runaway success of BlackRock's U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF, which became the firm's most profitable fund just 21 months after launch, now managing over $87.5 billion in assets. The fund was on track to hit $100 billion in assets under management and become the youngest ETF to cross that milestone, but last week's market crash derailed the timeline. “The launch signals the advancing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class by both major regulators and global asset managers,” Fabian Dori, Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum, told Decrypt. Dori expects the UK launch to pave the way for broader crypto product offerings, noting that "in the U.S., additional ETPs beyond BTC/ETH and the first diversified crypto baskets are progressing through preparatory stages.” “At the same time, various traditional managers are expanding their digital-asset footprint, including tokenized securities in BlackRock’s case,” he added. He said it's reasonable to expect the Financial Conduct Authority to "proceed deliberately" by monitoring market conduct and retail outcomes before "broadening issuer participation" and considering additional crypto assets "in close alignment with other major financial centres." The launch also follows CEO Larry Fink's pivot on crypto, from describing Bitcoin as an "index of money laundering” in 2017 to placing crypto alongside gold in investors’ portfolios. “The markets teach you, you always have to relook at your assumptions,” Fink told CBS last week. “There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it's an alternative." However, market conditions remain choppy with digital asset investment products seeing $513 million in outflows last week following a Binance liquidity cascade on October 10 that triggered nearly $20 billion in liquidations, including roughly $16.7 billion in long positions, according to a CoinShares report. BlackRock's UK expansion comes amid broader concerns about regulatory fragmentation in the crypto sector. Last week, the Financial Stability Board warned that crypto firms are exploiting loopholes in fragmented global regulations, threatening financial stability as countries adopt wildly different approaches to policing the digital asset market.

Title: How a Cyber Charter Struck Back When It Was Fired by a School District in New Mexico
URL: https://dianeravitch.net/2025/10/20/how-a-cybercharter-struck-back-when-it-was-fired-by-a-school-district-in-new-mexico/

Full Content:
Peter Greene, the best education blogger ever, writes regularly for Forbes magazine. Hopefully, some of the nation’s business executives are learning about the for-profit entrepreneurs who have entered into the education “industry,”where they are profiting without doing much for students. Greene recently wrote about the latest setback for the giant of the cybercharter industry. It’s now called Stride, but for many years it was K12 Inc. Top executives are paid millions of dollars. Profit, not learning, is its highest priority. Despite terrible academic results, low graduation rates, complaints about inflated enrollments, there are always school districts happy to host the cybercharter industry because the district gets a cut of the profits. Greene writes: Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations. Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent. In 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract. “Our students deserve better,” said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release.“This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law.” Within months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district. According to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff. The district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024. The district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan. According to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins.” The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin.” According to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district. Instead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.” Alleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education.” And counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him. The list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough. Defendant Stride purposely and willfully disregarded the contractual requirements and the statutory and regulatory requirements in order to defraud the School District to increase its profits… Defendant Stride, while obligated to provide a certain quality of education to students, disregarded its legal obligations with the sole intent to profit on the education of students that it was supposed to educate, and that profit was obtained illegally through the intentional 27 violations of State law, incomplete and false reporting of student data, withholding technical support and operating and manipulating student counts to include students who had been dropped, withdrawn or were excessively absent. Asked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance. Since being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems. But Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Ellison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors. In 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, “despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.” In 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.” In 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance. In 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their “epic series of tech errors.” K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.” The district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners. Wow, what a story! Looks like K12 Inc [now “Stride”] may finally be brought down [& hopefully snuffed out], after 26 yrs of ripping off the public with devious/ scurrilous practices. Kudos to New Mexico & its Gallup-McKinley County schools for persevering legally against this scam operation. LikeLike I’m going to blow up that first sentence and mount it on my wall. Thanks, Diane!

Strategy (MSTR), the largest publicly traded corporate holder of bitcoin, purchased 168 BTC at an average price of $112,051, according to a filing on Monday. The company financed the acquisition by raising $18.8 million through the issuance of various perpetual preferred shares and common stock. This latest purchase brings MSTR’s total bitcoin holdings to 640,418 BTC ($71 billion), with an overall average acquisition price of around $74,010. BTC climbed to over $115,000 on Oct. 13 but fell as low as $103,500 on Oct. 17. Bitcoin’s has seen a recent rebound to $111,000 on Monday, helping MSTR shares to a 3% gain in pre-market trading, just below $300 per share. However, the stock remains negative on a year-to-date basis, compared to bitcoin's 19% gain. The MSTR/BlackRock iShares Trust (IBIT) ratio currently stands at 4.74, its lowest level since October 2024. This highlights how the IBIT ETF has outperformed MSTR over the past 12 months, as the ratio previously hit an all-time high of 8.0 in November 2024.

You won't want to start your day without it. By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC$110,317.97 and the broader crypto market recovered over the weekend, offering a brief reprieve after sticky selling pressure kept cryptocurrency prices depressed in the aftermath of a $500 billion value-destruction event. The price of bitcoin rose 3% in the past 24 hours to $110,770. It remains down about 4% for the month. The recovery came as global risk sentiment improves, with equities rising and investors rotating back into more volatile assets. U.S. President Donald Trump’s softer stance on tariffs and signs that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy later this year have helped calm markets. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) index rose 4.3% in the past 24 hours with all members in the green. “While bitcoin has seen a notable short-term correction, the long-term trend remains a different story, as the cryptocurrency’s trajectory is still heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors such as the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, U.S. dollar strength, spot bitcoin ETF flows, and geopolitical risks,” XS.com markets analyst Linh Tran told CoinDesk in an emailed statement. Still, short-term momentum may not signal a lasting trend. Analysts at Coinbase Institutional warned that thin liquidity, a strong U.S. dollar and uncertainty around the Federal Reserve's rate path continue to weigh on market structure. A spike in U.S. Treasury yields at the end of last week and geopolitical tensions with Israel conducting retaliatory airstrikes in Gaza after attacks on its forces while a ceasefire was in effect and as Russia advances in Ukraine, have kept many institutional investors cautious. Nevertheless corporate accumulation has kept on going, with BitcoinTreasuries data showing that in the past 30 days these entities increased their holdings by 8.4% to 4.04 million BTC. Access to crypto exposure is also growing, with BlackRock and 21Shares adding debuting their crypto ETPs on the London Stock Exchange for retail investors. “Overall, in my view, bitcoin is currently in a reaccumulation phase following its short-term correction, with market sentiment stabilizing and institutional demand remaining resilient,” Tran added.

Title: BlackRock’s Tokenized ETFs Are Only The Beginning, CEO Says
URL: https://www.thedailyupside.com/etf/industry-news-etf/blackrocks-tokenized-etfs-are-only-the-beginning-ceo-says/
Time Published: 2025-10-20T10:10:00Z

Tokenized securities are moving closer to a reality as issuers make plans to bring more assets and funds on-chain. Lilly Riddle lilly@thedailyupside.com Tokenization was once just a whisper in the wind. Now, it’s a scream. Investment giant BlackRock, which boasts more than $13 trillion in assets under management, has made tokenized ETFs a top priority, CEO Larry Fink confirmed on an earnings call last week. Fink, who said that the crypto industry is set to grow “rapidly,” is calling for more regulatory clarity as his firm builds up the technology required to tokenize both its ETFs and traditional securities. The move is the latest by one of the industry’s largest issuers to merge the worlds of traditional and decentralized finance and bring tokenization — and with it, instantaneous transactions — to the mainstream. The hurdle for issuers remains a lack of guidance, experts said. “The challenge with all the various tokenization projects to get ETFs or stocks on the blockchain is that we don’t actually have a legal structure to allow this,” said Dave Nadig, director of research at ETF.com. “What there aren’t right now are clean legal and regulatory rails for this kind of activity … I’m not holding my breath.” While BlackRock’s move to tokenize ETFs would be a significant step toward decentralized finance, issuers are still some distance away from fully on-chain securities, said Aaron Kaplan, founder and co-CEO of Prometheum. Although having digital representations of ETFs can speed up the transaction process, it still wouldn’t allow for immediate movement of the underlying stocks, which remain off-chain. Another roadblock is the lack of infrastructure and cybersecurity safeguards, Kaplan added, particularly if on-chain assets are going to be held digitally by a custodian. “You have to have the cybersecurity, the blockchain technology, the operational security — everything else that’s required in order to protect the keys,” Kaplan said. “Because in the event that the actual custodian gets hacked, they could take those [on-chain] assets and make them disappear.” Still, Kaplan predicts tokenized on-chain assets, which now account for more than $30 billion, will soon be sold in public markets, particularly as agencies continue signaling their support. Issuers’ concerns about receiving a regulatory letter if they tried using blockchain have dissipated since the Trump administration came into office, he added. “When it comes to securities, you have to have the proper licenses and the technology to conduct such activities,” he said. “[This is] as opposed to the cryptocurrency space, which has been a little bit more Wild West-y.” Just Around the Corner. Really. As the ETF industry enters a transitional period, with markets moving from electronic to digital transactions, Kaplan anticipates that expanding on-chain trades beyond crypto products is coming — probably in the fourth quarter of 2025 or early 2026. “Initial use cases will be ETFs of bundles of underlying cryptocurrencies,” Kaplan said. “As more assets move on-chain, you’ll be able to create additional ETF products and other structured products and the like … It just makes paramount sense.” Some of the largest S&P 500-based funds lost billions this year as institutional investors sought out cheaper alternatives. The rare earths industry is booming as the materials are used less in electric vehicles and more in AI data centers. Asset managers have repurposed sustainable funds amid a pullback from them in the US. This change is more substantial than most. Even with the lights out at the SEC, it’s unlikely that ETF issuers seeking 3x and 5x funds will sail through the approval process. The new VanEck TruSector ETFs invest in stocks and other ETFs to maximize exposure to individual companies and reflect actual market caps. No one knows the future, but high inflation could make some investments virtually worthless. As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. © 2025 The Daily Upside

BlackRock debuted a bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) on the London Stock Exchange on Monday, one of a number of similar offerings that started trading after the Financial Conduct Authority ended a ban on retail investment imposed in 2021. In addition to the iShares Bitcoin ETP trading under the ticker IB1T, investors also gained access to products from companies including 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise, which allow retail investors to buy exposure to bitcoin through a regulated market without needing to hold the cryptocurrency directly. BlackRock's product is already available elsewhere in Europe, having been listed on Xetra, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris in late March according to the BlackRock’s page for the product. Switzerland-based 21Shares introduced four of its flagship crypto ETNs. These include its bitcoin (ABTC) and ether (AETH) staking products, as well as two lower-fee "Core” offerings, CBTC and ETHC, with management fees of 0.10%. “Today’s launch represents a landmark step for the U.K. market and for everyday investors who, for years, have been excluded from regulated crypto products,” 21Shares CEO Russel Barlow said in an emailed press release. Ending the ban “begins to level the playing field with Europe.” The WisdomTree Physical Bitcoin and WisdomTree Physical Ethereum ETPs, which were previously available only to wealthy investors, are expected to be available through a range of U.K.-regulated investment platforms starting this week, the company said. Bitwise listed four ETPs on the LSE, two each tracking BTC and ETH. The firm said on Monday it was reducing the management fee of its Core Bitcoin ETP (BTC1) from 20 basis points to 5 bps for the next six months. BlackRock, which manages over $13 trillion in assets globally, has seen strong growth in its crypto-focused products. Its flagship bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), has $85.5 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. This makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC, which has $21.9 billion in net assets. UPDATE (Oct. 20, 12:06 UTC): Adds listings by 21Shares, WisdomTree and Bitwise starting in first paragraph.

Title: Ethereum Foundation Researcher’s Pivot Highlights Growing Cultural Divide in Crypto

reading time 3 minutes On Friday, Ethereum Foundation Researcher Dankrad Feist announced he will be joining the stablecoin-focused blockchain startup Tempo, which was incubated via a partnership between fintech giant Stripe and crypto investment firm Paradigm. In response, some of the crypto purists on social media, most notably and understandably those who build on Ethereum, shared their disappointment, while others simply saw it as a sign of the times in terms of where the industry is headed more generally. Dankrad leaving Ethereum is a terrible look for open-source vs. corporate blockchains. Huge L for the entire community tbh — Andy (@ayyyeandy) October 17, 2025 The reaction to this recent move by Feist is an illustration of the greater cultural divide that has been growing in crypto over the past few years as more of this technology is built around increasingly centralized vectors of control. While Satoshi Nakamotoâs original Bitcoin whitepaper and other early writings discussed the need for a new system built on âcryptographic proof instead of trustâ and the problems with traditional systems being related to âall the trust thatâs required to make it work,â much of the more recent activity in crypto has involved centrally-issued stablecoins as poker chips in a meme coin casino. Much of the growth around crypto networks like Ethereum has been centered around centralized stablecoins, which operated in somewhat of a legal grey area in the U.S. prior to the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this year. With greater regulatory clarity established around these digital dollars, there has been an increase in various developments around so-called âstablechains,â which are focused on these bank-backed dollar tokens rather than crypto-native, permissionless assets. A fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum's primary uses cases are largely external to ETH's market value. Ethereum can be very useful, its apps can garner great revenue, and ETH can still be low price — or vice versa — there is little link between them. OTOH,â¦ — Nick Szabo (@NickSzabo4) October 7, 2025 Circle and Tether are the two largest stablecoin issuers via their respective USDC and USDT tokens. Earlier this year, Circle announced the creation of their own layer-one blockchain called Arc. Additionally, Tether and its affiliates have supported the development of at least two blockchains where USDT is the native gas token, namely Stable and Plasma. More well-known players in the fintech industry are also getting involved, with Coinbase, Stripe (Tempo), PayPal, and Robinhood all either announcing or already having launched their own blockchain platforms or other expansions into the crypto market. Google Cloud and Cloudflare also have their own blockchain offerings at different stages of development that are focused on payments for artificial intelligence agents. Some of these platforms are being built as secondary layers on top of Ethereum, while others are completely separate blockchain networks. As big tech giants and other notable players get involved in building out their own blockchain networks where they can have more control and extract more value, the cypherpunk values Satoshi wanted to infuse into Bitcoin, such as privacy and censorship resistance, have struggled to gain the hearts and minds of the general public. Sure, the bitcoin price recently hit a new all-time high once again (before subsequently dropping more than 15%); however, much of the recent bull run has been built around centralized, regulated financial products such as the publicly-traded exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the likes of BlackRock and bitcoin treasury companies such as Strategy. There are still pockets of activity in crypto that are relatively faithful to the Satoshi vision. Not all use cases reintroduce trusted third parties by building everything around centralized stablecoins or throw away privacy by putting too much financial data on public blockchains. This is becoming an increasingly smaller percentage of overall activity, however, when compared to speculation on dubious token offerings or further empowering financial institutions with new technology that allows them to avoid strict anti-money laundering regulations as long as they put their customers on a database they call a blockchain. Bitcoin itself has remained somewhat resistant to corporate influence at the protocol level, as shown by the resolution of its internal block size warÂ back in 2017. However, Ethereumâs reliance on stablecoins is becoming an increasingly hard-to-ignore issue that is worth watching, as the issuers of these tokens have an incentive to use their centralized point of control to extract as much value as possible from this technology. As seen by the recent âstablechainâ phenomenon, this may include a desire to cut the open Ethereum network out of the picture entirely. Contrastly, Bitcoinâs main problematic point of centralization in terms of third-party custodians still requires those custodians to use the Bitcoin network. While people are still able to use these technologies in the permissionless, non-custodial manner Satoshi originally intended, the crypto industry as a whole is increasingly turning into a way for centralized financial entities to empower themselves rather than individual users.

Title: $600 Billion Could Flow Into Crypto From Wall Street: Galaxy Research

Galaxy Research’s latest brief argues that the “wealth channel” in the United States—the network of roughly 300,000 financial advisors overseeing about $30 trillion in client assets—is finally starting to open to crypto assets, with implications that are both mechanical and potentially transformative. The crux of the thesis is arithmetic but not trivial: “If even a modest 2% allocation to bitcoin ETFs emerged across this channel, that would translate to roughly $600 billion in potential inflows,” the note states, adding that such a sum “is comparable to the entire global gold ETF market (~$472 billion) and more than 3x the US spot bitcoin ETF AUM (~$146 billion).” The firm frames this as the moment crypto begins moving from retail-driven speculation toward advisor-led portfolio construction, as approvals, custody, and compliance guardrails converge inside the largest wirehouses and banks. The catalyst, in Galaxy’s telling, is a series of platform-level access changes and infrastructure buildouts that remove long-standing bottlenecks. On October 10, Morgan Stanley “removed longstanding restrictions on crypto fund access for its financial advisors,” allowing proactive recommendations “to all clients across any account type.” Galaxy highlights the bank’s newest house guidance—“up to 4%” of portfolios in digital assets—as a conservative but meaningful signal that crypto is being slotted alongside established diversifiers. The shift matters less as a branding exercise and more as a workflow change: when exposure becomes standard inside advisory toolkits, it can be modeled, rebalanced, and supervised under the same risk and suitability processes that govern equities, bonds, and alternatives. The research brief stresses how the wealth channel’s internal approval machinery has been the real gating factor. Advisors “can only allocate to products formally approved by their firms,” and those approvals depend on “custody readiness, compliance frameworks, operational integration, and client suitability standards.” Crypto has lagged not because advisors lack interest, Galaxy argues, but because “approval of crypto products has been especially cautious” amid volatility, evolving regulation, and a limited on-platform track record. That calculus is changing as banks build the “critical backbone” internally—trading, custody, and advisory systems that let them “offer secure, scalable crypto access through their wealth platforms.” In the same vein, the note flags movement among the largest brand names in US asset management and banking. Vanguard—long the archetype of crypto skepticism—“is reportedly preparing to offer select third-party crypto ETFs to its brokerage clients,” a reversal Galaxy attributes to “strong client demand and a more supportive regulatory climate,” while noting that there is “not yet [a] specific timeline or which ETFs will be made available.” Citi, for its part, “plans to launch institutional-grade crypto custody in 2026,” and JPMorgan “signaled that its clients will soon be able to trade bitcoin and other crypto assets,” albeit without in-house custody for now. Galaxy treats these moves less as isolated headlines than as evidence that banks intend to capture crypto flows “using their own integrated trading, custody, and advisory systems” to provide regulated access at scale. Policy context also features in Galaxy’s analysis. The brief points to the recent executive order allowing 401(k) plans to include crypto as an option” as a legitimizing step that helps fiduciaries and compliance teams grow comfortable with the risk profile of digital assets inside retirement plans. While implementation ultimately depends on how plan sponsors interpret fiduciary obligations, Galaxy’s point is that headline regulatory posture is no longer exclusively restrictive—reducing a key narrative and operational headwind for wealth platforms. Importantly, Galaxy situates the prospective 2% allocation within a broader spectrum of public guidance from prominent allocators over the past year. The firm notes that “BlackRock, Fidelity, Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, and Ric Edelman have publicly suggested crypto allocations ranging from a conservative 1% to as high as 40% in aggressive scenarios.” Within this range, Morgan Stanley’s “up to 4%” ceiling is neither fringe nor maximalist; it reads as a risk-budgeted sleeve for an asset class the bank now describes as “both a hedge against inflation and a long-term growth opportunity.” Galaxy extends the math: if average allocations across advised assets land closer to 1% than 2%, bitcoin ETF assets could still reach “$500 billion within a few years.” The bottom line: If advisors can finally “integrate crypto directly into traditional balanced portfolios,” the firm concludes, the industry will likely look back on this period as the point “where crypto transitions from a niche investment to a standard portfolio component, alongside equities, bonds, and gold.” At press time, the total crypto market cap was at $3.71 trillion.
