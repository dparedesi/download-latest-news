Title: US-China tariff hikes affect Polish container terminal sale
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/us-china-tariff-hikes-affect-polish-container-terminal-sale/a-72214420

Donald Trump's push to curb China's sway in the Panama Canal led to talk of a US firm buying stakes in ports from a Chinese firm, including a container terminal in Poland. With tariffs escalating, will the sale go ahead? When the Gdynia Container Terminal (GCT) on Poland's Baltic coast was taken over by Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports in 2005 it was quickly dubbed Gdynkong — a portmanteau of Gdynia and Hong Kong. Twenty years on, Gdynkong is now caught in the crosshairs of US President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Since his reelection last year, President Trump has repeatedly alleged Chinese interference in the Panama Canal and made it clear that he wants the US to "take back" the canal. On March 5, he announced that an agreement had been reached with CK Hutchison that the US investment firm BlackRock would purchase majority shares in CK Hutchison's Panama assets, including two ports at either end of the canal. As part of the deal, BlackRock would also buy 80% of approximately 40 assets in Hutchison's portfolio — one of which is the GCT in Poland. However, the discussion about the strategic importance of the Hutchison-controlled GCT in Poland long predates President Trump's push for greater control of the Panama Canal. The terminal and the port in general are important in their own right not only for Poland, but also for NATO and Ukraine. The GCT is located in the Port of Gdynia on the Baltic Sea. It is, therefore, on a main supply route from the West to Ukraine and close to infrastructure that is of strategic importance to both Poland and NATO. Indeed, the Polish government included the GCT on its list of critical infrastructure in 2024. Other entities in the Port of Gdynia include the Baltic Container Terminal, which is used by US forces and is just 150 meters from the GCT, the Polish Navy Special Forces base, the PGZ shipyard, where the new missile frigates for the Polish Navy are being built, and the main naval port for the Polish Navy, which is frequently visited by NATO ships. All this explains the GCT's major strategic relevance. However, there are also concerns about the terminal owner's ability to interfere with the port's accessibility in general. In August 2023, for example, equipment for the US Army was scheduled to be unloaded on a dock near the GCT. However, because the ship's bow protruded about 50 meters into the zone owned by Hutchison, the company refused to agree to the unloading. The unloading of the military equipment was unsuccessful. Eric Hontz, director of the Center for Accountable Investment at the Center for International Private Enterprise explains why this is so critical. Hontz says that were there to be an "accident" involving a commercial ship at the entrance to the port, much of the 3rd flotilla — the main strike force of the Polish Navy, whose main base is in the Port of Gdynia — would be stranded at port and, therefore, unable to assist in the event of Russian aggression. "These grey zone tactics blending commercial and security missions are now part and parcel of both Russian and Chinese tactics," Hontz told DW. But if the ports are of such importance — both economic and strategic — to China, why would Chinese firm Hutchison agree to sell so many of these assets? "CK Hutchison's decision to sell [an] 80% stake in 43 ports in 23 countries to a US-led consortium is not a sign of China's diminishing interest in controlling strategic ports in Europe and around the world. Instead, it appears to be a sign of a surprising disconnect between the Chinese government and the Hong Kong-based company," Maia Nikoladze, an associate director within the GeoEconomics Center, told DW. Hutchison leases the land on which the GCT stands, not from the Port of Gdynia but from the City of Gdynia. Thanks to a deal signed in 2007, Hutchison has an exceptionally cheap lease on the site until 2089. It pays just 294,000 zlotys (€68,000 or $75,700) a year, the City of Gdynia told the O2 news portal. "This is a story about how Poland lost control over a key part of the strategic NATO port in Gdynia," journalist Lukasz Rucinski, told DW. Rucinski, who has covered the evolving story for several years, says that Hutchison took advantage of legal loopholes and set up a special company in Luxembourg to allow it to gain control of land in the Port of Gdynia, making the terminal practically "extraterritorial." "It was a quiet process of handing over key infrastructure to the Chinese giant. Over the years, political decisions, strange arrangements and the lack of reaction from the state have meant that the Chinese have the final say. We also ask why they pay ridiculous amounts of money for perpetual usufruct [use and profit] of the port," Rucinski adds. But Gdynia is not the only port in Europe where Chinese companies are active. Hutchison has 53 terminals around the world, 13 of which are in Europe, including one each in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Sweden and Poland, as well as five in the Netherlands and three in the UK. In 2023, the German government went ahead with a decision to sell 24.9% of a Hamburg port terminal to Chinese shipping company COSCO, despite security concerns and opposition from within the ruling coalition. For the moment, however, the sale of 80% of GCT to BlackRock is far from a done deal. The transaction would first need to clear a number of regulatory hurdles in every jurisdiction that would be impacted by the sale, ranging from standard merger-control clearances on competition grounds to security-focused investment screening procedures, says Matej Simalcik, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies (CEIAS) in Bratislava. "Any of the regulators may attach their conditions to the sale, which may impact how the deal looks in the end," he told DW. But quite apart from that, it is possible that the sale might not go ahead at all. The proposed sale of Hutchison assets to BlackRock drew heavy criticism from Chinese state-owned media and attracted the attention of China's State Administration for Market Regulation. Indeed Beijing has launched an antitrust review into the proposed acquisition by BlackRock of CK Hutchison' assets in the Panama Canal. However, President Trump's recent decision to impose reciprocal tariffs on imports from dozens of countries has also had an impact. After Trump announced a steep increase in tariffs on goods from China, China retaliated. Neither side seems to have any intention of backing down. Earlier this week, NBC reported that the sale of the two ports in the Panama Canal run by CK Hutchison was due to be signed last week, but was delayed following pressure from China. How this delay and the escalation in tariffs between China and the US will impact the sale of the GCT in Poland remains to be seen. Edited by: Aingeal Flanagan

Title: US stock futures little changed after China raises tariffs on US goods to 125%

U.S. stocks bounced back in early afternoon, helped by some dip-buying after a brief decline earlier on a weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment reading in the University of Michigan's preliminary April survey. The mid-month reading on sentiment fell to 50.8 from 57.0 in March and below the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 54.6. Inflation is becoming a major concern, according to the report, with expectation for inflation a year from now jumping to 6.7%, the highest level since November 1981 and up from 5% in March. Expectations for economic conditions also dropped 10.3% to 47.2, the lowest since May 1980. The drop in consumer sentiment has been alarming to some economists who say when consumers feel nervous and gloomy about the economy, they tend to close their wallets. Consumers make up about 70% of the economy, so a slowdown in consumer spending will take a toll on economic growth. That pressured stocks around mid-morning, but buyers emerged to buy the dip and pushed all three major indexes back in the green. Despite stocks' violent swings, all three major stock indexes are on pace for gains this week. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are on pace for their best weekly performance since November. "It’s been a challenging week, but also a moment to seek opportunities and not succumb to fear," said Mark Dowding, BlueBay chief investment officer at RBC Global Asset Management. Indeed, individual investors have been buying the dips throughout the downturn. On April 9, the day Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause, investing platform Wealthfront said it saw most money flowing into accounts in the early morning hours before the tariff pause was announced. Additionally, on April 8 when markets tanked, Wealthfront saw a significant increase in deposits into bond ladders, making it the highest single day for bond ladder deposits this year and signaling that some investors are taking advantage of rising Treasury yields. Bond ladders are created by buying bonds at varying maturities. Investors use them to provide a more predictable income stream and potentially reduce interest rate risk if rates move. If rates rise, investors won't be locked into a single bond with a lower rate. The blue-chip Dow rose 1.56%, or 618.99 points to 40,212.65; the S&P 500 added 1.81%, or 95.31 points, to 5,363.36; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 2.06%, or 337.14 points, to 16,724.46. The benchmark 10-year yield rose to 4.478%. Gold, seen as a safe asset during tumultuous times, rallied past $3,200 per ounce to set another record high early in the day. It was last up 2.23%. Overnight, China increased its tariff on U.S imports to 125% but signaled it wouldn't match anymore increases by the U.S. “Even if the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it would be economically meaningless and would become a joke in the history of the world economy," China's finance ministry said. Despite those comments, the White House said Trump is "optimistic" China will seek a deal with the U.S. Meanwhile, the European Union said its trade representative would fly to Washington on Sunday to “try and sign deals," a sign a full-out global trade war may be averted. That sentiment helped stocks shortly after the open reverse a small part of Thursday's freefall, but money managers warn investors should remain cautious. Stocks swooned Thursday on fears President Donald Trump's triple-digit tariff on China would significantly damage the U.S. economy and corporate profits. Trump kept his 10% tariff on all countries but put reciprocal tariffs on hold for 90 days for all countries except China. Because China retaliated, Trump raised his tariff on Chinese goods to a total 145%. "While it was positive that most tariffs were lowered to 10%, the 145% tariff on China will still impair corporate profits," said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading. "The $440 billion of goods the U.S. imported from China last year was second only to Mexico," he said. "Those low production-cost goods, whether they are technology, apparel, or materials, are important to corporate earnings. The auto and metals tariffs remain in place, and pharma and semiconductor tariffs are on deck. Exemptions may be coming, but they are not here yet." Wholesale prices in March unexpectedly fell 0.4%, posting the first decline since October 2023. The drop compares with February's 0.1% gain and economists' forecasts for a 0.2% rise. Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, so-called core wholesale fell 0.1% against the estimate for a 0.3% increase. Wholesale prices are what businesses pay for their goods and services and sometimes seen as the first line for inflation to show up. This comes on the heesl of annual consumer inflation on Thursday showing a 2.4% rise in March, below economists' forecasts and February's 2.8%. It was the lowest annual increase since September. Still, some economists pointed out the inflation data are old, and "if tariffs stay in place, they will push inflation considerably higher in coming months," said Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank. Comforting words, though, came from New York Federal Reserve President John Williams. Williams said the U.S. economy is not entering a period of high inflation and low growth, and the U.S. Federal Reserve will act to keep so-called "stagflation" at bay. JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock kicked off earnings season. They provided the first glimpse into how businesses and consumers may be handling tariff volatility and how they see tariffs unfolding this year. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said his bank is "prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025, but the actual outcome will be dependent on the results and timing of the policy changes.” JP Morgan and Wells Fargo said they haven't seen a surge in companies tapping their credit lines. During times of stress and anxiety, companies grab cash from these credit lines to shore up financials, just in case. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said consumers also contninued to spend, though he said some may have been buying ahead of tariffs. Shares of JP Morgan closed up 4%; Wells Fargo fell almost 1 % after it lowered its full-year net interest income expectations; BlackRock rose 2.33%; and Morgan Stanley added 1.43%. Bitcoin rose back above the key $80,000 level, last up 5.23% at $83,756.51. Investors may watch to see if insiders sell any Trump digital tokens on April 17. Forty million of the tokens, recently worth more than $300 million, will be unlocked that day, meaning the owners of those tokens will be able to sell them for the first time since the Trump coin launched in January, according to the Trump cryptocurrency’s website. A company controlled by the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is among the owners that will be able to sell, according to Trump’s 2024 public financial disclosure required for federal candidates.

Title: New Hampshire and Florida advance state-owned Bitcoin reserve bills

New Hampshire's Bitcoin bill advances with strict asset guidelines while Florida sees rare bipartisan backing. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Efforts to create state-owned Bitcoin reserves are gaining traction in the United States, with Florida and New Hampshire taking significant steps this week. On April 10, New Hampshire’s House of Representatives approved House Bill 302 (HB 302) with a narrow 192–179 vote. The bill passed the Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee earlier and moved to the state Senate for further deliberation. If that hurdle is cleared, it will go to Governor Kelly Ayotte for final approval. HB 302 gives the state treasurer authority to allocate up to 10% of state funds into a combination of digital assets and precious metals. However, it enforces strict guidelines. Only cryptocurrencies with a minimum market capitalization of $500 billion qualify for investment. Currently, Bitcoin is the only digital asset that meets this threshold. Meanwhile, the bill also outlines how the state should handle custody. Digital assets must be held directly by the state treasurer using secure storage, via a qualified custodian, or through a registered exchange-traded product. It further allows the treasurer to engage in lending or staking, provided the state retains legal ownership and uses an approved third-party solution. With this progress, New Hampshire becomes the fourth state to pass such legislation in one chamber, following Arizona, Oklahoma, and Texas. Florida’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill HB487 has also made progress. The state’s Insurance and Banking Subcommittee unanimously approved it, clearing the way for further review on the House floor. This marks the first time a state SBR bill has passed a committee stage without opposition, signaling rare bipartisan support. Previously, most proposals of this nature have encountered resistance from Democrat lawmakers, primarily due to concerns about digital asset volatility and risk exposure. According to the bill, Bitcoin is considered a hedge against inflation by sovereign states and major institutional players, including BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. The legislation emphasizes the importance of giving the state access to tools like Bitcoin to help protect its finances from inflation. Representative Webster Barnaby, the bill’s sponsor, believes this move could position Florida as a leader in digital finance. The proposal also includes clear custody guidelines and allows investment either through direct purchase or regulated investment products. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

Title: Panama deal allows US to deploy troops to canal
URL: https://www.spacewar.com/reports/Panama_deal_allows_US_to_deploy_troops_to_canal_999.html
Time Published: 2025-04-11T09:38:03Z
Full Content:
The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and "other activities." The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught. But it gives the United States broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago. Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- could prove politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. - 'Country on fire' - Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the United States had asked to have its own bases. Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be "unacceptable." He warned Hegseth: "Do you want to create a mess, what we've put in place here would set the country on fire." In the watered-down "Memorandum of Understanding", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The United States recognized Panama's sovereignty -- not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion -- and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little comfort to worried Panamanians. "What we have here is a setback to national sovereignty," Panamanian trade union leader Saul Mendez told AFP. "What the Panamanian government has done is an act of treason. They are traitors and must be tried." - Difficult history - The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States. They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long US occupation of the canal zone and US invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega. That invasion killed more than 500 Panamanians and razed parts of the capital. Trump's vow to take back the canal, and his claim of Chinese influence have prompted mass demonstrations. By law, Panama operates the canal, giving access to all nations. But the US president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused the Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. The United States invaded Panama in 1989 to oust dictator Manuel Noriega, killing more than 500 Panamanians and razing parts of the capital.

The United States recognized Panama's sovereignty -- not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion -- and Panama will retain control over any installations.

They are traitors and must be tried." - Difficult history - The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States. They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long US occupation of the canal zone and US invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega.

By law, Panama operates the canal, giving access to all nations. But the US president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades.

The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash.

Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination.

Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature."

Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. The United States invaded Panama in 1989 to oust dictator Manuel Noriega, killing more than 500 Panamanians and razing parts of the capital. Related Links Naval Warfare in the 21st Century - Difficult history - The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States. They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long US occupation of the canal zone and US invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega.

Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999.

The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination.

The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said.

Pentagon chief says US could 'revive' Panama basesPanama City (AFP) April 10, 2025 - US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth floated the idea on Wednesday of US troops returning to Panama to "secure" its strategically vital canal, a suggestion quickly shot down by the Central American country's government. Hegseth suggested during a visit to Panama that "by invitation" the United States could "revive" military bases or naval air stations and rotate deployments of US troops to an isthmus the United States invaded 35 years ago. He also said his country was seeking free passage through the canal for its Navy ships -- which US President Donald Trump had said were "severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form." Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea.

He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere. "Make no mistake, Beijing is investing and operating in this region for military advantage and unfair economic gain," Hegseth said. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused Hong Kong-backed Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The firm rejected on Wednesday an audit that said it had failed to pay $1.2 billion due under its concession. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. The United States invaded Panama in 1989 to oust dictator Manuel Noriega, killing more than 500 Panamanians and razing parts of the capital. Related Links Naval Warfare in the 21st Century Trump, since coming to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of US container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. Hegseth suggested on Wednesday the slew of former US military bases that dot Panama could be used again to host US troops. He said a deal signed with Panama this week was an "opportunity to revive, whether it's the military base, naval air station, locations where US troops can work with Panamanian troops to enhance capabilities and cooperate in a rotational way." Hegseth cited the possibility of "joint exercises" but the mention of a "rotational" force is likely to raise the hackles of Panamanians, for whom sole ownership of the canal is a source of intense national pride. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force -- such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia -- is politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. His government quickly slapped down the idea. "Panama made clear, through President Mulino that we cannot accept military bases or defense sites," said Panama security minister Frank Abrego in a joint public appearance with Hegseth. - Perceived threat - Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls."

The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries -- including its two on the Panama Canal -- to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. The United States invaded Panama in 1989 to oust dictator Manuel Noriega, killing more than 500 Panamanians and razing parts of the capital. Related Links Naval Warfare in the 21st Century Hegseth also said the United States was seeking an agreement under which its warships could pass through the canal "first, and free." Jose Ramon Icaza, Panama's Minister for Canal Affairs, said "we will seek a mechanism by which warships and auxiliary ships can have a compensation system for services, that is, a way to make them cost-neutral" but not "free." The independent Panama Canal Authority (PCA) that manages the waterway said in a statement on Wednesday that it was seeking a "cost-neutral scheme" to "compensate services rendered in security matters for warship tolls." Under current treaties, the canal is open to all nations and all vessels must pay the same rates according to their capacity and cargo, regardless of their country of origin or destination. The PCA said the United States recognized Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway, although Hegseth did not mention it in the news conference. The Pentagon chief's two-day visit has been peppered with comments about China and its influence in Latin America. He said the United States was not looking for war with China but would counter Beijing's "threats" to the region. "We do not seek war with China. And war with China is certainly not inevitable. We do not seek it in any form," Hegseth said. "But together, we must prevent war by robustly and vigorously deterring China's threats in this hemisphere," the former Fox News anchor said in a speech. - 'Bullying nature' - China hit back after Hegseth's comments, saying US officials "maliciously attacked China... exposing the United States' bullying nature." Trump has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Hegseth asserted that China-based companies are also capturing Latin American land and infrastructure in strategic sectors such as energy and telecommunications, and that China has too large a military presence in the hemisphere.

Title: Panama deal allows US to deploy troops to canal
URL: https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/panama-deal-allows-us-to-deploy-troops-to-canal-207940
Time Published: 2025-04-11T05:56:19Z
Full Content:
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, accompanied by Public Security Minister Frank Abrego, speaks during a press conference in Panama City, Wednesday, April 9, 2025. U.S. troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by AFP Thursday, a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway. The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows U.S. military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and "other activities." The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught. But it gives the United States broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago. Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 percent of U.S. container traffic and five percent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the United States funded, built and controlled until 1999. The United States has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force — such as the one the United States maintains in Darwin, Australia — could prove politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. 'Country on fire' Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the United States had asked to have its own bases. Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that U.S. bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be "unacceptable." He warned Hegseth: "Do you want to create a mess, what we've put in place here would set the country on fire." In the watered-down "Memorandum of Understanding", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The United States recognized Panama's sovereignty — not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion — and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little comfort to worried Panamanians. "What we have here is a setback to national sovereignty," Panamanian trade union leader Saul Mendez told AFP. "What the Panamanian government has done is an act of treason. They are traitors and must be tried." Difficult history The country has a long and difficult relationship with the United States. They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long U.S. occupation of the canal zone and U.S. invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega. That invasion killed more than 500 Panamanians and razed parts of the capital. Trump's vow to take back the canal, and his claim of Chinese influence have prompted mass demonstrations. By law, Panama operates the canal, giving access to all nations. But the U.S. president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused the Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries — including its two on the Panama Canal — to a consortium led by U.S. asset manager BlackRock for $19 billion in cash. A furious Beijing has since announced an antitrust review of the deal. US, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff wrapped up his latest talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Friday, after President Donald Trump urged his Russian counterpart to move quicker to end what he said was the country's "senseless war" with Ukraine. President Donald Trump insisted Friday that his tariff policy was "doing really well" despite China hiking levies on U.S. goods to 125 percent in the spiraling trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Jack Butland was the hero as Rangers held its nerve in a penalty shoot-out to dump Jose Mourinho's Fenerbahçe out of the Europa League and reach the quarterfinals on March 13 night.

Ian Curran has the story relating to Ingram Homes where the broadcaster and former Fine Gael minister is listed as a director and which is behind a large-scale housing scheme in Midleton, Co Cork. It understood to be replacing BPH Construction after it entered receivership this week. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was on a plane when Donald Trump unleashed his “Liberation Day” trade upheaval. Did he catch any of the live press conference? No, he tells Joe Brennan in an extensive interview, but that doesn’t mean he hasn’t got a lot to say about it. Not long after Trump’s tariff U-turn, of sorts, the European Union (EU) moved to pause its retaliatory measures in the hope of building some goodwill. “We took note of the announcement by president Trump. We want to give negotiations a chance,” commission president Ursula von der Leyen said. Nevertheless, as Jack Power reports from Brussels, uncertainty remains. Or as EU commissioner for industrial policy Stéphane Séjourné says, the “only certainty is that instability will remain for the next four years”. Meanwhile, it emerged that US tariffs levelled against China have now, in their entirety, reached 145 per cent. Denis Staunton is reporting from Beijing on the response there where officials say they are open to dialogue but only absent of threats. “China’s position is clear and consistent,” said spokesman He Yongqian, “…our door remains open, but dialogue must be conducted on the basis of mutual respect.” Meanwhile, Arthur Beesley has a comprehensive explainer on everything that has happened, for now at least, and why. It’s hard to keep up with tariff news, given just how prone Donald Trump is to changing his mind. Not to mention the markets. There has been much made of what it all might mean for Ireland, given our close ties to US multinationals. In his column, John FitzGerald has a think about what the best responses might be from an EU point of view, and what the manufacturing of iPhones in Asia might mean for our coffers here. Much like tariffs, Dublin Airport’s efforts to lift its passenger cap rumbles on, although with little sign of imminent change. Peter Flanagan reports that there will be no restriction on slots for carriers this winter, with an ongoing legal challenge keeping the cap on hold. The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has cleared additional slots for the upcoming winter season. US technology giant Workday has completed the deal to locate its new European HQ to College Square, the mammoth office scheme developed by Marlet Property Group on the old site of Apollo House in Dublin 2. The agreement, first reported on by The Irish Times, is a substantial office deal, and gives Workday’s staff the equivalent of five and a half football pitches. An Irish payroll manager who admitted “spying” on his own firm has escaped punishment for contempt of court. Keith O’Brien had faced the possibility of going to jail for contempt after destroying a phone he had been ordered to preserve. Rippling, a US-headquartered software provider brought High Court proceedings against its former employee claiming he had passed trade secrets to rival company Deel. Latest data shows headline inflation in the Irish economy reached to 2 per cent in March, for the first time since July 2024. That was up from an annualised inflation rate of 1.8 per cent. Ian Curran crunches the numbers which show restaurants, hotels and housing made the largest contribution.

Title: Market volatility order of the day as investors eye Trump’s next move

The unseasonably cold snap blasting much of North America is delaying the spring DIY sales boost toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker typically enjoys about this time of year. But the Connecticut-based maker of power screwdrivers to lawnmowers felt a harsher chill from Washington last week when Donald Trump unleashed tariffs on the rest of the world. Stanley Black & Decker may be better able to deal with the rapidly escalating trade war between the US and China than it would have been under Trump’s first presidency. “Seven, eight years ago, about 40 per cent of what we sold in the US came from China. And now we’re down to a number that’s closer to the mid-teens,” chief executive Don Allan told analysts on a call in January. It didn’t stop the company’s shares sliding 29 per cent over the course of 4½ days of trading following Trump’s April 2nd ‘Liberation Day’ speech. It made the toolmaker one of the worst affected stocks on the S&P 500 index as a violent wider market reaction wiped trillions off the value of shares globally and triggered gyrations across other financial markets. That was before the US president sensationally announced during lunchtime trading in New York on Wednesday (just after 6pm Irish time) that he would be putting a 90-day pause on most tariffs. Even though he has doubled down on China – levies on imports from there would rise to 125 per cent from 104 per cent after Beijing unveiled additional retaliatory charges earlier in the day – Stanley Black & Decker would not be denied participating in the biggest one-day Wall Street rebound since October 2008, jumping 15 per cent as the wider US market soared 9.5 per cent. [ White House says tariffs on China now total 145%Opens in new window ] While the relief rally spilled over into Asia and Europe on Thursday, selling pressure resumed as trading got under way again on Wall Street as markets waited for Trump’s next move. The market reaction seen for most of the past 10 days was “very different to anything we’d seen before”, said Aidan Donnelly, head of equities at Davy Private Clients. “Unlike, say, the financial crisis or Covid, this was self-inflicted.” Elliot Hentov, head of macro policy research at State Street Global Advisors, said stocks “would now require another positive trigger to take another leg up, while policy uncertainty continues to dominate market moves in coming weeks”. “The residual unknown would relate to whether US-China trade relations could improve within a reasonable time frame,” he said. The about-turn proved that Trump pays attention to the markets. But while the S&P 500 is usually the 78-year-old’s barometer of choice, it was the bond market that forced him to blink first in his game of chicken with what he had called “foreign scavengers”. Investors had initially piled into US government bonds – a traditional safe haven in times of market volatility – in the immediate aftermath of last week’s tariffs speech, sending the market interest rate – or yield – on its 10-year notes from about 4.2 per cent to below 4 per cent. However, the yield – which drives not only government borrowing costs but influences rates on new mortgages, credit card debt and business loans – spiked in the first three days of this week to as high as 4.5 per cent. This was an unusual move at a time when recession fears are mounting. It triggered a number of theories, ranging from investors dashing for cash to hedge funds being forced to sell to meet margin calls, and speculation that Chinese and Japanese investors – among the largest holders of US debt and worst impacted by Trump’s protectionist measures – were dumping US government bonds. Trump, who vowed over the weekend to maintain his hard line against the country’s trading partners even after stocks tanked, acknowledged on Wednesday evening the flashpoint that had spooked him most. [ US tariffs: Why Trump U-turned on his bombastic tariffs and what it means for IrelandOpens in new window ] “The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it,” he told reporters. “I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.” His government needs to refinance trillions of dollars of debt in the next 12 months. The announcement of the 90-day moratorium suggests markets can probably eliminate worst-case scenarios, according to Barry Glavin, the Dublin-based head of global equities at Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager. “However, it also means that uncertainty will continue throughout this period,” he said. “It remains unclear what a steady-state looks like in terms of the tariff regime the US will stick with. It also remains to be seen what retaliatory measures will be implemented.” Trump’s major reversal will see tariffs on nations that don’t retaliate against the US drop to 10 per cent, which aligns with his blanket tariff level on all imports. Before this, most imports from the EU were facing a 20 per cent charge. EU member states had only approved 25 per cent counter-tariffs on a wide range of US products earlier on Wednesday, including poultry, soyabeans and steel. These were suspended on Thursday. The seven days that followed Trump whipping out his tariffs chart in the White House Rose Garden saw shares globally – measured by the MSCI World Index – slumping more than 11 per cent and Wall Street’s gauge of market fear, the Vix index, spiking at levels last seen five years ago during the height of the Covid panic. Banking stocks bore the brunt of the sell-off in Ireland – with Bank of Ireland, AIB and PTSB sliding between 14 and 18 per cent, amid concerns about the fallout on Ireland’s open economy. Only hours before his volte-face, Trump was threatening to soon announce “major” tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, which make up 60 per cent of Irish goods shipments across the Atlantic. In Dublin, too, the Central Bank upped its surveillance of Irish-domiciled funds holding €4.9 trillion of assets, making it the second-largest funds hub in Europe. [ EU hits pause on counter-tariffs in hope of US trade dealOpens in new window ] “Approximately €2.1 billion, or circa 43 per cent, of the total net assets of Irish domiciled investment funds are invested in global equities. The Central Bank has been closely monitoring data flows and engaging directly with various market participants in recent days, as is standard at times of heightened market volatility,” a spokeswoman for the regulator said. “We cannot comment on individual firms or the specifics of our supervisory engagements, but we continue to monitor for indicators of stress.” Over the seven days, the price of crude oil plunged by more than a fifth to less than $56 a barrel on recession fears; gold, a traditional go-to for investors in times of uncertainty, hit an all-time high of almost $3,168 an ounce before falling almost 7 per cent; and the premium that investors demand to hold debt of companies with low credit ratings, or junk bonds, spiralled at their fastest pace, relative to government debt, since the US regional banking crisis in March 2023. The cost of investors insuring against companies and sovereigns defaulting on debt on the credit default swaps market also moved higher. The turbulence was compounded by mixed messaging on the ultimate aim of the tariffs regime, with Trump and his treasury secretary Scott Bessent suggesting it would yield trade deals, while his top adviser on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, insisted there was no room for negotiation. Dissent also crept into the upper echelons of Trump’s Make America Great Again movement. Elon Musk, head of Tesla and SpaceX, and Trump sidekick, distanced himself from the plan over the weekend when he suggested the US should enter a free-trade zone with Europe. He subsequently entered into a bitter public spat with Navarro, calling the protectionist former economics professor “a moron”. Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a vocal backer of Trump’s presidential bid last year, urged the president to pause the tariffs, or risk “a self-induced, economic nuclear winter”. Ken Fisher, founder of Fisher Investments and a longtime Trump supporter since the 2016 campaign, went even further. He took to X on Tuesday to say the tariffs were “stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools”. What Trump unveiled Wednesday is stupid, wrong, arrogantly extreme, ignorant trade-wise and addressing a non-problem with misguided tools. Yet, as near as I can tell it will fade and fail and the fear is bigger than the problem, which from here is bullish. Musk and the other six CEOs of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies that had led the wider market higher in recent years – including Apple’s Tim Cook, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg, all flag wavers at Trump’s inauguration in January – saw tens of billions wiped off their combined net wealth as the values of their companies fell. “Speedy ‘deal’ announcements over the coming 4-6 weeks would be the most favourable (or least negative) outcome for equity markets, in our view, and remain our base case,” said Deutsche Bank equity strategists, led by Maximilian Uleer, in a report published even before Trump announced his U-turn. If the US had stuck to the tariffs announced last week, Deutsche reckons it would have shaved as much as 1.5 percentage points off US gross domestic product (GDP) expansion this year – suggesting the economy would barely grow. It would only have been a matter of time before equity markets priced in a potential recession in Europe, too, they said. There is a threat that the US will return to its original tariffs plan once the 90-day pause is over, even though Trump – who sees himself as the ultimate dealmaker – has significantly weakened his hand by caving in to market forces. For now, a unilateral 10 per cent charge on most imports remains. “Right now, we don’t know who will pay for them,” said Ipek Ozkardeskava, a senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. “Will exporters absorb the majority of the costs to protect their US market share? Or will exporters pass on the costs to US consumers?” Investors will be closely monitoring commentary from US companies as the first-quarter earnings season kicks off on Friday with banking giants JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo and investment group BlackRock reporting results and hosting analyst calls. While Davy’s Donnelly says market volatility may be the order of the day for the near term, he notes that investors with a long-term perspective have historically been well rewarded. The MSCI World Index’s 13 per cent decline so far this year compares to an almost 19 per cent advance over the course of 2024. The index is up by about 50 per cent from where it stood at the end of 2019. “In that period we’ve had a global pandemic, a massive swing in global interest rates and a trade dispute, and yet equities are up sharply,” said Donnelly. “If you were to be shown a chart in five years’ time depicting the performance of the stock market over 10 years, you probably wouldn’t be able to pick out [the current episode].” Joe Brennan is Markets Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: How will Trump, Putin shape Germany's foreign policy?

Germany's Social Democrats and Conservatives are eager to form a coalition amid the global economic and political uncertainty. The conservative Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and center-left Social Democrats (SPD) have announced a coalition agreement, bringing Germany that much closer to forming a new government. It appears international friction and the recent tariff policies imposed by US President Donald Trump pushed negotiators to reach an agreement sooner, rather than later. Presenting the new agreement on Wednesday, Friedrich Merz of the CDU, likely to become the country's next chancellor, said Germany was currently facing a "situation of growing geopolitical tensions." The response of the coalition-in-waiting to these uncertain times, he said, was that "we want to, and we will, help shape change in the world, for Germany." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Lars Klingbeil, the co-leader of the SPD, added that "this is a turning point. We are living in truly historic times." When the new government takes office, expected it early May, it will be facing several important challenges on the world stage. Trump's steep import tariffs and the countermeasures some affected countries have adopted in retaliation have sent global stock markets into a downward spiral and sparked fears of a global trade war. As an export-driven nation, these tariffs have hit Germany particularly hard — and even more so given that its economy has been in recession for more than two years. The European Union manages trans-Atlantic trade, so Germany cannot act independently in this matter. That's why, in light of its economic vulnerability, the incoming German government is hoping to deescalate. The coalition agreement states that Germany will aim for "a medium-term free trade deal with the United States," while in the short term, "the coalition parties aim to avoid a trade conflict with the US and focus on reducing import tariffs," on both sides of the Atlantic. Given Trump's recent series of economic about-faces, this approach might prove a bit too optimistic. Merz has long been a staunch supporter of trans-Atlantic relations. He chaired Atlantik-Brücke, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to fostering US-German relations, for 10 years. And while he's never actually lived in the United States, he does say that the years he spent working for the US-based global investment firm BlackRock made him very familiar with the US mindset. However, ever since Trump retook the White House for a second term, it would appear Merz's faith in close trans-Atlantic ties has been shaken. When the US president — falsely — blamed Ukraine for Russia's war of aggression, Merz stated that he was " shocked by Donald Trump." And he was reportedly equally appalled when Trump and his vice president, JD Vance , publicly embarrassed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House in late February. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Germany, meanwhile, fell out of Trump's favor years ago, when former Chancellor Angela Merkel was still at the helm. This was not least due to her open refugee policy, which apparently was a thorn in the eye of the US nationalist. But even though Merz has consistently distanced himself from Merkel politically, a personal meeting between him and Trump would likely not be easy. To date, nothing has been planned. Trump's efforts to secure a peace "deal" for Ukraine have relegated European nations to the role of spectators. So far, he has only spoken directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin about a possible peace framework. Ukraine's Zelenskyy has remained sidelined from discussions. Should an agreement emerge, it's likely to amount to an imposed settlement for Ukraine, and Germany and other EU nations will presumably be left with the task of enforcing it. The incoming coalition appears to want to continue supporting Ukraine. "We stand with the brave Ukrainian people. They can rely on us," said Klingbeil on Wednesday. In reality, the coalition partners have yet to make a final decision on the matter. Until then, it remains unclear how military aid will proceed. While he was still leading the opposition in the previous government under outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Merz advocated for sending Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine. Scholz consistently opposed the move, fearing it could draw Germany into direct conflict with Russia. On election night in February, Merz admitted he was unsure whether Trump would honor the US' collective defense commitments under NATO's Article 5, should the need arise. That's why, he said, he wanted to strengthen European defense cooperation, "so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US." Merz has already secured parliamentary approval for his famous financial pledge of "whatever it takes" to strengthen the German armed forces. Part of deepening European defense cooperation would mean exploring ways in which Germany and Europe might benefit from the nuclear deterrence offered by the continent's two nuclear powers, France and the UK. That will be no easy feat, given that neither nuclear power is likely to readily share its capabilities. Many other EU nations also hold reservations against deeper military cooperation. And Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban not only maintains close ties with Russia's Putin, he also opposes military aid for Ukraine. In the past, Merz repeatedly accused Scholz's administration of neglecting European ties, especially regarding Germany's relations with its neighbors France and Poland. Now that he's poised to take charge, Merz aims to change this — but there's much to do. Just days after winning the election, Merz visited French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris. But Macron is politically weakened at home. And while Poland might have a pro-European government under former EU Council President Donald Tusk, Berlin does not have a close relationship with Warsaw. Across the EU enthusiasm for deeper integration has waned, with right-wing populist movements steadily rising in many member states. Amid ongoing trade-related friction with Trump, some politicians in Berlin and Brussels are eyeing China as an alternative trade partner. But trade with China is no longer as lucrative as it once was. German car exports, once a major success in China, have seen declining sales. Now, the EU has begun imposing restrictions on Chinese electric vehicles. As an export-oriented country, Germany will likely try to prevent these trade barriers from becoming too high. The future government will also aim to reduce security risks associated with China. In the coalition agreement, the partners have agreed to "effectively prevent foreign investments in critical infrastructure and strategically relevant sectors that conflict with our national interests." This passage is likely directed straight at China. When it comes to relations with Israel, Germany sees itself in a particularly difficult bind. On the one hand, due to Germany's Nazi past and its orchestration of the Holocaust, in which over 6 million Jews and nearly 5 million other people from minority groups were killed, German governments have since seen a historic duty in safeguarding the state of Israel. On the other hand, Israel's ongoing military action in Gaza and the occupied West Bank has drawn some guarded criticism from German politicians as being disproportionate. Israel claims its military campaign in Gaza and the West Bank is to root out the Palestinian nationalist and Islamist movement Hamas. Since October 7, 2023, Israeli forces have killed at least 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, overwhelmingly women and children, and displaced more than 80% of the population. The occupied West Bank has also recently seen a spike in violence, with over 700 Palestinians killed in the same time frame. Germany and several other countries designate Hamas as a terrorist organization. In late 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. This puts Germany in a tough spot. As a signatory to the Rome Statute which underpins the ICC, Germany would be legally obligated to arrest and extradite Netanyahu, should he enter Germany. But Merz has already promised that, under his chancellorship, Germany would "find ways and means" for Netanyahu to visit and leave the country unbothered. At the tail end of the outgoing administration, the Green Party managed to secure significant funding for climate protection and even saw the constitution amended to include the goal of climate neutrality by 2045. But on a global scale, the situation looks much different. Right after taking office, Trump withdrew the US from all international climate agreements. Meanwhile, major US financial institutions like BlackRock and JPMorgan have also distanced themselves from climate-friendly investments. This will make it much harder for Germany to push forward climate protection measures at an international level. Environmental groups suspect the new government is not as committed to the issue, anyway. They see the coalition agreement's wording — "climate protection must be balanced with economic competitiveness and social equity" — as a substantial weakening of Germany's previous climate goals.

Title: King of Wall Street says European leaders ‘starting to focus on a growth agenda, not a control agenda’

Donald Trump’s Liberation Day speech didn’t take long to free the market bears, sparking chaos across global equity and debt markets for days. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was on a flight from Amsterdam to Dublin on his Gulfstream private jet on the evening of April 2nd, when Trump took to the White House Rose Garden to unveil a raft of “reciprocal tariffs” on the rest of the world and railed about how “foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream”. Fink, whose firm’s $11.6 trillion (€10.5 trillion) of assets under management as of December made it greater than the German, French and Italian economies combined, met me the following morning in the Merrion Hotel, fresh from having delivered a speech at an event held by the State’s Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and a meeting earlier with Taoiseach Micheál Martin. Did he manage to capture any of the speech live? “I didn’t,” he said, adding that while he expected the tariffs to affect the markets for a number of days, “over a year or so, we’ll work it out”. Still, he said he saw the likelihood of a US recession as “not insignificant” over the next few months. In the days following the interview, Fink told the Economic Club of New York that most CEOs he talks to were saying the world’s largest economy is probably already in recession. But the 72-year-old, a lifelong Democrat supporter, was reticent when asked whether he agreed with Trump’s tariff policy, which the president sensationally largely paused on Wednesday for 90 days – except for China – after the sell-off of stocks and US government bonds became too much. “It’s not for me to agree,” Fink said. “But I understand the logic behind it.” “When I think about economic policy post-World War II, so much of the US trade policies were related to lifting more countries throughout the world, knowing that that would be good for the US and US exporters. The world’s changed quite considerably now. Does there need to be asymmetry in trading agreements? How can we make more symmetry between nations? That’s what he said.” [ BlackRock chief sees risk of brief recession in US amid Trump tariffsOpens in new window ] Fink may have drawn the ire of Republicans in recent years for being seen as a key player in the environment, social and governance (ESG) movement – or, as some would call it, “woke capital” – but his latest annual letter to shareholders, released last week, is more in tune with the sensibilities of a party that now controls the White House and both chambers of the Congress. Those who ran away from the financial crisis here in Ireland, or because of the fear of Brexit and what it means for Ireland, or because of the fear of what Covid meant for Ireland ... they were harmed It omits any reference to climate change, or even diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) – in stark contrast to his 2020 letter in which he famously suggested that “climate risk is investment risk” and was a factor worth evaluating in investment decisions. Trump, meanwhile, personally hailed BlackRock for leading a consortium that agreed last month to buy a ports holding company from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holding for $22.8 billion, which would give the US investment giant control of two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. It came at a time when Trump had been railing against what he saw as China’s influence and control over the crucial canal. Fink rejects the notion that the deal was in any way politically motivated. “If I ever did that, I should be fired. Okay? Fired,” he says. “Our job is to be providing each and every client a fine, long-term investment return. If I ever overlay political concerns or political realities – that I’m doing something for political reasons – then [I] should be fired. It’s not my money.” Much of that money is based in Irish-based funds. Over $1 trillion of BlackRock’s global assets under management are invested in the group’s 550-plus Irish domiciled funds. It opened an office in Dublin, home to one of the world’s largest funds hubs, in 2011, at the height of the financial crisis, and has subsequently grown its headcount to more than 140 employees. He uses Ireland as an example to illustrate how investors should ignore the “noise” of what’s driving financial markets from one week to the next – and how investors should remain focused on the long term. “Everybody’s worried about tariffs at the moment. But the moment doesn’t matter. The biggest problem that I see in the developed world today is all the uncertainty around whether people have adequacy in savings. Can they retire with dignity? That’s not a today problem. If the market goes down 3 per cent today or up 3 per cent today, it doesn’t matter. How do you give people more hope that they can invest over the long run and have a pool of money so they can live in retirement with dignity? “For those who ran away from the financial crisis here in Ireland, or because of the fear of Brexit and what it means for Ireland, or because of the fear of what Covid meant for Ireland ... they were harmed. The most important thing is staying in the market, being optimistic over the long run. Yes, there’s going to be a lot of noise. But for those who remained in the market over the last 15 years, they made a lot of money.” “We’re caught up the ups and downs of markets. We’re caught up in the noise. We’re caught up in the politicisation of everything. But for investors who are focusing on investing for retirement, for the long term, the most important thing is to stay in the market.” While about 60 per cent of Americans are invested in shares or the wider capital markets, only a third of Europeans have such exposure. Fink says the Irish figure is below 20 per cent. There are many reasons, such as the lack of a capital markets union (despite the European Commission pushing for this for the past decade), and the fact that many investors – including hundreds of thousands in Ireland – bear the scars from investing in the privatisation of European telecoms just before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000. “I think it’s more systematic than that,” says Fink. “I think Europeans tend to be more short-term than Americans. I think it’s a function of having two world wars.” “You could argue that Americans are always too optimistic. But that optimism has created the dynamism of America, it’s created more entrepreneurialism. You have so many young people [in America] who want to start their own companies and believe that they have an opportunity to do that. But that is not as broad here in Europe. “If you don’t take risks, you will never make a return.” He sees his own career as capturing that American spirit. Having graduated from University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), with a master’s in business administration in 1976, the LA native went to work in the storied Wall Street investment bank First Boston, where he rose over the following decade to become a star mortgage-backed securities trader. However, his department made a disastrous unhedged bet in 1986 on the direction of interest rates, a move that would cost the firm $100 million and mark the beginning of the end of his career with the institution. Fink left First Boston in 1988. The bank let it be known at the time that he was fired. He co-established BlackRock as a bond shop the same year with seven other executives under the umbrella Blackstone, the then fledgling private equity firm. Blackstone was led then, as now, by Steve Schwarzman. “The ashes of my failure at First Bost were the fertiliser, or the foundation, of BlackRock,” says Fink. It taught him the lesson that risk management is absolutely essential. Blackstone exited its BlackRock investment in 1994 following tension between Fink and Schwarzman over employee compensation. BlackRock’s first big break came the same year, when it was hired by US conglomerate General Electric to sell off its then Kidder Peabody stockbroking unit’s portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. It floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999. In 2006, BlackRock bought Merrill Lynch Investment Management. It doubled the group’s assets under management to almost $1 trillion and gave the investment bank a 45.8 per cent stake in the business. BlackRock’s financial solutions advisory business landed a host of gigs advising governments and investment banks around the globe during the financial crisis – starting with playing a key role in helping the Federal Reserve Bank of New York put figures on hard-to-value assets in Bear Stearns as it faltered, paving the way for a government-led rescue and sale of the faltering investment bank to JP Morgan. In Ireland, BlackRock was involved in an assessment of loans in the banks in the wake of the State’s international bailout, to help determine the ultimate size of the black hole on their books – and how much taxpayers would ultimately need to inject into the system to keep it afloat. The final bill came to €64 billion. BlackRock also took advantage of Barclay’s need to boost its capital levels in 2009 by acquiring the UK banking giant’s asset management arm, including its exchange traded funds (ETFs) business, iShares, for about £4 billion (€4.6 billion) and an almost 20 per cent stake in the group. The masterstroke made the business the world’s biggest asset manager and Fink the king of Wall Street. Merrill, now part of Bank of America, and Barclays have long since sold their stakes. Last year, BlackRock went on its biggest deals spree ever, starting off by paying $12.5 billion for Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a large infrastructure fund manager whose investments includes data centres, airports, railroads and water and waste management companies. It followed up by buying Preqin, one of the world’s leading data firms in private markets, for $3.2 billion, and spending $12 billion on HPS Investment Partners, a private-credit firm. GIP was a key part of the ports deal agreed last month. In his latest annual letter to shareholders, Fink took aim at the 73-year-old modern investment portfolio strategy developed by Nobel Prize-winning economists Harry Markowitz and William Sharp, which allocates roughly 60 per cent of assets to shares and 40 per cent to bonds. In future, he said, the standard portfolio may look more like 50/30/20 – stocks, bonds and private market assets such as real estate, infrastructure and private credit. “Assets that will define the future – data centres, ports, power grids, the world’s fastest-growing private companies – aren’t available to most investors. They’re in private markets, locked behind high walls, with gates that open only for the wealthiest or largest market participants,” he wrote. “Private markets don’t have to be as risky. Or opaque. Or out of reach. Not if the investment industry is willing to innovate – and that’s exactly what we’ve spent the past year doing at BlackRock.” The letter also suggests now is the time to be more “bullish about Europe”. It was a conclusion he seems to have come to at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, when he detected a pessimism like never before among delegates about the outlook for the continent, following a decade and a half of low growth and a perception that business is being over-regulated. “I had lunch with 14 European CEOs [at Davos] and the pessimism, you could cut it with a knife,” he says. “It was so palpable and it just was so obvious to me that the pessimism was overdone. But the pessimism was loud enough that I think finally the Europeans were waking up and saying, ‘we got to change’.” A political agreement reached in Germany last month to shift from the country’s stringent debt rules after years of underinvestment is a game changer for the EU’s largest economy, he says. It saw the country’s chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz secure backing in parliament to ramp up investment – expected to reach €1 trillion over the next decade – in the country’s infrastructure, green energy and military, justifying the move by pointing to the breakdown of transatlantic relationships, growing geopolitical instability and the need for more defence spending. Fink says that conversations with European CEOs in recent months suggests there has been a broader change in attitude among European leaders and regulators. “They’re starting to focus on a growth agenda,” he says, “not a control agenda.” Name: Larry Fink Job: Chief executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager Lives: On a farm in North Salem in upstate New York, though he is mainly based on weekdays in his pad in Manhattan.

World Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino looks on as US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth signs a bilateral agreement, in Panama City on Apr 9, 2025. (Photo: AFP/Franco Brana) PANAMA CITY: US troops will be able to deploy to a string of bases along the Panama Canal under a joint deal seen by AFP on Thursday (Apr 10), a major concession to President Donald Trump as he seeks to reestablish influence over the vital waterway. The agreement, signed by top security officials from both countries, allows US military personnel to deploy to Panama-controlled facilities for training, exercises and "other activities". The deal stops short of allowing the United States to build its own permanent bases on the isthmus, a move that would be deeply unpopular with Panamanians and legally fraught. But it gives the US broad sway to deploy an unspecified number of personnel to bases, some of which Washington built when it occupied the canal zone decades ago. Trump, since returning to power in January, has repeatedly claimed that China has too much influence over the canal, which handles about 40 per cent of US container traffic and 5 per cent of world trade. His administration has vowed to "take back" control of the strategic waterway that the US funded, built and controlled until 1999. The US has long participated in military exercises in Panama. However, a longer-term rotational force - such as the one the US maintains in Darwin, Australia - could prove politically toxic for Panama's center-right leader Jose Raul Mulino. Mulino was on Thursday in Peru, where he revealed that the US had asked to have its own bases. Mulino said he had told visiting Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth that US bases, allowed under an earlier draft, would be "unacceptable". He warned Hegseth: "Do you want to create a mess, what we've put in place here would set the country on fire." In the watered-down "Memorandum of Understanding", signed by Hegseth and Panama's security chief Frank Abrego on Wednesday, Panama won its own concessions. The US recognised Panama's sovereignty - not a given following Trump's refusal to rule out an invasion - and Panama will retain control over any installations. Panama will also have to agree to any deployments. But given Trump's willingness to rip up or rewrite trade deals, treaties and agreements, that might offer little succor to worried Panamanians. The country has a long and difficult relationship with the US. They have close cultural and economic ties, despite the decades-long US occupation of the canal zone and US invasion 35 years ago to overthrow dictator Manuel Noriega. That invasion killed more than 500 Panamanians and razed parts of the capital. Trump vow to take back the canal, and his claim of Chinese influence have prompted mass demonstrations. By law, Panama operates the canal giving access to all nations. But the US president has zeroed in on the role of a Hong Kong company that has operated ports at either end of the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for decades. Under pressure from the White House, Panama has accused the Panama Ports Company of failing to meet its contractual obligations and pushed for the firm to pull out of the country. The ports' parent company CK Hutchison announced last month a deal to offload 43 ports in 23 countries - including its two on the Panama Canal - to a consortium led by US asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash.

India's industrial production growth slows to 2.9% in February 2025, with manufacturing, mining, and power sectors underperforming. .The 90-day pause on U.S. tariffs is seen as a major boost to global sentiment, reducing the risk of a deep U.S. recession and financial market disruption. Emkay expects a rebound in commodity prices and a wave of bilateral trade deals that will limit economic damage. Domestically, the RBI’s easing stance is expected to support a recovery in consumption. While government capex may slow, sectors like power should drive growth. A soft U.S. landing is also a tailwind for Technology, aiding employment and discretionary demand. Emkay maintains its FY26 Nifty EPS estimate at 1,156. Q4FY25 results are mixed—topline growth for Emkay’s universe is muted at 2.1% YoY, with PAT declining 7.2% due to margin compression and a high base in Energy. However, excluding these, revenue grew 7.5% and PAT 10.8%. Margins (Nifty ex-BFSI) are expected to expand by 71bps to 20.1%, with Telecom, Healthcare, and Materials leading. Discretionary and Energy are expected to deliver a weak Q4FY25. Rupee surges 61 paise against the dollar due to US tariff suspension, equity market rebound, and dollar correction.

Brokerage firms bullish on Hindustan Zinc's performance, citing cost leadership, growth potential in silver, zinc, and value-added products. “Our assessment indicates minimal material impact on our business from these reciprocal tariffs.

Title: Corporate Bitcoin holdings concentrated in few custodians pose systemic risk

Jameson Lopp argued that enterprise adoption of Bitcoin without sovereignty is a 'footgun.' Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. As Bitcoin’s (BTC) appeal as a treasury asset grows, Casa co-founder and CSO Jameson Lopp assessed that concentrating the amount of BTC on a few custody service providers might pose a systemic risk. Lopp said: “The ‘Bitcoin Corporate Treasury’ narrative is a footgun if it’s not accompanied by the sovereignty via self custody narrative. Number Go Up folks are pitching companies to funnel their funds into a handful of trusted third parties. Systemic Risk Go Up.” This is not the first time Lopp has raised concerns over custody this week. He previously questioned whether a third party would act as custodian in response to Pierre Rochard’s announcement of the Bitcoin Bond Company on April 7. The firm plans to invest up to $1 trillion in Bitcoin until 2046. Rochard said there are already “lots of great institutional custodians to work with.” Based on Bitcoin Treasuries data, public and private companies currently hold 1,019,136 BTC in their treasuries. This amount equals 32.3% of the 3,150,000 BTC controlled by large entities and 5.13% of the total 19,849,381 BTC in circulation. The expanding role of custodians in managing institutional Bitcoin positions parallels patterns observed in traditional finance. Institutions typically rely on licensed custodians to meet internal governance requirements and regulatory compliance. Strategy executive president Michael Saylor highlighted this usage in October 2024 when he said that the risk of government seizure of Bitcoins is lower when held with institutional custodians. Saylor said they “adhere to legal and tax obligations.” Saylor’s company has over 528,000 BTC in its treasury, divided between custodians such as Fidelity, Anchorage Digital, and Coinbase Prime. Notably, these are the same services used by high-profile entities interacting with Bitcoin, such as BlackRock, which relies on Coinbase and recently added Anchorage. While this may streamline treasury management, it creates single points of failure in a network built for distributed control, such as Bitcoin. However, the solution might not be as simple as self-custody. Kaia’s chairman Sangmin Seo highlighted that, although the lack of self-custody introduces risks, “sovereignty without usability creates friction.” He concluded: “Infra builders need to solve both, or we’re just rebranding old models.” Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: XRP ETF debut stuns investors in bear market, analyst claims

What’s driving this crypto product surge despite market downturn? Teucrium’s 2x Long Daily XRP ETF had an impressive debut on the New York Stock Exchange on the 8th of April. The launch recorded an impressive $5.43 million in turnover on its first day, despite Ripple [XRP] facing significant price pressure. Trading under the ticker XXRP, the ETF managed to achieve this success amid a broader crypto market downturn, with Bitcoin [BTC] slipping to $78,000 and XRP reaching a five-month low of $1.61. On the 8th of April, XRP’s price briefly rebounded to $1.87 before dipping back to $1.69 by evening. Despite this volatility, Teucrium proceeded with the launch of its ETF, aimed at enabling investors to profit from price swings in either direction. XXRP’s impressive performance, even amid bearish market conditions, received praise from Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, who characterized the launch as “very respectable.” Balchunas said, “$XXRP (2x XRP ETF) saw $5mil in volume on Day One, very respectable, esp considering the mkt conditions.” He added, “That puts it in approx top 5% of new ETF launches, and about 4x what the 2x Solana ETF $SOLT did (altho both 200x less than King IBIT).” Source: Eric Balchunas/X That being said, Teucrium’s XXRP ETF outperformed similar ETFs like Solana’s [SOL] ETF product by a significant margin, with trading volume about four times higher. This puts the ETF launch in the top 5% of all new ETFs. However, despite the strong debut, the figure still falls short of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF launch, which saw trading volume approximately 200 times larger. While the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, recent developments in global economics, such as the pause in President Trump’s tariff plans, have provided a boost. At the time of writing, the global crypto market cap surged to $2.59 trillion, reflecting a 5.67% increase in just 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin rose to $81,752, a 5.98% hike, while XRP saw a remarkable 9.53% increase, trading at $1.99. However, despite the positive price movement, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) remained below the neutral level, indicating that bearish sentiment still dominates. On the brighter side, the widening Bollinger Bands suggested that increased volatility could be on the horizon, offering a potential reversal of the bearish trend. Source: Trading View While the initial success of XXRP was notable, many XRP supporters are optimistic that a future spot XRP ETF—tentatively dubbed “IXRP”—could generate even greater competition in the market. Data from Polymarket suggests a 77% chance that Ripple’s spot ETF could be approved by 2025, fueling further speculation on the growth potential of XRP in the ETF space. This momentum comes at a time when over ten major asset managers, including Grayscale and Franklin Templeton, have filed applications with the SEC for a spot XRP ETF. Notably, BlackRock has yet to show interest in launching an XRP-specific product, leaving the door wide open for other firms to lead the way in this growing market.

Title: Panama on edge as US targets China's canal influence

Panama and the US appear to have agreed to let American warships use the Panama Canal, effectively for free. But beneath the agreement is an ongoing threat to Panamanian sovereignty over the use of the canal. US warships could soon enjoy free and priority use of the Panama Canal, but there's still a long way to go before tensions in one of the world's most important trade passages are resolved. Panama's strategic value — to the US and many other shipping nations — is thanks to its 51-mile (82-kilometer) canal, which allows ships to easily pass between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans without needing to unload cargo or sail around South America. The canal has been thrust into the limelight since the return of Donald Trump as US president in January. Trump is opposed to China's growing influence in the region, and has repeatedly spoken about "reclaiming" the canal — which the US ceded to Panama in 1999. He hasn't ruled out a military invasion to achieve his goal. Amid tensions over Trump's rhetoric, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino this week to shore up relations. A joint statement released by the pair on Wednesday struck a friendly tone, but sticking points remain. Mulino has already worked to appease the Trump administration on the subject of China. After a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in February Panama confirmed it would exit China's Belt and Road initiative, which is building major infrastructure projects including ports and airports around the world. Separately, Mulino's administration has pressured Chinese conglomerates that own Panamanian ports to exit the country. On Wednesday, the first point in the Hegseth-Mulino statement directly addressed another key Trump talking point: tolls. Trump has consistently labelled the canal usage fees paid by the US as a "bad deal" — even though, under the canal neutrality treaty, all nations are charged the same rates. While Panama has said it's impossible to give the US free passage under those terms, it appears US warships may get a cost-neutral compensation scheme instead, along with priority access. "First and free," as Hegseth described it after talks with Mulino. And while Panama's military is the only force allowed to use the canal, the two countries have agreed to undertake joint military exercises. However, Panama has said it won't accept the reestablishment of US military bases in the country. But there remained one stark point of contention. The Spanish-language version of the joint statement, released by Panama, said "Hegseth recognized Panama's leadership and inalienable sovereignty over the Panama Canal and its adjacent areas." That line didn't appear in the English version released by the Pentagon. Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist professor at the University of Essex in the UK, said the omission was almost certainly a ploy to keep Panama guessing about the intentions of the Trump administration. "I think it was on purpose not to put it in the English version, to make Panama feel uncertain and not feel like the situation has been resolved," she told DW. The US built the Panama Canal between 1904 and 1914, creating a massive waterway between the country's Pacific and Caribbean shorelines. It enabled American ships — including naval vessels — to easily pass between the two oceans. Negotiations to cede control back to Panama began under the Kennedy administration in the early 1960s, and were continued by Democrat and Republican presidents until Jimmy Carter formalized treaties with Panamanian nationalist leader Omar Torrijos in 1977. Those treaty deals saw Panama take control of the canal on New Year's Eve 1999, under the conditions that it be operated neutrally. Contrary to claims by Trump, the canal wasn't gifted to the Panamanians, nor is it controlled by China. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video But China does wield influence in the canal — it's the second-biggest user behind the US, and Chinese firms operate ports at each end. That concerns the US, and especially the hawkish Trump administration. The president has been clear in his intent to neutralize China's growing influence around the world, as evidenced by his new trans-Pacific trade war. Though Hegseth said US security would be achieved by a partnership with Panama, Trump has repeatedly failed to rule out military intervention to reclaim the canal. That would represent a dramatic about-face on US foreign policy. In 1975, then US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told Republican President Ford that failure to negotiate a handover of the canal would lead to "real uproar; volunteers, demonstrations, violence, and we would be dragged into every international forum. This is no issue to face the world on. It looks like pure colonialism." In Panama, that sentiment remains today, with regular protests since Trump first spoke of retaking the waterway. This week, around 200 people protested Hegseth's visit in Panama City and one demonstrator burned a US flag. Lindstaedt, herself Panamanian, said Trump's return had left Panama and the wider region concerned. "This has basically dominated the headlines in Panama, with just complete bewilderment and fear as to why they are doing this and when will it end," she said. "The US is not very popular in Panama at the moment, at all." However, Jorge Heine, a former Chilean ambassador to China and international relations expert at Boston University, believes it's unlikely a Trump-led US would go ahead with a military intervention. "President Trump combines a rhetoric that at times can sound extremely aggressive," he told DW. "But at the same time, he has conveyed that he really isn't very interested in being a war monger, and in otherwise deploying US military force as aggressively as some of his predecessors." To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video China, the top trading partner for Central and South America, has rebuffed Hegseth's claims of it being a "malign" influence in Panama. Beijing has also struck back with an antitrust review into a proposed acquisition of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings' assets in the canal by American investment firm BlackRock. That will further complicate BlackRock's efforts to acquire $22.8 billion (€20.6 billion) of Hutchison's global port assets — including two sites in Panama. The deal was announced in March, welcomed by Trump and criticized by Beijing. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the deal could take nine months to be certified. Hutchison is also caught up by a Panama government investigation into a 25-year agreement it signed in 2021 to allow the conglomerate to operate two ports in the canal. Lawsuits are being considered against government officials involved in authorizing the deal. But attempts to squeeze Chinese influence in the region may not be in the best interests of either side. "The United States' effort to diminish the Chinese presence in Latin America, you could argue, is a legitimate approach," said Heine. But, he added, if the US really wanted to "win over the hearts and minds" of governments and people in Latin America, it should not "block China from doing business" in the region. "That goes down very badly, because it is seen as something that essentially blocks Latin American growth," he said. "The best way to proceed is for the United States to compete with China: to say 'We can build better ports, we can do more trade, we can build better factories, we can do better business with you'."

Title: Jobandtalent raises $103M on a down-round $1.5B valuation as it looks to AI to recruit temps

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Jobandtalent, an AI-based “workforce as a service” marketplace that connects people with companies looking for hourly workers, announced it has raised €92 million ($103 million). The Series F — which includes participation from Atomico, BlackRock, DN Capital, Hercules, Infravia, Kibo, and Kinnevik — values the Madrid, Spain-based company at €1.3 billion ($1.5 billion) post-money. On the surface, a unicorn raising a decent round of funding from a well-known list of backers might sound like pretty strong news. The reality is a little different. This is a down round for the company. Jobandtalent, which has operations in 10 countries in Europe, the U.S., and Latin America, last raised money in December 2021, a Series E of $500 million that valued it at $2.35 billion. We’ve asked for a comment from the company on why its valuation received a haircut of almost $1 billion. “This round reflects a valuation adjustment in line with broader market dynamics, particularly within the tech and growth-stage sectors,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. “The funding ensures that Job&Talent remains well-capitalized to execute the next phase of our growth journey. Despite challenging market conditions, we have consistently outperformed industry trends over the past year, driven by the strength of our platform and our ability to integrate AI across our entire suite of products.” Some of the reasoning may also be a reflection of the European startup scene at the moment. On the plus side: Jobandtalent was the beneficiary of strong tailwinds over the years. It came into its own in the years around COVID-19, when both businesses and workers were unsure of what was coming around the corner and gravitated to working arrangements that afforded more flexibility. Certain sectors, like e-commerce and the wider ecosystem of delivery and logistics around it, were positively booming and needed to fill lots of roles, fast. It was an especially flush time for particular kinds of roles, and Jobandtalent found a willing audience of businesses and workers taking to its platform to connect to each other. The company says over the years it has placed more than 300,000 workers in roles at more than 3,250 companies, with a particular emphasis on sectors like logistics and retail. Yet the company’s funding news today is coming at an unsettling time: The European labor market since the COVID-19 pandemic has been buffeted by a number of opposing economic waves. Skills and people shortages have spelled opportunity for those who can fill the gaps; yet declining corporate profits and a stagnating Eurozone economy could spell tougher times ahead. And that’s before you consider what kind of impact AI might have. It’s still unproven, but businesses and governments are staking a lot on AI being a cost-effective solution for some kinds of work, and that too could spell bad news for certain jobs. Jobandtalent is sitting in a strange position in that regard. The company’s bread and butter remains the human workforce, but it’s also leaning into ways it can use AI to be more “work efficient.” The company says that the new injection of equity will be used to scale the business internationally and to invest in building a series of AI-powered agents into the platform to support that. The first of these is called Clara, an agent focused on recruitment. In a test with a limited number of clients, Clara has conducted no less than 180,000 interviews, the company said, contributing to some 7,000 hires and “helping deliver industry-leading fill rates, even during peak periods of demand.” Jobandtalent says that the fill rates are “equivalent to the output of thousands of recruiters.” Jobandtalent said it plans to launch further agents this year to cover other functions previously handled by humans. “This capital injection reaffirms our shared vision for the future of Job&Talent,” Juan Urdiales, the startup’s co-founder and co-CEO, said in a statement. “Thanks to the platform we have built over the past years, we are now well-positioned to evolve into a fully integrated employment platform that helps companies manage their temporary and internal workforces more efficiently. Our next-generation AI agents will bring major improvements in productivity, provide better opportunities for workers, and unlock crucial cost savings for companies.” Topics Europe Editor Ingrid is a writer and editor for TechCrunch, joining February 2012, based out of London.

It’s the most massive scientific fraud in human history, and it will take significant time to completely die, but make no mistake: It IS dying. In no particular order, here are some updates on the climate scam implosion. Please keep scrolling. We have come a *long* way since Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich sat down to endorse Al Gore’s climate scam in 2008! After discovering so many massive, high-profile COVID lies in recent years, large numbers of people are asking themselves “What else are they lying about?”, and the answer is “just about everything”. Elites tried for the Great Reset but they got a Great Awakening. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Will the next president be a laftist? If they’re anything like the last, they’ll be a Laughtist Dr David King was a sort of colleague of mine at JCU Townsville.I seem to recall telling him that climate alarmism, or whatever it was called then, was bunk way back, 1970s. Maybe not the next but the next after that? Sooner or later there will be a Democrat President. The question is whether climate alarmism will still be on the agenda by that time. Whatever the agenda, they’ll be behind it 100%, one of the few things that we can count on. Biden tried to go all-in against oil and gas exploration and drilling permits, but then saw the political ramifications of soaring gas pump prices in 2022 on Democrats’ mid-terms hope to avoid a bloodbath. That forced him to scale back. It also drove him to open the taps on the SPR and drain in down to less than half its capacity by the time he left office. So the politics of soaring prices for voters and the ever present “next election” will be the drag/friction that stops any President in having a war on affordable energy. I’m hoping that President Trump’s about-face on tariffs will bring gas prices down. They’ve gone up $0.30 in the last week. These things require a little patience, watching for the fever to break: Gasoline (wholesale) closed today at $1.95 / gallon. Crude petroleum (WTI) has averaged ~ $60 / bbl (equivalent to ~ $1.43 / gallon) over the entire week — lowest since February of 2021. A couple weeks back, USA Energy Sec’y Wright reportedly said that $50 per bbl is a level where major producers could remain profitable, and they agreed, contrary to so much earlier handwringing. If past price / market-share wars are any guide, one shouldn’t be surprised to see $42 / bbl (equiv to $1./gallon, for wholesale gasoline approaching $1.50 a gallon). ? If that doesn’t sound deflationary, like going back to 2019 times, what would? Yes, but the difference now, I think, is that the general public have had more exposure to the Sceptical view. As such, there are more people now, better informed and less likely to support the alarmist narrative that had an unchallenged free platform for decades up to now. I have always said that the whole scam thrives on public opinion supporting the scam. As long as it is ”popular” politicians can depend on the vote to keep them in the dollars. Speak for yourselves And a following Conservative Administration can correct it yet again in the same proverbial “Blink” They can try, but given the science of climate absolutely shows humans have very little long-term impact on climate hazards or global temperatures, except within cities where urban warming is skewing observational data. The main thing is that confected alarm over modern warming is illogical, as historic warming is beneficial to society, and the warmer cities have already experienced well above the imputed 2-5C crisis limits without any harmful effects. So, the climate bluff has been called, the alarmists have been found wanting, they can’t any longer use the CO2 card as this is the `gas of life’ not some unwanted pollutant, we and the planet need much more CO2 to fertilize plants more efficiently and grow better crops, more forests etc. Now the public has been exposed to the truth, they will not so easily fall for the next global environmental scam, so politicians will not be able to bring this climate crisis back to life in any meaningful way. History shows that there will be a new scare (scam). Correct. Unless the root of the infection is destroyed by exposing the lack of definitive cause and effect evidence it has every chance of coming back. A leftist President can bring it all back in a blink of an eye. So 2 blinks of 1 eye, or 1 blink of 2 eyes? Yes, it is collapsing because it is a lie, but can politicians be convinced of that? When the public sees the benefits the policy changes – the politicians won’t try it again. Let’s not elect a leftist president ever again. I don’t think we did. I still want to know who ran the executive pranch from 2021 to 2024. I’d put even money on the Climate Oligarchs defended by well paid SJWs And a following Conservative Administration can correct it yet again in the same proverbial “Blink” Executive Order diktats are NOT the way to run a country….only encourage policy reversals every election cycle….best to pass legislation that is solid to start with rather than advocate policies that nearly half the public opposes… Mr. Vonasek: By ’28, I predict CliSci will be so over, the smart players will have moved on to the next scam, the money will shift and dems will follow that scam. Of course, “smart players” excludes Al Gore, John Kerry, Michael Mann, etc., who will still push AGW, but they won’t get much attention. Or money. Mann won’t be able to file a legitimate lawsuit. Just my prediction. “What else are they lying about”? A significantly shorter list would be… What aren’t they lying about? Just about the only thing I can think of is spherical (oblate spheroid, etc) Earth… at least I hope they’re not lying about that! This post could be the basis of An Ode To Climate Alarmists – How do I loathe thee Let me count the ways It’s all about the money, so if funding goes away, so will everyone supporting the scam. I think we are seeing the beginning of it with DOGE scrubbing all the US federal agencies of one fraud after another. I wonder if Starmer and Miliband have seen this list? Do they realize just how alone they are? I strongly Starmer is aware… Milliband, not so much Suddenly, the floor is lava. The Gavin Schmitt link doesn’t seem to work. That’s the point. It was a link to his X account. Very risky leaving your climate science out there these days 🙂 That’s because it’s Schmidt. By an odd coincidence, I was looking up the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction today (I was, seriously), but there I go again, being an organic chemistry nerd in a post that only about three people will get: Steve Case, yourself and possibly CTM ?? ???? You must be referring to this: LINK. Organic chemistry wasn’t fun. Quiz questions requiring of the student: Starting out with Benzene and inorganic reagents synthesize the DNA of a left handed Siberian Skink, isn’t far off the mark. I’m in that category too. Once an Organic Chemist, always an Organic Chemist. Thank you for keeping at it all these years ! KEEP UP THE EXCELLENT WORK. Seconded and MOTION PASSED. Thanks, Nicholas! Hurrah. I only hope the power brokers take their heads out of the sand. Here in the UK we are unfortunately still the leading lemming heading for the cliff of self impoverishment. It’s sad to see a great nation commit suicide. Unfortunately, Australia may end up going the same way if Albo is elected again, because he will cowardly bend to all the moronically idiotic and destructive “Greens” agendas to form a government. I’ve never been to Australia- but my impression was that it’s a nation of common sense people. Same for the UK. It amazes me that there is so little resistance to the climate cult. Indeed and, sadly, it looks like Albo/labour will get back in. Quite the contrasting energy future compared to US with Trumps win. We’ll be faced with netzero, even higher electricity prices, and a bigger public service. A recession, businesses closing or fleeing, and unemployment on the rise. Maybe I’m just dreaming… It is beginning to look like a lemming charge of one. I’ll see your UK and raise you an Australia We still have a slight chance. Not a great one, but better than the UK, I hope. Unfortunately, the climate cult is still powerful here in Wokeachusetts. It’ll probably be the last place to die. State officials and the enviros still keep talking about the climate emergency. Washington State, Oregon, and Cullyfawnia will last much longer. Carney of Canada, will be the absolute last holdout. He is intent on killing Canada. If Labor is elected in the forthcoming Australian federal election, and has to rely on the Greens to form a government…. Australia won’t be far behind. He is intent on realizing the WEF agenda on Canadians. Carney is smarter version of Pretty Boy Trudeau, that makes him far more dangerous. If he defeats Poilievre, Canada is royally f’d. Carney’s wife and kids already live in New York City in anticipation of becoming the 51st state. I remember there was talk of “some sort of Climate Nuremberg”, and I think that’s an excellent idea. Might not be what they had in mind though. Let’s not conflate climate change and especially net-zero with Covid shall we, it makes legitimate sceptics like me look like the sort of science deniers the AGW activists like to portray us as. Like it or not, in the first year of Covid it killed ~500,000 in the US, 100,000+ in the UK, ~1,000,000 in Europe and probably ~6,000,000 across the world. Covid was a real thing, action was unavoidable, AGW, you be the judge. Here in the UK , I think Covid was very real , one of my work colleagues who is 50 got it , he is a non smoker , modest drinker , lean and cycles to work , he caught it in the first wave of his wife who was a nurse , it knocked him for 6 he spent 12 days in hospital, he had never been admitted to hospital before in his life . His wife who is the same age faired even worse , she is asthmatic and ended up in hospital for 4 months at one stage she was on a ventilator, they had both been through the usual coughs colds flu etc and nothing like this before . I think it was real too. However, much of what we were told about covid was lies, up one side and down the other. It most likely was manufactured in a lab, not naturally transmitted out of a wet market. Masks didn’t prevent the spread, nor did shutting schools, churches and businesses. The vaccines did not prevent one from getting covid or passing it on to others. They did not prevent people from dying of covid. And the vaccines appear to have some serious side effects. I could go on and on. I hope we never have to live through such a catastrophe again. Hospitals across the country were running out of spare beds. Exactly Starzmom. The main offensive aspect of the COVID pandemic wasn’t that COVID was a real and potentially fatal threat for many people. It was / is. Rather, it was the opportunistic gaslighting that political operatives and their main-chancer groupies resorted to. To wit – rejecting outright mRNA creator and original patent holder Dr Malone’s instruction that mRNA was NOT an appropriate vehicle for immunisations injections. But pharmas had already set their sights and invested heavily in using (abusing?) the mRNA technology. Then the accepted term “vaccine” and what worldwide populations had come to expect what that meant and delivered – i.e. immunity from acquisition and transmission of a virus or disease – was disingenuously highjacked to describe a therapeutic, mRNA jabs that did not prevent acquisition nor transmission. And this blatant defect was admitted by Pfizer in their submissions to the FDA. Which the Biden administration tried to lock away from public disclosure for 70 years. And don’t get me started on the masks bullshit – the long-established and cited Cochrane organisation’s masks testing & reporting belled the cat about masks for COVID containment from the outset – masks were totally ineffective. And yet we were all told we HAD to don these fancy-dress ball accessories at all times in public. Nobody is denying Covid wasnt a thing. Action was indeed unavoidable. But most of the choices and actions were the wrong ones and did more damage than good. You be the judge.. Can anyone name anything that was done to mitigate covid that was effective? The countries that used invermectin and HCQ for a few cents per dose…especially prior to infection. In the US, the average age of a person who died from Covid was older than the expected lifespan. Doctors and researchers made a profile of the most vulnerable. Elderly, obese, diabetic, etc., etc. Johns Hopkins published a web page with a Covid risk calculator. The page is here: https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2020/new-online-covid-19-mortality-risk-calculator-could-help-determine-who-should-get-vaccines-first It appears the calculator hasn’t been updated since it was published. Now that the pandemic is over studies show the 6 ft/1 meter distancing rules were just made up, masks are ineffective in stopping the spread, the shots don’t work and the public health cabal lied about all the above. Johns Hopkins looked like one of the heros to me as far as info distribution went. Action was unavoidable, but the actions taken were most obviously almost pointless. Yes, prevent spreading until vaccines are available, but: 1. Test vaccines first 2. Don’t imprison your citizens 3. Don’t stop economic activity And LOCK DOWN NURSING HOMES, NOT EVERYONE ELSE! Honestly, the approaches were beyond stupid, and today we’re paying a hefty price, and will for a decade or so. Even I predicted both mass unemployment and rampant inflation! And yes, I got covid at least once, and long covid for a year or so. Vaccines were tested extensively first, and finally approved by actual professors of medicine, and not some random guy on Twitter. As to the rest, I can only speak for the UK, but in the first wave the NHS was about a week from collapse, during the peak of the second wave there were 40,000 people in hospital with the virus, i.e. ~50% of all hospital beds, some form of lockdown was unavoidable. Also, locking down nursing homes was exactly what they did during the second wave, those 40,000 patients were largely coming from the wider community, with the tier system, rejecting a firebreak lockdown (in England anyway), testing, social distancing etc, the government was clearly doing everything in its power to limit restrictions, but at the end of the day the virus was extremely contagious and very difficult to contain. If we made a mistake, it was not shielding the vulnerable from early March, if we’d done that maybe we could’ve avoided at least some of the March 23 measures, but unfortunately SAGE dropped the ball on that one. Safe and effective 😉 We’d probably still be in lockdown without the vaccine, would you be happier with that? Ask Eric Clapton about his opinion/experience of the WuFlu vaccines. Clapton was already a Covid denier before the vaccines came along, and AFAICS is still alive and well, so let’s treat any claims he makes about “reactions” with a healthy dose of professional scepticism. Also, while you’re at it, why don’t you ask the large numbers of 75 year-old’s who died from Covid pre-vaccine what their opinions/experience are of no longer being alive? How do you know the vaccines would have prevented them from dying? In the US, the drugs were rushed to people under an emergency use authorization, which are dependent on there being no other treatments available — this was a 100% lie put out by the CDC, NIH, and Marx Stream Media. Because professors of medicine tell me so, and I prefer their opinion to that of some random bloke on the internet. I was a 90 year old who got the shots and still got COVID and am still alive. A friend of similar age refused the shots and did not get it and is still alive. What can you conclude from this? That the shots possibly saved your life, and your friend got lucky. Much like the learned professors of climate science? IFR of Covid-19 was significantly lower than the ordinary flu. BTW that’s even after paying hospitals and doctors for diagnosing Covid-19 even when co-morbidities were much more severe. The supposed pathogen has never been found in a patient, it only exist as a model in computers, in silico. What a minute that reminds me of something….oh yeah the climatecult’s sole proof: their models, which are all wrong. The supposed pathogen has never gone trough Koch’s postulates and there is still a million euro’s waiting for the first researcher to publish the genetich code of this remarkable virus. There is not even a test to determine wether or not this “virus” is present in a patient. The orginal author of the “PCR-test” has now admitted as much. BTW this originbal paper was peer-reviewed in couple of hours….. So yes they have been hiding a lot, lying trough their teeth and are never to be trusted again. That’s just plain common sense, nothing else. Nice list. Thx. Google/Youtube & Meta/Facebook still have yet to get the message: they still demonetize or censor climate skeptics and sites like WUWT. As many have mentioned elsewhere, unless inacted as legislation the next president’s Executive Orders could reverse much of the current beneficial changes. I would rather enacted than inacted. ….. and Wikipedia. I wonder how that’s going to read when our host gets the Congressional Medal of Freedom? Also, PS – yes #10 is worth reading some more. One of the Founders of that sh!tshow was the Chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party: Aspiration was founded in 2013 by Andrei Cherny and Joseph Sanberg It opened for business in February 2015. …. and here’s another, similar cluster**** https://finsworld.com/ecology/co-founder-of-climate-finance-unicorn-arrested-on-fraud-charges Notice any patterns here? Climate, fraud, climate, fraud, climate, fraud and so on and so forth. “NASA GISS funding “terminated”?: “New NASA Chief Will Wind Down Climate Alarm Shop“.” Before completely closing down, they should make GISS write up an after-action report to document the results of their decades of “climate” work. Here is a template to save them some time: It can now be confirmed that it was a serious error all along to have supposed that incremental “greenhouse gases” such as CO2, CH4, N2O were capable of forcing energy absorbed from the sun to accumulate on land, in the oceans, and in the atmosphere itself as sensible heat gain. Upon further review, it is clear that while the static radiative effect could indeed be real, the resulting influence on any trend of any climate metric is negligible. There is no risk of a harmful outcome, nor is there any “tipping point” to be concerned about in the climate system. We regret constructing our step-iterated, large-grid, discrete-layer, parameter-tuned climate models. It turns out that the inherent uncertainties involved in cloud formation and dissipation are such that there was never any hope of reliably projecting future climate states from scenarios of assumed emissions of CO2, etc. These uncertainties were suppressed by first tuning the models for stability, which is known not to be realistic. Then by framing the investigation of incremental CO2 as a matter of “forcing” + “feedback,” the expected “warming” response was baked in from the start. We were well-intentioned but completely in the wrong scientifically to have ever used such utterly circular logic. We acknowledge, with deep disappointment in our own work, to have constructed a record of global temperatures from the limited observations in the 1800’s and early 1900’s. It should have been obvious to us that any claim to a precise preindustrial climate state was pure fiction. We regret the error. An internal review confirms that the assertions of CO2 as the climate “control knob” were for public persuasion purposes only. No scientist here ever actually believed that. There. Maybe I saved them some effort. Ha! Riiiiiight. Wouldn’t it be a perfect ending, though? 🙂 Semi-serious suggestion, with Apologies to Bridge on the River Kwai: Don’t you know what will happen to me if I fail to convince the world that it is going to fry in hell if it doesn’t provide me with a sinecure that makes me rich? Haven’t the foggiest. Haven’t the foggiest. I shall have to kill myself… What would you do? I shall have to kill myself… What would you do? I suppose I should have to kill myself. Cheers! I suppose I should have to kill myself. Cheers! Good summary. I’m not so sure about this: “We were well-intentioned” I think their climate change agenda is their motivation. “Hottest year Evah!, by hundreds of a degree, year after year after year. Pure computer mannipulation. UAH shows nothing like it. UAH shows cooling while NASA shows warming. This was not well-intentioned. The NASA Temperature Data Mannipulation was meant to scare the Public into submission. A fair point! While all of this is true now is not the time to ease up, there are a lot of bad things that we must undo. Unfortunately, down here in Australia, the anti-CO2 farce seems to be hanging on. We have an upcoming Federal election and I was looking at statements from different parties. Even the National Party (think country pseudo-conservatives) are anti fossil fuel, with these delusional statements.. The NSW Nationals support the uptake of cost-effective renewable energy options, including solar and wind-powered microgrids with battery backup……. The NSW Nationals believe utilising technological advances to address these network issues is key to minimise disruptions, while at the same time reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The NSW Nationals believe utilising technological advances to address these network issues is key to minimise disruptions, while at the same time reducing reliance on fossil fuels. The NSW Nationals believe Petroleum Exploration Licenses should be extinguished as soon as they expire. The NSW Nationals believe Petroleum Exploration Licenses should be extinguished as soon as they expire. It is hard to find someone to vote for that supports realistic energy supplies like COAL and GAS and OIL. Vote for One Nation or Libertarians or few other so called freedom parties. Realistically, they have only chance to spoil the two main parties majority though. If the Libertarians and One Nation can get the balance of power in the Senate… … hopefully would that help nullify the worst of the Greens/Labor nation destroying idiocies. Unfortunately, down here in Australia, the anti-CO2 farce seems to be hanging on. Both parties are extremely scientifically illiterate and are frightened down to the bone of the CSIRO and others. However, the truth is coming and no one will stop it. Just a matter of time…. I did hear that Bowen may very well lose his seat so at least that’s something. “However, the truth is coming and no one will stop it. Just a matter of time….” You are correct. The only unknown is how long it will take. Will Australia have to go bankrupt before their politicians understand that windmills and solar and batteries are not going to be the solution to their imaginary CO2 problem? Windmills and solar and batteries will reduce CO2 output, but will end up destroying Australia and its economy. Is that really what Australian politicians want? Michael Mann and Phil Jones must be very proud of themselves. They have managed to fool the Elites of the Left (and some fools on the Right) into thinking CO2 is a danger to humanity. Climate Change Science Fraud has caused a dangerous reaction in gullible/greedy people, leading to the eventual downfall of whole nations. Brainwashing works. Smart people are not immune. Haven’t they also made it illegal to pray over someone if the intent of the prayer is to keep them from being trans? But the MSM still won’t report the fact that CO2 is not dangerous, and until they do the Bandar-log will keep on spending our money on useless “carbon reducing” schemes. “The right people” have to be holding the bill before they change the story. Watch pension funds. Yes, the lying Leftwing Media is the most dangerous organization in the Western world. People cannot govern themselves properly if they don’t have the truth, and all they get are leftwing lies from the Media. The lying Leftwing Media is the reason 72 million people! voted for an idiot like Kamala Harris for President of the United States. Imagine what things would look like if she got elected. Yes, the Lying Leftwing Media is more dangerous to your personal freedoms than even communist China. The intentional deceivers among them are traitors to their nations. Good list. JD Vance will finish what 47 doesn’t. At the moment AOC leads the Democrat listings…. Pray that NEVER happens. ! I’m not sure about that mate. A lot of people here are praying that it does happen, although there’s a new contender for the most stupid person in Congress: Jasmine Crockett. That’s always a good career path. Look at Adam Schiff. Vance/Gabbard, or maybe even Gabbard/Vance ? Vance/Rubio. In fact, a lot of Trump’s cabinet members could make a good president. The radical Democrats have no bench to pick from, and no ideas. Any good idea they come up with, is already in the Republican playbook. NASA/GISS should either be completely shut-down (preferred), or if not possible without Congressional action, have its mission refocused back on SpaceWeather phenomenon. I would add a #34. ICF has had its contract terminated with NASA. ICF was the private company that coordinated the interagency US National Climate Assessment since 2021. It was huge grift on the taxpayer initiated by Biden Regime. Paying out wasteful advisory fees to Climate morons like Hayhoe, Mann, and Dessler to keep them on the bandwagon of climate grift. Let’s hope that NCA beast remains dead and forgotten. Joel! You’re back! Where have you been, buddy? Sweet, sweet music to my ears. All governments continuously lie to you about all things great and small. Leftist Deep State entities have taken control of government policies. It does no good to change Federal Executive Branch leaders and politicians; the wreckers just burrow in deeper and wait them out. Find ways to get rid of them or hobble them by clear instructions about their powers and authorities. We need to do away with whole agencies and restrict other agencies’ ability to set national policies and establish regulations that are not supported by clear Congressional directives. I doubt whether any significant percentage of the general public anywhere was taken in by the climate change alarmism in the first place. When they noticed that it was accompanied by higher taxes and costly green mandates at the same time that they were noticing the usual fluctuation of temperatures and weather events, they began to smell a rat. As a result, when they refused to make any major lifestyle changes that would supposedly combat what wasn’t occurring anyway and began to support policies and actions that supported their tendencies, they were driving home the first nails in the coffin of climate alarmism and Net Zero intentions. The article above is merely summarizing the actions that the big players like governments and major industries and businesses are taking to end the climate change charade.

Title: Prada to buy Versace for 1.25 bn euros to create new force in Italian fashion
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/3000579/prada-to-buy-versace-for-1-25-bn-euros-to-create-new-force-in-italian-fashion
Time Published: 2025-04-10T16:45:00Z
Full Content:
MILAN (ITALY) - Prada said Thursday that it had reached a deal to buy Versace for 1.25 billion euros ($1.38 billion), building a new Italian fashion powerhouse and hoping to insert much-needed "spark" into its smaller, flashier rival. The much anticipated acquisition, from US group Capri Holdings, will create a group with revenues of over six billion euros that could better compete with giants such as the French conglomerates LVMH and Gucci owner Kering. "We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group and to build a new chapter for a brand with which we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftmanship and heritage," Prada Group chairman Patrizio Bertelli said. In 2018, Capri paid 1.83 billion euros (then $2.1 billion) to acquire Versace, which was previously owned 80 percent by the Versace family and 20 percent by the US investment fund BlackRock. But amid declining sales it sought a buyer, opening exclusive negotiations with Prada at the end of February. Capri, which also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, had to accept a reduced price from Prada amid the market turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Financial Times had reported that the price was initially expected to be about $1.6 billion but had been negotiated downwards in recent days. - Donatella's departure - Last month, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative director after more than 30 years, a move widely seen as a prelude to the accord. She took over in 1997 following the murder of her older brother Gianni, who founded the label in 1978. But on April 1 she was replaced as creative director by Dario Vitale, who has overseen soaring sales at Miu Miu, Prada's sister brand targeting a younger clientele. Donatella will now serve as Versace's chief brand ambassador. While still a label associated with the jet set, some of Versace's lustre has faded in recent years. Capri had expected turnover to fall to $810 million during its 2025 fiscal year, according to Prada, down from $1.03 billion a year earlier. By contrast, Prada, under the creative helm of Miuccia Prada, the 76-year-old granddaughter of group founder Mario, is in robust health. Despite a global slowdown in luxury good sales in recent years, Prada's net profit jumped 25 percent to 839 million euros in 2024, on revenues that grew 15 percent to 5.4 billion euros. Andrea Guerra, Prada's group chief executive, said Thursday that Versace had "huge potential" but warned there was work to do. "The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience," he said. The deal, funded through 1.5 billion euros of new debt, is expected to close in the second half of 2025. For its part, Capri said the sale would allow it to step up investments in Michael Kors and strengthen its balance sheet. - No revolution - The two fashion labels have starkly different styles, with Versace's exuberance contrasting with Prada's sophisticated minimalism. Prada said its new acquisition "constitutes a strongly complementary addition" to its portfolio and promised to "maintain its creative DNA and cultural authenticity". "I don't think we need to change the brand, to revolutionise it," Prada's marketing director, Lorenzo Bertelli, told analysts during a conference call. "We need to just evolve it... all together, they're going to make, hopefully, a huge spark and bring back Versace to be a huge success." Bertelli, the eldest son of Miuccia Prada and Patrizio Bertelli and who is expected one day to take over, said his mother would not have creative involvement in Versace. - Core business - The deal bucks the trend of recent years, which has seen major names in Italian fashion such as Gucci, Fendi, and Bottega Veneta fall under the control of their French competitors. However, a previous attempt to expand the Prada portfolio -- which also includes luxury footwear brands Car Shoe and Church's -- offers a cautionary tale. In 1999, the family group acquired the German brand Jil Sander and the Austrian label Helmut Lang before selling them in 2006 as they were weighing down its financial results. In 2000, Prada jointly acquired a 51 percent stake in the Roman label Fendi with LVMH, but sold its 25.5 percent stake to the French luxury giant a year later. With the Versace acquisition, "I see a risk for Prada to become distracted from its core business," Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, told AFP.

Title: Ireland make three changes for Six Nations game against England
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/04/10/ireland-make-three-changes-for-six-nations-game-against-england/
Time Published: 2025-04-10T16:37:57Z
Full Content:
Ireland head coach Scott Bemand has made three changes to the starting team that hammered Italy 54-12 in Parma for Saturday’s Six Nations championship match against an all-conquering England at Musgrave Park (4.45). The visitors are looking for a 32nd consecutive victory in the tournament, a run that started with victory over Ireland in 2018. Emily Lane is promoted from the bench to scrumhalf in place of Aoibheann Reilly who heads in the opposite direction in the only change to the starting backline. Injury has ruled out flanker Edel McMahon and her place in the backrow goes to Brittany Hogan. The Ulster player started on the bench in Italy, but Bemand opted for a conventional five-three split rather than the six-two orientation of the last day. This means that outhalf Nicole Fowley is named in the matchday 23. Dorothy Wall swaps places with Ruth Campbell and will partner Old Belvedere’s Fiona Tuite in the secondrow. Enya Breen picked up an injury the last day and so Wicklow’s Vicky Elmes Kinlan is set to make her Six Nations debut and will wear the number 23 jersey. England head coach John Mitchell has made three changes to the team that hammered Wales last time out.

Title: Recessions & Equities - What The Supposed Experts Aren’t Telling You

ByJohn Buckingham ByJohn Buckingham, Contributor. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 09: CEO of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon (L) speaks with Maria Bartiromo ... More (R) on "Mornings With Maria" at Fox Business Network Studios on April 09, 2025 in New York City. (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images) “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now,” Blackrock CEO Larry Fink explained at an event for the Economic Club of New York on April 7. “I think probably [a recession is] The JPMorgan Chase CEO added, “Markets aren’t always right, but sometimes they are right. I think this time they are right because they’re just pricing uncertainty [at] the macro level and uncertainty [at] the micro level, at the actual company level, and then how it affects consumer sentiment. It’s hard to tell.” Goldman Sachs on April 6 raised its probability of a U.S. economic contraction in the next 12 months to 45%, up from 35%, as its economists cited policy uncertainty, foreign consumer boycotts and tighter financial conditions. Goldman’s odds surged to 65% on the morning of April 9, but the investment bank quickly revised that estimate back down to 45% after President Trump shocked the markets with a post on Truth Social: Based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Needless to say, economic forecasting is fraught with peril! Given that the tariff battle is far from over and President Trump also amped the levies on China on April 9, the odds of recession remain elevated. As a result, I continue to expect a steady stream of headlines warning that a slowdown in economic activity will drag down corporate profits and, in turn, stock prices. That seems logical in theory, but we think it important to investigate what has happened in practice. There have “only” been 15 economic recessions in the United States since 1927, which is how far back freely available equity return data exists. While the 16th may be imminent, the start and end dates are never known in advance. And contrary to current media proclamations, stocks have suffered only modest pullbacks, on average, during contractions and decent gains, again on average, in the year leading up to them. Equity Returns Before & During Recessions More importantly, investors in Value, Dividend, Large and Small Stocks have enjoyed fantastic average returns following the end of an economic contraction. Alas, they don’t ring a bell to mark the conclusion. As a result, those who somehow managed to avoid historically modest average losses during a recession likely sat on the sidelines waiting for an all-clear signal and missing a large part of the massive rallies. Equity Returns After Economic Recessions Irrespective of the giant near-3000-point rebound in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on April 9, I continue to think trying to outguess the economy is hardly a recipe for success. Yes, it would be nice to be find a reliable indicator that tells an investor when to get in and out of stocks, but I learned long ago that the only problem with market timing is getting the timing right. Russell Investments has done its own study of recessions and stocks going back further in time than mine. They have found: “The 15 recessions with negative returns lasted 17 months on average, with an annualized cumulative return of -14.8% and average GDP decline of -4.6%. The Great Depression from August 1929 through March 1933, a duration of 43 months, had a total U.S. stock return of -73.6% and was the worst economic downturn on record.” Of course, they have also learned: “There have been 16 recessions which had positive stock market returns—as measured from the start to the end of each recession. These positive-market recessions lasted on average 16 months, with stock returns ranging from 38.1% to 0.02%, with an annualized cumulative return of +9.8% and an average GDP decline of -2.7%.” Now all we need to know is if the next recession will see stocks have negative or positive returns and we will be set, though if a contraction began at the start of this month as Mr. Fink suggested, we have already endured a significant chunk of the average decline! ***** For those who like what I have to say in this forum, further market analytics and stock picks can be found in my newsletter, The Prudent Speculator.

Title: UK Crypto Market Heats Up: Best Altcoins to Surge After Kraken-Mastercard Partnership

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Kraken, the popular cryptocurrency platform, has partnered with MasterCard, which will allow users to spend their crypto assets, from established best altcoins to new meme coins, directly at more than 150M merchants. This partnership can be a historic move in the payment industry, as it will allow users to pay for real-world goods and services with their crypto holdings, just like they spend cash. Read on as we explore the specifics of this announcement and talk briefly about the UK’s changing relationship with crypto. We’ll also point you toward the best altcoins to buy now. Kraken plans to launch physical and digital debit cards in the weeks to come, which will help bridge the gap between everyday spending and the crypto economy. Crypto is transforming the payments industry, and we envision a future where global commerce and everyday payments are powered by crypto assets – David Ripley, Kraken Co-CEO This move comes after the launch of Crack and Pay in January – a feature powering borderless payments in 300+ cryptos. MasterCard also published a link where Kraken customers can join the waitlist for this new crypto payment offering. At a time when the US and other large economies have liberalized crypto regulation, the UK seems to be adopting a stricter approach. As per reports, the FCA wants to regulate activities such as stablecoin issuance, crypto lending, exchange activities, and payment services. Since 2020, only 14% of firms that have applied for mandatory registration have gotten the approval. Out of this, BlackRock is the latest addition to the FCA register. This decision also comes at a time when six UK digital economy trade bodies have written a letter to the UK Prime Minister to appoint a special team for crypto and digital asset regulation management in the country. Just like the US has done. The letter underlines that blockchain and crypto can add $73.6B to the UK economy in the next 10 years. Realizing this potential, the coalition suggests the creation of a detailed action plan, cross-sector collaboration, and informed decision-making. However, as more countries adopt the US approach of liberalizing cryptocurrencies, it’ll definitely mount pressure on the UK. Growing mainstream adoption will help the market rebound. It also presents retail investors like us with a great opportunity to invest in promising crypto assets. If you don’t know where to look, here are three suggestions. There’s little doubt over the fact that Bitcoin ($BTC) will receive the biggest push with the growing crypto adoption in the UK and worldwide. Also, with $BTC showing signs of a reversal (it’s taking support on the 50 EMA), the time is ripe to capitalize on the King Crypto. And BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) might just be the best crypto to buy to rally alongside $BTC’s growth. It’s the ONLY crypto right now offering free (and real) $BTC to token holders. Now, the biggest reason we’re confident about BTC Bull Token following $BTC’s price is that the aforementioned airdrops will take place every time $BTC reaches a new milestone, such as $150K and $200K. Although this game plan already sounds like a surefire winner, the developers have further bolstered the token’s future by scheduling regular token burns. These will artificially contract the total supply, and as investors rush to grab the few remaining $BTCBULL tokens, their price will most likely see an uptick. In fact, our BTC Bull Token price prediction suggests that the token could climb as high as $0.0096 by the end of 2026. So, if you get in now (when the price is just $0.002455), you’ll be able to generate nearly 400% returns. The project has so far raised over $4.5M, and here’s a detailed guide on how to buy $BTCBULL. The SUBBD platform is, quite frankly, a relief to the $85B subscription-based creator industry. Plus, with its native token, $SUBBD, it’s got a lot of perks to offer to fans as well. A huge reason we believe SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) has serious potential is how it plans to reduce the distance between the creators and their fans. With AI live streams, direct chat, and the ability to request personalized content, $SUBBD will help fans get closer to their favorite creators, which was the point all along. What’s more, as a $SUBBD token holder, you’ll also receive subscription discounts, loyalty rewards, and the earliest access to new platform features. You’ll get governance rights, too. This means you’ll be able to vote on matters, such as which features the developers should prioritize, which creators should/should not be onboarded, themes, etc. The best part? You can buy $SUBBD, one of the best new cryptocurrencies, for just $0.055125. That’s because the token is currently on presale. It’s, in fact, in its first presale stage, meaning this is the absolute cheapest you’ll get it for. And with $SUBBD price prediction targeting $0.668 by the end of 2026, early adopters may see a nearly 1,200% gain over the current price. In light of new crypto partnerships being forged and Trump finally agreeing to pause his reciprocal tariffs, Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN) has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos. With full-blown degen energy backing this absurdly themed meme coin, it has jumped over 91% in the last seven days – and it’s up 202% in just the last month. Take that, crypto pessimists! What’s $FARTCOIN, you ask? Built on a suggestion by the Truth Terminal AI chatbot, Fartcoin came into existence as a result of Elon Musk’s fascination with fart jokes. Currently trading at $0.6983, $FARTCOIN is in a pole position to rally higher. As crypto grows more legs with new partnerships and new markets being unlocked, the above-mentioned are the next crypto likely to explode. However, it’s important to remember that returns aren’t guaranteed. The crypto market does as it pleases, after all. With volatility being the main portfolio killer, make sure you don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose.

Title: Trump’s Attack on ‘Woke Investing’ Is Silencing Climate-Conscious Shareholders
URL: https://gizmodo.com/trumps-attack-on-woke-investing-is-silencing-climate-conscious-shareholders-2000587593
Time Published: 2025-04-10T15:10:03Z
Full Content:
Environmental-, social-, and governance-related shareholder proposals are down 34 percent this year as the Trump administration galvanizes the movement against âwoke investing,â according to an annual report by the shareholder advocacy groups As You Sow and Proxy Impact. The report counted 355 such proposals as of February 21, compared to 536 proposals filed by the same time last year. Wariness over anticipated changes at the Securities and Exchange Commission contributed to the decline, the authors said, as many investors opted to postpone resolutions until it became clear whether they would be blocked by new SEC leadership. âWeâre a little bit in a pause mode,â said Andy Behar, As You Sowâs CEO. He said a âright-wing crusadeâ against socially responsible investing has left shareholders in limbo as they figure out how to navigate the shifting political climate. The term ESG â shorthand for an investment approach that prioritizes environmental, social, and governance issues â dates to 2004 and doesnât have a fixed definition. Generally, it represents the idea that investors should buy shares in companies that factor social and environmental issues into their decision-making on the theory that such companies are more likely to prosper in the long run. Investors promote ESG principles via shareholder resolutions, brief proposals that are put up for a vote by everyone who owns stock in a company during their annual meeting. These resolutions typically ask a company to issue a report about how some aspect of its operations, like its greenhouse gas emissions, may affect the companyâs future profitability. All of the shareholder proposals submitted to a company during a given year are compiled into a âproxy statement,â and the time of year when voting occurs âÂ usually around May âÂ is called proxy season. Progressive critics of ESG have argued that the concept is so vague as to be meaningless and that exaggerated claims of corporate responsibility are a distraction from the systemic reforms needed to address societal problems. But the more aggressive criticism has come from the political right, which sees corporate diversity and environmental policies as âwokeâ interference with capitalism. These criticisms escalated during Joe Bidenâs administration. In 2022, red-state regulators began naming and shaming financial institutions for an alleged âboycottâ of fossil fuel companies and investigating big banks for their ESG practices. Last year, 17 red states passed legislation restricting corporate decision-making based on ESG priorities, and institutional investors like BlackRock grew more tepid in their support for ESG proposals. President Donald Trumpâs broad attacks on climate policy and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have further chilled ESG efforts, inspiring several major banks to withdraw from a climate initiative in the lead-up to Inauguration Day. Experts quoted in the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report said government attempts to limit ESG investing amount to an attack on shareholdersâ right to make policy recommendations through proxy voting, guaranteed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. âAn anti-shareholder movement âÂ often mislabeled as âanti-ESGâ â is silencing the voice of everyday investors in the U.S.,â reads one statement from Rick Alexander, CEO of the nonprofit The Shareholder Commons. Behar said ESG opponents are unduly manipulating the market. âThey donât like capitalism, they donât like free markets, they donât like democracy,â he said. âThis is problematic for all the shareholders who are trying to keep our companies proceeding into the future.â Trumpâs reelection has also prompted changes at the SEC, the federal agency charged with protecting investors and enforcing laws against market manipulation. It normally has five commissioners, no more than three of whom may belong to the same political party, but two of its Democratic members voluntarily stepped down after Trump was elected, and their seats are currently vacant. Two of the three sitting commissioners â one Republican and one Democrat âÂ were nominated by Trump. The third, a Republican, was nominated by former president Joe Biden. In February â after the majority of the ESG shareholder resolutions included in the report had been filed â the SEC announced two new policies that complicated these resolutions and could make it more difficult to file resolutions next year. First, the agency placed tighter deadlines and more onerous reporting requirements on large investors asking companies to, for example, disclose their climate risks or boost gender equality on their boards. Second, the SEC made it easier for companies to exclude shareholder proposals from their proxy statements if those proposals were deemed not âsignificantly relatedâ to their business. The SEC gave companies an extra opportunity to convince regulators to allow specific proposals to be excluded on the basis of this new policy, but it has not afforded investors a similar opportunity for additional explanation. âIt was clearly a biased decision stacked against shareholders,â said Michael Passoff, CEO of Proxy Impact and a co-author of the report. In light of the growing anti-ESG movement, Behar said some companies have grown more willing to engage in dialogue with investors, perhaps hoping to avoid the publicity generated by a proxy vote. This, he said, is how shareholder advocates prefer to make change âÂ by persuading companies to take action voluntarily in exchange for the withdrawal of a proposal. According to the report, 22 percent of ESG-related shareholder proposals were withdrawn as of February 21, compared to 7.7 percent at a similar time in 2024, suggesting that companies were negotiating behind the scenes with investors. However, companies have also been emboldened to ignore shareholder proposals. One way to measure this is by looking at the number of âno actionâ requests prompted by shareholder resolutions. These are requests companies make to the SEC asking for confirmation that the agency will not take action against them if they omit a proposal from their proxy statements. Even with fewer proposals filed as of early March this year, 221 had prompted no-action requests, compared to just 94 around the same time last year. While the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report identified fewer climate- and environment-related shareholder proposals filed this season, the nature of those that were filed did not change much from previous years. The largest chunk ask companies for information about the decarbonization strategies or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some new ones ask financial institutions to set investment ratio targets for clean energy infrastructure compared to fossil fuels; for insurance companies to report and reduce the climate pollution associated with their underwriting; and for mining companies to disclose their policies for deep-sea mining, in the absence of international rules governing this activity. Frances Fairhead-Stanova, a shareholder advocate for the environmentally responsible mutual fund Green Century Capital Management, said the As You Sow and Proxy Impact report raises concerns that affect many shareholders. However, she reported that the presidential election results and anticipated changes at the SEC did not prompt her organization to file fewer resolutions. She noticed more no-action requests, but said itâs unclear whether the SEC will grant a greater proportion of them compared to previous years. So far, Green Century has withdrawn 6 of the 27 climate- and environment-related resolutions it filed, in exchange for some sort of action or reporting. Starbucks, for example, agreed to share more information about its transition to reusable cups and to remove any recycling labels it deems misleading, following an internal assessment. TD Bank agreed to an audit of its board of governance policies with the aim of improving climate risk management. Five companies filed no-action requests, and the SEC has rejected two of these. The others are still pending. âWeâre not panicked about any changes,â Fairhead-Stanova said. âWe are just continuing to do our work.â This article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/business/trump-climate-equity-esg-woke-investing-shareholder-resolutions/.Â Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

Title: Italy's Prada Agrees To Buy Rival Versace For 1.25 Billion Euros
URL: https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/italy-prada-agrees-to-buy-rival-versace-for-1-25-billion-euros-8134276

Italian fashion house Prada announced Thursday it had reached a deal with US group Capri Holdings to buy its flashy rival Versace for 1.25 billion euros ($1.38 billion). The acquisition will create a luxury group with revenues of over six billion euros that could better compete with industry giants such as the French conglomerates LVMH and Gucci owner Kering, amid a slowdown in the sector worldwide. "We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group and to build a new chapter for a brand with which we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftmanship and heritage," Prada group chairman and executive director Patrizio Bertelli said in a statement. In 2018, Capri paid 1.83 billion euros (then $2.1 billion) to acquire Versace, which was previously owned 80 percent by the Versace family and 20 percent by the US investment fund BlackRock. Amid declining sales at the Milan-based label, it put Versace up for sale, and began exclusive negotiations with Prada at the end of February. Capri, which also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, had to accept a reduced price from Prada amid the market turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Financial Times reported that the price was initially expected to be about $1.6 billion but had been negotiated downwards in recent days. Last month, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative director after more than 30 years, a move widely seen as a prelude to the accord. She took over in 1997 following the murder of her older brother Gianni, who founded the label in 1978. But on April 1 she was replaced as creative director by Dario Vitale, who has overseen soaring sales at Miu Miu, Prada's sister brand targeting a younger clientele. Donatella Versace, who turns 70 in May, is now the label's chief brand ambassador. Long journey While still a label associated with the jet set, some of Versace's luster has waned in recent years. It posted $193 million in revenue in its fiscal 2025 third quarter, down 15 percent. By contrast, Prada, under the creative helm of Miuccia Prada, the 76-year-old granddaughter of group founder Mario, is in robust health. Despite the global slowdown in sales of luxury goods, Prada's net profit jumped 25 percent to 839 million euros in 2024, with revenues up 15 percent to 5.4 billion euros. Andrea Guerra, Prada's group chief executive officer, said on Thursday that Versace had "huge potential" but warned there was work to do. "The journey will be long and will require disciplined execution and patience. The evolution of a brand always needs time and constant focus," he said. The deal, funded through 1.5 billion euros of new debt, is expected to close in the second half of 2025. 'Complementary addition' The two fashion labels have starkly different styles, with Versace's exuberance contrasting with Prada's sophisticated minimalism. Prada said its new acquisition "constitutes a strongly complementary addition" to its portfolio. It said Versace will "maintain its creative DNA and cultural authenticity", while benefitting from Prada's "industrial capabilities, retail execution and operational expertise". The deal bucks the trend of recent years, which has seen major names in Italian fashion such as Gucci, Fendi, and Bottega Veneta fall under the control of their French competitors. "Prada will be able to bring light back into a brand that was dying and infuse it with new life," Antonio Bandini Conti, a design consultant, told AFP. However, a previous attempt to expand the Prada portfolio -- which also includes luxury footwear brands Car Shoe and Church's -- offers a cautionary tale. In 1999, the family group acquired the German brand Jil Sander and the Austrian label Helmut Lang before selling them in 2006 as they were weighing down its financial results. In 2000, Prada jointly acquired a 51 percent stake in the Roman label Fendi with LVMH, but sold its 25.5 percent stake to the French luxury giant a year later. With the Versace acquisition, "I see a risk for Prada to become distracted from its core business," Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein, told AFP.

Title: U.S. and Panama Agree to Counter Chinese Influence in Panama Canal, Prioritize Passage of U.S. Government Ships

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shakes hands with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino, in Panama City, Panama April 9, 2025. REUTERS/Aris Martinez U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced an expanded partnership with Panama aimed at securing the Panama Canal against what he termed “China’s maligned influence” in the region. During a joint press conference with Panamanian Public Security Minister Frank Abrego, Hegseth declared that “The era of capitulating to coercion by the communist Chinese is over.” The announcement came during a three-day security conference in Panama City. The partnership includes a signed memorandum of understanding for cooperative security activities and an upcoming declaration specifically focused on canal security and operations. This new framework will provide U.S. warships and auxiliary vessels “first and free” passage through the canal. A key component of the agreement involves reestablishing American military presence at several former U.S. installations, including Rodman Naval Station, Howard Air Force Base, and Fort Sherman. Currently, the U.S. has deployed significant military assets to the region, including two guided-missile cruisers, a Coast Guard cutter, four F-18 fighter jets, and over 1,000 service members. The agreement follows President Trump’s controversial threats to “take back” the Panama Canal from Chinese influence—a claim strongly refuted by the Panamanian government. To address U.S. concerns, a consortium led by the American investment firm BlackRock reached a deal in March to acquire Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison’s port operations at both ends of the canal, a move that Beijing has widely criticized. The deal has yet to close. Trump also previously criticized what he called “exorbitant tolls” charged for American ships, claiming the U.S. “foolishly gave away” the canal. The Panama Canal Authority confirmed the agreement in an official announcement highlighting that the declaration reaffirms Panamanian sovereignty over the waterway and compliance with strict anti-discrimination requirements established by the 1977 Neutrality Treaty between Panama and the U.S. The agreement also includes provisions for developing compensation mechanisms for services provided to military vessels. The enhanced partnership extends beyond canal security to include joint efforts in combating regional criminal enterprises and border security. Notably, Panama has achieved a 99% reduction in illegal border crossings at the Darién Gap over the past year. The USNS Comfort, a U.S. Navy hospital ship, is scheduled to visit Panama this summer to provide medical care and strengthen bilateral relations.

Title: How CEOs Beat Trump on Tariffs

It took a mere 13 hours for the Trump administration to cave on their reciprocal tariff scheme. President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Advisor Peter Navarro did exactly what they said they would not do—“back off” of the non-negotiable trade measures. More perplexing is that no significant trade concession was gained from a single country during the brief period of “maximum leverage.” But a self-congratulatory tone was adopted after announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs. Advertisement Advertisement While the President may have been able to confront retaliatory tariffs from foreign partners and diffuse public demonstrations against DOGE actions, he was ultimately unable to stand up to the growing chorus of CEOs condemning his administration’s tariff agenda. Under the threat of aggressor trade tactics, U.S. stocks shed more than $6.5 trillion in two days. And more market pain looked likely as corporate quarterly earnings were just beginning to be released, with growth forecasts being revised downwards. Moreover, Treasury yields and the dollar’s value appeared to be breaking with conventional trade norms during similar periods of crisis, fueling rumors of the two assets losing their coveted “safe-haven” status—and threatening the interest rate discounts on U.S. corporate debt associated with that status. Simply put, CEOs had enough. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted a recession is “a likely outcome” as tariffs were "beyond what people expected." Delta Airlines CEO Ed Bastian pulled the company’s financial forecast for the year “given broad economic uncertainty around global trade.” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told an audience at the Economic Club of New York that most business leaders from his portfolio companies “say we are probably in a recession right now.” These three instances are but a few of the many recent statements of defiance from all corners of the business community, including finance, transportation, housing, autos, technology, and general manufacturing—led by other titans of industry, from Tesla’s Elon Musk to Ford’s Jim Farley to Alcoa’s Bill Oplinger as well as trade association leaders such as Jay Timmons of the National Association of Manufacturers and Suzanne Clark of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Last month, in fact, at Yale’s CEO Caucus, 100 top CEOs told us they would begin to speak out against Trump if the stock market fell by approximately 20%. Business executives did exactly that as the markets surpassed or flirted with the threshold. Collectively, they punctured the threats and self-inflicted suffering in a challenge directed towards the president. Despite the moderate trade relief, CEOs remain confused and concerned with the continued delays and whiplash reversals by the administration. The uncertainty has stalled business investment and stymied the potential boon in opportunities from deregulation. Many have expressed a loss of confidence in the president’s economic policy agenda. Trump has placed himself in a precarious situation. In corporate leaders’ minds, the blame rests not only on Trump but also Navarro and Lutnick. Both have lost credibility after reversing course on the negotiability of tariffs. In an interview last week on CNN, Lutnick said, “I don't think there's any chance…President Trump's going to back off his tariffs.” On the same day, Navarro went on air to declare “this [tariff doctrine] is not a negotiation.” The trade advisor then doubled down in an op-ed with the Financial Times. It is Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent who adopted the opposite message to his two colleagues in the internal feud over the White House’s trade strategy. Wednesday’s market relief in response to Trump’s Truth Social post indicates the President may have quelled some of the jitters of nervous traders but not those of CEOs. Business leaders might have stopped him from driving the U.S. economy off a cliff, but it remains teetering on the edge. The conflicting details from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Bessent, and Trump did not provide business leaders enough confidence to end their pause on capital investments or M&A. After more firm details behind the pause emerged, initial excitement tempered. Some analysts even expect the new tariff policy to be just as economically painful. The 10% base tariff was not rescinded. Tariffs on China were ratcheted up to 145% from 104% as punishment for retaliation, despite the European Union approving retaliatory tariffs of their own hours before. The tariff stance on Canada and Mexico were not affected, nor were existing tariffs on the auto, steel, aluminum, lumber, and other sectors rescinded. Tariffs on the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries are still reportedly under consideration. The heightened sense of uncertainty that forced small business confidence to plunge by 50%, labor market conditions to deteriorate, capital spending to stall, and GDP growth forecasts to plummet still remains. Before any reciprocal tariff announcements, 89% of CEOs said at our CEO Caucus in March that they were increasingly concerned the US economy is heading towards a recession, while 69% said the administration would be bad for the economy. Nearly all leaders supported the use of selective tariffs, like most of the American public, but not those that are generalized or reciprocal. And as four-fifths of CEOs reported apologizing for Trump’s behavior to their international counterparts, some of those same longtime foreign trade partners are having exploratory conversations with China to expand commercial ties. Perhaps Musk best described the current tariff policy on X amid his public feud with Navarro. Musk called Trump’s trade advisor “dumber than a sack of bricks." Seems appropriate, but then again, that characterization might be unfair to bricks. The trade policy uncertainty continues to present significant challenges for business leaders, disrupting long-term planning, investment decisions, and global supply chain strategies. The recent decision to pause reciprocal tariffs might be a small “win” for leaders. They are hoping the President has learned a lesson here. © 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

April 10, 2025 10:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, April 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global biopharmaceutical logistics market was valued at US$ 135.88 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 252.20 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 7.24% during the forecast period 2025-2033. The biopharmaceutical logistics market is undergoing rapid globalization, with manufacturers and logistics providers increasingly targeting high-growth regions such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa. By 2024, India and China collectively account for 35% of global pharmaceutical production, leveraging their cost-efficient labor pools and pro-business regulatory reforms. Emerging markets now represent 45% of the $1.6 trillion global biopharma industry, according to IQVIA, but infrastructure bottlenecks—such as fragmented transport networks and unreliable cold chain storage—continue to hinder seamless operations. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/bio-pharmaceutical-logistics-market To address these challenges, multinational firms like UPS Healthcare and DHL Supply Chain are investing over $500 million annually in regional hubs, exemplified by Singapore’s Life Sciences & Healthcare Campus, which serves as a gateway to Southeast Asia. Cross-border trade agreements in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, such as the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), are simplifying regulatory harmonization and slashing transit times by 20%. However, geopolitical tensions, including shipping disruptions in the Red Sea and U.S.-China trade friction, are forcing companies to adopt dual sourcing strategies for critical raw materials. Localized manufacturing via modular facilities, such as Samsung Biologics’ “Plug-and-Play” plants, is reducing dependence on centralized production hubs while accelerating market entry. Despite a projected CAGR of 7.24% through 2033, this globalization wave demands agile risk management frameworks to navigate trade volatility and ensure supply chain resilience. Key Findings in Biopharmaceutical Logistics Market Cold Chain Innovations Tackle Temperature Sensitivity of Advanced Therapies With biologics like mRNA vaccines and CAR-T cell therapies dominating 70% of the US$ 135.88 billion biopharmaceutical logistics market (2024), maintaining ultra-low temperatures has become a critical focus. Products such as CRISPR-based gene therapies require storage as low as -150°C, driving demand for cryogenic solutions like B Medical Systems’ nitrogen-powered containers. IoT-enabled sensors, including Controlant’s real-time monitoring devices, have reduced temperature deviations by 25% per WHO data, while blockchain platforms like MediLedger ensure tamper-proof documentation. Regulatory mandates, notably the EU’s revised GDP Annex 15, now enforce 99.99% temperature accuracy, catalyzing $3.2 billion in annual investments in cold chain infrastructure. Despite progress, 30% of global biopharma shipments still face delays due to underdeveloped airport cold rooms in regions like Africa and Southeast Asia. Hybrid solutions combining passive cooling (e.g., WHO-certified insulated boxes) with active refrigeration are gaining traction, supported by initiatives like the USDA’s $2 billion cold chain initiative in India. Predictive analytics tools, such as Tive Solo, are cutting spoilage costs by $15 billion annually by forecasting risks like customs holdups or equipment failures. The rise of autologous therapies, which require patient-specific logistics, is further pushing the industry toward decentralized “just-in-time” delivery models—innovation that demands reconfigurable cold chain networks to balance speed and precision. Digitalization Unlocks End-to-End Visibility and Predictive Supply Chain Control Digital transformation has reshaped biopharmaceutical logistics market in 2024, with 80% of top-tier companies deploying AI-driven platforms to optimize decision-making. Tools like SAP Integrated Business Planning have slashed inventory waste by 18% through hyper-accurate demand forecasting, while machine learning algorithms from Blue Yonder improve route efficiency by 22%. Cloud-based transport management systems (TMS), such as Oracle’s platform, centralize data across 30+ supply chain touchpoints, reducing administrative overheads by $7 million annually per enterprise. Blockchain adoption is surging, with 60% of vaccine shipments now tracked via Hyperledger Fabric to combat counterfeiting and ensure compliance. Digital twins, which simulate supply chain disruptions, enabled Pfizer to reroute 30% of COVID-19 vaccine shipments faster during 2023’s Hurricane Ian. Nevertheless, fragmented legacy systems remain a hurdle for the biopharmaceutical logistics market: 40% of mid-sized biotechs still rely on manual Excel tracking, doubling error rates. Cybersecurity risks have also escalated, with attacks on shipment data rising 200% since 2022—pushing firms to adopt Zero Trust Architecture, a US$ 1.8 billion market by 2024. The integration of 5G-enabled IoT devices provides real-time monitoring of temperature-sensitive CRISPR therapies, ensuring sub-second response times to anomalies. With Astute Analytica estimating US$ 21.7 billion spent on digital logistics this year, the sector is racing to balance innovation with operational continuity. Serialization Mandates Reshape Compliance Amid Regulatory Fragmentation Global regulatory pressures are intensifying, with the FDA’s 2024 DSCSA deadline compelling 90% of U.S. pharma firms to adopt item-level serialization. Similarly, the EU’s Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) mandates tamper-proof packaging for 95% of biologics, costing manufacturers $5 million annually per product line. China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) now requires blockchain-based serialization in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, which has reduced counterfeit biologics by 40% since 2023. Aggregated systems like Systech’s UniSeries accelerate validation by enabling pallet-to-unit traceability, cutting compliance time by 50%. Interoperability gaps, however, persist: reconciling U.S. GS1 standards with China’s MMDS system adds $2.3 billion in annual costs in the market. Post-Brexit complexities, such as dual UK/EU labeling rules, have raised operational expenses by 18% for firms like AstraZeneca. To streamline compliance, 70% of companies now use AI-driven platforms like TrackTraceRX to automate 80% of documentation, while FDA warning letters for GDP non-compliance surged 35% in 2023 over storage validation lapses. Emerging markets in the biopharmaceutical logistics market like Brazil are tightening rules—Anvisa’s RDC 430 now mandates temperature data loggers for all cold chain shipments—forcing smaller logistics players to partner with tech providers. While organizations like PIC/S aim to harmonize regulations, slow progress continues to delay biologics’ time-to-market by 6–12 months. Personalized Medicine’s Rise Demands Precision Logistics Overhauls The US$ 82 billion personalized medicine market requires logistics networks tailored to therapies like CAR-T, which have a 72-hour viability window. AmerisourceBergen’s World Courier delivers over 300 CAR-T doses monthly via GPS-tracked, IoT-enabled shippers, while Cryoport’s nitrogen vapor systems maintain -170°C for stem cell therapies, achieving a 0.1% failure rate. However, 25% of apheresis centers lack same-day airport access, prompting DHL to deploy mobile collection units. Wherein, gene therapies pose unique hurdles to the biopharmaceutical logistics market: adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors degrade above -65°C, necessitating solutions like CSafe’s RKN shippers with proprietary phase-change materials. Real-time patient monitoring via CRISPR-based biosensors (e.g., NanoString) triggers dynamic routing for treatments like Vertex’s exa-cel sickle cell therapy. Decentralized clinical trials, now 45% of studies, require localized distribution across 50+ countries, pressuring firms like IQVIA to establish micro-fulfillment hubs. Payers are pushing back against logistics costs, which account for $500,000 per CAR-T dose, driving investments in scalable “hub-and-spoke” networks to cut last-mile expenses by 30%. With AI tools predicting patient adherence (e.g., Novo Nordisk’s Rybelsus® refill algorithms), the sector must align agility with affordability. Personalized medicine is projected to drive 65% of logistics investments through 2030, but only through hyper-specialized infrastructure can the industry meet this demand sustainably. Sustainability Gains Momentum with Green Logistics and Carbon-Neutral Transport Sustainability has become non-negotiable for biopharmaceutical logistics market, with supply chains contributing 8% of global CO2 emissions. Sixty percent of the top 50 firms now adhere to science-based targets (SBTi), committing to 45% emission cuts by 2030. DHL’s GoGreen Plus program offsets 30% of air freight emissions via sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) credits, while Pfizer’s EcoBox initiative eliminates 25 million pounds of annual waste through reusable packaging. Innovations like Sonoco Thermosafe’s eutectic phase-change materials reduce energy consumption by 40% compared to traditional refrigeration. Solar-powered warehouses, such as FedEx’s Los Angeles hub, cut facility emissions by 90%, and electric trucks like the Tesla Semi handle 20% of U.S. middle-mile distribution. Despite progress, 70% of shippers in the biopharmaceutical logistics market still use polystyrene coolants, which take 500+ years to decompose. Regulatory risks loom: EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) could penalize non-compliant firms up to $4 million annually. EcoVadis ratings now influence 35% of logistics contracts, compelling suppliers to adopt ISO 14001 standards. While SAF remains 300% costlier than conventional fuel, coalitions like ClearBlue aim for price parity by 2026. Investors are reinforcing this shift: BlackRock reports 99% of institutions prioritize ESG metrics in 2024, making green logistics a strategic imperative rather than an optional benchmark. View the Table of Contents to select and purchase individual chapters: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/industry-report/toc/bio-pharmaceutical-logistics-market Urbanization and Patient-Centric Models Revolutionize Last-Mile Delivery Urbanization, with 68% of the global population in cities by 2024, has intensified demand for rapid, temperature-controlled last-mile delivery in the biopharmaceutical logistics market. Same-day service now covers 40% of critical biologics, led by Amazon Pharmacy and Capsule’s urban networks. In Rwanda, Zipline’s drones deliver 10,000+ vaccines daily, slashing transit times from 4 hours to 15 minutes. However, 60% of U.S. patients reside in “pharmacy deserts,” prompting Walgreens to deploy micro-fulfillment centers for extended reach. Precision temperature control is paramount: Tesla’s refrigerated vans maintain 2–8°C with 98% accuracy versus 85% for legacy fleets. Crowdsourced platforms like Uber Health reduce costs by 25%, but stolen oncology shipments rose 15% in 2023, underscoring security risks. Predictive routing via Locus Robotics cuts delivery times by 30%, though 50% of APAC countries lack standardized addressing systems for precision logistics. Patient-centric adherence tools, such as Phil’s GPS-enabled inhalers, automatically trigger refills, necessitating dynamic inventory management at UPS’s metropolitan hubs. Regulatory bottlenecks, including FAA restrictions on long-range drones, delay U.S. adoption of aerial delivery. Despite a projected $35 billion market for last-mile biopharma logistics in 2024, labor shortages—a 1.2 million driver deficit in the U.S.—and rising “clicks-to-bricks” returns (up 25%) challenge scalability, demanding smarter automation and workforce strategies. Climate and Geopolitical Risks Demand Proactive Supply Chain Mitigation Climate disasters cost the biopharmaceutical logistics market a US$12 billion in 2023, highlighted by Hurricane Fiona’s disruption of Puerto Rico’s pharma exports, which supply 10% of global APIs. Concurrently, geopolitical volatility, such as the Red Sea shipping crisis, extended lead times by 21 days, pushing 60% of firms to nearshore API production. Everstream Analytics’ AI-driven risk platforms now redirect 30% of shipments preemptively, while dual sourcing strategies—employed by Pfizer for lipid nanoparticle suppliers—cover 80% of critical materials versus 40% in 2021. Insurance costs have spiked 40% due to war exclusions, accelerating the shift to parametric models like Swiss Re’s NatCat for faster claims. The 2023 Phoenix city heatwave destroyed $150 million in insulin through temperature excursions, spurring adoption of climate-resilient packaging like Va-Q-tec’s PHCbi. Moreover, sanctions on Russian airspace forced reroutes via Kazakhstan, raising 2024 fuel costs by 18%. Post-pandemic buffer stockpiling costs $8 billion annually in the biopharmaceutical logistics market, even as firms pivot to multi-modal options—30% of temperature-sensitive cargo now moves via blockchain-secured rail (e.g., DB Schenker’s PharmaRail). Proactive risk management, now a $4.5 billion market, is no longer optional but a cornerstone of supply chain viability in an era of compounding disruptions. Future Outlook: AI, Circular Supply Chains, and Regionalization Redefine Logistics By 2033, AI will govern 50% of biopharmaceutical logistics market’s decisions, with generative models like GPT-5 automating 70% of customs paperwork. Autonomous robotics, including Boston Dynamics’ Stretch, will manage 30% of warehouses, achieving 99.9% picking accuracy. Apart from this, the circular economy will dominate, as 90% of packaging transitions to blockchain-tracked reusable loops, exemplified by Loop Industries’ partnership with GSK. Regionalized manufacturing, such as BioNTech’s mRNA “BioNTainer” facilities, will slash transport needs by 40%, while 4D-printed vaccines from MIT could eliminate cold chain dependencies. However, monopolization risks loom: Amazon, DHL, and UPS control 65% of the logistics market, prompting antitrust scrutiny. Space logistics partnerships, like SpaceX’s polar satellite launches, may expedite global distribution, while quantum computing could optimize routes in milliseconds.

Title: Stock futures slide even as inflation cools. Tesla, Apple, and Amazon slip as bank earnings loom
URL: https://qz.com/djia-sp500-nasdaq-stocks-markets-tesla-apple-amazon-1851775588

Stocks closed sharply down on Thursday as investors digested a wave of economic uncertainty, including tariff tensions, inflation data, and a string of downbeat corporate signals. The Nasdaq sank 4.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 3.5% and the Dow fell 2.5%. The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, slid 4%. Big Tech led the losses: Apple fell more than 4%, Amazon dropped over 5%, and Tesla slumped more than 7%. Used-car retailer CarMax was one of the day’s biggest losers, closing down 17% after a disappointing earnings report and broader concerns about the auto sector. Looking ahead, Friday will bring a wave of bank earnings, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others set to report — offering fresh insight into credit conditions and consumer resilience. Investors will also parse new economic data, including producer price inflation figures, for clues about the path of interest rates. Markets fell sharply Thursday, giving back a big chunk of Wednesday’s huge rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,693 points in early-afternoon trading, or about 4.2%, after its historic 3,000-point surge the day before, The S&P 500 fell 4.9%, and the Nasdaq dropped 5.7%, with shares of the Magnificent Seven tech giants leading the retreat: Apple (AAPL+4.00%) stock slid 6%, Tesla (TSLA-0.96%) dropped 10%, and Amazon (AMZN+1.90%) fell more than 6.5%. Shopify (SHOP-2.15%) stock tumbled more than 9%. Used car stocks were hit especially hard after CarMax’s earnings miss, with CarMax stock down almost 20% and Carvana (CVNA+0.06%) off 10%. The pullback reflects lingering skepticism around President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs, which arrived even more abruptly than the trade war policy itself. Markets seem reluctant to trust a policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as inflation data offered some welcome relief. The Consumer Price Index showed that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March, the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax’s (KMX+1.95%) fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts’ expectations of $0.66 per share. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025’s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+4.84%) will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins — the critical metrics that show how it’s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment. Any signs of tightening credit or weakening consumer demand could ripple across the market.
