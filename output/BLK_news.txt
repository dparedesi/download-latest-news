Global Financial Collapse: Analysts warn of a rapid unraveling of the financial system, with stock markets crashing, bond markets destabilizing, and hyperinflation looming, making gold and silver the only reliable stores of value. "The Great Taking": The crisis is framed as a deliberate dismantling of wealth, where institutional investors like BlackRock may seize assets from ordinary citizens, wiping out middle-class savings and pensions. Hyperinflation & Bank Bail-Ins: Government responses, including money printing and tariffs, will worsen hyperinflation. Bank "bail-ins" (confiscating depositor funds) and Chinaâs threat to call in U.S. debt could trigger a dollar collapse. Geopolitical Escalation: Trade wars with China could lead to economic warfare (e.g., dumping U.S. treasuries) or kinetic conflict, with Russiaâs hypersonic missiles posing a severe threat in a potential WWIII scenario. Urgent Preparation Needed: Physical gold, silver, food, water, and backup communications are critical for survival. Analysts warn of imminent societal breakdown, urging immediate action before supply chains collapse.

In an emergency interview, financial analysts Steve Quayle and Mike Adams issued a dire warning: the global financial system is unraveling in real time. With the Dow Jones plummeting over 2,000 points and bond markets destabilizing stock markets, the two experts emphasized that gold and silver remain the only reliable stores of value as hyperinflation looms and governments prepare for "bail-ins" â the confiscation of depositor funds to prop up failing banks. The discussion, which aired on Brighteon.com, painted a grim picture of a coordinated economic takedown by global elites, with catastrophic consequences for middle-class investors. Quayle, a veteran financial analyst, warned: "The real story is behind the scenesâwhatâs happening in the bond markets. When bond markets take a hit, the collateral banks are holding collapses. Weâve never seen the economy deteriorate at such an accelerated rate with so many negative events happening concurrently." The Great Taking: Middle-Class Wealth Erased Adams and Quayle asserted that the current financial crisis is not accidental but a deliberate demolition of the existing system to usher in a "Great Taking"âa scenario where institutional investors like BlackRock swoop in to seize assets from ordinary citizens. "This feels like a great taking moment where the typical middle-class investor is about to get obliterated financially," Adams said. "Anyone not holding gold and silver will see their assets destroyed." Quayle added that commercial real estate is the next domino to fall, with major retailers and restaurants defaulting on loans, triggering a chain reaction that will wipe out pensions and savings. Hyperinflation, Bank Bail-Ins, and the Death of the Dollar Both experts warned that government responsesâsuch as Trumpâs proposed tariffs and potential money printingâwill only accelerate hyperinflation. "Whatever Trump or anyone does to respond to this will involve printing more money, which will only devalue the dollar further," Adams said. Quayle emphasized that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are already in crisis mode, with China threatening to call in its $2 trillion in U.S. debtâan act theyâve reportedly labeled as an "act of war" if unpaid. "If we canât pay the interest on our debt, China will consider it an act of war," Quayle warned. "The U.S. dollar is being repudiated globally, and 146 nations are moving away from it." World War III and Economic Warfare The conversation took an even darker turn as Adams and Quayle connected the financial collapse to escalating geopolitical tensions. They warned that Trumpâs aggressive tariff policies against China could push the world into kinetic warfare. "China and Trump are playing a game of global chicken," Adams said. "If trade wars go insane, China could sell off U.S. treasuries, ban rare earth exports, and even attack Taiwan." Quayle added that Russia and Iran have mutual defense agreements, meaning any U.S. strike on Iran could trigger a full-scale war with Russiaâone that would be decided in minutes due to Russiaâs hypersonic missile superiority. The Only Safe Havens: Gold, Silver, and Preparedness Both analysts stressed that physical gold and silver are the only assets that will retain value in the coming collapse. Quayle, who has decades of experience in precious metals, warned: "Without gold and silver, your entire financial worldâwhether youâre retiring or just trying to stay afloatâwill go down the drain." Adams urged listeners to secure food, water filtration, and backup communications (such as satellite phones from SAT123.com) before supply chains collapse entirely. Final Warning: âThis Weekend Could Change Everythingâ Quayle issued a chilling final warning: "This is the weekend that could literally go down in history. If youâre not prepared, you will be caught in the crossfire of financial destruction, war, and societal breakdown." As markets continue to freefall and global tensions reach a boiling point, Adams and Quayleâs message is clear: The collapse is here. Prepare nowâor face the consequences.

Quayle emphasized that the Federal Reserve and Treasury are already in crisis mode, with China threatening to call in its $2 trillion in U.S. debtâan act theyâve reportedly labeled as an "act of war" if unpaid. "If we canât pay the interest on our debt, China will consider it an act of war," Quayle warned. "The U.S. dollar is being repudiated globally, and 146 nations are moving away from it." World War III and Economic Warfare The conversation took an even darker turn as Adams and Quayle connected the financial collapse to escalating geopolitical tensions. They warned that Trumpâs aggressive tariff policies against China could push the world into kinetic warfare. "China and Trump are playing a game of global chicken," Adams said. "If trade wars go insane, China could sell off U.S. treasuries, ban rare earth exports, and even attack Taiwan." Quayle added that Russia and Iran have mutual defense agreements, meaning any U.S. strike on Iran could trigger a full-scale war with Russiaâone that would be decided in minutes due to Russiaâs hypersonic missile superiority. The Only Safe Havens: Gold, Silver, and Preparedness Both analysts stressed that physical gold and silver are the only assets that will retain value in the coming collapse. Quayle, who has decades of experience in precious metals, warned: "Without gold and silver, your entire financial worldâwhether youâre retiring or just trying to stay afloatâwill go down the drain." Adams urged listeners to secure food, water filtration, and backup communications (such as satellite phones from SAT123.com) before supply chains collapse entirely. Final Warning: âThis Weekend Could Change Everythingâ Quayle issued a chilling final warning: "This is the weekend that could literally go down in history. If youâre not prepared, you will be caught in the crossfire of financial destruction, war, and societal breakdown." As markets continue to freefall and global tensions reach a boiling point, Adams and Quayleâs message is clear: The collapse is here. Prepare nowâor face the consequences.

Title: Thousands of speeding prosecutions on hold pending test case over ‘defective’ notice

Full Content:
A test case with implications for more than 2,000 drivers who were allegedly speeding in an average speed zone will be heard by the High Court this week. The case concerns the legal adequacy of a fixed charge notice (FCN) issued to Edel O’Brien, Springhill Avenue, Deansgrange, Blackrock, Co Dublin, who is alleged to have driven at 131km/h on the M7 motorway at Birdhill (west), in an average speeding zone where a 120km/h limit applies. A core issue is whether the absence of the word “average” from FCNs, when issued for alleged speeding in an average speed zone, makes them so defective that a conviction cannot be registered on foot of them. About 900 other cases have been adjourned, and 1,500 summonses for alleged speeding in an average speed zone have yet to issue, pending the outcome of the High Court’s decision on legal issues referred by District Court Judge Miriam Walsh arising from Ms O’Brien’s case. Average speed cameras record vehicles at two distinct points a set distance apart, allowing for speed to be calculated over a longer distance than a single static camera. In Ms O’Brien’s case, she was served with a FCN alleging she was driving at 131km/h on the M7 Ballinahinch, (westbound) Birdhill, on September 7th 2022. Ms O’Brien contacted the Garda Processing Office querying the content of the FCN. She said she was then told, for the first time, the allegation related to a recorded average speed over a 9km distance on the M7 westbound ending at Birdhill. When she did not pay the notice, she was summonsed to appear before Nenagh District Court in March 2024. In setting out legal issues to be determined by the High Court, Judge Walsh said Ms O’Brien, representing herself, had pleaded guilty and accepted she had been speeding in excess of the 120km/h limit but she raised an issue that the FCN did not refer to the word “average” with reference to the speed of 131km/h alleged. Ms O’Brien argued the FCN materially misstated the particulars of the actual speeding allegation. The judge initially entered, but later vacated, a conviction against Ms O’Brien and suggested she get legal advice. The High Court will be asked to decide on issues in the case on Thursday.

Title: $2B Lost In 90 Days: How Losses In Crypto Security Incidents In Q1 2025 Increased 96% Y/Y

Time Published: 2025-04-06T19:45:19Z

The cryptocurrency industry is no stranger to hacks and scams, but Q1 was particularly rough, and that might be putting it mildly. $2 billion. That’s how much was lost in crypto security incidents in Q1, according to a Tuesday security report from Web3 security outfit Hacken. For context, the figure represents a 96% increase over what the industry lost in Q1 2024 and is almost equivalent to the $2.25 billion lost in the whole of 2024. Don't Miss: Of the $2 billion lost in Q1, over $1.6 billion was lost to so-called access control exploits, over $300 million was lost to rug pulls, over $96 million was lost to phishing scams, and over $29 million was lost to smart contract vulnerabilities. The dominance of access control exploits is significant as a variation of it has led to the largest exploits for three consecutive quarters. Access control exploits see bad actors target the infrastructure surrounding a project, like its website front-end, to gain access and steal user funds. In the past three quarters, it has proved particularly effective in targeting Safe multi-sig crypto wallets, which are thought to provide additional security by eliminating a single point of failure. Trending: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. As highlighted by Hacken, access control exploits targeting Safe multi-sigs were behind the $235 million WazirX exploit in Q3 2024, the $55 million Radiant Capital exploit in Q4 2024, and the infamous $1.5 billion Bybit hack in Q1, the largest in the quarter by far and the largest exploit in history. According to Hacken, the trend highlighted a failure to secure the surrounding infrastructure around these multi-sigs as much as the smart contracts behind the wallet. Security practices suggested by the firm included implementing human-readable signing to allow signers to see clearly the details of the transaction they are consenting to, securing off-chain components like web interfaces, and promoting operational discipline among signers. Meanwhile, in addition to this access control exploit concern, Hacken highlighted that bad actors displayed new money laundering tricks in Q1. Trending: Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Typically, when funds are stolen in the cryptocurrency space, they are funneled through mixers to obscure their origins, but bad actors may now be turning to a very different venue: trading platforms. In this approach, bad actors open large leveraged bets with their loot while hedging against that bet elsewhere with clean capital. They then let the leveraged position get liquidated while retaining the profits from the hedged position. “By sacrificing the origin wallet and creating a loss event on-chain, the attacker distances themselves from the stolen capital while retaining its economic value,” the report wrote. See Also: Have $200K saved? Here's how to turn it into lasting wealth Another approach these malicious actors are exploring is staging sandwich attacks to reframe stolen funds as profits from DeFi arbitrage. Still, behind Q1’s alarming hack numbers and the growing sophistication in how bad actors launder their loot, the cryptocurrency industry was able to largely maintain one positive trend. Specifically, the industry did not see a significant rise in decentralized finance exploits in line with a steady decline in the previous four quarters. According to Hacken, this suggested that protocol design is maturing. Read Next: © 2025 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.

Title: Trump tariffs: Australian sharemarket to plunge after Wall Street meltdown

Treasurer Jim Chalmers has flagged the prospect of up to four cuts in interest rates this year as a result of the deepening global economic turmoil that wiped almost $100 billion off Australia’s sharemarket on Monday. Fears that US President Donald Trump’s trade war will trigger a US recession sent global markets into a meltdown on Monday, with the ASX 200 plunging 4.2 per cent, its biggest fall since the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. The Australian dollar plunged to five-year lows of less than US60¢. Repercussions from US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariff announcements spread across global markets.Credit: Bloomberg The violent moves are due to worries that Trump’s trade war will inflict a major hit on world economic activity and spark a US recession, after China retaliated to the US trade barriers and as Europe prepares to take countermeasures. The ASX 200 has now fallen more than 10 per cent since the start of this year, and the bourse has lost about $175 billion since late last week, when Trump spooked the markets with his “Liberation Day” tariff plans. The typical superannuation fund has lost about 4.5 per cent this month, SuperRatings said, and there are growing financial market bets the Reserve Bank will respond to the global turmoil by cutting interest rates next month. As experts warned of more volatility ahead, Chalmers said the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the Australian economy should be “manageable” but noted markets were now expecting about four rate cuts this year, including one cut of as much as 0.5 percentage points at the next Reserve Bank meeting, on May 20. “I don’t predict or pre-empt those decisions, but the market is certainly now expecting multiple interest rate cuts over the course of the year, beginning in May,” Chalmers said in a press conference in Sydney. Shadow treasurer Angus Taylor insisted the Coalition had a better track record on the economy, and that it was ready to manage the economy through the turmoil. “The impact of tariffs on global sharemarkets is impacting Australians’ retirement savings, it is impacting young Australians investing to save for a home deposit,” Taylor said. The market rout came as new Treasury analysis found the tariffs announced by Trump last week would permanently dent economic growth, but the bigger impact would be on the world economy. Australia’s gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for inflation, will be 0.1 per cent lower than if tariffs had not been imposed, while inflation will be 0.2 percentage points higher, Treasury said. Treasurer Jim Chalmers says the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the Australian economy should be “manageable”.Credit: Dominic Lorrimer The federal Treasury’s analysis was based on an economic model created by leading Australian economist and former Reserve Bank board member Warwick McKibbin. McKibbin said the model revealed the biggest hits by Trump’s tariffs would be on the Australian mining, energy, durable manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Demand for workers across mining by the end of next year could be almost 5 per cent lower than if the tariffs had not been put in place. Independent economist Saul Eslake said the impact on the Australian economy was likely to be worse than the Treasury forecast because the formal advice could not take into account the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s next decisions – and what he called the “madness” of the White House. “When businesses are uncertain, they put the shutters up – and they put off decisions to invest or employ,” he said. It was a sea of red on the ASX, with all sectors down sharply and shares in Australia’s biggest companies hit hard: Commonwealth Bank shares crashed 6.2 per cent and mining giant BHP plunged 6.1 per cent. Monday’s 4.2 per cent drop erased about $97 billion in value from the ASX 200. Perpetual’s head of investment strategy, Matt Sherwood, predicted more volatility ahead, saying there was no obvious “off ramp” for investors. He said it was hard for Trump to back down from the tariffs he had announced, and he believed it was also unlikely the US Federal Reserve would cut interest rates soon. “The investors are not wanting to catch the falling knife,” Sherwood said. “It’s hard to see things stabilising, at least in the near term.” Despite the pain, Allekian Family Office managing director Shant Allekian was relatively unfazed by the recent market downturn, saying he views it as an opportunity to buy stocks at low valuations. “This is opportunity first and foremost, and these types of opportunities only present themselves every handful of years. I bought a lot of things on market open today,” he said. “Sure, it can be shocking to see these big headline market drops, but it’s important to put things into perspective and understand that longer-term things will revert to the mean, just like we saw during COVID and the GFC [global financial crisis].” He said anyone with investments or superannuation who might be panicking after today’s downturn should think about why they’re investing, and unless they have a fixed time frame, just ride it out. “This is where a lot of people can panic and get very nervous and think the whole world is falling apart. But we get these episodes regularly. This isn’t rare, and throughout all of these periods of volatility, the markets come through the other side at some point,” he said. Shant Allekian sees the market rout as a buying opportunity.Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui AMP chief economist Shane Oliver said that while he did not think Australia was at risk of recession – which is generally defined as two quarters in a row of negative economic growth – he estimated the US faced a 45 per cent chance of recession, and this was the key concern for markets. “History tells us that if you have a recession in the US, then you could have a deeper, longer bear market in shares. If you avoid recession, it could be a shorter bear market or just a correction,” Oliver said. Wall Street’s S&P 500 plunged 6 per cent on Friday in New York after China announced its response to Trump’s reciprocal tariffs of 34 per cent on Chinese imports. But another reason for the wild swings on markets is investor uncertainty over whether Trump will implement all the tariffs he announced last week, or whether he could back down in the face of the sharemarket plunge. Montgomery Investment Management chairman Roger Montgomery said it was difficult to see a rebound from the plunge while investors remained uncertain about whether Trump’s tariffs were set in stone or more of a negotiating tactic. “While there’s uncertainty about that, it’s very difficult to imagine any investors building a case that says it’s safe to go back in now,” he said. The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed chair Jerome Powell said on Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself because it can drive a vicious cycle of behaviour that only worsens inflation. US households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. With Shane Wright, David Crowe and AP The Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day’s trading.

WELCOME TO HOW I Spend My Money, a series on The Journal that looks at how people in Ireland really handle their finances. We’re asking readers to keep a record of how much they earn, what they save if anything, and what they’re spending their money on over the course of one week. Are you a spender, a saver or a splurger? We’re looking for readers who will keep a money diary for a week. If you’re interested send a mail to money@thejournal.ie. We would love to hear from you. Each money diary is submitted by readers just like you. When reading and commenting, bear in mind that their situation will not be relatable for everyone, it is simply an account of a week in their shoes, so let’s be kind. Last time around, we heard from a lab specialist on €70K living in Dublin. This week, an audit associate on €31K living in Dublin. I graduated from UCC last year and I’m currently in my first year of a graduate programme at a ‘Big Four’ accountancy firm in audit. I’m 24 and living in a house share in the south Dublin area, sharing with four others. I went travelling last year around Asia for a few months as I knew what I was signing myself up for. On normal weeks, I work 37-40 hours per week, however, for anyone familiar with accountancy and audit, they’ll know the horror stories of the busy season. From January to March, I work anywhere from 55 to 80 hours, which are unfortunately unpaid. As if that’s not enough, as part of my contract, I must complete the ACA exams (the Chartered Accountant qualification) which take three years. Lectures and tutorials take up to seven hours per week and then I must study. My first round of exams are in May. Luckily, my studies and exams are paid for by my employer and each round of exams passed we get a bonus and marginal salary increase (around €2,000 increase if I pass these first exams). I have April and May off work as I will be on paid study leave before the exams. I save on the Revolut app, earning 2.5% AER (which typically earns me €10 per month after deducting Deposit Interest Retention Tax (DIRT)). Occupation: Audit associate (graduate programme) Age: 24 Location: Dublin Salary: €31,500, with an additional €900 gross for passing exams in May Monthly pay (net): €2,369 Extra income: €90-120 per month for walking my neighbour’s dog. €10-11 per month interest income after deducting DIRT from my Revolut savings (earning 2.5% AER) Rent: €850 (bills included) Groceries: My parents kindly give me a €150 Dunnes voucher every month Petrol: €65 – €75 – I’m not from Dublin and I travel home once a month to see family and friends. Unfortunately, due to my busy schedule, that’s all I can do as I don’t get any study done at home. Whilst in Dublin, I use public transport the vast majority of times, or walk Leap card: €20 Social: €50 Gym membership: €129 Car insurance and AA breakdown assistance: €56 Google and Apple storage: €5 Revolut Metal: €16 Spotify: €12 Vodafone: €20 HP ink: €3 Advertisement Coffee: €45 Long-term prescription: €40 Nails: €45-60 Health insurance: My employer pays half, and I pay €65 per month Savings: Typically €780-€950 per month Car tax: €76 every three months Hair: €230 every four months New running shoes: €170-€220 every four months Clothes: Approx €200 every three months – I don’t buy from Penneys, I prefer to get better quality pieces either new (if I want to treat myself) or I use vinted where I often find brand new items for less than half the price. *** 5:30 am: I wake up and prepare for the gym and work. I drink half of my protein shake to energise myself. My lunch for work is prepped. I tiptoe around the house to avoid waking my housemates. 6:00 am: I walk to the gym for my 6:30 am class. Although my gym is expensive, I certainly get my money’s worth as it is all class-based, and the facilities are top-notch, including Dyson hairdryers, hair straighteners, quality shampoo and conditioner, and excellent instructors. 7:45 am: I freshen up after my class, put on my skirt and blazer, and straighten my hair. My gym is near the green line Luas, so I top up my Leap card on the way (€5). 8:25 am: I arrive at work and grab a barista coffee (free) in the canteen. As I sip my morning coffee, the looming audit deadline begins to weigh on my mind, I certainly start to feel stressed and like an imposter! 1:00 pm: I enjoy my chicken salad sandwich and yoghurt during my break. Afterward, my friends and I take a refreshing 20 min walk around Grand Canal Dock before returning to the office at 2pm. 5:30 pm: After finishing work, I opt for a leisurely walk to St Stephen’s Green before catching the Luas home. 7:30 pm: I arrive home and make a vegetable stir fry for dinner. Before I know it, it’s 9:30pm thanks to doomscrolling on TikTok, and I reluctantly pack my bag for work tomorrow. 10:00 pm: I head to bed. Today’s total: €5.00 5:00 am: My alarm goes off a bit earlier today as I plan to go for a run before work. Having recently recovered from a stress fracture injury, I am gradually easing back into my running routine. I fuel up with a slice of toast and a glass of water. With a reluctant yawn, I put on my shorts and running shoes and head out for a 10 km run. 6:30 am: I get home, take a shower, and get ready for work. 8:30 am: After taking the Luas, I arrive at work and enjoy a complimentary coffee and pastry. My day is filled with a busy schedule, juggling endless work tasks while also preparing for my upcoming ACA exams. 1.00 pm: I glance at my watch, which signals it’s time for a much-needed break. I enjoy a prepped pesto pasta and crackers with hummus. It’s a sunny day in Dublin, which helps freshen my mind. My colleagues and I go for a brisk walk, savouring the fresh air. 7:30 pm: I finally arrive home after 10 hours in the office. I was supposed to have an online lecture at 6 pm, but work commitments decided otherwise. I make my dinner, pop on a face mask and change my bed sheets before bed at 10 pm. Today’s total: €0.00 5:30 am: My alarm rings, signalling the start of my day. Since I am working from home today, there’s no need to commute to the office, but I still have a gym class to attend. 6:00 am: I head out for my 6:30 am class. I usually attend HIIT classes, which I find provide me with a great boost for the day ahead. 8:30 am: I set up my workstation and get started on audit workpapers, client meetings, and internal catch-up meetings. 1:00 pm: I decide to take a walk to Hatch coffee in Blackrock and get a latte (€4.10), arguably the best coffee spot in Dublin! Related Reads Money Diaries: A laboratory specialist on €70K living in Dublin Money Diaries: An interior designer on €45K living in Leinster Money Diaries: A software consultant on €76K living in Co Kildare 5:30 pm: I finish work on-time which is great. I walk our neighbour’s dog for an hour – I started doing this since Christmas as the owner is elderly and I typically do it twice a week and charge €15. Today’s total: €4.10 5:00 am: My alarm gets me up as usual. I get ready and head to my 6:30 am gym class. 8:30 am: I arrive at work. 12:00 pm: Coffee, work, meetings, repeat. 5:30 pm: This evening after work all of us associates on my team are heading out for some drinks at a nearby bar. Why are Thursday evenings so busy!? We were like sardines in the bar. We are allowed to expense two drinks per person and so I only pay for one drink (€11.40). 10:00 pm: I get the bus home using my Leap card. Today’s total: €11.40 8:00 am: I am working from home again today, so my alarm goes off a bit later. It feels like a nice welcome to the weekend ahead. I grab a bite to eat before setting up my desk, untangling many cables and turning on my monitors. 1:00 pm: I head for a much-needed coffee at Bear Market (€4.20) and make my own lunch when I get back. 6:30 pm: I head to an evening gym class. My gym is near a Dunnes, and so after my class I head in and get my weekly groceries. It comes to €41, but I use my voucher from my parents, which allows me to save a bit more each month. Today’s total: €4.20 8:00 am: I decide to head out for a run; it’s great to be injury-free once again. I was truly going insane not being able to get my movement in for those three long months. I treat myself to a coffee and almond croissant afterward in the newly opened Bread41 in Stillorgan (€8.10) before heading home for a study day. 10:00 am: I have upcoming exams in less than six weeks, so today is dedicated to studying and trying to catch up on lectures and tutorials. These exams will be tough, and we have the fear of being fired if we fail them. 4:00 pm: I completed three lectures from 12 pm until now. Time for a break. I have a chicken salad with couscous and brown bread. 6:00 pm: Back to the grind. More studying and practicing exam questions. The ACA exams are demanding, but I am motivated and have a study plan in place to help me (hopefully…) succeed. Once fully qualified, the average Chartered Accountant in Dublin is on a salary of €101,000 per annum, which is a huge motivating factor given that I’m only on €31,500 at the moment. 10:00 pm: That was a long day. I wind down from studying by watching some TV, grab a shower, and head to bed. Today’s total: €8.10 8:00 am: I wake up to a later alarm and get ready for the day. I have an in-person lecture at 12 pm this afternoon, so I decide to walk into town instead of getting the bus as I am not going to the gym today. I was tempted to go for a run, but decided against it as trying to avoid my injury from returning. 10:00 am: I meet my friend before my lecture, and we get a coffee (€4.30). 2:00 pm: We have a break, where they provide a free lunch consisting of sandwiches and finger food. 4:00 pm: Once the lecture finishes, I get the Luas back home. 5:30 pm: I arrive home and make a big dinner so that I can bring leftovers to work tomorrow. 7:00 pm: I walk my neighbour’s dog this evening and earn €15. 9:00 pm: Doomscrolling on TikTok once again, head to bed at 10:30 pm and set my alarm for another week of work and study. Today’s total: €4.30 *** What I learned - Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Sunday Summary: The Manhattan Office Market’s Return to Form

Time Published: 2025-04-06T13:00:19Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy After some fits and spurts, it appears Manhattan’s office market might have finally recovered, five years after COVID-19. Things looked promising last year, when office leasing hit a full-year volume of 33.3 million square feet after dropping roughly 50 percent in 2020 to 19 million square feet, and it seems the good times kept on rolling. Leasing reached 11.4 million square feet in the first quarter of 2025, the fourth consecutive increase in quarterly demand and the borough’s strongest three-month volume since the 13.2 million square feet leased in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to a Colliers (CIGI) report. And a look at the top leases of the quarter is also something worth spending your Sunday celebrating as none came in below 300,000 square feet, with Jane Street’s nearly 1 million-square-foot expansion and renewal at Brookfield (BN)’s 250 Vesey Street leading the pack followed by the United Nations’ 425,190-square-foot renewal at 2 United Nations Plaza. There were several other deals signed last quarter worth highlighting, including Universal Music Group’s rumored 336,000-square-foot lease at Penn 2 crossing the finish line and law firm Kirkland & Ellis expanding its New York City presence by leasing 131,000 square feet at 900 Third Avenue for a new office. Speaking of rumored deals getting finalized, Goodwin Procter secured 250,000 square feet at 200 Fifth Avenue, a deal that Commercial Observer reported the law firm was in negotiations for weeks ago. And it seems like this activity won’t be limited to just the first quarter. The New York Post reported that several large tenants are currently looking to secure spaces of 350,000 square feet and above, while CO had the scoop that Apollo Global Management (APO) is in talks to take just under 100,000 square feet at 9 West 57th Street. Everything’s coming up real estate But the gangbusters leasing activity isn’t the only thing to give real estate cause for celebration. There are also bidding wars and big dollars for space, with Ralph Lauren and LVMH duking it out to either buy or sign a high-priced lease for the ground-floor storefront at 109 Prince Street; PGIM Real Estate closing on a massive $3 billion capital fund for data center projects; Burlington dropping more than $257 million to acquire an Inland Empire warehouse from BlackRock; and PMG landing $215 million to build the 38 West Eleventh Residences near Downtown Miami. Yet, nobody might be having a better week than New York Mayor Eric Adams, and that might play in real estate’s favor as well. Adams had his federal corruption charges dropped by a judge — who also removed the ability to bring them back to life in the future — leading Hizzoner swiftly afterward to announce he had switched party affiliations and would run for re-election as an independent in the November general election. That move could clear the field for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to clinch the Democratic primary race in June and set up an Adams vs. Cuomo general election. Despite the two candidates having considerable baggage, it could be a win-win scenario for real estate. Both have long been friends to the industry (and Cuomo has recently doubled down on that by apologizing to the Real Estate Board of New York for passing the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019) and it could knock from contention more progressive candidates like Zohran Mamdani, who has vowed to freeze rents on rent-stabilized apartments. Now to harsh your mellow, but … Unfortunately, it wasn’t all good news this week. Some more buildings faced distress. Rialto Capital hit Thor Equities and Premiere Equities with a foreclosure at their 25-27 Mercer Street retail condo after they defaulted on a $10 million loan. Special servicer CW Asset Management filed a pre-foreclosure on Metro Loft Management’s 180 Water Street after it defaulted on a $265 million commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. (Metro Loft’s Nathan Berman told CO it will avoid foreclosure by settling its debts.) Meanwhile, that $401 million deal former boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. reportedly made to acquire more than 1,000 units in Upper Manhattan might not be the knockout it seems, with public records not showing those properties changing hands and reports saying that Mayweather bought only a small stake in the portfolio. Over on the West Coast, Los Angeles’ controversial “mansion tax” — which slaps a levy on high-dollar sales of most property types in the city — has led to an up to 50 percent drop in transactions above $5 million since it went into effect two years ago and created only about $632.6 million in revenue for the city, according to a study by the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies. Also, the Los Angeles office market has reached its post-pandemic bottom and is expected to stay there for a while, with the city recording 3.4 million square feet of leases in the first quarter, a drop from the previous quarter, according to a Savills report. And, while the moves in the New York City political scene could be a boon to real estate, the same might not be said about what’s happening in the White House. President Donald Trump’s efforts to deport undocumented immigrants, an important source of labor for the construction industry, coupled with historically high inflation, have made it even harder to fill construction jobs. A 2024 study found that 92 percent of construction firms with open salaried positions are having trouble filling those roles. “One thing that over the last 10 years that actually kept the construction workforce afloat was the increased migration that we had into the U.S.,” Gregory Kraut, co-founder and CEO of owner KPG Funds, told CO. “In one day, we had about 20 percent of our workforce disappear because of Trump’s immigration stance. There’s a whole underbelly of construction that relies on those people.” And the construction industry was dealt another blow with Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement, which would implement a 10 percent tariff on all imports to the United States, along with steeper tariffs on other countries, including China and those in the European Union. “When the tariffs took effect last month, glass prices went up 10 percent,” Eli Moyal, founder of design-build company Chapter, told CO. “Now, with the new tariffs … we could see up to a 30 percent increase in glass prices.” Those tariffs and the crackdown on immigration have had another effect: stopping many international tourists from wanting to visit the United States. That could have a significant impact on hotel and hospitality in New York City, the nation’s top urban tourist destination. “It’s not good, obviously,” Vijay Dandapani, president and CEO of the Hotel Association of New York City, told CO. “As yet, we in New York City haven’t felt it in any significant way. Nothing material yet.” Farewell, Women’s History Month Last week saw the end of Women’s History Month, and CO marked the occasion by talking to some important women in the industry. We sat down with Melissa Román Burch, the Forest City Ratner and Lendlease alum who is now chief operating officer for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, to talk about the Brooklyn Army Terminal and MADE Bush Terminal projects; dived into the careers of Lorie Hanson, Pharrah Jackson and Pamela LeVault, top professionals at lender Greystone; and looked at how brokerage Platinum Properties — led by Dezireh Eyn and Teresa Stephenson — has been moving beyond their Financial District roots to find success in other locales like North Brooklyn.

Title: AIL round-up: Clontarf finish regular season in top spot after win over St Mary’s

Clontarf finished the Energia All-Ireland League regular season on top of Division 1A by overtaking St Mary’s with a 47-19 win over the latter at Castle Avenue to secure a home semi-final in a fortnight’s time. The visitors, already assured of a home semi-final, fielded a somewhat weakened side to allow key players a respite. Leading 19-14 at half-time, Clontarf pulled clear with four second-half tries and will now host Lansdowne on April 19th, while St Mary’s will welcome the champions Cork Constitution to Templeville Road. Con completed their regular season campaign by sharing 14 tries with Terenure in an entertaining 47-45 win at Temple Hill in a repeat of last year’s final. Centre Ethan Reilly scored four tries for a Terenure side which was playing its first dead rubber in four seasons, in what was also Seán Skehan’s final game as head coach after the most successful era in the club’s history to date. Lansdowne warmed up for the playoffs by dipping deep into their squad for a 26-13 home win over relegated Garryowen, and their only defeat in their last nine games was a 49-46 loss at Castle Avenue to the last kick of the game. A UCD side featuring eight players on Leinster’s books, including four who played in the province’s win over the Sharks in Durban a week previously, preserved their 1A status with a 40-10 win at Young Munster. They were also indebted to City of Armagh’s somewhat surprising 29-24 loss at home to Ballynahinch. City of Armagh now host UCC in next week’s 1A/1B promotion/relegation semi-finals after the students climbed above Old Wesley with a 38-5 win over 1B champions Old Belvedere. Old Wesley missed out after a 40-28 defeat to Blackrock, who next week visit Nenagh Ormond in the other semi-final. Shannon suffered back-to-back relegations despite a 66-12 win at home to Queen’s, while Highfield avoided a relegation playoff with a 43-42 bonus-point win at Naas, while Trinity were restricted to two tries in their 20-7 win at home to Nenagh. Trinity will now host Greystones in the 1B/2A semi-finals after the latter edged out Corinthians on points difference (+169 to +159) thanks to a 15-13 win in Navan, while the Galway club were frustratingly one try short of a bonus point in their 19-12 win at home to Ballymena. Cashel will host Barnhall in the other semi-final. Navan will host Galwegians in the 2A/2B semi-finals after the latter overtook UL Bohemians on the final day thanks to a 39-7 win in Skerries and Sligo’s 12-8 win over the Limerick club. Sligo thus finished above Skerries in the relegation playoff spot on points difference. Dungannon host Clogher Valley in the other semi-final. Enniscorthy pipped Midleton to the Division 2C title with a 29-26 win away to Belfast Harlequins, while the Cork side were losing 26-24 away to Monkstown. Midleton must now refocus in hosting Dolphin in the 2B/2C playoffs, while Skerries host Ballyclare in the other semi-final.

Title: What To Expect in the Markets This Week

March inflation data and Big Bank earnings are among the major items on this week’s economic calendar as investors look for signals about what's next for markets following a chaotic end to last week. Friday ended a two-day run that will end up in the history books, the major US indexes logging their biggest weekly declines since the start of the Covid pandemic. Investors are now seeking clues for what might be next on prices and economic health following President Donald Trump's tariff announcement, which is expected to take effect Wednesday. China announced 34% retaliatory tariffs that are scheduled to begin on Thursday. Investopedia's live coverage of Monday's trading can be read here. What else is on tap? Friday earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and BlackRock (BLK) are among the financial institutions on the calendar. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and CarMax (KMX) also are scheduled to deliver earnings earlier in the week. Federal Reserve meeting minutes are expected to provide insight into economic conditions and the path of interest rates. Data on consumer sentiment and credit levels will be closely watched amid uncertainty over inflation and tariffs. Monday, April 7 Tuesday, April 8 Wednesday, April 9 Thursday, April 10 Friday, April 11 March inflation data will be in the spotlight as market participants keep an eye on prices in the wake of President Trump’s sprawling tariffs, which are expected to take effect on Wednesday, reigniting recession fears. Economists at Wells Fargo expected the Consumer Price Index to remain unchanged in March, with that data’s scheduled release for Thursday. The sideways movement comes as inflation has edged lower recently, including a steeper-than-expected decrease in February’s CPI reading. Inflation has been a key reason cited by Federal Reserve officials for keeping interest rates at their current levels. Wednesday’s scheduled release of the minutes from the Fed’s most recent March meeting will provide more insight into how current economic conditions are affecting the way that central bankers view interest rate levels. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and New York Fed President John Williams are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, the Producer Price Index (PPI) for March will give investors more information about prices at the wholesale level, potentially feeding into consumer prices down the line. Investors are also expecting data on wholesale inventory levels on Wednesday. Another key inflation measurement will come in Friday’s scheduled release of consumer sentiment data, which will include consumer price expectations that can have an influence on the direction of inflation. Consumer and business sentiment has also been closely watched after Trump’s tariffs policy has raised worries over price increases and worsening economic conditions. Small business sentiment is expected to come on Tuesday as recent surveys have shown that business owners are also starting to sour on the economy. Big Banks will lead off the latest earnings season with a slew of scheduled reports later this week, giving investors their first look at first-quarter earnings. Analysts will be watching to see if banks can continue to drive growth in areas like investment banking and net interest income. JPMorgan Chase is expected to kick off a string of reports from financial firms with its earnings report Friday, coming after the world’s largest bank by market capitalization delivered a surprising jump in profits last quarter. JPMorgan grew its investment banking revenue while its net interest income also increased. BlackRock’s announcement scheduled the same day comes after the firm posted a record quarter for assets under management. Investors likely will be listening for updates on Blackrock’s $30 billion AI infrastructure funding project with Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Elon Musk’s xAI and other firms. Wells Fargo’s scheduled Friday report comes as its net income topped analyst estimates but the bank just missed its revenue target last quarter. Before Friday’s financial services reports, Delta Air Lines’ scheduled report on Wednesday comes as the carrier has lowered its projections for the quarter on weakening travel demand amid economic uncertainty. The lowered outlook came after Delta reported a profitable prior quarter on stronger sales of premium offerings. Levi Strauss has also warned that macroeconomic conditions could hurt its 2025 sales, with the jeans makers’ quarterly report scheduled for Monday. Egg seller Cal-Maine’s scheduled report on Tuesday comes amid interest in prices for that food stock, becoming a symbol in the battle against inflation and a political talking point. But Cal-Maine has benefited from increased demand for eggs amid a bird flu outbreak, posting better-than-expected results in the previous quarter due in part to higher egg prices. Other noteworthy reports this week include Rust-Oleum maker RPM International on Tuesday, Corona beer brewer Constellation Brands on Wednesday, and online car seller CarMax on Thursday.

Title: No match for Marty Morrissey when it comes to RTÉ moonlighters

When RTÉ began compiling a quarterly register of external activities documenting requests by staff to engage in side hustles, it was assumed the most eager moonlighters would be young influencers with large Instagram followings. On the contrary, it turns out there’s no party like a Marty party when it comes to sideline gigs. The list of staff who requested permission from RTÉ for an outside event during the second and third quarters of last year, released under freedom of information legislation, shows Marty Morrissey is the undisputed king of the liggers. Despite not being a client of agent to the stars Noel Kelly, Morrissey requested permission for five external activities in the second quarter of last year and 22 in the third quarter. RTÉ will not disclose how much staff are paid for their sidelines and will not say whether they were granted or refused permission. Many will presumably be unpaid, including those for charitable causes. Marty’s gigs included emceeing the Repak Environmental Awards in the Shelbourne Hotel and the Supervalu Tidy Town Awards in Croke Park, along with interviewing the cast of Riverdance about their careers. The list for the fourth quarter will presumably include what sounds like his most lucrative outside gig: fronting the Marty Party holiday package in the Costa del Sol last October where holidaymakers were entertained by the likes of Tommy Fleming and Sharon Shannon. Where does he get time for the day job? Not that Morrissey, who had to return his free Renault last year after the Ryan Tubridy payments scandal, was the only sports presenter juggling jobs last year. [ Marty Morrissey: ‘I’m an only child of an only-child dad and an only-child mum. I’ve no aunts, uncles or first cousins’Opens in new window ] The second and third most requests came from the sport department, with presenter Darragh Maloney seeking permission for 17 outside gigs during the two quarters and fellow broadcaster Jacqui Hurley seeking 15, including presumably hard-hitting interviews with retired rugby star Brian O’Driscoll about his Land Rover Defender and Q&As with rugby player James Ryan and jockey Rachel Blackmore on behalf of Volvo. Michael O’Leary is estimated to be worth about €900 million, mostly down to his stake in Ryanair. But he also has an expanding property portfolio with his 2,000-plus acres in Co Westmeath leading to the nickname “The Mullingar Magnier” after the Coolmore Stud boss, who is estimated to own more than 10,000 acres in Co Tipperary. In Dublin, O’Leary owns several period piles which he lets out, including houses on Raglan Road and Clyde Road in Dublin 4. When it comes to pursuing his rent, he’s not shy of a trip to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB), the arbiter of landlord-tenant disputes, even if it’s over only €754. Last week the RTB published a judgment following a case taken by Bradley Investments, O’Leary’s investment vehicle, against a couple who underpaid their €2,260 monthly rent at a property his company owns in Blackrock, Dublin by about €754 one month. The couple said they had cut the rent for one month because they had been forced to move out while the house was painted, which took 10 days. They say they initially objected to the house being painted, arguing it would be “too disruptive”. When O’Leary’s company suggested a reduction in their rent for the month of the painting, they said this was “an insult” as it did not include any compensation. However, when Bradley Investments insisted it needed to paint the place, they moved out for 10 days and reduced the amount they paid. At the RTB O’Leary’s representative argued the tenants had rejected the suggestion that a portion of the rent would be waived, adding there was no proof they moved out for the 10-day period and should have paid their rent in full. However, the RTB found in favour of the tenants, ruling O’Leary’s representatives did not have “carte blanche” to carry out painting or repairs at the expense of the tenants’ right to “peaceful occupation”. Perhaps the reason O’Leary was so keen to keep up the house’s appearance was because of a former resident – it’s where his wife Anita Farrell lived before marrying the Mullingar man. Speaking of Coolmore Stud, the latest addition to the board of Horse Racing Ireland is Anne-Marie O’Brien, the wife of Aidan, the trainer at John Magnier’s Ballydoyle Stables. A trainer in her own right, she grew up in the business – her father Joe Crowley was previously Coolmore’s head trainer. She was nominated courtesy of the Irish Racehorse Trainers Association and appointed by Minister for Agriculture Martin Heydon, himself from good bloodstock country in Kilcullen, Co Kildare. Hot on the heels of Wanderers FC, Ireland’s second oldest rugby club, getting planning permission for a tricky conversion to their clubhouse on Merrion Road, Old Belvedere has lobbed in an application to expand its own base on Anglesea Road with a larger bar and, of course, three padel courts. The decision to add the padel courts was endorsed by members in a recent egm, with 97 per cent voting for the game that seems to be smashing squash and tennis in the popularity stakes. We can guess which way neighbour Dermot Desmond, an honorary life member of the club and devotee of padel, voted. Rogue lawyer Michael Lynn has obviously been keeping busy in prison reading journalist Michael O’Farrell’s book about him. Fugitive: The Michael Lynn Story was published a year ago by Merrion Press and Irish Academic Press. But it was only last week that Lynn, represented by John P O’Donohoe solicitors in Waterford, filed a High Court defamation action against O’Farrell and the book’s publishers. Perhaps he discovered it in the prison library. Mediahuis boss Peter Vandermeersch has been living in Ireland since taking over as publisher of the Independent stable of newspapers in 2019. Now he is turning his journalist’s eye on the “history, culture and paradoxes” of Ireland in a new book aimed at the Dutch market. Described as “not a classic travel guide”, it is instead “a quest for the soul of Éire”. [ ‘Talbot Street is known as Tablet Street now’: Will a €2m makeover be enough to turn things around?Opens in new window ] We wonder if he’ll mention Talbot Street, his favourite Dublin street and the location of Mediahuis HQ. In a blog post five years ago, he rhapsodised about the cosmopolitan stretch where you will find the most “junkies, nutters and crackpots” in the capital. And no, he wasn’t talking about his colleagues. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Donald Trump delays TikTok ban, but will it remain available in the U.S. in June? The truth behind the decision
URL: https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/2025/04/06/67f1a919ca474166468b457b.html

Editions: En/lifestyle/us-news People have been expecting news on this matter President Donald Trump announced on Friday that his administration will delay the enforcement of a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations. The move extends the deadline by 75 days, pushing it to June 18, as discussions continue to determine TikTok's future in the United States. The law, passed in 2024 with bipartisan support, mandates ByteDance to sell TikTok to non-Chinese owners or face a nationwide ban. Lawmakers and national security experts have raised concerns over TikTok's data collection practices and ties to the Chinese government, citing the app as a potential risk. ByteDance has pushed back, emphasizing that 60% of its ownership lies with global institutional investors, 20% with its Chinese founders, and the remaining 20% with employees, including those in the U.S. In his post on Truth Social, Trump expressed optimism about progress made toward securing an agreement that would ensure TikTok's continued operation in the U.S. "My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump wrote. "We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal." ByteDance confirmed that negotiations with U.S. officials are ongoing but noted that any deal would require approval under Chinese law. A key sticking point remains TikTok's content-recommendation algorithm, which the U.S. law bars from being controlled by ByteDance but is critical to the app's functionality. China has opposed any sale involving the algorithm, further complicating negotiations. Reports suggest that an agreement to spin off TikTok's U.S. operations into a new company, majority-owned by American investors such as Oracle or Blackrock, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake, was close to being finalized earlier this week. However, the deal hit a roadblock after Trump announced steep tariffs on Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to withhold approval. The tariffs have also spurred financial market volatility, further raising the stakes for the administration. As the June deadline approaches, TikTok's future remains uncertain. The app briefly shut down in January following legal challenges but resumed operations after assurances from Trump that the ban would not be enforced while negotiations continued. ByteDance has described its discussions with the U.S. government as "constructive" but acknowledged unresolved issues. Potential investors such as Oracle, which already hosts TikTok's U.S. user data, and Amazon have reportedly expressed interest in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations. With multiple parties involved and diplomatic tensions high, the coming weeks will be critical in determining whether TikTok avoids a ban and secures a path forward in the American market. Trump's decision to delay enforcement reflects the broader complexities of U.S.-China relations, blending national security concerns with economic and political challenges. As the June 18 deadline looms, all eyes will be on Washington and Beijing as they seek a resolution to one of the most contentious tech disputes in recent history. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

Title: If Bitcoin Holds This Level Between Now And April 15, Arthur Hayes Says 'We Are Out Of The Woods'

After days of anxious waiting, President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” came and went. As anticipated, equity and cryptocurrency markets did not like the idea of fresh and broad tariffs. A broad market sell-off ensued in after-hours trading as the president read off his chart outlining “reciprocal tariffs” on almost every country in the world, including uninhabited islands. Bitcoin, in particular, dropped 5% from $88,500 to just over $82,000 and continues to trade near these lows, eroding earlier market optimism. Amid the rout, one prominent analyst has pointed to a key level to watch. Don't Miss: According to BitMEX founder and Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes, the $76,500 price point is the level to watch for Bitcoin. “if BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods,” he wrote in a Wednesday X post following Trump’s tariff announcements. Mrkt no likey "Liberation Day", if $BTC can hold $76.5k btw now and US tax day Apr 15, then we are out of the woods. Don't get chopped up! The price level aligns with the three-month price low Bitcoin hit on March 11. On March 20, Hayes speculated that the level was the line in the sand for the asset, suggesting that the worst of the recent correction is over and that it is unlikely the asset will break below the level before making a run for new highs. Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? For confirmation of Hayes’ analysis, bulls will want to see a strong bounce from that level should Bitcoin retest it. The analyst’s view comes as he continues to maintain that the leading digital asset is on course to more than double in price this year. Specifically, Hayes maintains that Bitcoin can still hit $250,000 by the end of the year. This prediction is based on the belief that the Federal Reserve will have no choice but to pivot from quantitative tightening to quantitative easing due to political pressure as Trump seeks to reduce the U.S.’s trade deficit from 7% to 3% by 2028. In this scenario, the liquidity created is expected to boost risk markets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. In the analyst’s telling, this pivot may have already started following remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell in March. He announced a slowdown of the central bank's quantitative tightening efforts that kicked off Tuesday while stating that he now expected tariff inflation to be “transitory.” See Also: BlackRock is calling 2025 the year of alternative assets. One firm from NYC has quietly built a group of 60,000+ investors who have all joined in on an alt asset class previously exclusive to billionaires like Bezos and Gates. With the move to slow down quantitative tightening, Hayes argued that the apex bank was already on course to create an extra $240 billion in liquidity. “If my analysis of the Fed’s major pivot from QT to QE for treasuries is correct, then Bitcoin hit a local low of $76,500 last month, and now we begin the ascent to $250,000 by year-end,” he submitted in an essay released on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Hayes’ expectation of greater market liquidity is not limited to the U.S. The analyst also expects China and Europe to join in the money printing—the former to defend the dollar-yuan exchange rate, the latter to build armies as the U.S. under Trump looks set to step back from guaranteeing its protection. Nonetheless, at the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to fall, trading below $82,000 in an over 5% decline over the past 24 hours. Read Next: © 2025 Benzinga.com.

Title: These 2 Indicators Are Tricking Investors And Costing Them A Fortune

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Shocked upset elderly couple getting bad news, finding fraud, money stealing, loss, overspending, ... More financial problem, holding calculator, using laptop, staring at monitor Most indicators are misleading investors right now, with some looking rosy and others seemingly saying it’s time to panic. So today we’re going to parse through the noise and look at what’s really going on under the hood of the US economy. Then I’m going to give you our latest “CEF Insider intel” on what to do with stocks—and funds (specifically closed-end funds) that hold them. We’re also going to dig into one bond fund yielding an outsized 13% that’s set to benefit as uncertainty grows. Consider the CNN Fear & Greed index, a closely watched sentiment indicator. As I write this, it’s showing a five-alarm fire. Fear & Greed Index Meantime, let’s look at the VIX, the market’s so-called “fear gauge.” You’d think that with the S&P 500 just closing out its worst quarter since 2022, the VIX would be spiking. Instead, crickets. VIX Quiet The VIX, which measures stock volatility, is at 22.3 as I write this—somewhat high territory compared to the last decade, but still pretty low in light of the worry the market has experienced going into April 2 tariff announcements. But in really moody times, this indicator rises to over 25, which it did several times in—you guessed it—2022. I’m guessing that if you’re reading this, you may also be thinking of 2022 right now, since that year also saw fears of inflation and a stagnant economy that caused markets to sell off. So today we’re going to drill into that and look at two reasons why, no, 2025 is not 2022 all over again. We’ll do it by looking at both inflation and stagnation to see if, in fact, either (or both!) are reasons for investors to worry. (Sneak preview: The answer is no—but we do need to be more selective and look at areas beyond stocks, like corporate bonds, including the bond fund we’ll talk about below.) I dislike pointing this out, because I almost always get comments from readers who (rightly!) tell me that prices keep going up in supermarkets and elsewhere. But, well … Inflation, on a year-over-year basis, remains below 3%, according to the consumer price index (CPI). That’s far from the alarming levels we saw in 2022. To be sure, prices are still going up: And as upsetting as that’s been for consumers, the important point for the stock market is the question of how much. We can consider the current rise of 3% year-over-year to be a safe zone. And if you look at the right side of the chart above, you can see that since inflation fell off a cliff in early 2023, it has been slowly (but inconsistently) creeping closer to 2%. The verdict here is clear: Inflation is not trending back to the eye-watering levels we saw in 2022. Yes, we do need to keep an eye on this, but it isn’t reason to panic. But what about the economy as a whole? Earnings Growth Paths BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li pointed to this chart recently when she said in a recent LinkedIn post that corporate earnings are rising “still above the historical trend of 6% to 7%.” In other words, companies are not only growing profits, but they are doing so at a stronger rate than they tend to, on average. It’s also worth noting that the S&P 500 saw earnings rise 17.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2021, when companies were comparing themselves against the economic shutdowns of 2020. That gives them some additional resilience in the face of tariffs and other unpredictable changes. Investors are totally ignoring that earnings number, as well as the fact that 77% of S&P 500 companies exceeded EPS estimates when they reported earnings in the last quarter. That earnings growth is accompanied by 4.2% revenue growth at the start of 2025 and 2.8% spending growth by consumers after we take inflation into account. I know this is a lot to take in, but the takeaway is that the average American is spending more not just because prices are going up, but because they’re buying more goods and services. Companies, in turn, are taking in more revenue and expanding profit margins. And they’re making their operations more efficient, in turn causing their earnings to rise, too. All of this is good news for investors. So the recent market price decline is a buying opportunity. My beat, of course, is CEFs—often-ignored funds that yield around 8% on average. So let me talk about what all this means for our CEF strategy. The short answer is that we need to be very selective in this environment—and target other corners of the CEF market beyond those funds that hold stocks. In 2025, we’ve seen CEFs hold their own for the most part, with average discounts to net asset value (NAV) for all CEFs around 5%, with stock funds at 6.2%. That might sound generous, but discounts were more like 8.5% in 2022, so this tells us there are fewer CEFs that are generously discounted. This is why we’ve been holding off on adding more equity CEFs to our portfolio this year, choosing to focus instead on corporate-bond CEFs. As I write this, we have just two tickers in our equity-CEF bucket. And we continue to like bond funds—especially those whose managers have been able to buy higher-yielding bonds with long durations. Those bonds are especially well-positioned as interest rates fall (something I see happening as the economy slows, which I expect as we move into the second half of 2025). Case in point: the Nuveen Core Plus Impact Fund (NPCT), a 13%-yielder trading at a 7% discount to NAV today. As I write this, it holds 132 bonds with an average leverage-adjusted effective duration (which measures how much a bond is likely to go up or down in value in relation to interest rates) of 8.7 years. That means NPCT will be able to bring in its bonds’ income streams for nearly a decade. And those bonds’ value will only increase as rates decline. The fact that we can pick this one up at a 7% discount to the value of the bonds it holds is a nice bonus and suggests more price upside ahead.

More and crypto summit in March ahead of extreme bitcoin price volatility and a looming stock market crash. “Bitcoin is becoming a store of value, gold’s has historically been a store of value,” Bessent told podcaster Tucker Carlson, adding there are “a lot of different stores of value over time.” Bessent’s comments come as stock markets around the world fall sharply in the aftermath of Trump’s so-called Liberation Day of trade tariffs that saw the U.S. implement a global baseline import tax of 10% and much higher rates for goods from dozens of countries. “As risk assets continue to sell off, investors may increasingly rotate into traditional hedges like bonds and gold—or into bitcoin, which has shown notable resilience relative to equities in recent days," David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at bitcoin and crypto investment company 21Shares, said via email. Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, is up around 15% so far this year as traders and central banks buy it to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties. “Bitcoin’s price action this week has been a true testament to its investment case as an emerging store of value and potential for uncorrelated returns," Hernandez said. The U.S. stock market has plummeted by around 10% since Trump followed through with his well-telegraphed global tariff regime that was more aggressive than traders had anticipated. Trump himself shared a social media post with a caption reading: “Trump is purposely crashing the market." The bitcoin price has, however, climbed over the course of the week, breaking its recent correlation with the stock market—specifically the tech heavy Nasdaq and the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks that includes Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has dropped in recent weeks but has outperformed the "crashing" stock market. "What’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a MAGA problem," Bessent told Carlson, referring to the Trump administration’s Make American Great Again series of policies that are focuses on rebuilding the country’s manufacturing base. “The Trump tariffs have unleashed volatility, notably shaking the U.S. equity markets, but with this, bitcoin’s unique reaction deserves attention,” Joe Burnett, director of market research crypto financial company Unchained, said in emailed comments. "Recalling March 2020, bitcoin rapidly bottomed and recovered first (before U.S. equities), a pattern potentially repeating today as bitcoin hasn’t made new lows since March 11th. This resilience could signal a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Of course, if stocks continue falling aggressively over the coming weeks, it’s reasonable to expect that bitcoin could experience another leg down too.”

Title: BlackRock Will Offer Spot XRP And Solana ETFs, Insider Claims

Time Published: 2025-04-05T09:30:44Z

Andrew Parish, the founder of x3 and a frequent source of high-level information on X, has stirred the crypto community with his latest claim that the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, “will eventually capitulate and offer both XRP and SOL ETF’s.” Parish conveyed that sources close to the matter have told him “crypto floodgates have opened, 2025 filings expected,” while also suggesting that BlackRock leadership has indicated “we may not be first, but we will give clients choices,” and that “if nothing else, both will be included in crypto asset class products” because “crypto assets are an unprecedented growth opportunity.” This is not the first time Parish has shared alleged insider knowledge that turned out to be accurate. On March 17, he posted an update in which he cited “two SEC sources” who believed that the Ripple case was “very close to ending,” adding that these sources expected “XRP to get serious commodity consideration” and a “greatly reduced fine; GREATLY reduced.” He also emphasized that “new leadership knows this case and how they handle it is a big deal; precedent.” Just two days after Parish released that information, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to X to announce that the US Securities and Exchange Commission would drop its appeal, lending credence to Parish’s track record. It is also worth noting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission actually reduced its penalty significantly from $125 million to $50 million, as revealed by Parish. While Parish’s assertion regarding a future spot XRP ETF offering may seem bold, he is not alone in his assessment. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, Host of ETF Prime, and Co-Founder of The ETF Institute, has similarly predicted that BlackRock will seek to expand its crypto footprint beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Geraci noted three weeks ago, “I’m ready to log formal prediction… BlackRock will file for both Solana & XRP ETFs,” pointing out that in his view “Solana could be any day. Think XRP once SEC lawsuit concluded.” According to Geraci, BlackRock’s motivation lies in its current dominance by assets in Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. He believes the firm will be reluctant to allow competitors to break ground with major altcoin ETFs, stating that “I simply don’t see them allowing competitors to come in & launch ETFs on 2 of the top 5 non-stablecoin crypto assets w/out any sort of fight. I also believe BlackRock will file for crypto index ETFs btw.” Geraci’s reasoning underscores a notable shift from BlackRock’s previously cautious stance on additional cryptocurrency ETFs. In July of last year, the firm’s Chief Information Officer, Samara Cohen, told Bloomberg that BlackRock had no imminent plans to roll out altcoin products beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Jay Jacobs, BlackRock’s US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs, reinforced that perspective in December, saying the company was predominantly focused on its existing crypto investment offerings. Additional remarks from Parish reveal that he has been hearing similar timelines and predictions from unnamed “ETF execs in the know.” In one update posted two weeks ago, Parish mentioned anticipating a variety of spot crypto ETF approvals beginning in Q2, including an expected timeframe of “XRP early Q2,” “LTC early Q2,” “SOL late Q2,” and “HBAR early Q3,” while also pointing to the possibility of “basket” crypto ETF products and leveraged long or short funds. His sources, he said, predict that “2025 is the year of crypto ETF’s.” At press time; XRP traded at $2.04 For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

In the end, the make-up of the top four and the Division 1A play-offs in the Energia All-Ireland League did not go down to the wire. Even so, there is some jostling for home semi-finals and the play-off picture throughout the divisions, as well as the AIL qualifiers. St Mary’s (63 points) top 1A after a seven-year absence but travel with a weakened team to second-placed Clontarf (61), who welcome back Ivan Soroka and need a win to ensure a home semi-final. ‘Tarf could be edged out of the top two by Cork Con, who entertain Terenure, finalists for the last three years but who have lost four in a row. After a transformative five seasons as head coach this will be Sean Skehan’s final game before focusing his energies on the rugby programme in the Terenure school. As indicated by a much-changed selection at home to relegated Garryowen, fourth-placed Lansdowne (56) are contentedly in the semi-finals after a run of one defeat in eight. City of Armagh (27 points) can stay above UCD (25) in the relegation play-off place by winning at home to Ballynahinch. After Trinity’s relegation last season, UCD feature eight players on Leinster’s books, including four who featured in the province’s win over the Sharks in Durban last week, for their trek to Young Munster, who are again stacked with Munster players. Old Belvedere have won 1B while Nenagh Ormond have secured second, leaving Blackrock (51 points), Old Wesley (50) and UCC (48) fighting for the remaining two play-off spots. Blackrock host Old Wesley in Stradbrook, where the losers could miss out on the play-offs to UCC if they beat Old Belvedere at home. Last-placed Shannon (24 points) need a bonus-point win at home to Queen’s and hope that Highfield earn nothing from their trek to Naas if the nine-time champions are to avoid successive relegations. Trinity, at home to Nenagh, need to match Highfield’s result to avoid a relegation play-off. In the tussle for the last promotion play-off place in 2A, Corinthians, at home to Ballymena, trail fourth-placed Greystones, away to Navan, on points difference with their opponents fighting to avoid a relegation play-off. UL Bohs, Galwegians and Rainey are competing for the last play-off place in 2B, and face the relegation threatened duo of Sligo and Skerries as well as champions Wanderers. Midleton lead Enniscorthy atop 2C heading into final games away to Monkstown and Belfast Harlequins. In the Qualifying Playoffs, Bective Rangers meet Creggs and Thomond meet Dromore in a double header at Cill Dara RFC, while Enniskillen are seeking promotion to the AIL for the first time when they meet Ennis/Kilrush in Mullingar RFC in the Women’s Qualifying Final.

Gordon Chang, expert on U.S.-China relations, details how Beijing can 'make life very difficult' for firms involved in sale of Panama Canal from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S.-based BlackRock. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is slated to meet with Panama leaders next week amid President Donald Trump's continued efforts to regain control of the key strategic and military resource. The Trump administration has been outspoken about national security threats presented by alleged Chinese interference. During a February visit to the country, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote in an X post that "the United States cannot, and will not, allow the Chinese Communist Party to continue with its effective and growing control over the Panama Canal area." Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed on Friday the secretary of defense will attend the 2025 Central American Security Conference, participating in discussions that will "drive ongoing efforts to strengthen the U.S.'s partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations," according to a report from the Associated Press. A cargo boat navigates on the Panama Canal next to the expansion project of the Panama Canal on the Pacific side in Panama City, November 17, 2015. (Reuters) PANAMA DENIES STATE DEPT CLAIM THAT IT IS ELIMINATING FEES FOR US GOV VESSELS USING CANAL The president, who has criticized the six-figure premiums imposed on U.S. ships traveling along the vital waterway, previously suggested repurchasing the canal. It was built by the U.S. over the span of multiple decades, but was eventually handed over to Panama during the Carter administration. The "Panama Canal Repurchase Act," a bill that was recently introduced in Congress, would give Trump the authority to negotiate with appropriate Panamanian government officials to reacquire the Panama Canal. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attends a NATO Defence Ministers meeting at the Alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium on Feb. 13, 2025. (Reuters/Yves Herman) CHINA, HONG KONG THREATEN TO THWART SALE OF PANAMA CANAL PORTS TO AMERICA'S BLACKROCK Panama President José Raúl Mulino previously said China does not have influence over the canal and accused Trump of "lying" about potentially acquiring it, according to the AP. BlackRock, Inc. later announced a $23 billion deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchinson to take ownership of the Panamanian ports of Cristobal and Balboa, along with 43 ports in 23 other countries, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Editor Podcasts Jeff Berwick, The Dollar Vigilante You do have options. Never say I didn’t tell you so. Because, if you ignore today’s vlog and you find yourself in a 15-minute Smart Jones Plantation, with your every move controlled and monitored, and chipped and dipped in whatever lethal poison is best for ‘you and the planet’, you already know what I’ll say: ATOADASO! In today’s video I chatted with my friend of 15 years, Michael Cobb, the ceo of ECI Developments who I met up with yesterday in Nicaragua. We talked about living a high-quality, low cost, healthy lifestyle in an almost secret country in Latin America. I last visited the development in 2018, and now, with over 20 Dollar Vigilantes already living in the community and 20 more having secured their houses, it was amazing to connect with like-minded, free-thinking people taking control of their lives outside the Global Reset realm. It’s incredible how many people are putting their escape plan in place, right now. If I was a gambling man, I would bet this is pretty much the last opportunity to secure off-grid, eco-friendly offshore real estate just a two-minute walk from Nicaragua’s world famous Asuchillo swimming and surf beach. At an unbelievable price with financing options. They even accept crypto and gold. Plus you have the option of getting a residency visa or citizenship! If you’re looking for an escape hatch with fresh food, clean air, unpoisoned bodies, autonomous living and free thought, your options are slim. The word is out on Costa Rica, Belize and El Salvador. And, BlackRock has taken over Panama. Europe has been fooked since The Great Replacement kicked off. Plus they’ve got the Hollyweird celebtards moving in faster than you can say transgender abortions. The USSA is a khazarian-infested death swamp disguised barely with a MAGA cap who wants to replace all living beings with robot armies. Whereas Kanada got rid of Little Castreau only to replace him with a global bankster climate Nazi. And, never forget that Kanadians were voted most likely to turn you in for thinking outside the mainstream narrative, with research showing that most Kanadians support punishing those not following the coronavirus rules in the Covaids scamdemic. So, when the next plandemic demands mandatory lethal injections, AI takes over your job, hyperinflation hits, debts get called in, taxes increase, food gets scarce and riots increase… WHAT IS YOUR ESCAPE HATCH?

Specialist Anthony Matesic works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Friday, April 4, 2025. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)AP NEW YORK — Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6% after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. The drop closed the worst week for the S&P 500 since March 2020, when the pandemic ripped through the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231 points, or 5.5% and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.8% to pull more than 20% below its record set in December. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China with its own 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4% from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself, because it can drive a vicious cycle of behavior that only worsens inflation. U.S. households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. That could indicate a hesitance to cut rates because lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals on that. On Friday, he said Vietnam “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” Trump also criticized China’s retaliation, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 12.7% after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 12% of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 16%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 322.44 points to 5,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 to 38,314.86, and the Nasdaq composite fell 962.82 to 15,587.79. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell, but they pared their drops following Powell’s cautious statements about inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.01% from 4.06% late Thursday and from roughly 4.80% early this year.

Title: Fidelity Submits Tokenized Market FYHXX to SEC, Sells US Treasury Bills on Ethereum Chain

Fidelity Investments, an American asset management company, has applied to register its tokenized U.S. dollar money market blockchain, joining a growing list of businesses that are tokenizing assets. Fidelity registered its blockchain with the SEC, creating a tokenized version of its Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), which contains cash and treasury securities. The SEC filing revealed that Fidelity wishes to create an on-chain share class of its funds, FYHXX, using the Ethereum network but plans to create an independent blockchain. FYHXX will not invest in cryptocurrencies but in cash and U.S. securities. It currently holds 80% in securities. Fidelity made a previous SEC filing before this one to introduce Staking for the Ethereum ETF, attempting to catch up to Blackrock, which was already investing in blockchain technology. Tokenization money funds offer quicker settlement times, direct transactions, 24/7 trading, and more liquidity. Fidelity can take traditional investments like bonds, funds, and credit, place them on the blockchain, and provide better asset access. For Fidelity, Real-World Assets are tokenized using the Ethereum blockchain. FYHXX will provide shareholders with verifiable transactions on the blockchain, keeping track of shares owned, but will be backed up with a traditional method of record keeping. The blockchain, therefore, will not be the official record of shares traded but will be updated daily to reflect the off-chain official record. Further, the U.S. Treasury bills would not be tokenized directly. The dual record model, with the primary record being off-chain and the secondary record being an Ethereum blockchain, could be vital to transitioning to an on-chain primary record. Fidelity, which manages $5.8 trillion, has been lagging behind other companies regarding blockchain adoption. Blackrock runs the money market BUIDL, which holds $1.5 billion in assets. Blackrock has been the leader in asset management, with other contenders following its example. Franklin Templeton has also developed a money market using tokenized funds, with $689 million. Debanking, the phenomenon of banks refusing to finance crypto businesses, didn’t help with adopting tokenized assets. Banks often lumped cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets in the same basket, despite tokenized assets following the same rules as traditional assets. A change in attitude occurred when Blackrock created BUIDL, a tokenized asset class. Many banks prefer AI companies to blockchain-based companies, despite both having varying degrees of risk depending on the underlying business model. “There was no question”, said Robbie Mitchnick, Blackrock’s head of crypto, “that the blockchain we would start our tokenization on would be Ethereum, and that’s not just a BlackRock thing, that’s the natural default answer. Clients clearly are making choices that they do value the decentralization, they do value the credibility, and the security and that’s a great advantage that Ethereum continues to have”.

(AP Photo: Richard Drew) S&P 500 companies have lost over $US4 trillion ($6.5 trillion) in stock market value since China matched US President Trump's tariff increase. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,054 points overnight, with Wall Street suffering its worst falls since the COVID-19 crash. Meanwhile, Donald Trump was spotted playing golf in Mar-a-Lago after writing on social media that "this is a great time to get rich". Global stock markets and oil prices have tumbled again as China has struck back against US President Donald Trump's tariffs and worries about a prolonged global trade war have mounted. Wall Street nosedived for a second straight day on Friday, confirming the Nasdaq Composite was in a bear market — defined by falling prices of at least 20 per cent from a recent high —while the pan-European STOXX 600 index confirmed it was in a correction as the trade war fanned global recession concerns. The move comes after Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries including China. Since Mr Trump unveiled his tariffs late on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has plunged 2,054 points and S&P 500 companies have lost more than $US4 trillion ($6.5 trillion) in stock market value. It is a record two-day decline for the benchmark and exceeds the two-day loss of $US3.3 trillion in March 2020 when the pandemic ripped across global markets, according to LSEG data compiled by Reuters. Some investors fled to the safety of government bonds, while the dollar recovered from Thursday's weakness. Responding to Mr Trump's tariffs, China on Friday said it would impose additional levies of 34 per cent on American goods, confirming investor fears that a full-blown global trade war was under way. President Donald Trump waves as he arrives at the Trump International Golf Club after announcing widespread tariffs. (AP: Alex Brandon) Mr Trump slapped a 10 per cent tariff on most US imports and much higher levies on dozens of countries, erecting the steepest trade barriers in more than 100 years. The United States and China are the world's two largest economies. Two days after sending the economy reeling, Mr Trump insisted his trade policies would never change. He headed to his nearby golf course at Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Palm Beach, after writing on social media: "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH." President Donald Trump, driven by his son Eric Trump, arrives at Trump National Doral. (AP: Alex Brandon) The president has often proved impervious to the kind of scandals or gaffes that would damage another politician, but his decision to spend the weekend at his gilded properties could test Americans' patience at a time when their retirement savings are evaporating along with the stock market. The tariffs are expected to increase prices by thousands of dollars a year and slow economic growth, and there are fears about a potential recession. Democrats called out Mr Trump for being in a "billionaire bubble", as senator Chuck Schumer put it, while millions watched their investments sink. "While the American people are trying to put food on the table, I see that Donald Trump's out there playing golf," said senator Ben Ray Luján, a Democrat from New Mexico. So far there are few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. European stocks dropped roughly 5 per cent. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war would weaken the global economy. Wondering how Trump's new tariffs were calculated? It would be funny if it wasn't so serious. "It's sort of the worst fears of where the tariff program was headed," said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. "For those investors who were sure it was just a negotiation — while that still may be true at some point — it's getting awfully deeper into the detail and more dangerous for companies." Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning's US jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It is the latest signal that the UU job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it's been a linchpin keeping the US economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what's to come. "The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices will likely need to come down even more than they have already.

Title: Hegseth is to travel to Panama for meetings following Trump's demands for the canal

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will travel to Panama next week to meet its leaders following recent U.S. allegations of Chinese interference in the operations of the critical Panama Canal shipping lane WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will travel to Panama next week to meet with leaders of the Central American country following recent Trump administration allegations of Chinese interference in the operations of the critical Panama Canal shipping lane. President Donald Trump has complained about the U.S. relinquishing control of the waterway to Panama more than 20 years ago and has threatened to retake it, arguing that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. Panama’s government has denied Trump's assertion that China exerts influence over the canal. Sean Parnell, chief Pentagon spokesman, said Friday that Hegseth will participate in the 2025 Central American Security Conference. He said Hegseth will take part in meetings that “will drive ongoing efforts to strengthen our partnerships with Panama and other Central American nations toward our shared vision for a peaceful and secure Western Hemisphere.” He did not mention the canal, which was built by the U.S. in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington turned control over to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away. After Trump's threats, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its controlling stake in a subsidiary that operates ports near the Panama Canal to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control. The deal will give the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the Panama Canal. Other ports are in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere. The transaction must be approved by Panama’s government, which has maintained that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway. Parnell said Hegseth also will stop at Eglin Air Force Base to visit service members and command leadership at the 7th Special Forces Group. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6% after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. The drop closed the worst week for the S&P 500 since March 2020, when the pandemic ripped through the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231 points, or 5.5% and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.8% to pull more than 20% below its record set in December. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China with its own 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4% from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself, because it can drive a vicious cycle of behavior that only worsens inflation. U.S. households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. That could indicate a hesitance to cut rates because lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals on that. On Friday, he said Vietnam “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” Trump also criticized China’s retaliation, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 12.7% after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 12% of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 16%. All told, the S&P 500 fell 322.44 points to 5,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 to 38,314.86, and the Nasdaq composite fell 962.82 to 15,587.79. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.3% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell, but they pared their drops following Powell’s cautious statements about inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.01% from 4.06% late Thursday and from roughly 4.80% early this year. It had gone below 3.90% in the morning.

Posted in: Opinion, streaming, TV, TV | Tagged: opinion, TikTok, trump Donald Trump delayed the deadline on the TikTok ban another 75 days - until mid-June. So far, the Congressional silence has been deafening... When he's not busy tanking the U.S. economy and blowing off the dignified transfer of four American soldiers who died during a training exercise in Lithuania that took place at Delaware's Dover Air Force base earlier today, POtuS Donald Trump is weighing in on the TikTok timeline – and making VVP JD Vance look like an idiot in the process. "My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days," Trump wrote on his version of social media earlier today – meaning the April 5th deadline has now been extended to June 18th. Of course, there are two important factors to keep in mind. First, Trump has no legal authority to do it. TikTok was considered a threat to U.S. security by Congress, which passed a bipartisan bill that was signed into law by President Joseph Biden – you know, the guy behind the economy that Trump has shit away in less than 100 days. But when you have lackeys like Mike Johnson as House Speaker – who clearly doesn't get the concept of "separation of powers" and seems more into the "dictator daddy" vibe – Trump's not going to get any pushback. Of course, if there is a silver lining in all of this mess, it's that Trump made Vance look clueless once again – with Trump's move coming a day after Vance told FOX "News" that a deal would be announced by Saturday (whoops) to keep the app running in the U.S. As for who might end up owning the social media service, it could end up being anyone from Oracle and Blackrock to Amazon, the founder of OnlyFans, ex-L.A. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, and others. Enjoyed this? Please share on social media!

Title: Report: Unelected Canada PM Mark Carney Declared 'Strong Confidence' in Investing in China on Beijing Trip

Leftist Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who was installed after an internal Liberal Party election in March, “expressed strong confidence in the development prospects and growth potential of investing in China” during a visit to Beijing in October, Canadian outlets recalled this week. The Chinese government summary of his visit to Beijing while serving as an economic adviser to pro-China leftist predecessor Justin Trudeau followed multiple revelations suggesting Carney’s relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and its ideology is dangerous close, including his refusal to drop a Liberal Party candidate who called for citizens to capture anti-communist dissidents for a Chinese “bounty” and the securing of a sweetheart loan to his former company, Brookfield Asset Management. It is in his capacity as chairman of Brookfield that Carney visited Beijing and met with its mayor, Yin Yong, in October. Carney is currently in a cutthroat race to keep his appointed prime ministership in an election scheduled for April 28. His most formidable opponent, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, argued on Wednesday that Carney was “compromised by the authoritarian regime in Beijing” – a grave accusation following multiple reports that Canadian intelligence officials have uncovered Chinese regime operations to interfere in Canadian elections. The Canadian outlet Blacklock’s Reporter reported on Tuesday, citing the anti-communist Epoch Times, that Carney “lobbied” the mayor of Beijing during his visit in October. Both reports were based on an article in the Chinese state outlet Beijing Daily published on October 23, 3024, on Yin’s meetings with Carney and the vice chairman of BlackRock, Philipp Hildebrand. The two men were in Beijing to attend the “Annual Conference of Financial Street Forum.” “Yin encouraged Brookfield Asset Management and BlackRock to seize opportunities, tap into their strengths, and increase their investment and business presence in Beijing,” Beijing Daily reported. “He invited both companies to further deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, and share the dividends of Beijing’s high-quality development and high-standard opening-up.” “Both foreign guests expressed strong confidence in the development prospects and growth potential of investing in China,” the report continued. Carney, it claimed, personally “highlighted Brookfield Asset Management’s keen interest in seizing development opportunities in China, further expanding its business in Beijing, and deepening cooperation with relevant partners in areas such as green finance, fund management, and infrastructure investment.” A month after Carney’s visit to Beijing, in November, Brookfield secured a a $276 million 15-year loan with four percent interest, a greatly beneficial deal to the asset manager that Conservatives described as a “sweetheart” agreement. Carney’s visit to China and the massive Brookfield loan occurred after Carney became an official part of the Trudeau government. As the National Post recalled this week, Trudeau offered Carney a job as the leader of a Liberal Party “task force on economic growth.” Carney had previously advised Trudeau on his disastrous response to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic and on green energy. Poilievre condemned Carney’s relationship with China on Wednesday, describing him as “compromised.” “His company owes the Chinese state-owned bank a quarter billion dollars. He protected a Liberal candidate & MP who said a Canadian citizen should be turned over to Beijing for a bounty,” Poilievre noted. “And now we find out he lobbied the Chinese government weeks before becoming PM to ‘deepen co-operation.’ The Carney Liberals can’t be trusted to keep Canadians safe. They don’t deserve a fourth term.” The “bounty” comment concerned the scandal emerging this week surrounding member of Parliament and now-former Liberal Party candidate Paul Chiang. In January, Chiang had suggested to Chinese-language media that individuals should attempt to abduct his opponent, anti-communist activist Joe Tay, to receive a bounty from the Chinese government. “If anyone here can take [Tay] to the Chinese Consulate General in Toronto, you can get the million-dollar reward,” Chiang said. When the comments emerged in Anglophone media in late March, Carney mildly condemned them but refused to call for Chiang to step down, calling the scandal a “teachable moment.” “He’s made his apology. He’s made it to the public, he’s made it to the individual concerned, he’s made it directly to me, and he’s going to continue with his candidacy,” Carney said. “He has my confidence.” Chiang stepped down anyway on March 31. Brookfield Asset Management is an international company that first invested in China in 2013. According to the website of its Chinese office, it has invested heavily in green energy in China as well as the country’s floundering real estate market. “We have continued to invest in assets that form the backbone of China’s economy across critical industries including logistics, retail, energy and business services,” Brookfield said of itself. Bloomberg News highlighted Brookfield as a company bucking the trend of Western investors fleeing the decaying post-lockdown Chinese economy in May. “There are many global investors that are not interested in China anymore, but there a lot that are,” Brookfield Chief Executive Officer Bruce Flatt said at a panel in Qatar that month, as quoted by Bloomberg. “The local investors have money in China and are doubling down on investing in China.” Follow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.

Title: Trump Delays TikTok Ban Again, Saying Deal ‘Requires More Work’
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/trump-tiktok-delays-ban-us-deal-1236355158/
Time Published: 2025-04-04T17:46:24Z
Full Content:
By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor President Trump said he’s going to delay enforcement of a U.S. law that requires TikTok‘s parent company to sell to non-Chinese owners for another 75 days — setting a new deadline of mid-June. In a post Friday on Truth Social, Trump wrote, “My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.” TikTok had faced a looming April 5 deadline set by Trump to reach a deal that would comply with the U.S. law — or effectively be banned from being hosted or distributed in the country. The app has been painted as a national security threat to the U.S. by many American lawmakers because of its ownership by China’s ByteDance. Related Stories VIP+ Why the Theatrical Window Debate at CinemaCon Feels Hopeless ‘The Life List’ Review: Sofia Carson’s Rote Romantic Drama for Netflix Inspires Jeers, Not Cheers ByteDance said Friday that it has been in discussions with U.S. government officials “regarding a potential solution for TikTok U.S.” and that “an agreement has not been executed.” Popular on Variety “There are key matters to be resolved,” ByteDance said. “Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law.” Trump’s second punt on the TikTok ban comes a day after VP JD Vance said in an interview on Fox News that the administration would announce a deal by Saturday that would keep the app legal. It also came as financial markets entered their second day of significant declines in response to Trump’s plan to enact steep tariffs on most countries, including China. A deal led by the Trump administration to spin off TikTok’s U.S. business into a new company — majority-owned by U.S. investors, with ByteDance retaining a stake of less than 20% to comply with the law — had been “largely finalized” Wednesday, including approval from ByteDance, Reuters reported. But the Chinese government refused to sign off on the plan because of Trump’s new tariffs, according to the report. Trump technically does not have authority under the TikTok-targeted legislation, passed in 2024 with bipartisan congressional support and signed by President Biden, to postpone the enforcement of the law. But he continues acting as if he does have the power to forestall an effective nationwide U.S. ban on the popular app while the White House tries to figure out a new American-controlled ownership structure for TikTok. Trump on Friday said negotiations were in progress with China, which has the authority to block any sale of TikTok by ByteDance. The U.S. government’s TikTok divest-or-ban law bars the app from operating in the U.S. if it continues to use the content-recommendation algorithm controlled by ByteDance — while the Chinese government has opposed a TikTok sale that includes the algorithm. A 75-day extension from Friday would make the new deadline June 18. Trump said on Truth Social, “We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!). This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National Security! We do not want TikTok to ‘go dark.’ We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Potential investors in TikTok could include Oracle and Blackrock, which have been reported to be in deal talks. Oracle is seen as logical partner, as the company has an existing agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data. Others that have expressed interest in bidding for TikTok include Amazon, former L.A. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, and Tim Stokely, the founder of OnlyFans. Under the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, ByteDance is required to sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or be outlawed. In January, TikTok lost an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds. It briefly shut down in the U.S. on Jan. 18 but came back online citing Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to find a solution. Apple and Google pulled TikTok from their U.S. app stores amid legal uncertainty over Trump’s executive order delaying enforcement of the TikTok-targeted law, but restored TikTok after assurances from the White House they would not be held criminally liable for doing so. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees including those in the U.S. A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Why Tariffs Make Now A Strategic Time To Buy Bitcoin

ByBecca Bratcher ByBecca Bratcher, Contributor. WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. President Donald Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariffs (Photo by Chip ... More Somodevilla/Getty Images) On April 3, 2025, Wall Street faced its steepest decline since the COVID pandemic, almost exactly five years ago. Following President Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement, which revealed a sweeping set of new tariffs, the market swiftly responded negatively. The S&P 500 plunged 4.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4%, and the Nasdaq tumbled 6%. This move ignited fears of a prolonged trade war, fueling concerns about rising inflation and a potential recession. Even gold, which has long been considered a safe haven, tumbled after the announcement. Small-cap stocks suffered the most, with the Russell 2000 down 6.6%. Amid this historic market selloff, one asset stood out for its relative stability: Bitcoin. Though the leading cryptocurrency initially fell 5%, it quickly rebounded and held at around $81K, climbing the following day to over $83K. While almost every other asset class faced steep losses, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain support levels underscored its growing role as a financial alternative in uncertain times. A key factor behind Bitcoin’s resilience is mounting skepticism over the long-term viability of the U.S. dollar. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, recently raised concerns in his “2025 Annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors” that America’s rising debt could threaten its role as the world’s reserve currency. In the letter, Fink states that the U.S. national debt has grown three times the pace of GDP, and this year, interest payments on that debt will exceed $952 billion, more than the country’s defense budget. By 2030, mandatory federal spending and debt service are projected to consume all government revenue. “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control… America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink warned. His comments seem to reflect a growing view among investors who are looking for alternatives to traditional currencies and see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against economic instability. Even as equity markets plunged, Bitcoin remained above key support thresholds, suggesting sustained investor confidence. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the broader selloff that engulfed small-cap and tech stocks. Shares of crypto-exposed companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy fell 7% and 10%, respectively, but Bitcoin itself avoided deeper losses. Tuur Demeester, Bitcoin investor and economist, posted on X, “As the global economy starts to repair decades of resource misallocation, savers increasingly seek refuge in liquid, scarce safe haven assets. Stocks _will_ decouple from bitcoin.” The relatively stable performance suggests investors are viewing Bitcoin not as a speculative bet but as a durable store of value, despite intense market pressure. With over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply already in circulation and the final coins being released at an increasingly slower pace due to programmed halvings every four years, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly scarce asset. Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed supply cap, unlike government-issued currencies subject to inflationary pressures, positions Bitcoin as a strong hedge against currency debasement and a compelling long-term store of value. Author and financial advisor Morgen Rochard said, “Bitcoin isn’t a stock pick. It’s an opt-out button.” As markets reel from geopolitical shocks and fiscal uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly proving itself as more than a speculative asset. It’s becoming a reliable financial alternative. With its fixed supply, growing adoption, and resilience amid chaos, Bitcoin offers investors a way to avoid the volatility of centralized monetary systems. In a world where trust in traditional assets is wavering, owning Bitcoin may be less about chasing returns and more about securing financial sovereignty.

Title: Blockchain Meets Banking: BNY’s Bold Move With BlackRock In Tow

Bank of New York Mellon Corp. unveiled a new blockchain-based tool Friday that posts up-to-date net asset value (NAV) data for tokenized funds directly on a blockchain. According to company officials, BlackRock will be the first client to implement this technology with their on-chain money market fund, BUIDL. According to a report by Fortune, the financial giant’s move comes amid growing acceptance of blockchain technology in traditional finance, supported by favorable regulatory changes under US President Donald Trump’s administration. BNY Mellon temporarily paused its crypto custody services during the Biden Administration after the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance known as SAB 121, which created balance sheet requirements for companies holding crypto assets for clients. In 2024, the bank received an exemption allowing it to custody Bitcoin and Ethereum for exchange-traded products without treating them as balance-sheet liabilities. Under Trump, the SEC quickly rescinded the previous guidance, which was widely unpopular among banks and crypto companies. BNY’s latest crypto product moves beyond custody, and reflects the growth of financial instruments launched on blockchains, such as BlackRock’s on-chain money market fund, BUIDL #BlackRock #BNY #BUIDL #Bitcoin https://t.co/HRHN1RdFM1 — Digital Startup (@digitalstartup5) April 3, 2025 BlackRock, which depends on BNY Mellon as both fund administrator and custodian for its BUIDL fund, will be the first to use the new tool. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, called BNY’s ability to bring off-chain data insights to public blockchains “an unprecedented event and a significant milestone for the industry” in a statement shared with Fortune. The partnership builds on BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s public statements supporting increased tokenization of financial assets to improve costs and efficiency. While the technology remains limited to specific test cases and mostly blockchain-native customers, this implementation represents a step toward broader adoption. Caroline Butler, BNY’s head of digital assets, explained in an interview with Fortune that the new product will allow more transparent and current information around tokenized funds. “Because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this,” she said. “It sits right in that sweet spot as we continue to add more and more value for clients.” The tool posts NAV information directly to the blockchain instead of relying on third-party accounting services. According to Butler, this helps investors see current NAV values of instruments like BUIDL, which can improve their creditworthiness. While this type of data sharing isn’t unique to crypto, Butler noted that BNY’s blockchain technology enables the company to offer a more complete set of tools for tokenized funds. BNY Mellon’s latest offering represents another step into the blockchain sector, which began in 2008 with Bitcoin’s introduction. Despite market ups and downs, the bank has shown ongoing interest in the technology, including a previous launch of a digital asset custody platform for Bitcoin and Ethereum. In March, Butler testified before the House Financial Services Committee during a hearing on stablecoins. “Embracing blockchain technology in connecting the traditional and digital markets is consistent with BNY’s long track record of supporting innovation in the global financial system,” she stated at the hearing.

Stan Choe, Associated Press Stan Choe, Associated Press Leave your feedback NEW YORK (AP) — Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6 percent after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. WATCH: Markets plunge in wake of Trump’s new tariffs and fears of global trade war The drop closed the worst week for the S&P 500 since March 2020, when the pandemic ripped through the global economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 2,231 points, or 5.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite tumbled 5.8 percent to pull more than 20 percent below its record set in December. So far there have been few, if any, winners in financial markets from the trade war. Stocks for all but 14 of the 500 companies within the S&P 500 index fell Friday. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34 percent tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China with its own 34 percent tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question looking ahead is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices may need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down 17.4 percent from its record set in February. Trump seemed unfazed. From Mar-a-Lago, his private club in Florida, he headed to his golf course a few miles away after writing on social media that “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH.” The Federal Reserve could cushion the blow of tariffs on the economy by cutting interest rates, which can encourage companies and households to borrow and spend. But the Fed may have less freedom to move than it would like. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday that tariffs could drive up expectations for inflation. That could prove more damaging than high inflation itself, because it can drive a vicious cycle of behavior that only worsens inflation. U.S. households have already said they’re bracing for sharp increases to their bills. “Our obligation is to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored and to make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,” Powell said. That could indicate a hesitance to cut rates because lower rates can give inflation more fuel. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals on that. On Friday, he said Vietnam “wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.” Trump also criticized China’s retaliation, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED – THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 12.7 percent after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 12 percent of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 16 percent. All told, the S&P 500 fell 322.44 points to 5,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,231.07 to 38,314.86, and the Nasdaq composite fell 962.82 to 15,587.79. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5 percent, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8 percent. In the bond market, Treasury yields fell, but they pared their drops following Powell’s cautious statements about inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.01 percent from 4.06 percent late Thursday and from roughly 4.80 percent early this year. It had gone below 3.90 percent in the morning.

Title: Ralph Lauren in Bidding War With LVMH for SoHo Storefront

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy A prominent SoHo corner spot at Prince and Greene streets has been at the center of a bidding war by two luxury brands, but it looks like the longtime occupant, Ralph Lauren, will pay up to keep the space, Commercial Observer has learned. While the ground-floor storefront 109 Prince Street has been occupied by the retailer since 2010, its lease is coming due. French retail giant LVMH has been battling for the space, which LVHM wants for Tiffany & Co., now located at nearby 97 Greene Street. Sources told CO Ralph Lauren will most likely purchase the spot, but it could also turn into a high-priced lease instead. Most retail deals are currently trading at a 6.5 to 8 percent cap rate, according to broker Adelaide Polsinelli of Compass, who marketed the space a decade ago for $54 million with no takers. While unaware of but not involved in the current transaction, she said Ralph Lauren would now command a premium over that range, putting it at a 5 to 5.5 percent cap rate. The Real Estate Board of New York‘s fall report found average retail asking rents along the Broadway corridor in SoHo to be $490 per square foot. Any new starting rent for Ralph Lauren would likely be higher. LVMH has been trying to find a new home for Tiffany for some time, but keeps losing out. Over the last year, the company has tried to lease the former Nespresso store at 92 Prince Street, which was instead leased to Ferrari, as well as the nearby Apple (AAPL) store at 103 Prince Street. That 30,000-square-foot former post office has been occupied by Apple since 2001 and underwent a $30 million expansion and renovation in 2011 when it was purchased by Imperium Capital. With the aggressive LVMH nipping at the bricks, to maintain its space, one real estate source said, “Apple was forced to renew at a rent they didn’t love.” Now it looks like LVMH has lost out on another Prince Street deal and pushed another retailer to pony up. The primary owner of 109 Prince is the Swiss investor and art financier Jean-Pierre Lehmann, who bought the 20,000-square-foot historic cast-iron building in 1991 for $3 million. He completely renovated the French Renaissance-style edifice, first home to silk dealers and later to chemical suppliers, designed by Jarvis Morgan Slade and now part of the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. In 1997, Lehmann sponsored the building as a live-work artist condominium through his company Prince Street Realty, with retail on the ground floor, second floor and lower level, plus three upper-floor residences. In May 2010, records show Ralph Lauren signed a lease for the two retail lots, which had been a Replay store with a café in the lower level. The lease ends in 2026. The ground-floor lot has 3,258 square feet with a retail-friendly, 16-foot-high ceiling and a lower-level cellar spanning 3,386 square feet. The second-story retail condo has 3,265 square feet, and restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten leased it for storage. It could not be determined if he still leases that space. With those leases in hand, however, Lehman reconstituted the ownership entity of the two lots and obtained a mortgage of $18 million. After trying to sell the leased retail for $54 million through Polsinelli, enough interest was generated to up the mortgage in 2014 to $35 million with J.P. Morgan Chase, which pooled it into a commercial mortgage-backed securities loan. In 2016, as Ralph Lauren was closing stores around the country, CO reported that loan could be at risk in 2026 if the retailer did not renew since the store occupied 74.2 percent of the space, with 25.8 percent being occupied by others — presumably Vongerichten. But now the loan appears to be paid off. A Securities and Exchange Commission report from February 2025 said the balance on the one New York retail loan was $29.6 million and had an interest rate of 4.65 percent. Scheduled to mature in January 2026, the loan was anticipated to be repaid in June 2024. While no loan satisfaction has been filed, the report also stated there was an “unscheduled principal” prepayment for a partial liquidation of $156,917, and that the loan was paid through March 1. The upper floors are all residential condominiums. The third floor of the building has been owned since December 1998 by a Fortress Investment Group executive who did not respond to requests for comment. He paid $1.375 million to late art gallery owner Ileana Sonnabend, who had paid $775,000 just a year earlier. She also paid $775,000 for the fourth floor, which she sold back to Lehmann’s entity in mid-1998 for $1.589 million. His entity also still owns the fifth floor that has exclusive use of the roof. Sources said Ralph Lauren is likely negotiating this deal in-house but its spokesperson did not return requests for comment. Lehmann’s attorney and an LVMH spokesperson also did not return requests for comment. Naturally, this deal may still be undone. If inked as a sale, however, it would continue what is now a long trend of retailers buying New York City real estate. Prominent sales to retailers include Prada buying 720 and 724 Fifth Avenue, and a space in 730 Fifth Avenue, from Jeff Sutton for $835 million; Kering paying Sutton $963 million for 100,000 square feet at the base of 717 Fifth Avenue, which it is expected to renovate for Gucci; and James Dyson‘s Weybourne Group picking up 155 Mercer Street for $60 million as well as 770 Madison Avenue from Sutton and the Reuben Brothers for $135 million, where it is expected they will eventually locate Dyson stores. Plus, as CO first reported, Chanel is now negotiating to buy 60,000 square feet of retail in the base of Gary Barnett’s upcoming 655 Madison Avenue luxury residential tower for around $450 million. Barnett has already sold 70,000 square feet at 570 Fifth Avenue to Ikea’s parent for about $400 million. Read the latest edition of the Commercial Observer online!

Title: Sell-off worsens worldwide and Dow drops after China retaliates against Trump' tariffs

Stock markets worldwide are careening even lower Friday after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs in an escalating trade war. Not even a better-than-expected report on the U.S. job market, which is usually the economic highlight of each month, was enough to stop the slide. The S&P 500 was down 5% in morning trading, coming off its worst day since COVID wrecked the global economy in 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,656 points, or 4.2%, as of 10:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 5.5% lower. So far there are few, if any winners, in financial markets from the trade war. European stocks saw some of the day’s biggest losses, with indexes sinking roughly 5%. The price of crude oil tumbled to its lowest level since 2021. Other basic building blocks for economic growth, such as copper, also saw prices slide on worries the trade war will weaken the global economy. China’s response to U.S. tariffs caused an immediate acceleration of losses in markets worldwide. The Commerce Ministry in Beijing said it would respond to the 34% tariffs imposed by the U.S. on imports from China by imposing a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10. The United States and China are the world’s two largest economies. Markets briefly recovered some of their losses after the release of Friday morning’s U.S. jobs report, which said employers accelerated their hiring by more last month than economists expected. It’s the latest signal that the U.S. job market has remained relatively solid through the start of 2025, and it’s been a linchpin keeping the U.S. economy out of a recession. But that jobs data was backward looking, and the fear hitting financial markets is about what’s to come. “The world has changed, and the economic conditions have changed,” said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. The central question is: Will the trade war cause a global recession? If it does, stock prices will likely need to come down even more than they have already. The S&P 500 is down roughly 16% from its record set in February. Much will depend on how long Trump’s tariffs stick and what kind of retaliations other countries deliver. Some of Wall Street is holding onto hope that Trump will lower the tariffs after prying out some “wins” from other countries following negotiations. Otherwise, many say a recession looks likely. For his part, Trump has said Americans may feel “some pain” because of tariffs, but he has also said the long-term goals, including getting more manufacturing jobs back to the United States, are worth it. On Thursday, he likened the situation to a medical operation, where the U.S. economy is the patient. “For investors looking at their portfolios, it could have felt like an operation performed without anesthesia,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. But Jacobsen also said the next surprise for investors could be how quickly tariffs get negotiated down. “The speed of recovery will depend on how, and how quickly, officials negotiate,” he said. Vietnam said its deputy prime minister would visit the U.S. for talks on trade, while the head of the European Commission has vowed to fight back. Others have said they were hoping to negotiate with the Trump administration for relief. Trump criticized China's retaliation on Friday, saying on his Truth Social platform that “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” On Wall Street, stocks of companies that do lots of business in China fell to some of the sharpest losses. DuPont dropped 16.8% after China said its regulators are launching an anti-trust investigation into DuPont China group, a subsidiary of the chemical giant. It’s one of several measures targeting American companies and in retaliation for the U.S. tariffs. GE Healthcare got 14.3% of its revenue last year from the China region, and it fell 13.3%. United Airlines, which is in an alliance with Air China and got a third of its passenger revenue last year from flights across the Pacific, lost 12.6%. In the bond market, Treasury yields continued their sharp drop as worries rise about the strength of the U.S. economy, along with expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates to cushion it. The yield on the 10-year Treasury tumbled to 3.90% from 4.06% late Thursday and from roughly 4.80% early this year. That’s a major move for the bond market. The Fed could cut its main interest rate to relax the pressure on the economy, as it was doing late last year before pausing in 2025. But it may have less freedom to move than it would like. Lower rates can goose the economy by making it easier for U.S. companies and households to borrow and spend. But they can also push upward on inflation. And worries are already worsening about that because of tariffs, with U.S. households in particular bracing for sharp increases to their bills. In stock markets abroad, Germany’s DAX lost 5.2%, France’s CAC 40 dropped 4.6% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.8%.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) HONG KONG – Wall Street’s worst crisis since COVID slammed into a higher gear Friday. The S&P 500 lost 6% after China matched President Donald Trump’s big raise in tariffs announced earlier this week. The move increased the stakes in a trade war that could end with a recession that hurts everyone.
