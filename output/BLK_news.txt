Title: Here’s How Much J.D. Vance Is Worth

Update (Nov. 4, 2024): Two years ago, JD Vance was an Ohio venture capitalist best known for writing a book that helped explain the rise of Donald Trump to liberal coastal elites. Today, he’s a firebrand senator whose first and only election victory was bankrolled by PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel and who now has a shot of becoming Donald Trump’s heir apparent. Since we published his net worth estimate back in July, not much has changed on the financial front for him—media attention has mostly focused on past and present controversial remarks about abortion, women, immigrants and more. But a promotion to vice president would come with a compensation bump to $235,000 from his current Senate salary of $174,000. It would also set the 40-year-old up for a future White House run of his own—and all the monetary perks that come with it. Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, come from two different Americas. In Trump’s, fathers start passing down real-estate fortunes to their kids when they are toddlers. In Vance’s, fathers don’t even leave kids with their last names. Raised mostly by his mother’s parents, the Vances, J.D. Vance catapulted himself from Rust Belt poverty to coastal high society with a degree from Yale Law School, a marriage to another lawyer and the publication of “Hillbilly Elegy,” a memoir about Vance’s upbringing. The book came out in the summer of 2016 just as Donald Trump was surging in the polls, leaving liberals searching for something, anything, to explain Trump’s popularity in Middle America. “Hillbilly Elegy” made Vance rich—it reportedly sold more than three million copies—and turned him into a national figure. Today, he is worth an estimated $10 million. Given where he started, it’s a remarkable sum, one that solidifies Vance’s place in circles that might have made his younger self uncomfortable. Vance wrote in his book about how odd he found a particular kind of charity—wealthy families picking out gifts for low-income kids, not knowing what those kids actually wanted or needed. “I grew up in a world where everyone worried about how they’d pay for Christmas,” he wrote. “Now I live in one where opportunities abound for the wealthy and privileged to shower their generosity on the community’s poor.” V ance’s maternal grandparents moved from Jackson, Kentucky to Middletown, Ohio as part of the 1950s mass migration to industrial centers. His grandfather worked in an Armco steel plant his whole career, and they raised three kids. That included Vance’s mother, who had Vance, her second child, in 1984, at age 23, with her second husband. By then, the Steel Belt had begun to rust, eventually leaving Middletown “little more than a relic of American industrial glory,” as Vance put it. His childhood was chaotic, laced with dropouts, alcoholics and violence, problems he chalks up to both structural factors—economic insecurity, a culture that “encourages social decay”—and individual bad decisions. Vance’s father was largely out of the picture early, and his mother cycled through husbands, abusive episodes and rehab stints. A product of his environment, moving between homes, sometimes Vance was dysfunctional, too. The only relative stability he had came from his grandparents, who stressed education, but Vance racked up so many unexcused absences from class at one point that the school district threatened his divorced parents with prosecution. He finished his freshman year of high school with a 2.1 grade-point average. Life changed when Vance moved in with his grandmother as a sophomore. (His grandfather had died a few years earlier). He got a part-time job as a cashier, and his grades improved. Vance contemplated college, balked at the price and instead enlisted in the Marines, earning about $1,000 a month after taxes. He served in Iraq and used extra money he won from playing online poker to pay for his grandmother’s health insurance. He also learned how to save money, balance a checkbook and invest. “The Marine Corps,” Vance wrote, “taught me how to live like an adult.” He finished his service in 2007 and enrolled at The Ohio State University. Vance excelled, graduating in less than two years, then went to Yale Law School in 2010. Military service and financial aid helped Vance avoid accruing massive debt—and high-paying gigs at elite law firms during his Yale years helped, too. He graduated in 2013, and today, Vance has no student debt. Equipped with a law degree, Vance and his girlfriend, Yale classmate Usha Chilukuri, both clerked in Cincinnati for a year, then married soon after, changing their last names to “Vance.” The newlyweds moved to Washington D.C., where Usha clerked for then-circuit court judge Brett Kavanaugh and Vance started at a corporate law firm. They purchased a home east of the Capitol building in August 2014 for $590,000, borrowing just over $600,000 to pay for it. The home is worth about $850,000 today, and they owe an estimated $480,000 against it—the only debt they appear to have on their balance sheet. Vance and his wife, Usha, appeared on the floor of the Republican National Convention Monday night, where he was acclaimed Trump's VP nominee. Next, the couple headed to the Left Coast, where Usha started at the San Francisco office of Munger, Tolles and Olson. J.D. pivoted to tech, finding like-minded conservative circles in Silicon Valley. He worked at a biotech outfit, then joined Mithril, a venture capital firm founded by Paypal billionaire Peter Thiel. I n 2016, Vance published “Hillbilly Elegy,” which launched him onto the national stage, turning a poor kid from Ohio into a more genteel spokesperson for the white working class than the rich guy from New York. Vance appeared on CNN and graced the pages of The New York Times, but he didn’t always enjoy his new role, unsettled by his proximity to what he now terms “the liberal establishment.” In 2017, Vance announced that he was moving back to Ohio and starting an organization to fight the opioid epidemic. It didn’t go well. Our Ohio Renewal raised $220,000 in 2017 and spent $45,000 on a survey, $71,000 on salaries and wages, $63,000 on management and $11,000 on advertising and promotions. His wife, meanwhile, left her law firm in 2017 to clerk for Chief Justice John Roberts, then returned to private practice in D.C. at the same firm. J.D. pivoted back to startups, joining AOL billionaire Steve Case in his efforts to invest in VC-starved Middle America. In 2018, Vance and his wife bought a $1.4 million home in Cincinnati’s left-leaning East Walnut Hills—his neighborhood voted for Joe Biden in 2020 by 40 points. Forbes estimates that the house, now owned by an LLC, is worth about $1.8 million. Online listings say the property contains 5 bedrooms and 4,700 square feet, offering plenty of room for Vance, his wife and their three kids. A year after buying the Cincinnati home, Vance started his own venture firm, Narya. His investments hinted at his political inclinations. He bet on Rumble, a right-leaning YouTube competitor that now serves as a key partner to Trump’s Truth Social platform. His firm also invested in Strive Asset Management, the fund provider that former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, another Ohioan, founded to take on the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard. By 2021, with somewhere between $3 million and $10 million of venture holdings and liquid assets, Vance moved on to a new challenge, politics. Thiel, his old venture partner, seeded a U.S. Senate run with $10 million, then pitched in another $5 million as the race heated up. Other billionaires who had crossed paths with Vance in the business world declined to donate anything. Something had changed about Vance. Once a “never-Trump” Republican, he began bowing down to the former president, ultimately winning Trump’s endorsement. It was enough to beat former Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, and Vance stayed loyal to Trump after winning. On Saturday, he blamed Joe Biden for the assassination attempt that nearly killed Trump. As a Senate candidate, Vance leaned hard into right-wing messaging on immigration, Ukraine and support for former president Trump. Vance’s triumphant return to Washington D.C. came with another real estate investment in a blue area—in early 2023, he dropped $1.6 million on a 2,500-square-foot home in Alexandria, Virginia, which voted by huge margins for Biden in 2020. Asked if Vance has friends in the area, one neighbor said, “No, God, no, no,” before noting that Sean Spicer lives nearby. Forbes estimates Vance’s home is worth about $1.8 million today, bringing his total real estate holdings across three homes to around $4 million. He may not need the house in Virginia for long. If Vance becomes vice president, as polls currently suggest he will, he and his family will be able to move into the Naval Observatory, the official vice presidential residence, 10 minutes from the White House and hundreds of miles from hillbilly country.

Title: For investors, does it matter who wins the US election?

Larry Fink of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is “tired of hearing this is the biggest election in your lifetime”. The reality, says Fink, “is over time it doesn’t matter”. Is he right? Ordinarily, yes. With stock returns, there are many more important factors than politics. Stocks usually rise no matter who is in power, so professionals routinely advise investors not to fret about politics. Some republicans believed Obama would be terrible for stocks. Some Democrats panicked when Trump was elected in 2016. Nevertheless, stocks rose in both instances. As Dimensional Fund Advisors founder David Bloom notes, “shareholders are investing in companies, not in politicians”. Stocks may well rise significantly during a second Trump administration, and many on Wall Street are enthused about possible corporate tax cuts and deregulation. Nevertheless, Fink’s nonchalance is misplaced. Trump is no ordinary politician. Tariffs, trade wars, huge budget deficits, increased inflation expectations, further deglobalisation, mass deportations – one sees why 23 Nobel economists recently penned a letter endorsing Kamala Harris. Worse, Trump’s authoritarian instincts are deeply problematic. As Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf warns, Trump “is at the very least ‘fascistic’ and can be credibly called a fascist”. Autocracy is not good for investors, with research showing a strong link between democracy and stock returns. Capitalism relies on independent courts and institutions to ensure fair rules and support a stable market environment. Replacing civil servants with political appointees could endanger reliable reporting of economic data. Additionally, investors should be alarmed by Trump’s desire to end the Federal Reserve’s independence and give the president influence over rate policy. Now, some argue Trump’s bark is worse than his bite. Even if there is institutional erosion, it might unfold slowly, so stocks may do just fine under a Trump presidency. A bad president can still be good for stocks. Still, ignoring political risks may no longer be wise; healthy markets require healthy democratic institutions.

Title: Great restaurants around Ireland for a night out

Almost a year in, Niall Davidson has settled into his Canal Docks location. A new casual bar and bottle shop has just opened and there are plans for a test kitchen, which is an indication of where his ambitions lie. The food is as spectacular as ever, with freshly landed fish, seafood, pork chops and hunks of beef from six-year old ex-dairy cows cooked over a custom-built Rhys Allen levitation grill. Corinna Hardgrave Andra Bhavan has branched out to Abbey Street with its extensive menu of southern Indian dishes and it now has Ireland’s first South Indian cocktail bar. The menu stretches from breakfast-style dosas, idlis, and vadas to heartier fare as the day moves on, such as mixed thali platters, Gutti Vankaya curry, lamb Chettinadu, and birianis. If you know the Marlborough Street original, expect much of the same, with the bonus of cocktails. CH Gaz Smith has built a reputation for seafood and steak that few can rival. His dedication to delivering the freshest seafood extends to rising at the crack of dawn to get the catch direct from local boats, and on busy days, the contents of their indulgent seafood platters can change three to four times. With steaks from Hannan’s, and an extensive wine list, Big Mike’s is a spot for celebrations big and small. Joanne Cronin Foxrock locals are lucky to have this spot, run by Alan and Elaine Wang. Start with Castletownbere crab on sourdough or pan-fried scallops, and move on to the decadent shellfish risotto. The 45-day dry-aged rib-eye steak, paired with crispy onions and a rich Béarnaise, and sole on the bone are cooked with pinpoint precision. The well-priced wine list rounds off the experience. CH A long-established fixture in Ireland’s Chinese restaurant scene, China Sichuan offers elevated Sichuan cooking in comfortable surroundings. Second-generation owner Kevin Hui and his team of classically trained chefs have developed a menu that combines the best of Sichuan flavours with Irish ingredients. Look out for beef tenderloin with black pepper and merlot, Sichuan favourite dan-dan noodles or delightful luóbo gao (crispy turnip cubes). JC Aishling Moore is one of the sharpest culinary talents in the country, her cooking driven by a “whole catch” philosophy that keeps things exciting and unpredictable. Much of her menu depends on what the day boats haul in, allowing her to flex her creative muscles on the fly. Her approach to flavour is as agile as it is bold, starting with Rossmore oysters topped with elderflower vinegar granita, and moving on to larger plates such as pan-roasted hake, paired with tomatillo kakut and a punchy beetroot acchar. CH Gursha operates as a supper club with a €29.90 tasting menu, so you’ll need to book and pay in advance. Prepared by Ethiopian native Yagerenesh Tadesse, (known to all as Mamay), her slow-cooked, berbere-spiced dishes, brimming with onions and chillies, are mostly vegetarian and served family-style on vast platters of injera, the tangy fermented bread made from teff. The food is bold, hearty and shared. Their next big project is brewing Ethiopian honey wine (mead), which is still in the experimental phase. CH Eric Mathews’ and Richie Barrett’s restaurant exploded on to the scene a year ago, making an immediate impact with its fiery cooking and bold flavours. The menu jumps from light bites to sharing plates, with pasta and meats kissed by flames. The potato focaccia with carbonara butter feels almost criminal in its indulgence, while Matthews’ Irish coffee riff on tiramisu is rich and delicious. It’s brash, unapologetic, and full throttle flavour. CH Kevin Burke’s restaurant is the kind of place where getting a table feels like winning the lottery – it’s one of the hottest bookings around. It’s a buzzy room with food that is sharp and inventive. Kick off with small plates such as crispy rabbit paired with sauce gribiche, before graduating to heavier hitters such as hamachi belly. Downstairs, a private diningroom for six-to-10 people can be yours with enough advance notice, and a minimum spend to match the experience. CH When chef Gráinne O’Keeffe was seeking to name her first restaurant, it was only natural to name it after her late grandmother Mae. It’s housed above the French Paradox wine shop, O’Keeffe’s seasonal cooking complemented by wine pairings sourced from below. The glorious tarte Tatin and selection of handmade knives have become fixtures, and in good news for locals, she has recently added a Friday lunchtime service. JC When chef Luis Martin took over the former Old Couch Café, he maintained its quirky nature, all the while putting his Spanish stamp on the menu. Bringing experience from his time in the kitchen at three-Michelin-starred restaurant Cenador de Amos, he seamlessly integrates Irish produce into dishes such as rabbit and carrot escabeche or quail and dark chocolate. Plans are under way with a local farmer to grow vegetables for next year’s menus. JC Regardless of whether you are dining during daytime or night-time, the large glass windows at Ox provide a sense of openness to this beautiful, understated room close to the river Lagan. Refurbished in 2023, it is the canvas on which chef Stephen Toman and sommelier Alain Kerloc’h paint their magic. Look out for smoked Ballywalter veal with black garlic or lobster with broad beans and lemon grass. JC Owners Alice Jary and Richard Kennan draw on their vast experience and travels to produce contemporary dishes such as Velvet Cloud labneh and peaches, adorned with glorious green beans and hazelnuts, or flavourful shiitake and tofu dumplings with Szechuan vinegar and roasted seaweed. With bar and restaurant seating, plus a creative cocktail list, and open from lunch to late night, Rúibín is truly a gem in Galway. JC Fidelity Studio is now linked to Fidelity Bar by a sleek interior door, making it easy to drift between the two. Sister 7′s menu, a collab with Big Fan, features dumplings, bao and inventive sharing plates. Don’t skip the “lip sticks”, deep-fried vegetable cakes of fermented rice, celeriac, yam and tofu. DJs spin tunes from a bright orange booth, keeping the energy alive as the night rolls on. CH The Dunmore is a space built for celebrations – dramatic, lively and perfect for catching up with friends over fresh seafood and sizzling dishes from the charcoal-burning oven. Midweek, the early-evening menu – two/three courses for €29/€35 – is particularly good value, with Duncannon mussels, seafood pie, fire-roasted chicken and a Pat McLoughlin beef burger featuring. For larger groups, the mezzanine is your spot, hosting up to 20 people. CH Knockranny has taken a more laid-back approach with the rebranding of La Fougère into The Fern Grill, now focused on relaxed dining, local ingredients and a new cocktail counter. Head chef Seamus Commons fires up daily catches, dry-aged Irish Black Angus, and lamb on the Josper Basque charcoal grill. Choose from the a la carte or the €55, five-course Taste of Knockranny menu. CH Owner and chef Brian Murray describes his style as “cooked with grá and kissed with a little fire”. Since returning to his native city, he has transformed the former Old Thompsons Bakery building into a modern, stylish restaurant. The menus change regularly, offering dishes of black sole with surf clams or Fitzgerald’s lamb served family style. JC The Tannery has become synonymous with modern Irish cooking, combining a cookery school and elegant town house accommodation with Paul and Máire Flynn’s famous restaurant. Chef Damien Derwin has shouldered Paul’s legacy, maintaining the tradition of hearty and creative food made with local ingredients. The revamped website now makes it easier than ever to book an overnight B&B stay with dinner. JC Having spent many years travelling the world and working at Belfast’s Yugo, chef Sean Lafferty opened Umi to share his love for Asian flavours. Umi has a vibrant atmosphere that seamlessly reflects the creative food including binchotan grilled Wagyu steak, and crispy dumplings made with local pork and chilli nut oil. They even offer their own wine, Rainbow Pie, a fresh Austrian Blaufränkisch made by ex-employee Jack Mcateer, with plans to add a white wine. JC Morgan VanderKamer, president of the Irish Guild of Sommeliers, co-owns this Waterford spot, so the wine list is exceptional. Her partner, Stephen McArdle, ensures the food is equally impressive. The menu focuses on wild fish and seasonal ingredients, with dishes such as Kilmore Quay crab with pickled cucumber, free-range pork terrine with foie gras, and roasted monkfish with smoked almond romesco and fennel.

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Eastern Europe has recorded increased crypto adoption, with DeFi transactions as the key driver. The region received more than $499 billion worth of crypto assets between July 2023 and June this year. Moreover, Eastern Europe contributes over 11% of the total crypto value worldwide and ranks as the fourth-largest global crypto market. Eastern Europe has recorded significant growth in its crypto adoption within the past few months. In a recent report, on-chain analytics company Chainalysis indicated the region received about $499.14 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Further, the report revealed that the region now ranks globally as the fourth-largest crypto market. Its digital assets activity accounted for 11% of the cumulative global inflows within the period under analysis. In detail, decentralized finance (DeFi) activity within Eastern Europe saw a remarkable surge. The region recorded over $165 billion of DeFi-related transactions, representing a third of its total crypto deals within the period. Amid the events of war and turbulence within the region, DeFi activity grew by almost 40% in Eastern Europe. Moreover, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) witnessed more inflows, especially from Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus. These positive indications placed Eastern Europe third in global DeFi adoption, only behind Latin America and Sub-Africa. Amid the growing DeFi engagement, centralized exchanges (CEXs) still dominate crypto activity within the region. The report indicated that the CEXs received more than $324 billion in crypto asset transactions. Russia and Ukraine pioneer crypto adoption and growth within Eastern Europe with remarkable crypto transaction volumes amid their ongoing war and turbulent events. According to Chainalysis, Russia recorded over $182 billion in crypto assets flows to emerge at the top. Ukraine trails in the second position, with transaction flows amounting to more than $106 billion. Also, DEXs in Russia and Ukraine posted inflows growth of over 173% and 160%, respectively. Meanwhile, the Chainalysis report indicated that Ukraine and Russia ranked sixth and seventh in the 2024 global crypto adoption index. Ukraine made the most drive in the market’s activity in institutional and professional transfers. The country’s prominent activity came from large institutional transfers of over $10 million and mid-sized institutional transfers between $1 million and $10 million. A leading CEX in Ukraine, WhiteBIT, acknowledged the positive overturn of crypto transactions. WhiteBIT told Chainalysis: “Institutional and professional crypto transfers in Ukraine have surged as many seek financial stability amid the ongoing war, with cryptocurrencies viewed as a safer alternative.” Also, WhiteBIt highlighted certain factors that fueled the spike in crypto adoption and transfers in the country. These include inflation, market volatility, war-related sanctions, and the increasing institutional attraction in Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like BlackRock. Citing order book data, the Chainalysis report also noted that Bitcoin acquisition via the Ukraine hryvnia surged drastically over the past year, above $882 million. This trend reflects that Ukrainians have potentially adopted Bitcoin as a reliable store of value and inflation hedge.

Title: Florida CFO Sees a Potential Growth of the State’s Crypto Portfolio Under a Trump Presidency

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Florida’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Jimmy Patronis predicts an explosive growth of the state’s crypto portfolio under a Trump presidency. Patronis recommended the inclusion of digital assets as the state’s retirement fund as a means of diversification. The CFO highlighted some optimism anticipations via a potential win for Trump in the upcoming elections. In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Florida’s CFO, Jimmy Patronis, expressed a strong belief in the possibilities of crypto assets. He mentioned that the state’s crypto portfolio would experience explosive growth under Trump’s presidency. During the discussion, Patronis disclosed that Florida’s retirement fund holds $800 million in digital asset-based investments. However, he believes the state’s digital asset holdings could surge with a pro-crypto US president. Regarding the state’s cryptocurrency portfolio, Patronis said he would “not be shocked to be able to see that growing under a Trump administration.” The CFO said Trump’s victory in the elections will positively impact Florida’s digital asset adoption. The situation will translate to a remarkable spike in crypto-related investments in Florida and the entire country. Further, Patronis advocated that the state should deepen its digital asset engagements. In his recent letter to the executive director of Florida’s State Board of Administration, the CFO recommended Florida’s retirement fund should include more crypto-based investments. Patronis wrote: “As the Chinese Communist Party engages more in the cryptocurrency realm, action is necessary. Trump has mentioned forming a cryptocurrency presidential advisory council and using the US government’s current cryptocurrency holdings to establish a national BTC reserve.” Also, Patronis expressed his eagerness and anticipation for more growth within the digital asset industry if Trump returns to the White House. He slammed crypto skeptics over their negative stance on the assets. He mentioned that those who neglect crypto are making a huge mistake. In addition, Patronis reiterated his commitment to push forward the relevance of crypto inclusion in the state’s investments. He pointed out that the move would come with beneficial results for the state in the long run. Moreover, he noted that great possibilities of cryptocurrency are not just emerging; they are already here. In his campaign, Trump has indicated a more supportive stance for the cryptocurrency industry. He promised to revolutionize the crypto sector in the US and position the country as a global leader in the industry. Moreover, Trump’s team suggested that the Federal Reserve should create a Bitcoin reserve with an annual billion purchases. Amid his bullish stance on crypto, Patronis showed concern regarding the government’s overreach through Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). The CFO stated: “We need to be able to have a hedge against this massive overreach by the federal government with a centralized currency.” Besides Florida, some US states, including New Jersey and Wisconsin, have considered the possibilities of crypto investments. In May, Wisconsin acquired 94,562 shares of BlackRock Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) worth almost $100 million. Similarly, in July, New Jersey filed its documents to the SEC to allocate some Jersey City pension fund percentages to Bitcoin ETFs.

Title: AI-Powered Private Credit Will Shape The Future Of Lending
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/donmuir/2024/11/03/ai-powered-private-credit-will-shape-the-future-of-lending/
Time Published: 2024-11-03T23:41:40Z

Creative engineering, vintage illustration of the head of a man with an electronic circuit board for ... [+] a brain, 1949. Screen print. (Illustration by GraphicaArtis/Getty Images) Good times are rolling in private credit: more flexible terms and fewer regulations have made it easier to access and underwrite businesses that have been left behind by old-guard giants like J.P. Morgan. The private credit market, at a projected $1.7 trillion in loan volume for full-year 2024, could more than double to $3.4 trillion in just four years, BlackRock says. It's been headline after headline of multi billion dollar deals into hot companies, and funded by some of the largest asset managers in the world. In July, Ares Management closed on a $34 billion private credit fund, one of the largest ever. In October, Apollo allied with Citigroup to form a $25 billion private lending fund for “strategic transactions,” and it may grow from there. The scale of private credit is extremely vast. Giants serving giants, companies with nine or 10 digits in annual revenue and AUM alike serving one another. In May, Blackstone set up a $7.5 billion debt facility for CoreWeave, an AI hyperscaler with half a billion dollars in annual revenue. Just last week, the Financial Times reported that “once high-flying fintechs” like Klarna, SoFi, and Upstart are “literally passing the buck to private credit” on tens of billions of dollars worth of loans. Headline after headline indeed. There’s a big gulf between the balance sheet of the shiniest of these companies and the lower middle market - companies bringing in even tens of millions annually are often too small and overlooked by these giant lenders. And with commercial banks retrenching from direct lending due to regulatory pressures, rising interest rates, and regional banking volatility, a growing gap has emerged for private credit to fill in the middle market. Running a complex private debt deal takes a lot of man power, but the delta of hours between a $50M process and a $500M process actually isn’t that wide. The credit box is different but the financial analysis is largely the same. I know this firsthand because my company Arc processes hundreds of private credit transactions across this sizing spectrum every quarter. And when I was a private equity associate, the deal teams never exceeded 3 people (Associate, Principal, Partner), whether the equity check was $250 million or $3 billion. Bigger deals take precedent as they require the same amount of time but produce significantly larger payouts for investors. Qualification and underwriting of private debt is labor-intensive and expensive. Managing a portfolio is also operationally onerous. While lower middle market companies can deliver better risk adjusted returns on average with less competitive deal dynamics than their peers upmarket, it’s simply too challenging to deploy capital at scale downmarket for larger funds. Data is unstructured and inconsistent. Deal teams have finite time and resources. Credit analysts can only spend so many hours toiling in data rooms to deliver complex financial analyses and produce credit memos. If a fund wanted to reduce its average transaction size from $250M to $50M, it would need to underwrite at least 5x the volume of deals. Without scalable infrastructure, this means dramatically increasing payroll costs for the fund. This simply isn’t viable. Private credit purveyors need to find new ways to serve these smaller businesses, too. With the adoption of AI, private investors will be able to serve this huge demand without having to double their staff. AI will allow lenders to analyze financial data at a deeper level, faster and more efficiently than ever before. As the technology continues to improve, and is adopted by high-octane private credit funds, they can originate and underwrite more private credit opportunities with the same resources, without sacrificing precision. AI should also reduce loss ratios, based on ever smarter, more comprehensive credit models that become more accurate as they ingest more private company data and performance history. It is difficult to track the precise gains afforded by AI, but here is one hint. Asked whether the private-credit market is a threat to his bank, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said lenders are “providing credit sometimes we can't provide, because of the amount of leverage a fund can take versus us. But what gives us the strength in commercial banking is the customer relationships.” A nice way for a too big to fail bank to politely say that big banks are struggling to keep up. Perhaps BofA should take a page out of Citi’s book and spin up a private credit facility with Apollo or Blackstone to better serve its commercial banking clients? The reality is that we’re seeing the tip of the iceberg. Private credit is already outperforming traditional banks upmarket on megadeals backed by deep-pocketed private investors like Apollo, Blackstone and Golub. When the private credit universe adopts AI en masse, they’ll eat the traditional banks' lunch through the lower middle market as well. This is how ExecThread, a New York-based talent marketplace whose revenue grew eight-fold in a year, was able to line up millions in financing from Decathlon Capital Partners in a matter of weeks. It’s also how IDMission, a Boulder-based Biometric ID software platform with tens of millions in annual sales landed new financing from a private credit fund in just a few weeks. In just the first week, says CEO Ashim Banerjee, he was able to tap a broad network of lenders and compare multiple competitive term sheets and deal structures by leveraging AI. “It gave us the flexibility to choose the optimal deal for IDMission,” he says. These deals were discovered, negotiated, and executed on a new private-credit marketplace: Arc Capital Markets, which my fintech firm launched in January and has since ingested $4 billion in loan volume. Our proprietary software features disruptive AI technology that helps massively accelerate the workflow of private credit lenders. There is an insatiable demand for private credit and a relative shortfall in supply. The advent and adoption of breakthrough technology will help bridge this gap by allowing investment funds to do more with their time. The marriage of AI with private credit will democratize access to the debt capital markets for the middle market businesses who power the US economy. We will go deeper into this, up next.

Title: Tesla (TSLA) Stock: A Risky Bet on Future Promises?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks to Watch in November. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stands against other trending AI stocks to watch in November. Amid soaring valuations of AI stocks, beginner investors keep wondering whether they are too late to the AI party. However, investing experts believe that opportunities abound in the AI space because of the nature of this technological revolution. While talking to Wall Street Journal during the WSJ Tech Live Conference, venture capitalist Martin Casado, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, explained why he believes there is no such thing as “too late” when it comes to AI for now. “When it comes to AI, it really feels like the marginal cost of language, reasoning and creation are going to zero. And if that’s the case, this is a supercycle. And if that’s the case, we’ve got decades. So there’s no “too late.” In that sense, we’re still very, very early.” The AI revolution is quickly entering the phase where we are seeing real-life use cases as AI is helping companies significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency. According to a detailed report published by Benesch’s AI Commission, an AI-based tool that monitors real-time data from electronic medical records reduced unexpected deaths in hospitalized internal medicine patients by 26%. Casado also talked about the usability of AI models for actual problem-solving: “Everybody looks at the OpenAIs. But as far as value creation and integration, if you look at all the private companies, the smaller companies that are building their own smaller models, they are some of the fastest-growing companies we’ve seen in the history of the industry.” Also Read 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now. For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending on latest news and earnings. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 85 Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management recently said the following about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) during a program on CNBC: “In the near term, the setup was all about timing, and Elon talked about two years before we see this. You make the adjustment, it is three-plus years away. Also, they didn’t talk about that all-important, more affordable Model 2. I think most people had expected that. The Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) event was indeed short on details. Notably absent was the discussion of a “more affordable” model that Musk had previously mentioned to boost confidence in Tesla’s vehicle sales growth outlook. What about the $30,000 price tag claim? Musk has indicated that the Cybercab will have a production cost of approximately $30,000. Operating within the robotaxi fleet is projected to cost around $0.20 per mile. With a production cost of $30,000, the retail price of the Cybercab is likely to exceed this figure. For instance, if the Cybercab is priced at $30,000 per unit, that translates to $15,000 per seat. In contrast, the average price per passenger seat in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s most affordable long-range RWD Model 3—factoring in full self-driving (FSD) licensing—is under $10,000 ($29,990 post-incentive vehicle price plus $8,000 for the FSD license, divided by four passenger seats). Regarding operational costs, while the Cybercab is expected to cost $0.20 per mile, charging the Model 3 is estimated at under $0.10 per mile, leaving a significant margin to cover maintenance and downtime. There is a lot of hype around Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) robo taxis but many believe they will not be enough to fix the company’s long-term challenges. What are these challenges? Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) product lineup is showing signs of stagnation, with over 95% of sales still coming from the Model 3 and Model Y. Meanwhile, competitors are rolling out more advanced models. Even Rivian’s CEO suggested Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) could be nearing market saturation for these models. According to Reuters, Tesla’s market share in Europe is slipping as legacy automakers like BMW post stronger sales. Chinese competitor BYD is also gaining ground in Europe, despite talk of tariffs. ClearBridge Small Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “The strength in the stock market adds significantly to that enormous transfer of wealth, which one could argue is good for shareholders. But is it causal? That is, did the stock market do well because CEOs got large stock grants? Are the CEOs just the lucky recipients of a windfall when the market goes up and their employees perform well? Or do they require huge grants to do their jobs that no one else could possibly do as effectively? Overall, TSLA ranks 10th on our list of trending AI stocks to watch in November. While we acknowledge the potential of TSLA, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TSLA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Solventum Corporation (SOLV): A Promising Medical Stock with Growth Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Most Promising Medical Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Solventum Corporation (NYSE:SOLV) stands against other most promising medical stocks. The healthcare sector depends on medical technology advancements, particularly devices used in disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Unlike pharmaceuticals, medical devices work through physical or mechanical means rather than chemical processes. Key products include pacemakers, imaging equipment, dialysis machines, and implants. Like many other industries, the medical device industry was greatly affected by the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, the In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) segment saw significant revenue growth in 2020 and 2021, mostly due to the increased demand for PCR and fast testing. Overall, even while funding for digital health had been rising gradually in the years preceding the pandemic, it saw a notable uptick in 2021, hitting around $45 billion, more than all of the funds amassed between 2010 and 2017. The global market for medical devices, estimated to be worth $570 billion in 2022, is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.8% from 2023 to 2032, reaching over $996.93 billion. By 2032, the U.S. market is expected to have grown to a value of around $246.51 billion, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6%. Key drivers propelling the medical devices market’s expansion in the upcoming years are the rise in demand for cutting-edge treatments and continuous technical developments in medical devices to meet unmet demands in the healthcare industry. The importance of the medical devices sector, which employed over 329,000 people and generated $25.8 billion in payroll in 2020, is highlighted by the U.S. Cluster Mapping Tool. The 2023 EY Medical Technology study highlights supply chain management and financing as two important topics for Medtech leaders worldwide. In 2022, R&D expenditure returned to historical norms, despite reaching a record $24.7 billion. A significant drop in mergers and acquisitions is also noted in the report which indicates a diminished emphasis on inorganic growth tactics. Artificial intelligence (AI) and other technologies have revolutionized patient monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment in the healthcare industry. Applications of AI include predicting results using electronic health information and evaluating radiological images for early detection. One noteworthy instance was when NVIDIA Corporation and Medtronic announced in March 2023 that they would be integrating NVIDIA’s AI technology into Medtronic’s FDA-approved GI Genius, an intelligent endoscopic module that helps detect precancerous growths. Also Read 10 Best Healthcare Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds and 10 Best Mid-Cap Healthcare Stocks to Buy Now. For our methodology, we began by filtering medical stocks from healthcare equipment ETFs. Next, we identified those with the highest number of hedge fund holders as of Q2 2024, using data from the Insider Monkey database. The final selection was ranked based on the number of hedge fund holders to prioritize stocks with greater institutional interest. “Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).” Photo by National Cancer Institute on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 37 Solventum Corporation (NYSE:SOLV), a newly independent healthcare company that spun off from 3M in April 2024, develops and sells a wide range of medical products, including wound care, surgical supplies, dental products, healthcare software, and filtration systems. Solventum Corp is implementing a 3-phased approach to stabilize its business, reposition for growth, and optimize its portfolio. Phase 1 involves establishing a new mission, acquiring talent, and restructuring for agility while managing its separation from 3M. As part of the separation, the company is relocating manufacturing lines from 67 plants to 29 Solventum plants, with 2 new facilities under construction. Additionally, Solventum Corporation (NYSE:SOLV) is restructuring its distribution and supply chain by reducing the number of distribution centers from 122 to 73. The rebranding efforts are extensive, covering over 90 countries, and management has adjusted commercial distribution models in more than 60 countries. In Q2 2024, Solventum Corp reported revenue of $2.08 billion. The MedSurg segment grew by 1.8% year-over-year, driven by negative pressure wound therapy and antimicrobial IV site management solutions. However, the Dental segment saw a 2% decline due to volume pressures from challenging market conditions. The HIS segment increased by 3.6%, fueled by the adoption of the 360 Encompass and steady performance management solutions. The Purification and Filtration segment experienced a slight decrease of 0.9%, impacted by performance in drinking water filtration. Overall, SOLV ranks 6th on our list of most promising medical stocks according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of SOLV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SOLV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Move over swing states: Control of Congress runs through New York — and costs a lot

Published Nov 1, 2024 Modified Nov 3, 2024 Share Published Nov 1, 2024 Modified Nov 3, 2024 Share Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2024. Donate today Gothamist is funded by sponsors and member donations What’s it cost to try to win a handful of New York congressional races that could help tip the balance of power in Washington? The answer is $146 million … so far. Democrats and Republicans have zeroed in on six House districts in the Empire State that are potentially up for grabs on Election Day. Most of them are in New York City’s suburbs in the Hudson Valley and Long Island. The political donor class has responded by putting its money where its collective mouth is and pumping tens of millions of dollars into each race. That money has been used to blanket the airwaves in an attempt to influence some of the nation's most consequential House races. Here’s a look at the key New York congressional contests by the numbers. … New York’s sprawling 19th District, which stretches all the way from the mid-Hudson Valley to Ithaca. The bitter rematch between Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro and Democratic attorney Josh Riley has attracted about $41 million in spending so far this cycle, according to Federal Elections Commission filings. That’s the second-highest total in the country, just behind a House race in California, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks election spending. A total of 32 outside groups have put about $27 million into the race, funding a barrage of ads — most of them negative — focusing on immigration, abortion and more. Elsewhere in the state, the Hudson Valley battle between incumbent GOP Rep. Mike Lawler and former Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones is also one of the country’s most expensive races, coming in at roughly $36 million. The bulk of the spending — about $90 million — is coming from outside groups, which are allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money. The biggest spenders include the Congressional Leadership Fund, a national PAC dedicated to electing Republicans that has spent $25.8 million on the six New York races alone. Its biggest donors include Timothy Mellon, a banking heir and major GOP benefactor, and Kenneth Griffin, the CEO of hedge fund Citadel. The House Majority PAC — a pro-Democrat organization — has spent about $15 million. Its biggest donor is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Battleground New York, a PAC supporting Democrats that is largely funded by labor unions, has spent more than $4 million on the six races; it also spent about $1.6 million on Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, who is back on the ballot after winning a key special election to replace expelled Republican Rep. George Santos earlier this year. Suozzi is facing Republican Michael LiPetri. All told, 70 different outside groups have spent at least some money trying to influence the key New York races. That includes groups like Bloomberg’s gun safety organization Everytown, which has spent about $1.6 million supporting Democratic candidates or criticizing their Republican opponents, according to Federal Elections Commission data. On the Republican side, the National Association of Realtors’ PAC has spent about $2.8 million supporting Lawler and Molinaro. Two-thirds of the money has gone toward negative ads or efforts that oppose a candidate. The remaining third has gone to positive ads or efforts that support a candidate, according to the filings. An organized collective of 99 well-heeled donors, most of them from the tristate area, provided a big boost to three New York Democrats in battleground races. It’s called the House Victory Fund, and its donors collectively contributed more than $500,000 each to Jones, Riley and Laura Gillen, a Long Island Democrat challenging Rep. Anthony D’Esposito. It’s a significant chunk of change. In all three cases in New York, the fund is listed as the candidates’ biggest donor, though it’s really a collection of donations. The fund raised more than $8 million from individuals this year – more than $6 million of which came from people who listed a New York address. That includes many Wall Street types, including former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and a wide array of financiers, executives and employees with various investment funds, as Politico reported earlier this year. Other donors who gave to the national fundraising effort include Laurie Tisch, whose family owns the New York Giants; Kamal Patel, CEO of Ellkay, a health care data management company; philanthropists David and Susan Rockefeller; and Elizabeth Economy of the Hoover Institution. New York City isn’t expected to see any competitive congressional elections this year. So why has a Brooklyn representative raised far more than any other House candidate in the country? Don’t think too hard. It’s House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who has more at stake this election cycle than just about anyone not named Trump or Harris. If Democrats win a national majority, Jeffries would be in line to make history as the first Black speaker of the House. He’s raised huge amounts of money to make it happen. That includes a staggering $21.8 million for his individual campaign account, which he’s used to support the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and individual candidates around the country. It’s over $4 million more than current House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, the No. 2 fundraiser. FEC records show Jeffries’ campaign has thousands of individual contributors from across the nation. He’s also received contributions from hundreds of committees controlled by labor unions and special special interest groups — which includes names like CVS Health, SEIU, Deloitte, BlackRock and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, better known as AIPAC. Aside from Jeffries, two other members of New York state's House delegation cracked the list of top 10 fundraisers this cycle: Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of the North Country ($14 million) and Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of the Bronx ($13.3 million), who both have significant national profiles. There are two key House races on Long Island: The battle for the Suffolk County-based 1st District between GOP Rep. Nick LaLota and Democrat John Avlon, and D’Esposito’s rematch against Gillen, the former Hempstead supervisor, in the 4th District. So far, the Gillen-D’Esposito race has proven to be more expensive — clocking in around $27 million. As the incumbent, D’Esposito’s campaign spending has received recent media scrutiny. A story from CNN raised questions about why his campaign spent more than $102,000 on food and beverages, including more than $23,000 at steakhouses, bars and liquor stores. “The last time I checked, nobody wants to go to political fundraisers at a fast food restaurant. So you need to spend money in order to raise money,” D’Esposito told Gothamist. He said he needed to cultivate new donors to make a successful run in a very competitive district, “and that's what it takes to do it.” Aside from the races in the Hudson Valley and Long Island, the other competitive New York race comes in central New York. That’s where first-term Republican Rep. Brandon Williams is trying to hang on in a race against Democratic state Sen. John Mannion. Brigid Bergin contributed reporting.

Singer takes over Phibsborough pub Pub landlord and music star Gavin James IRISH pop star Gavin James is set to become his native Dublin’s latest celebrity publican. The international chart-topping singer songwriter – famous for hits such as Nervous and Always – is the new proprietor of Doyle’s Corner bar in the city’s northside suburb of Phibsborough. The official opening of the iconic Dublin pub, which dates back to 1873, will be held this coming Wednesday night when the globally famous new owner will pull pints and sing for his customers in a one-off performance. Time Out magazine in recent years named Phibsborough as one of the world’s coolest neighbourhoods, putting it on the map for visitors to the city. Now fans of Gavin James, who also lives in Phibsborough, are set to flock to the area in the hope of meeting the singer in his bar. Gavin James is the new proprietor of Doyle’s Corner bar “This is a really positive story at a time when there is doom and gloom in the Irish hospitality industry with pubs and restaurants closing,” one Dublin businessman told the Sunday World. “More than 2,000 pubs have closed around Ireland since 2005 and it’s a constant struggle for bars and restaurants to stay open due to rising costs of running their businesses.” James, whose fans include Ed Sheeran and James Blunt, joins a string of personalities who own bars around Dublin city. The include a group of former Irish rugby players – Rob and Dave Kearney, Jamie Heaslip and Sean O’Brien – who run Lemon & Duke, The Bridge 1859, The Blackrock and Little Lemon. They also recently purchased Ranelagh’s most famous pub, McSorley’s, for €5.5 million. James – real name Wigglesworth – is Dublin city born and reared and grew up on Manor Street. Showbusiness runs in Gavin’s family, as his great grandparents were opera singers, and his grandfather, Jimmy Mac, was a well-known comic in the 1970s. Gavin James on stage His own career in music has come full circle, as he started off singing in the pubs in Temple Bar before hitting the big time. He supported Ed Sheeran at Croke Park and Taylor Swift in London’s Hyde Park and enjoys a huge following around Europe, as well as in Australia and South America. Although he travels the world, James told the Sunday World in a recent interview that his heart is always in Dublin. “I always wanted to do a bit of travelling, but when you’re away you realise you don’t really want to leave for too long,” Gavin said. “I never found a place that felt like home as much as Dublin does. I do like to travel and see foreign places, so I’m very lucky to have the best of both worlds because my career involves a lot of travelling.” Gavin’s manager, Edison Waters, yesterday told the Sunday World that while Doyle’s Corner is not going to be turned into a music bar, there are plans to have singer-songwriters play there at weekends. “Gavin started his own career singing in the pubs, so for people trying to get their leg into the industry there will be no better place to start than in Gavin’s pub,” he said. Trimmed-down singer James, who now maintains a healthy diet and fitness regimen after losing four stone, has never forgotten what it’s like to be a struggling singer-songwriter hustling for support slots on shows by successful bands and artists such as Kodaline and James Blunt in his early years. Kodaline Last year, in association with the mobile network Three, the star took Irish buskers out on his European tour to open his shows. James told the Sunday World how he himself pestered singer Steve Garrigan to bring him on tour with Kodaline. “I annoyed the b*****ks out of him,” Gavin said. “Kodaline were the first people to bring me away. I invited myself on their first UK tour. I wrecked Steve’s head…I kept asking, ‘Steve, can I please come on tour with you?’ And he said, ‘Yeah.’ And then I asked him again and again and again, and he always let me go with them. So thank you, Steve, for that.” Sunday World Newsletter Sign up for the latest news and updates Please check your inbox to verify your details Now download the free app for all the latest Sunday World News, Crime, Irish Showbiz and Sport.

Title: Who are the markets backing in the US election?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Speculators are piling in on the Trump trade, suggesting a Harris victory would come as a surprise For some heavy-hitters in markets, the "worst possible outcome from the US presidential election" is a victory for Kamala Harris, said Katie Martin in the FT. The Democratic candidate's narrowing, or even vanishing, lead in opinion polls – combined with "a big rise in wagers" on her rival in the betting markets – "has been enough to persuade a good chunk of macro hedge fund managers that Donald Trump is on his way back to the White House". For all that, political wonks still reckon the election is a "coin toss" and that betting markets are "unrepresentative and best ignored". BlackRock chief Larry Fink, meanwhile, has argued that the result of the election "really doesn't matter for markets" – a relaxed stance that it's fair to say isn't universal. Many believe that Trump's policies of imposing "aggressive tariffs on imports" and launching "crackdowns on immigration" are inflationary and will have a big effect on bond markets. "For the hedgies holding this view, the Trump trade is very much on." Both long and short-term US bond yields have picked up markedly in the past fortnight: the yield on 10-year Treasuries has risen forcefully higher to around 4.2%. Having been surprised in 2016, "it looks as though the bond market has tried to get that election day jump over with ahead of time in 2024", said John Authers on Bloomberg. But there are some crucial differences. The experience of Trump 1.0 has reduced the "fear of the unknown": the basic outline of what he plans to do is unchanged. "The difference lies in the context." Inflation had been under control for years in 2016 with interest rates "anaesthetised"; now, there's "much less room for manoeuvre". Nor is the "protracted" stock rally that followed Trump's 2016 victory set to be repeated, partly because stocks are at a higher price already. "In the still extremely possible scenario that Harris wins", it would be "great news for European stocks", which would avoid the "numbing effects of Trump tariffs". Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. The other big consideration this time, said DealBook in The New York Times, is the influence of "political prediction markets", and whether they have "artificially inflated Trump's odds". One of the most popular platforms, Polymarket, admits that a single French national, with "extensive trading experience", may have been behind some of the largest bets placed. America's bright economic outlook should help Harris in the campaign's closing stages, said The Economist. Growth is holding up well; prices are rising less quickly; consumer confidence is recovering; and the spending power of "ordinary Americans" is increasing. If Trump wins, it will be in spite of – not because of – the state of the US economy.

Title: Fund Tokenization: How Close To The Next Financial Revolution?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/11/03/fund-tokenization-how-close-to-the-next-financial-revolution/
Time Published: 2024-11-03T06:14:54Z
Full Content:
On October 29, 2024, The Boston Consulting Group, Aptos Labs, and Invesco published a Whitepaper with the title Tokenized Funds: The Third Revolution in Asset Management Decoded. Although the title is interesting and potentially thought-provoking, is there any truth in it? Is fund tokenization the next step in financial evolution, and if so, to what end? (Original Caption) 1889-Trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Photograph, 1889. According to the White Paper, fund tokenization (which they call the third revolution in asset management) offers the potential to create billions of dollars of value for both financial institutions and end investors. It claims that in late 2024, tokenized funds had secured more than USD 2 billion in assets under management by BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and WisdomTree. Even though it is a fraction in comparison to the rest of the AUM by these three entities, this behaviour shows an interest from virtual asset owners. Moreover, more banks seem to roll out tokenized investment funds - the latest has been UBS that released its Money Market Investment Fund Token (uMINT) on November 1, 2024. Fund tokenization is the process of converting ownership of a fund, like a real estate, mutual fund or private equity fund, into digital tokens (on a blockchain). Each token represents a small share or unit of the fund, similar to a stock in a company. Let us compare the company shares and fund tokens: Shares represent traditional pieces of paper or electronic entries within systems managed by stock exchanges or banks. They represent ownership in a company and come with certain rights, like voting on company decisions or receiving dividends. Buying and selling shares usually involves going through brokers, and they’re recorded in centralized financial systems. Business model that has been around for centuries. Now, think of tokens as fully decentralized and digital versions of ownership. They have with similar rights and obligations as the shares, but in their form they are recorded on a decentralized digital ledger. Tokens are different in form because they do not rely on traditional stock exchanges or brokers. Instead, they are fully digital, allowing people to buy and sell them directly, often 24/7, without needing intermediaries. The value of fund tokenization, drawing insights from the BCG Whitepaper and the Bain Company & JP Morgan Analysis, centers on transforming the asset management landscape by creating a more accessible, efficient, and liquid market. Here is a brief overview of the added value: In essence, fund tokenization could offer a significant value by democratizing access, improving liquidity, and increasing efficiency for both investors and asset managers. It positions asset management for future growth, responding to evolving market needs while enhancing investor experience and returns. Potentially, it can also bring more oversigth and trust into the industry. According to InvestaX, certain funds are better suited for tokenization. Particularly, those with high entry barriers, like high minimum investments or geographical restrictions, might benefit from it, as do funds with illiquid assets, such as private equity or real estate. Ideal funds for tokenization include: Investors observe the stock market at an exchange hall on January 6, 2016 in Beijing, China. Before envisioning the next financial revolution, it is also important to recognize the potential risks and limitations of tokenized funds. While neither of the two above mentioned documents address these risks, we should at least consider the following: Tokenized funds represent a fascinating innovation with significant potential value—offering enhanced liquidity, greater accessibility, and operational efficiencies. However, it would be prudent for traditional banks to adopt a more transparent approach regarding the associated risks. A balanced perspective that openly addresses both the advantages and the limitations is essential to build trust among investors and stakeholders. It’s also noteworthy that, just a few years ago, the financial sector largely dismissed crypto assets as speculative or fringe. Now, however, we see major financial institutions not only recognizing but actively embracing the potential of blockchain technology for a range of their own activities. This shift underscores how rapidly perspectives can change, as the underlying technology of digital assets begins to reshape traditional finance in meaningful ways. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast

A top executive of a New York-based global investment firm made an audacious claim that Bitcoin breaching the six-figure price will happen very soon. SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci said that in the next two years, BTC will be traded at $176,000, joining other crypto investors who believed that the oldest cryptocurrency is ripe for a six-figure price per coin. Scaramucci hailed the alpha crypto asset for sustaining a price surge in only a short period, adding that it sees the digital asset to further surge in the next two years. Scaramucci’s statement was timely as BTC today regained its momentum and once again hit the $70,000 level after the crypto scared many investors as the digital asset slid further down to $68,000 yesterday. According to Scaramucci, he has an ambitious prediction on Bitcoin, saying that by mid-2026, the cryptocurrency will be traded at $176,000. In the previous days, several notable crypto personalities shared the same vision with Scaramucci of the likelihood that BTC will hit the six-figure mark. One of which even predicted a price of $220,000. SkyBridge’s Scaramucci says US will solve debt crisis, bitcoin to triple by 2026 https://t.co/aKYDI6vW2N pic.twitter.com/1BQCdomKHy — Reuters (@Reuters) October 30, 2024 The SkyBridge founder explained that the cryptocurrency could experience a threefold rise in its price in 18 to 20 months, saying that the rally is highly plausible because there is a growing demand for the coin, but the supply is fixed which is the right ingredients for an exponential price uptick. Scaramucci is among the few known crypto investors who announced their support for the presidential candidacy of current US Vice President Kamala Harris. Scaramucci disclosed in previous interviews that Harris would be endorsing Bitcoin once she got elected to the White House. The SkyBridge managing partner has been working closely with the camp of the Vice President to craft policies that will allow cryptocurrency to thrive under her administration. He added that there had been development in Harris’ crypto agenda which he plans to reveal soon. In a separate interview, Scaramucci supported the relationship between gold and Bitcoin, saying that BTC is comparable to gold as an asset. The SkyBridge founder described the firstborn virtual coin as the digital gold of the cryptocurrency world. He noted that other leading financial experts, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, also believe in the Bitcoin-gold comparison, predicting that BTC would reach half of the gold’s market cap. He suggested that it would take Bitcoin about 10 years to attain such a milestone which would greatly benefit its investors since they would get a tenfold return on their BTC investments. At the time of writing, gold is being traded at $2,754 per ounce, a new all-time high, and boasts a market cap of $18.494 trillion.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Corporate America is ditching wokeness — but expect it to remain in government if Kamala Harris wins

The great un-wokening of America appears to be progressing at an unrelenting pace. Last week, Boeing became the latest big company to ditch its so-called DEI Department, a group of corporate bureaucrats who performed the useless and illegal function of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in hiring. It’s a fancy way of imposing racial and gender-based quotas in the workplace as opposed to merit, which in Boeing’s case nearly put it out of business. Boeing’s decision followed similar moves by John Deere, Harley Davidson and Jack Daniels. Wall Street firms, I am told, are also scrubbing their corporate policies of anything that seems to smack of preferences after a SCOTUS ruling that struck down affirmative action in college admissions that can be used as fodder for lawsuits against preferences in hiring. BlackRock is ditching Environmental Social Governance investing that forced oil companies to invest in inefficient windmills because its clients hate it and it led to higher gas prices. Kamala Harris — once the queen of woke, the BLM-loving politician of the ages — has chosen to run a presidential campaign not on grievance but on joy. The question for me isn’t why. That’s something I fully addressed in my book: “Go Woke Go Broke; The Inside Story of the Radicalization of Corporate America.” Americans aren’t woke. The bigger issue is whether we are seeing a moment or the real dismantling of woke in the public sphere My guess is the former. Yes, I keep receiving emails from the liberal and sometimes woke Yale management Professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld on how all these former CEOs he knows support the woke Kamala Harris over the very unwoke Donald Trump in Tuesday’s election. Notice how they’re all “former,” and not people like Jeff Bezos, Jamie Dimon, Tim Cook and many more still in the business who are choosing neutrality for fear of a consumer backlash. Sorry, Professor, America hates all things woke — whether it’s a trans woman activist half-naked giggling in a bubble bath hawking Bud Lite, or employees from working-class backgrounds being forced to admit to their “white privilege” during mandatory corporate diversity training performed by elitists from the Ivy League. They don’t want to have to pay more for gas because BlackRock thinks it’s swell to charge extra fees for ESG portfolios. Sonnenfeld, as I wrote in my book, led a CEO effort to publicly denounce — culminating in a two-page New York Times ad, no less — as discriminatory a 2021 voting law in Georgia that they believed created roadblocks to a fair election. Yet, black voter turnout increased in its aftermath. Yes, woke is also idiotic. But that doesn’t mean it’s dead. The tools of wokeness will remain in the vast administrative state if Kamala Harris, Joe Biden’s current VP and now the Dem nominee, is able to gloss over her far-left progressivism and become president. Recall her support of all things DEI and her demands that “we” as a country “have to stay woke. Like everybody needs to be woke.” You can chalk that up to the word salad of a simpleton, but if that simpleton gets elected, it will likely be funneled as policy through the various agencies that regulate corporate America — the Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, etc. — in more direct ways than it was under Joe Biden, who once boasted that during his presidency, DEI “starts at the top with the vice president.” I’m afraid wokeness, particularly in a corporate setting, isn’t dead. It’s still hidden inside a party that claims to represent half the voting public and may, come Tuesday, remain in control of the White House. Journalism was once a profession that Americans trusted, even revered. We actually enjoyed going to the movies to watch inked-stained wretches practice their craft and do good. One of my favorites is a so-called film noir that hit the theaters in 1948, “Call Northside 777.” It starred Jimmy Stewart as the dogged reporter P.J. McNeal, who chased a story and proved the innocence of a man jailed for murder. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Her dogged reporting for Fox Business about innocent crypto executive Tigran Gambaryan exposed the miscarriage of justice surrounding his arrest and galvanized public support for his release from a notorious Nigerian prison. Full disclosure: Ellie is my TV producer at Fox, but she has become one of the best at unearthing scoops in the burgeoning crypto business. One of those scoops involved Gambaryan, an exec at crypto-exchange Binance who was jailed on trumped-up charges of money laundering and tax evasion shortly after landing in the country. Her reporting sparked a lobbying campaign for Gambaryan’s release by crypto bigwigs, law enforcement officials and apparently the Biden administration. Gambaryan was released last week, reunited with family and friends after eight months of incarceration. “I appreciate Fox News and other media for covering my story and keeping my name alive,” he said after being freed. P.J. McNeal would be proud of ­Ellie.

Title: Everything We Know About Trump’s Potential Cabinet If Elected—As RFK Jr., Elon Musk Are Among Candidates

Officials for former President Donald Trump’s campaign are considering adding Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a potential Trump administration, according to the Washington Post, amid speculation in recent months over who may serve in Trump’s second term if he’s elected. RFK Jr. dropped his presidential campaign earlier this year to endorse Trump, whom he had previously ... [+] criticized. Kennedy has met privately with Trump transition officials about drawing up plans for a new administration, which could involve Kennedy taking a role as a White House czar instead of leading a government agency, four unnamed people familiar with the planning process told the Washington Post. Trump said in September he would create a “government efficiency commission” first proposed by billionaire Elon Musk, whom Trump said agreed to lead the new task force. In an interview with Bloomberg in June, Trump indicated he was considering JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon as treasury secretary, though he later walked back his statement and claimed the “Radical Left” proposed naming Dimon or BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to the role. During an appearance on the Hugh Hewitt Radio Show last month, Trump said he had “four or five good choices” for defense secretary, including some names proposed by Hewitt: Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., and Trump’s former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. There are a few names who are likely being considered to be named Trump’s secretary of state, including Waltz, former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, former U.S. ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell and Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Bill Haggerty R-Tenn., according to Politico. Aileen Cannon, the federal judge who dismissed Trump’s classified documents case in July, is among those under consideration for attorney general in a second Trump administration, in addition to former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, former Senate aide and Republican attorney Mike Davis and former White House lawyer Mark Paoletta, among others, multiple people familiar with the matter told ABC News.

Trump has considered naming hedge fund billionaire John Paulson as treasury secretary, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. Haggerty, Clayton, Robert Lighthizer, who served as Trump’s top trade official during his first term, hedge fund manager Scott Bessent and Larry Kudlow, the former director of Trump’s National Economic Council, are also likely candidates for the role, Politico reported. Trump reportedly said earlier this week he would install a new cabinet official who would be tasked with cutting the cost of living, though he did not indicate who would take the role. Of the 42 people who worked in Trump’s first administration, 24 have endorsed his bid for a second term, according to the Post. Former national security adviser John Bolton has criticized Trump, saying he is “unfit to be president.” Other former Trump officials have advised against electing Trump again, including Trump’s former chief of staff and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, former Vice President Mike Pence and Defense Secretary Mark Esper. The Post reported Kennedy and his advisers have discussed 30-, 60- and 90-day plans about what they would like to accomplish if Trump is elected, and Kennedy told the outlet that Trump had “asked me to clean up corruption and conflicts at the agencies and to end the chronic disease epidemic.” Howard Lutnick, co-chair of Trump’s transition team, appeared to align with Kennedy’s anti-vaccine stance in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, saying it would be “pretty cool” to give Kennedy data to study the effectiveness of vaccines. In his endorsement, Kennedy appeared to reverse his tone on Trump after condemning the former president on several occasions. Text messages obtained by the New York Times showed Kennedy calling Trump a “terrible human being” and “probably a sociopath,” and Trump has called Kennedy a “Radical Left Lunatic.” In 2018, Kennedy denounced Trump’s decision to not probe a link between vaccines and autism in children. During the pandemic, Kennedy was a critic of Anthony Fauci, the former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, for his recommendations on Covid restrictions. Despite an often bitter back-and-forth, the two have also shared compliments: Kennedy applauded Trump for entering North Korea in 2019 and said he has “really good instincts.” Kennedy announced last April he would seek the Democratic nomination before later deciding to run as an independent.

Title: BlackRock Is Quietly Boosting These 3 Big Closed-End Funds
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/11/02/blackrock-is-quietly-boosting-these-3-big-closed-end-funds/

MILAN, ITALY - APRIL 10: The logo of American multi-national investment company BlackRock is ... [+] pictured during "Il Salone del Risparmio" at Allianz MiCo on April 10, 2024 in Milan, Italy. "Il Salone del Risparmio" is the Italian largest event in the asset management industry. (Photo by Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty Images) One often-overlooked way for closed-end funds (CEFs) to give us a profit boost is for management to buy back a fund’s shares. By now, buybacks are probably familiar to most investors: With “regular” stocks, buybacks reduce a company’s share count, which boosts earnings per share and other per-share metrics, indirectly boosting share prices along the way. With CEFs, buybacks have a bit of a different effect. With these high-yielding funds, we want to focus instead on how buybacks affect the discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of a CEF’s underlying portfolio). Members of my CEF Insider service know that we love discounts to NAV because they’re the primary indicator of CEF value. We can buy discounted CEFs, then “ride along” as the discount closes, propelling the fund’s price higher as it does. These discounts originate from the fact that CEFs have fixed share counts, so their market prices can—and regularly do—trade at different levels than their portfolios. And they regularly trade at discounts. I’m bringing this up now because back in May we dug into an unexpected move from BlackRock that I said would help put a floor under the firm’s CEF discounts and boost their market prices The move? Early this year, BlackRock announced a program (also known as a “tender offer” because the firm is inviting investors to tender their shares) to buy back shares of 14 of their CEFs at 98% of NAV once a fund’s discount is at or below 7.5% over a three-month measurement period. This is great for investors, since they get to sell their shares to BlackRock at essentially a 2% discount to NAV. If they bought at a bigger discount, that’s instant profit. Since then, we’ve seen some erosion of these funds’ discounts. But more importantly, bigger gains and more downside protection for shareholders. BlackRock CEFs Above we see the moves in the discounts of three BlackRock tech funds since the buyback plan was announced: the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in orange; BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in purple, and the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust (BIGZ), in blue. Two of these funds, BST and BSTZ, are CEF Insider holdings. In this chart, we can see that BST has stayed at around a 5% discount on average. That’s easily explained by the 7.5%+ discount limit on BlackRock’s buyback program. BST simply hasn’t been eligible. But that’s a good thing—it means BST’s discount hasn’t moved below 7.5% in a sustained way, so investors who buy more when it flirts with such a discount have seen less volatility. The buyback program, however, has helped BIGZ much more; its market price (in purple below) has soared since news of the plan broke, far outstripping its nearly flat total NAV return (in orange). BIGZ Total Returns If we stop to ponder this, we can see how successful BlackRock’s plan has been. This year has been great for stocks, and for growth stocks, in particular, so BIGZ’s NAV should be soaring. Instead, its NAV has flatlined, which should result in investors exchanging the fund for something better, like BST, which has seen its market price–based return (in purple below) and its NAV return (in orange) rise in the last six months: BST Total Returns But remember, BST isn’t benefiting from the buyback program directly, as its discount isn’t big enough. This explains why the NAV and price returns are close to each other. Out of this trio, the fund that’s benefiting the most from the tender offer is BSTZ: BSTZ Total Returns As BSTZ’s discount has shrunk from 17% to around 10% as of this writing, the fund’s 9.7% total NAV return (in orange above) has been significantly compounded, giving investors a 19.4% return, based on the fund’s market price (in purple). This is why I urged CEF Insider members to buy BSTZ in the May issue, after the tender offer was announced. With BSTZ’s discount still around 10%, there’s a ways to go for investors to buy into this fund and profit from the real floor for BSTZ’s discount: 7.5%. Before we go further, it’s worth bearing in mind the two reasons why we love CEFs: the high yields—of course! (BSTZ yields an outsized 12.8% today, while BST yields 8.3%) and their steep discounts to NAV. But bear in mind that a steep NAV discount is great for buying, not so much for selling. That’s why we want our CEFs’ discount to NAV to fluctuate a fair bit, so we can sell at a narrower discount and take profits. Buyback programs can play a role here: BlackRock’s approach allows the fund’s manager to buy back any shares owned by investors in the fund at a fixed discount, as mentioned, so investors who wish to walk away from the fund have better odds of doing so while making a quick profit. But investors who stay in the fund also benefit, because the fund essentially gets to retire those shares at a discount. And the 2% discount accrues to shareholders, so the NAV of the overall fund goes up a bit. For instance, if you buy BSTZ today at a 10% discount and sell at a 2% discount, that’s an instant 8.8% profit. Bear in mind, though, that BlackRock’s program is highly competitive, as the company is only offering buybacks of up to 2.5% of outstanding shares per quarter, so you’ll need to contact your broker ASAP to benefit. All in all, the BlackRock program is great for shareholders of BIGZ, BST and BSTZ, but I do worry that it seems to be offsetting lackluster performance at BIGZ. The market isn’t really in a mood to care, as it’s riding the buyback train, so if there’s a turnaround in BIGZ’s NAV, this fund could soar.

You’d hardly notice, then, that it was one of the worst weeks ever for America’s top crypto employers. On Tuesday, Ethereum software giant Consensys laid off 20% of its global workforce. Hours later, DYdX, a New York-based decentralized crypto exchange, cut its team by 35%. The next morning, Kraken, one of America’s largest crypto exchanges, slashed its headcount by 15%. Rounding out the week, Coinbase reported a disappointing Q3 that missed targets, and an overall decline in customer activity. What gives? Experts told Decrypt a multitude of factors may be at play—ranging from shorter term election- and regulation-related anxieties that may resolve soon, to more existential issues concerning the place for crypto-native companies in an industry increasingly populated by traditional finance giants. “This is definitely the most bearish bull market of all time,” Alex Tapscott, managing director of digital assets at Ninepoint Partners, told Decrypt. While rosy headlines about crypto’s rising tides may appear omnipresent, that narrative really only pertains to Bitcoin, which is more than ever “in a league of its own,” Tapscott said. And even Bitcoin’s strength is no longer necessarily the crypto industry’s gain. “Yeah, Bitcoin’s price went up a lot, but where did that inflow go?” Owen Lau, a senior analyst at investment firm Oppenheimer & Co., told Decrypt. “It's going into traditional finance companies, as opposed to crypto-native companies.” With Wall Street titans like BlackRock scooping up billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin trades through its exchange-traded fund thanks to brand trust and rock-bottom fees, crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken are getting left out in the cold, Lau said. Companies tied to sagging cryptocurrencies like ETH—such as Consensys—are faring even worse, he added. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in Decrypt, which is editorially independent.) Fears related to regulatory uncertainty and the looming presidential election may also be playing a substantial role in chilling crypto activity and investment—at least for the moment. Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association, a leading crypto lobbying group, told Decrypt that while she is optimistic that both a Trump and Harris administration look poised to bring regulatory clarity and support to crypto, the current U.S. Security and Exchange Commission’s hostility to the industry has done substantial damage to business that won’t be remedied until next year at the earliest. “A lot of the capital, I think, is sitting on the sidelines, and is nervous about coming into this space until they see some more clarity,” Smith said. “So I do think the regulatory issues and the political issues are a big factor in all of this.” Earlier this week, the Blockchain Association launched an initiative to track how much money leading crypto firms have spent on lawsuits initiated by the SEC. It says that figure is already in excess of $400 million. On Tuesday, when Consensys announced it would lay off 20% of its staff, the company’s CEO, Joe Lubin, said the staff cuts were linked to the “many millions of dollars” Consensys has spent defending itself against the SEC in court. And yet, some experts insist crypto’s woes won’t fade away even if the U.S. government embraces the industry. Oppenheimer’s Lau thinks the current landscape of crypto-native companies—particularly centralized exchanges—is much too overcrowded, and that many such companies will end up either dying out or getting acquired by traditional finance firms. “I don't know why the market would allow 200 exchanges in the world,” he said. “It doesn't make sense to me.” Ninepoint’s Tapscott, meanwhile, thinks it’s going to take a lot more than getting rid of SEC Chair Gary Gensler to unleash a true crypto bull market. “It’s not just the election,” he said. “If you look at previous cycles, there’s always been some set of new applications or capabilities that got people really excited.” Tapscott points to the landmark innovations of decentralized applications (dapps) or NFTs, both of which propelled crypto markets to then-unprecedented highs. “This time around, is there something that has galvanized people in quite the same way?” he said. “I think the answer is, not yet.” While the prospect of politicians and Wall Street embracing crypto is certainly exciting, Tapscott added, that development has not been sufficient to kickstart a true industry-wide bull run—and can’t replace the zeal generated by a bonafide new use case for blockchain tech. “How do you do something with the technology that wasn’t possible before?” he said.

Title: Inflation isn't going anywhere, and higher rates could spark a 12% downturn for stocks in the coming year, veteran strategist says
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-prediction-credit-crunch-inflation-interest-rates-outlook-bubble-2024-10

Full Content:
Households and companies may be breathing a sigh of relief as borrowing costs move lower, but they shouldn't get comfortable because rates and inflation are going to remain high — and that reality could spark a big drop for stocks in the next year, Wall Street veteran Bill Blain said. Blain, a longtime strategist and principal of Wind Shift Capital Advisors, said he sees a rocky 12 months ahead for the stock market. He said the Fed isn't poised to take interest rates as low as markets think, and borrowing costs could indeed rise from here. That could crimp lending, slow dealmaking, and take US and global stocks down 7%-12%, he told Business Insider in an interview. "I think the crunch that we face is what happens when interest rates start to rise, and governments are not in a position to continue boosting the economy in an interest rate rising environment because they've lost the support of markets," Blain said. In the event of a credit crunch, he doubts the US will be able to dole out stimulus as it did during the pandemic, due to concerns about the overall level of debt and the inflationary impact on the economy. "It's the reality that inflation is going to creep back into the global economy. Interest rates are going to have to rise," he said. Blain's forecast may sound counterintuitive to investors who have been pricing in ambitious rate cuts from the central bank. But the US economy faces too many inflationary pressures over the medium-term to warrant aggressive policy easing, Blain said. For one, the federal debt has swelled to a historic $35 trillion. Economists have flagged rapid government borrowing as a factor that risks stoking inflation. Meanwhile, supply chain issues linger, and given rising geopolitical tensions, world trade looks on track to be more fragmented, which can also prop up inflation. Finally, the threat of high tariffs from former President Donald Trump would impose a tax on nearly all imported US goods that economists say would end up being passed on to the consumer. "I think inflation is going to be more ingrained, as it was in the 1970s and early '80s," Blain said. "It's going to be a very, very different economy and we just need to get used to it." Other forecasters have warned inflation could be much stickier than markets expect. Core inflation is unlikely to fall back to the Fed's 2% target, BlackRock strategists said in a recent note, pointing to large US budget deficits and other "mega-forces" that will propel prices higher. That means investors waiting for a return to near-zero borrowing costs to return will be in for a rude awakening. Blain thinks interest rates will hover between 4.5%-6% in the "new normal," causing interest payments to "go through the roof" when compared to pre-pandemic levels, he said. Companies could take a hit as the credit crunch plays out. Though Blain said he wasn't necessarily calling for a market crash or a wave of "zombie" firm failures, he thinks dealmaking in the private equity space could slow, while some of the most financially troubled firms risk insolvency. Meanwhile, stock prices will head back to a much more reasonable level as the speculative bubble in asset prices pops. "I think there's still a massive hangover from the 2010 to 2022 era of ultra-low interest rates and easing and I think stocks are generally still priced for speculation and lower interest rates," he said of his predicted downside to the market. "I don't think there's any reason to really expect major interest rate cuts." Still, investors are feeling pretty positive about the short-term outlook for stocks and lower rates. Markets see a 95% chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points at the November policy meeting, and a 72% chance that rates will be 50 basis points lower by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Title: Former Disney Exec Blames Hollywood's Collapse on Woke DEI Policies Forced by Investment Firms
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2024/11/02/former-disney-exec-blames-hollywoods-collapse-on-woke-dei-policies-forced-by-investment-firms/
Time Published: 2024-11-02T11:14:58Z
Full Content:
Ex-Walt Disney TV executive Monica Harris is blaming Hollywood’s collapse on high-dollar investment firms for forcing the woke DEI initiatives that have driven customers away. Harris noted that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) ideas have flooded Hollywood from the writer’s rooms to the board rooms, and the agenda has become far more important than the products Hollywood is producing, according to The Park Place. Harris pointed to how many corporations are failing so badly, with companies such as Target, Kellogg’s, and others suffering boycotts and loss of revenue thanks to the indulgence of woke, DEI policies. And she said Hollywood is suffering the same short-sighted obsession over such policies. “I think very much the same is true in Hollywood. DEI has swept through that place,” Harris explained. “The Academy Awards, the nominations are only available to films that hit certain quotas, right? You have to have a certain number of people who are black or BIPOC, trans, non-binary, whatever. It’s totally the antithesis of what artistic work is about.” So, why do they do it? Because they are being controlled by the people who control the money, according to Harris. “I’ve noticed this is happening because the same core group of companies are largely funding or have shareholder stakes, majority shareholder stakes in Fortune 500 companies and in the S&P 500. We’re talking about BlackRock. We’re talking about Vanguard. We’re talking about State Street,” she said. “When those three companies and their subsidiaries dominate Boards of Directors and dominate the ownership of stock, then they literally are in the position to tell these companies to adhere to whatever guidelines they’d like,” she continued. “So if DEI is an initiative that these majority shareholders would like companies to pursue, that’s what they’ll pursue. Because if not, then they’ll face the wrath of the people who can yank the money, yank the loans, yank the funding, because it’s all about money.” Harris suggested the leaders of companies such as Disney are torn between two conflicting positions because of this setup. “So at the end of they day you’re in — if you’re a CEO, you’re like, ‘Do I piss off my consumer base and maybe hope I can massage them, or do I piss off the people who are actually funding me?’ And they’re between a rock and a hard place,” she explained. “But they have to do this because… if they don’t adhere to these guidelines those loans, that funding is going to be yanked,” she said. “So again, they are between a rock and a hard place. That’s the untold story, in my opinion.” Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, has basically confirmed Harris’s opinion. In a 2017 interview, he bragged about “forcing behaviors” on companies. “Well, behaviors are going to have change. And this is one thing that we’re asking companies. You have to force behaviors. And at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors. 54% of the incoming class are women,” Fink said. “We added four more points in terms of diverse employment this year. And what we are doing internally is if you don’t achieve these levels of impact, your compensation could be impacted. You have to force behaviors. And if you don’t force behaviors — whether it’s gender, or race, or just any way you want to say the composition of your team, you’re going to be impacted.” Meanwhile, Hollywood’s revenues are tumbling fast. And Disney, in particular, has been hard hit by its dwindling customer base. That state of affairs has caused the company to begin seriously contracting, closing down departments, and laying off thousands of employees. According to her LinkedIn work history, Harris worked for Disney from 1998-2000, long before its current woes.

Title: What happened in crypto this week?
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/what-happened-in-crypto-this-week-2/
Time Published: 2024-11-01T22:58:03Z
Full Content:
It’s been another busy week in crypto: Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is planning to launch a stablecoin, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hit $30 billion in assets in 293 days, ex-FTX executive Nishad Singh avoided prison, and Immutable received a Wells notice from the SEC. Let’s take a closer look at these and give you a recap on what happened this week in crypto. With the US election drawing closer, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial project plans on entering the crypto market by linking a stablecoin to the US dollar. The news of this comes as the project raised $14 million in initial funding; however, despite intentions to capitalize on the growing demand for stablecoins, the project saw limited success, falling short of its $300 million token sale. On top of that, shortly after the sale went live, the platform’s website crashed and even though 100,000 people signed up, only 6,832 unique wallets hold WLFI tokens, according to Etherscan. With only a few days until election day, if Trump does become the US President again, he would hold significant influence over the regulatory environment surrounding stablecoins, which could be a pivotal move for the future of WLFI. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has set a new record, reaching $30 billion in assets in 293 days. By doing so, it surpasses gold, which did it in 1,790 days and JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ($JEPI), which did it in 1,272 days. BlackRock holds more than 433,000 Bitcoin, valued at $30.5 billion, according to iShares data. The milestone from BlackRock comes 10 months after the company launched its spot Bitcoin ETF in January. Then, it was reported that BlackRock had traded $7.5 million in shares within the first 10 minutes of launching. With the combined spot Bitcoin ETFs, they now have over one million in Bitcoin holdings and could soon pass Satoshi Nakamoto’s wallet, which holds 1.1 Bitcoin. 12,000 btc a day keeps the doctor away lol. At this rate they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they? https://t.co/dLVNsjMlxK — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 31, 2024 Earlier this week, Nishad Singh, the former engineering director of crypto exchange FTX, was sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release in a federal court in New York. Judge Lewis Kaplan said, “this may have been one of the biggest crimes in American history.” Kaplan also noted that Singh’s involvement appeared limited compared to FTX’s founder Sam Bankman-Fried and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Due to “substantial assistance” from Singh, his lawyers argued for a lenient sentence. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison and Ellison is expected to surrender by November 7 and was sentenced to 24 months in prison. As the crackdown on FTX executives continues, Singh is the fourth former executive to receive sentencing, with co-founder Gary Wang set to face court on November 20. Blockchain gaming platform Immutable has become the latest to receive a Wells notice from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging securities laws violations. According to Immutable, nothing was specified in the notice; however, it believes its “claims are targeting the listing and private sales of IMX in 2021.” Immutable has said they are confident that the IMX token is not a security. Immutable said the Wells notice before the US election illustrates why the “industry is so skeptical of any attempts from this SEC to argue it is attempting to provide clarity.” “Prior to the issuance of a Wells notice, there are often multiple months of interviews and conversations between company counsel and the SEC, so the SEC can fully understand the situation,” Immutable added. “Instead, in our very first interaction with the SEC, we were told a Wells notice would be issued to the company within the week. We then received it within hours.” Immutable joins a list of companies in the crypto industry that have faced or are facing lawsuits against the SEC. Other crypto organizations that have received a Wells notice from the SEC include Coinbase, Crypto.com, and OpenSea.

Title: Vivek Ramaswamy’s anti-DEI, pro-Bitcoin financial services company moving HQ to Dallas

businessBanking By Sasha RichieBreaking business reporter Breaking business reporter Strive Enterprises, a financial services company co-founded by former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, announced Friday that it will move its headquarters to Dallas. In a press release, the company said it expects most of its staff will move to Dallas from its current Columbus, Ohio headquarters by the end of Q1 2025. It is also launching a wealth management division — to be focused on “integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios” — to complement its existing asset management platform. Founded in 2022, Strive currently has $1.7 billion in assets under management and seeks to combat, “social and political agendas” in the financial world, according to its website. The site names DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) and ESG (environmental, social and governance; sometimes called impact investing) initiatives as particular concerns. Major firms like BlackRock, Vanguard and the Dallas area’s own Charles Schwab, all with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, incorporate DEI and ESG strategies. Become a business insider with the latest news. Or with: By signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy “When Strive launched in 2022, nearly every major corporation bent the knee to ESG,” Ramaswamy said in the release. “Just two short years later, the national environment has changed dramatically, in no small part due to Strive’s efforts. The moment is now ripe to launch a pro-capitalism Wealth Management business focused on true financial freedom, with a focus on integrating Bitcoin into standard portfolios.” Governor Greg Abbott points to Strive’s relocation as the latest development in the growth of Y’all Street, the nickname given to Texas’ booming financial sector. “Texas has become the home of capital in the United States,” Abbott said in the release. “With the Best Business Climate in the nation and as the top state for corporate relocation and expansion projects, Texas is the future hub of capital markets that will help cement our economic power on the global stage.” Ramaswamy rose to national prominence during his run for the Republican presidential nomination throughout 2023. Having launched pharmaceutical company Roivant Sciences in 2014, Ramaswamy billed himself as an “anti-woke” entrepreneur and drew attention for controversial pitches such as those to shut down the Department of Education, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After taking fourth in the Iowa caucuses, Ramaswamy suspended his campaign in January 2024. He has since been on the campaign trail for former President Donald Trump, and has stated interest in Ohio’s governorship and Senate seat, as well as in a potential Trump cabinet seat. Sasha is a business reporter for The Dallas Morning News. She has previously worked for the news department at Car and Driver magazine and served as the sports managing editor of The Duke Chronicle. She graduated from Duke in 2023 with a degree in Russian, a certificate in Policy, Journalism and Media Studies, and a minor in political science.

Title: The Regime Goes After Elon Musk

This is a lightly edited transcript of the accompanying video from professor Peter St. Onge. Recently, Elon Musk gave a talk detailing the government attacks on his companies since he came out as pro-free speech and, especially, since he came out as pro-Donald Trump. These include endless made-up environmental rules—including a study to see if falling rockets hit sharks. It includes curbs on SpaceX launches specifically because Elon tweets pro-Trump things. And it includes a $600,000 fine for spilling … drinking water in a desert. Not a joke. Attacking dissident companies, of course, is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. As Mussolini put it, “everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state.” For a true authoritarian no citizen is allowed to dissent—and certainly no companies, which are sitting ducks. Of course, in theory, this sort of thing doesn’t happen in America. In theory, we jail bureaucrats who conduct Mussolini-style lawfare. Alas, it has been going on ever since the progressives imposed the administrative state about a hundred years ago. Saddling now every industry in America with a regime Big Brother, a library worth of regulations, mandates, licensing boards—a bureaucratic army that, like everything government does, is thoroughly corrupt. Still, before Donald Trump there was some independence. CEOs could still criticize regime shibboleths like mandatory racism—er, affirmative action—or transvestites in girls’ locker rooms if anybody had been dumb enough to propose that in 2015. Sadly, that all changed as authoritarian Borg went to war with Trump, culminating in the reign of terror during COVID-19 that snuffed out the slightest hint of disloyalty with an enthusiasm that would make North Korea blush. We saw it in living color during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots. Historically, about 70% of Fortune 500 CEOs vote Republican. Meaning that, statistically, at least 70% of them were probably horrified by BLM’s orgy of city-burning and murder. And yet not one Fortune 500 CEO spoke up. Now, you might say that’s because most are spineless cowards, and that’s true. But look at it from their perspective: You’re entrusted with tens of thousands of employees, and if you speak up, rioters will come beat them, burn their workplaces, and put them out of a job and your shareholders out of a retirement account. You could, like Elon, be targeted by hundreds of regulators—even prosecutors in blue cities—hunting with a fine-tooth comb for some way, any excuse, to destroy the entire company. For a CEO with a legal duty to protect the company—and a moral duty to protect employees—it’s simply too risky. So, they shut up. To be sure, many indulged, enthusiastically jumping on the institutionalized racism of DEI or cutting checks to the very rioters burning cities—in fact, BLM cashed more than $50 billion in corporate donations. Not since Genghis Khan has burning a city been quite so profitable. But others never drank the Kool-Aid. They may have opposed the Left with every fiber of their being. But they were held hostage by rioters, prosecutors, regulators, even financiers like BlackRock. So, what’s next? The solution is very easy: Get rid of the administrative state. Lay off the hundreds or thousands of little Mussolinis populating every regulatory agency from the Environmental Protection Agency to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Supreme Court laid the groundwork earlier this year with its Loper Bright decision clipping bureaucrats’ wings. And Musk himself has been floated by Trump for a blue-ribbon panel slashing government waste and corruption. The final step is Congress sitting down and actually defunding these agencies. Zero them out. Return the money to the people. Return the bureaucrats to jobs that don’t involve extortion. And let Americans get back to exercising our rights without being destroyed.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs could surpass Satoshi’s holdings ‘in less than two weeks’ – Analyst

Spot BTC ETFs have amassed over 50% of the assets held by Gold ETFs in just 10 months. Less than a year post-launch, U.S. Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs have collectively accumulated over 1 million BTC. This is significant as just recently, Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, had predicted that the ETFs could surpass the holdings of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator – Satoshi Nakamoto. At the time, he had projected that this would happen by mid-December. However, BlackRock’s single-day purchase of 12,127 BTC, according to Lookonchain, has hastened the timeline. Balchunas reacted to this massive accumulation on X, stating, “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks. Altho they can’t keep up this Joey Chestnut-level pace, can they?” At press time, BlackRock held 429,185 BTC, valued at approximately $30.8 billion. Combined, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs now manage assets totaling $70.86 billion, representing 5.12% of Bitcoin’s market cap. This, according to data from Soso Value. For context, Nakamoto holds an estimated 1.1 million BTC, currently worth $76 billion. Previously, AMBCrypto reported that on 30 October, BlackRock’s IBIT marked its largest single-day inflow since January. This surge in investment followed a trend of daily triple-digit total net inflows since 23 October. Source: Soso Value However, daily total net inflows dipped to $32.14 million on 31 October. Moreover, only IBIT and the CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ETF (BRRR) brought in $318.80 million and $1.89 million, respectively. Other ETFs saw either outflows or no inflows at all. Interestingly, this drop coincided with the king coin losing its standing over the $70,000-level. Despite this decline, however, Balchunas revealed that IBIT managed to attract more cash than the total of 13,227 ETFs worldwide over the past week. He emphasized that this achievement is particularly significant for an ETF that is still under a year old. Source: Eric Balchunas/X IBIT’s remarkable performance didn’t go unnoticed by industry experts. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, shared his perspective on X: “This thing is turning into a $$$ vacuum cleaner.” Geraci highlighted that BTC ETFs’ $70 billion in assets was more than 50% of the $130 billion held by gold ETFs since 2004—All within just 10 months of their 2024 launch. Quinten Francois, Co-founder of WeRate, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Bitcoin ETFs had more inflows in the last 2 days than the Gold ETF took in during its entire first year.” Meanwhile, the Uptober rally came to an end with BTC’s 16th anniversary, marking the day Nakamoto released the nine-page whitepaper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” This milestone laid the foundation for a decentralized digital currency and the cryptocurrency era. Interestingly, on its anniversary, Bitcoin dipped below the $70,000-mark. At press time, it was valued at $69,821, down by 3.33% over the last 24 hours. While the downturn may have disappointed some, it also poses an intriguing question – Could this be an opportunity for institutional investors to “buy the dip” and takeover Nakamoto sooner than expected? Such a move would accelerate the shift towards institutional dominance in a space Nakamoto originally envisioned as decentralized.

Title: Why Everyone’s Wrong About Stablecoins
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christiancatalini/2024/11/01/why-everyones-wrong-about-stablecoins/
Time Published: 2024-11-01T16:42:28Z
Full Content:
The Stripe Inc. headquarters in South San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, April 16, 2024. ... [+] Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg Stripe’s recent acquisition of stablecoin orchestration startup Bridge sent shockwaves through the crypto world. For the first time, a major payments company committed over a billion dollars to accelerate its use of this technology. Though this isn’t Stripe’s first attempt at crypto, the timing feels different. Enthusiasm for stablecoins is at an all-time high, and Bridge’s co-founder, Zach Abrams, positioned the company masterfully: by branding it as the ‘Stripe of crypto,’ he ensured it would catch the attention of the Collison brothers. What most miss: Bridge might be worth $1.1 billion to Stripe, but on its own, it likely wouldn’t have hit that mark. This isn’t due to any lack of talent—Zach and his team assembled a top group of engineers—but rather because making money with stablecoins is extremely challenging. Whether through issuing, orchestrating (i.e., converting between stablecoins), or integrating them with legacy banking rails, achieving long-term profitability will be a significant challenge. But how can that be? After all, Circle and Tether have been raking in substantial profits following the interest rate hikes of the last two years, and with ongoing anticipation around a Circle IPO, the market appears primed for further growth and consolidation. The reality is that network effects in the stablecoin market are likely much weaker than most anticipate, and it’s far from a winner-take-all environment. In fact, stablecoins may well function as loss leaders, and without essential complementary assets, could even become a losing venture. While industry insiders often cite liquidity as the primary reason only a few stablecoins will dominate, the truth is far more complex. So what are the biggest misconceptions about stablecoins? Let’s take a closer look. Paolo Ardoino, chief executive officer of Tether Holdings Ltd. Photographer: Nathan Laine/Bloomberg When we designed Libra, it was clear to us that stablecoins require a complementary business model to thrive. The Libra ecosystem was structured around a non-profit association that brought together wallets, merchants, and digital platforms to support both stablecoin issuance and the payment rails on which these assets would move. Relying solely on reserve interest isn’t a sustainable way to monetize a stablecoin. We learned this early on, as we were planning to issue stablecoins backed by currencies with minimal (Euro) or even negative (Yen) interest rates at the time. Stablecoin issuers like Circle and Tether seem to overlook that today’s high-interest environment is an anomaly, and a sustainable business can’t be built on a foundation that’s likely to crumble when market conditions shift. Of course, it’s not just the ‘stock’ of stablecoins that can be monetized; their ‘flow’ can be too. Circle’s recent increase in redemption fees suggests they’re starting to realize this. However, this approach violates a fundamental principle in payments: to build user trust and retention, entry and exit must be seamless. While exit fees may be acceptable in gaming, they’re a poor fit for mainstream payments, as they undermine the basic expectation that money should feel unrestricted and readily available. This leaves transaction fees as a potential revenue source—but enforcing them on a blockchain is challenging without strict control over the protocol. Even then, it’s impossible to impose fees on transactions occurring between users within the same wallet provider. These are all scenarios we explored exhaustively with Libra, highlighting just how complex and uncertain the business model was for the non-profit association. So what options do stablecoin issuers have? Unless they’re relying on temporary regulatory loopholes—which are unlikely to hold long-term (more on that in the next section)—they’ll need to start competing with their own customers. Circle’s recent initiatives—including programmable wallets, a cross-chain protocol, and the Mint program—reveal exactly where the company is going. And that’s unwelcome news for many of its closest partners. This is nothing new in platform strategy: never allow a partner to come between you and your customers. Yet, many exchanges and payments companies are doing just that by letting Circle into their ecosystem. For Circle to survive, it must transition into a payments company, even if that means encroaching on its allies’ territory. It’s a familiar pattern—think of Amazon with third-party sellers, travel platforms with hotel chains, or Facebook with news publishers. As platforms succeed, they frequently bring in-house the functions they initially depended on partners to bootstrap and refine, adopting and monetizing what works. Developers within Apple’s and Google’s ecosystems are all too familiar with this. Stripe doesn’t face this dilemma. As one of the world’s most successful payments companies, they’ve mastered the art of deploying and monetizing a streamlined software layer on top of global money movement—a model that scales efficiently through network effects without being slowed down by the need for country-specific banking licenses. Stablecoins accelerate this approach by acting as a bridge between Stripe and domestic banking and payment rails. What was once a network constrained by legacy institutions—including card companies—can now overcome its last-mile problem, delivering significantly more value to merchants and consumers. This is also why PayPal launched its own stablecoin, with other fintech giants like Revolut and Robinhood soon joining the fray. Competing on open protocols is a shift from their usual playbook, but they can fine-tune their stablecoin strategy to complement their core offerings. In doing so, they’ll make stablecoins exceptionally affordable and convenient for consumers and businesses alike. Argentine peso banknotes equivalent to 1,000 US dollars arranged in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on ... [+] Tuesday, Sept. 26, 2023. Photographer: Erica Canepa/Bloomberg Crypto has a history of greatly underestimating the influence of regulation on its future. We learned this the hard way with the release of the first Libra whitepaper, which led to two grueling years of intense regulatory interactions to align the project with the expectations of policymakers and regulators. The same is true for stablecoins today. Many assume that stablecoins will seamlessly operate as low-cost, global dollar accounts for consumers and businesses. After all, in a crisis, everyone in the world would prefer to hold dollars in a too-big-to-fail U.S. financial institution. Moreover, one might think the U.S. government would support this, as it strengthens the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. The reality is far more complex. While the United States risks losing a great deal if its financial and sanctions infrastructure is no longer the global standard—and would face even greater consequences if the dollar’s ‘exorbitant privilege’ erodes, as it has for every reserve currency before it—this doesn’t mean the U.S. Treasury will always favor accelerating dollarization. In fact, its Office of International Affairs would view this as a significant challenge to both diplomacy and global financial stability. Countries that value monetary policy independence, fear capital flight in a crisis, and worry about destabilizing their domestic banks will strongly oppose the large-scale adoption of frictionless USD stablecoin accounts. They’ll use every tool available to block or limit these accounts, just as they’ve resisted other forms of dollarization. And while it may be impossible to stop crypto transactions entirely, as the Internet has shown, governments have numerous ways to restrict access and curb mainstream adoption. Does this mean stablecoins are doomed in emerging economies with capital controls or concerns over capital flight? Not at all—the rise of domestic stablecoins that adhere to local banking and regulatory frameworks is inevitable. While the U.S. dollar has traditionally dominated the stablecoin market, things could change rapidly. In Europe, following the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, banks, fintech companies, and new entrants are rushing to issue euro-denominated stablecoins. This approach has the benefit of preserving the stability of the local banking system, and will be even more important in regions like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. Clear regulation also enables banks to finally enter and compete on an equal footing, something that hasn’t yet occurred in the United States. Banks can issue deposit tokens in addition to fully-backed stablecoins, allowing them to boost revenue through money creation. This puts pure-play stablecoin issuers—who lack banking licenses, access to the discount window, or government deposit insurance—at a significant competitive disadvantage. Icons for various payment services are displayed in Hong Kong, China. Photographer: Anthony ... [+] Kwan/Bloomberg Yes, an issuer can build network effects around global liquidity and availability for its stablecoin, but as DEX protocols know all too well, liquidity is as easily lost as found. Similarly, economies of scale in branding and marketing may help issuers capture mindshare, but they don’t always translate into a truly defensible position. The reality is that a stablecoin’s most important feature—its peg to a currency like USD or EUR—is also its greatest weakness. Today, these assets are seen as distinct, but once regulation standardizes stablecoins and makes each equally safe, individuals and businesses will view them simply as dollars or euros. While legal distinctions do exist—as highlighted during the Silicon Valley Bank run—most people don’t differentiate between dollars held at Bank of America and those at Chase. That’s the magic of those dollars functioning as money—a feat orchestrated behind the scenes by the Federal Reserve. The same will be true for stablecoins. While there may be dozens in each major market, this complexity will be abstracted away for users. When that happens, the economics of stablecoins will favor entities with either a complementary business model, as described above, or those that control the interface between stablecoins and the assets backing them—be it bank deposits, U.S. treasuries, or money market funds. That is bad news for pure-play issuers like Circle, whose current banking system interfaces depend on entities such as BlackRock and BNY Mellon. These financial giants are well-positioned to become direct competitors. For instance, BlackRock already operates the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury bills and repos fund (BUIDL). A common misconception in the history of technological disruption is how frequently incumbents manage to push back. Even Clayton Christensen’s key example of disruptive innovation—the rise of smaller disk drive producers in the hard disk industry—is wrong: Seagate not only survived disruption but remains the world’s largest manufacturer to this day. In heavily regulated industries like financial services, the odds are even more heavily stacked against new entrants. BERLIN, GERMANY - DECEMBER 05: Revolut Founder CEO Nikolay Storonsky, N26 Founder & CEO Valetin ... [+] Stalf and Monzo CEO Tom Blomfield (Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch). Tech companies with banking licenses, like Revolut, Monzo, and Nubank, are well-positioned to lead in their markets, and other players are likely to accelerate their licensing efforts to gain similar advantages. However, many players in the stablecoin market will struggle to compete with established banks and may face acquisition or failure. Banks and credit card companies will resist a market dominated by one or two stablecoins. Instead, they’ll advocate for a landscape with multiple interoperable and interchangeable issuers. When that happens, liquidity and availability will be driven by existing distribution channels to consumers and merchants—an advantage already held by neobanks and payment companies like Stripe or Adyen. Fully-backed stablecoins like USDC and USDT will need high-velocity use cases to remain viable—such as enabling cross-border money movement—or they’ll need to attract a DeFi ecosystem that can introduce transparent fractionalization to subsidize their narrow-bank model. Meanwhile, deposit tokens issued by banks or tokenized funds will benefit from stronger underlying economics, which will drive their adoption across both consumer and institutional use cases. Institutional users, in particular, are used to managing diverse assets like money market funds and pay close attention to the opportunity cost of their capital. The race to the bottom in sharing stablecoin yields is already well underway in that segment. In every region, national champions—from banks to crypto firms—will position themselves as the essential entry point into the local market. However, they’ll need to carefully consider how stablecoins, by linking domestic rails to blockchain networks, could also lower barriers for foreign competitors to enter and compete. After all, the core transformation here from a business perspective is that these systems will run on open protocols. Agustin Carstens, the General Manager of the Bank for International Settlements. (Photo by Vernon ... [+] Yuen/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The future is bright for leading payments, fintech, and neobank players, who can leverage stablecoins to streamline operations and accelerate global expansion. It also opens new opportunities for domestic stablecoin issuers to position themselves and ready their payment systems for global interoperability—an area where stablecoins are poised to succeed where the bureaucratic BIS’s ‘Finternet’ vision will quickly fall short. Leading crypto exchanges will also leverage stablecoins to enter the consumer and merchant payments space more aggressively, positioning themselves as credible challengers to major fintech and payment companies. While questions remain about how stablecoins will scale AML and compliance controls as they go mainstream, there’s no doubt they offer an opportunity to rapidly modernize our financial services stack and shake up industry leadership.

Title: Bitcoin at 16: Getting Its Driver's License and Entering a New Era

Election 2024 coverage presented by On October 31, Bitcoin turned 16 — the anniversary of Satoshi Nakamoto publishing the whitepaper that changed financial history. At 16, Bitcoin is no longer just a rebellious experiment; it’s entering a critical phase where it’s being tested on a much larger scale. Bitcoin is getting its proverbial driver's license, ready to navigate the open roads of the global financial system. The question is: can it handle the complexities ahead? Bitcoin has evolved beyond "digital gold." Today, it's a foundational piece of global financial infrastructure. 2024 has seen the rise of Bitcoin Layer 2s, Ordinals, and institutional adoption, which shows we’re at a critical inflection point. Perhaps the most defining moment of Bitcoin’s 16th year has been the entrance of institutions. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs, led by financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco, marked a historic shift. As of mid-2024, these ETFs have collectively attracted over $1.5 billion in assets under management (AUM), providing a significant capital influx into the market. This institutional wave reflects a growing appetite for Bitcoin exposure through traditional financial vehicles. BlackRock alone manages trillions of dollars in assets, and its involvement signals that Bitcoin is no longer seen as a fringe asset but a serious contender in the global financial arena. So how can Bitcoin maintain its decentralized ethos while absorbing billions in institutional capital? For those of us building on Bitcoin, this is the challenge we face: to keep Bitcoin permissionless and resilient, even as it becomes mainstream. Layer 2 solutions like Lightning (now five years old) have transformed how Bitcoin is used, in regions with unstable currencies, Lightning has proven to help with payments; however, adoption in developed markets has been slower than many anticipated. This slower-than-expected adoption shouldn’t be seen as a failure but rather as a reflection of Bitcoin’s maturing role as a broader infrastructure layer. In fact, this shift from immediate use cases like payments to longer-term infrastructure development is arguably a positive sign. For a majority of the world, we're in a new era where we've separated BTC, the asset, from Bitcoin, the rails. BTC will remain the most inflation-resistant Lindy asset. The rails where you now access BTC on chain will matter. Transacting on the L1 may be considered a high-value, "luxury" settlement only where L2s offer a cheaper, faster, and better means of moving onchain. Take Stacks, a programmable layer for Bitcoin which began in 2018. The just-activated Nakamoto upgrade for Stacks represents a significant leap forward regarding Bitcoin liquidity and integration into both traditional and decentralized financial systems. With the sBTC protocol live as of two days ago, we're looking at an ecosystem where Bitcoin can be used more flexibly without sacrificing decentralization. Stacks' sBTC brings Bitcoin liquidity without requiring centralized exchanges, solving a long-standing problem in Bitcoin's integration into DeFi. Through projects like Granite, Stacks is providing tools for decentralized lending and borrowing without rehypothecation, keeping Bitcoin liquidity non-custodial and transparent. Stacks' native sBTC brings another layer of innovation, enabling users to move Bitcoin seamlessly across various applications without losing its decentralized qualities. People now realize their BTC has significant value and are looking for avenues to safely invest their BTC for yield, get liquidity against it, or acquire more BTC. It's less about spending BTC freely but more about managing risk not to lose your BTC and never to sell. That's why protocols like Granite exist, offering a transparent on-chain way to borrow against without selling. When you bridge/wrap BTC to another on-chain asset, you want it to feel like Bitcoin – the same network robustness, resilience, and decentralization. Technological innovations like BitVM, which introduces complex smart contracts to Bitcoin, and OP_Cat, which brings covenant-based programming, are opening new doors. These advancements enable more advanced governance models to be built on Bitcoin without compromising security. This pivot toward programmability marks a new chapter for Bitcoin. And by mid-2024, projects like Coinbase's cbBTC have tokenized Bitcoin for applications, with cbBTC acting as collateral in lending protocols, mirroring the success of Ethereum's wrapped assets — yet another indicator that Bitcoin is broadening its utility beyond simple buy-and-hold strategies. At 16, Bitcoin is maturing into more than just a monetary asset — it’s becoming the infrastructure for a decentralized world. With hundreds of Layer 2s launching, Bitcoin is becoming something far expansive than perhaps Satoshi ever intended. We’re now building a financial future where Bitcoin is now the rails for decentralized finance, digital identities and smart contracts. Bitcoin's programmability through technologies like Stacks and BitVM offers capabilities once thought to be better suited to other blockchains. While institutional interest is a significant milestone, it raises concerns about how Bitcoin’s core values — decentralization, security, and permissionlessness — can be preserved. EFTs are great for massive awareness and adoption but leave less freely circulating BTC on-chain. With billions of capital flowing into Bitcoin ETFs, institutions will play a major role in Bitcoin's future. Therefore, Bitcoin builders must ensure that this doesn’t come at the expense of Bitcoin’s core principles. To put this in perspective, institutions like BlackRock are wielding financial influence that have the potential to influence Bitcoin’s ecosystem. For instance, its AUM dwarfs the entire market capitalization of many cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin at 16 is not about having all the answers; it’s about having the tools, the developers, and the vision to keep building. All paths are leading to users wanting consumer crypto — a place where Ordinals, Runes, and DeFi can thrive. But we’ve hardly just begun. The road ahead is vast, but with the right builders steering, the journey has only begun.

UBS taps into growing tokenization trends, offering customers enhanced access and transparency. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. UBS Asset Management, a subsidiary of Zurich-headquartered investment bank UBS, has launched its inaugural tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, aiming to expand access for its clients. According to a Nov. 1 statement, the new product — the “UBS USD Money Market Investment Fund Token” or “uMINT” — offers clients an innovative investment solution. Token holders will gain access to UBS Asset Management’s institutional-grade cash management strategy, which utilizes high-quality money market instruments under a conservative, risk-managed framework. Thomas Kaegi, Co-Head of UBS Asset Management, emphasized that the launch aligns with increasing investor interest in tokenized assets. He commented: “We have seen growing investor appetite for tokenized financial assets across asset classes. Through leveraging our global capabilities and collaborating with peers and regulators, we can now provide clients with an innovative solution.” This launch also supports UBS’s broader “UBS Tokenize” initiative, which began in June 2023 by creating fully digitally structured notes worth CNH 200 million for a third-party issuer. By November, UBS had executed the first-ever cross-border repurchase transaction using a natively issued digital bond on a public blockchain. UBS Asset Management said these efforts reflect its ongoing commitment to both public and private blockchain networks, enabling it to expand offerings like fund issuance and distribution, creating more streamlined and accessible financial products. As of the fourth quarter of 2023, UBS managed $5.7 trillion of its clients’ invested assets. The company operates in more than 50 markets worldwide. Tokenization, representing traditional assets such as the US Treasury-backed money market funds on blockchain networks, has gained significant traction among established finance firms, including BlackRock, over the past year. Notably, the US Treasury Department has acknowledged tokenization’s potential to reshape markets, noting that it could boost efficiency, broaden investor access, and increase transparency in the Treasury market.

Cllr Garret Kelleher speaking about Ballincollig TidyTowns, the overall winner's of this year's competition Ballincollig has been crowned as the winner of the 2024 Supervalu Tidy Towns competition in Croke Park this afternoon. They received the overall winner award and the €15,000 in prize money for being the highest scoring entrant in the whole competition. Cllr Garret Kelleher, who is a long-serving member of Ballincollig TidyTowns said it has been “years and years in the making” after the group placed second last year. It marks the groups twelfth overall gold medal in a row, as well as building on their Tidiest Large Urban Centre win in last year’s competition and in 2018. Pictured at the 2024 SuperValu TidyTowns competition was (at centre) Luke Hanlon, Managing Director of SuperValu; Tom Butler, Chairperson, Ballincollig Tidy Town Committee; and Minister for Rural and Community Development, Heather Humphreys TD, along with members of the Ballincollig Tidy Town Committee at the awards ceremony at Croke Park. Pic:Naoise Culhane “We thought it was never going to happen that we would actually get to the top, so today is just the result of years and years of hard work and it’s fantastic. “I’m delighted for everyone involved because there is a great community spirit in Ballincollig,” he said. Cllr Kelleher said there is great friendships and comradery within the Cork group, based 8km west of Cork City. “This is just brilliant, particularly for some of our senior members,” he said, paying tribute to one of the groups “stalwarts” Tony Whelan, who passed two years ago today. “No doubt he is looking down on us now and he would be very proud,” Cllr Kelleher said. The group is comprised of close to 90 volunteers, however on any given Sunday, the group would have 18 to 30 people out taking part in clean-ups and initiatives. He said that “there is so much more” to the work of Tidy Towns than what is commonly associated with it, namely litter picking. “It’s getting businesses and it’s getting the community to improve,” he added. As well as improving the built environment and streetscape, Ballincollig TidyTowns runs initiatives getting businesses to change to energy-efficient light bulbs, introduce re-usable coffee cups and setting up cleaner air initiatives. A lot of their work is done with local schools, with one using rainwater from its roof to harvest and water flowers around the town. He also stressed the importance of Tidy Towns in bringing people from different ethnic backgrounds and of all different ages working together. “Without Tidy Towns their circles wouldn’t interact. Tidy Towns is a big melting pot. It’s always about whatever somebody can give time wise,” he said. Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys, was on hand to present Ballincollig and all of the other winners in each of the categories with their awards, on top of announcing an additional €1.5 million in funding for over 900 groups. “Today you are all winners. What you do for your communities is admirable and commendable… you are out there whether rain, hail or shine,” Ms Humphreys said. MC Marty Morrissey said the awards ceremony at a packed out Hogan Suite in Croke Park was a “celebration of place”. A total of 904 towns and villages entered the competition this year, which has been running for 66 years. In place since 1958, the competition, administered by the Department of Rural and Community Development and sponsored by SuperValu, has grown beyond a competition into a national sustainability movement. Luke Hanlon, Managing Director of SuperValu paid tribute to the efforts of 30,000 volunteers across the island, with over one million hours put in by committees across the country this year. He also commended volunteers, 20pc of which are under 25 years old, for planting 108,000 trees and 200,000 square metres of flower beds. Towns and villages big and small across the country entered, ranging from the smallest in Category A – populations of under 200, to the largest, Category H – with 25,001 and over. A total of 80 Tidy Town centres were awarded gold medals. “Let’s acknowledge the efforts of all our volunteers,” Morrissey said, before a resounding cheer rung out for the medal winners. Silver and Bronze Medals, along with the 80 gold medals were also also given to entrants with scores that fall within a set range from that year’s winning score. Ireland’s tidiest village award went to Ballynahown in County Westmeath, which has a total population of 75 people, while Ireland’s tidiest small town went to Blackrock in County Louth. The winner of Ireland’s tidiest large town for 2024 was announced as Westport, while Ireland’s Tidiest Large Urban Centre went to Ballincollig. Minister Humphreys also presented the Young Person in TidyTowns award to Ballyphehane TidyTowns , Cork as well as the ‘Town Centre First National Award’ today to Carrickmacross TidyTowns, Co Monaghan. This was in recognition of their tremendous efforts to address vacancy and dereliction in line with the Government’s ‘Town Centre First‘ policy. A series of Endeavour Awards were given out for the biggest improvement by an entrant in each county from the previous year. There were also County Awards for the top three entrants in each county and Regional Awards for the top-scoring entrant in each region. The national island award went to Bere Island off the West Cork coast, while Belmullet TidyTowns won best Gaeltacht area. Assessment of participating towns was carried out by an independent panel of adjudicators appointed by the department during the months of June, July and August.

Title: TidyTowns 2024: Full list of winners as Ballincollig in Co Cork claims top prize

Ballincollig in Co Cork has been named the overall winner of the 2024 Supervalu TidyTowns Competition. Westport in Co Mayo was named Ireland’s tidiest large town, while Ballincollig also received the award for tidiest large urban centre, securing the award for the second year running. The coastal town of Blackrock in Co Louth received the award for tidiest small town while Ballinahown in Co Westmeath, which has a population of just 75 people, was named Ireland’s tidiest village. Some 30,000 volunteers from 904 towns and villages across Ireland took part in this year’s competition, representing one million hours of work. Cork City Councillor Garrett Kelleher, a long-standing member of the award-winning Ballincollig TidyTowns group, said the nearly 90 local volunteers represented “everything that’s best about community” and gathered together to work “for the greater good, for the benefit of the community”. He noted the group’s work also focused on taking “small steps” to encourage the wider community and local businesses to get more involved in adapting to the climate crisis. “A lot of people on the outside might associate it with the likes of litter picking and nice floral presentations but there’s so much more to it now.” The group brings together “people from different ethnic backgrounds” and “different ages, old and young” who under normal circumstances might never meet one another, he added. Mr Kelleher also paid tribute to former “stalwart” of the Ballincollig group, the late Tony Whelan. “He actually didn’t really want to win the national award because he said, by not winning it, it kept the standards high, and we were always striving to achieve it. But two years after his passing, the great Tony Whelan is looking down on us and would be very proud.” The winners of the 2024 competition were presented with their awards by Minister for Rural and Community Development Heather Humphreys and Supervalu managing director Luke Hanlon at the ceremony in Croke Park on Friday. More than €270,000 in prize money was awarded to groups across all categories in this year’s competition. Welcoming all participants to Croke Park, RTÉ broadcaster Marty Morrissey, who hosted the awards for the first time, underlined the national importance of the event. “This is Ireland,” said Mr Morrissey. “This is pride of place, this is about being from somewhere, wherever it is and it’s your country, your village, your town, your province. And we’re all from somewhere.” Mr Hanlon said that when individuals act together “no action is too small, local initiatives can spark global change, TidyTowns is testament to this”. The work of these communities focuses on “planting trees that will outlive us, clearing spaces where our children’s children will play and building communities that will thrive for generations,” he said. Mr Hanlon paid tribute to the 15 per cent of TidyTowns volunteers who were born outside Ireland and who bring “fresh perspectives” to the work. Ms Humphreys paid special tribute to all the children involved in the youth award, adding that all volunteers had been “instrumental in making our communities more attractive, inclusive and sustainable places for everyone”. Some 80 groups across the State received gold medals with special mentions for the town of Clane in Co Kildare, Monaghan town in Co Monaghan and the parish of Abbey in Co Galway. Bere Island off the coast of west Cork received the national island award; Beal an Mhuirthead TidyTowns in Co Mayo received the Gaeltacht award; Carrickmacross TidyTowns in Co Monaghan received the award for best town centre and the Balla Community TidyTowns group in Co Mayo received the inclusive communities award. Other winners of special awards included Dunboyne Senior National School in Co Meath for the School award; the Cork suburb of Ballyphehane in Co Cork for the Young Persons award; Ardmore Tidytowns in Co Waterford for the Heritage award and Portlaoise TidyTowns for the Tree Project award. The Supervalu TidyTowns competition, which is now in its 66th year, was cancelled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic, while in 2021 it was operated as remotely as possible and under strict social distancing rules. It returned as normal in 2022. In June of this year, Randalstown in Co Antrim was named Ireland’s Best Kept Town for 2024 in the separate all-island competition. Also among the winners were Malin in Co Donegal, which won Best Kept Village, and Roscommon which won Best Kept Large Town. The Ireland’s Best Kept Towns award, which is run by the Northern Ireland Amenity Council and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, allows the top towns from the Northern Ireland amenity council’s Best Kept Awards and the Supervalu TidyTowns Competition to compete with each other.

Title: Franklin Templeton Becomes First Asset Manager to Build a Tokenized Fund on Base

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Franklin Templeton became the first tokenized money fund on Coinbase’s Layer-2 (L2) blockchain late last night (on October 31). $FBOXX is already valued at a whopping $408M. By joining the largest L2 network by Total Value Locked (TVL), Templeton aims to boost the government money market fund’s appeal further. Since its initiation in 2021, the fund has primarily invested in US government securities with minimal credit risks. It ultimately aims to provide capital safety and easy access to treasury bills while maintaining a $1 share price. It’s the third largest treasury product in the $2.40B RWA market, hot on the heels of BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund ($BUIDL) and Ondo US Dollar Yield ($USDY). Beyond Base, $FBOXX is available on five other blockchain networks: Stellar, Arbitrum, Aptos, Avalanche, and Polygon. Stellar is the fund’s primary network. It’s the second largest blockchain network in the treasury market with a $391M market cap. Ethereum’s mainnet (valued at $1.67B) leads the charge. Still, Franklin Templeton taps into Ethereum’s top-rated L2 scaling solutions productively. Base dominates with a TVL of $2.45B, followed by Arbitrum ($2.36B) and Polygon ($1.17B). The fund joined Polygon on April 26, 2023, to capitalize on its Ethereum-based (ERC-20) assets, which were valued at $260B at the time. Further boosting its attraction and decentralization is its partnership with the Layer-1 (L1) blockchains, Aptos and Avalanche. Aptos’ active addresses have spiked by 1,138.95% since last year (from 53.61K to 664.2K), signaling a favorable time for $FBOXX. $FBOXX sets a new benchmark in digital asset management by being the first-ever tokenized money fund to join Base. Expanding its accessibility across various blockchain networks, Franklin Templeton pushes the boundaries regarding costs, security, and the very nature of making financial transactions in the tokenized treasury market. As blockchain technology continues to gain traction in TradFi, $FBOXX’s multichain approach, and fractionalized RWAs might spur other financial companies to follow suit – especially when considering the RWA market is poised to hit $600B by 2030.

Title: Bitcoin Rally Masks Bleaker Picture in the Crypto World

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Beyond Bitcoin’s rally toward another all-time high and renewed ETF inflows, a bleaker picture of crypto is emerging, one where waning interest in once-hot assets prompts some companies to slash jobs. Most Read from Bloomberg Is Denver’s Big Bet on E-Bikes Paying Off? The Answer To Making Cities More Family-Friendly? Courtyards Chicago Mayor Seeks Property Tax Hike, Breaking Campaign Vow Istanbul Tries Free Public Transit to Help Job Seekers NY Transit Agency Takes Next Step on Brooklyn-Queens Rail Link On Wednesday, crypto exchange Kraken announced job cuts a person familiar with the matter said amounts to 15% of workers, while rival Coinbase Inc. reported earnings that missed estimates. Software developer Consensys is among other digital-asset firms that recently started trimming jobs. Such cuts fly in the face of Bitcoin’s recent strength and industry optimism that Donald Trump, a crypto convert, will soon be in the White House again. At the same time, many blockchains that were touted as Bitcoin alternatives have languished, and fundraising by crypto startups slumped in the third quarter by one estimate. “It has been a Bitcoin-dominant market this cycle,” said Toby Lewis, co-founder of OrdinalsBot. “The hope of the wider crypto industry is that this will rotate into alternative coins, but this has taken longer than many expected.” A look at performance among top cryptocurrencies this year drives home the industry bifurcation. Bitcoin is up some 64% since Jan. 1, and Solana has posted similar gains. Dogecoin, the memecoin associated with Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and a staunch Trump supporter, has rallied almost 80%. Meanwhile, so-called altcoins like Polkadot, Polygon and Algorand have gotten hammered. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, was always the poster child for the sector’s booms and busts. But the hugely successful introduction of US exchange-traded funds backed by Bitcoin in January set the stage for its adoption on Wall Street, and the impact has been widely felt. BlackRock Inc.’s iShares Bitcoin Trust now oversees $31 billion after drawing nearly $900 million of inflows on Wednesday alone. The spoils haven’t flowed to all corners of crypto. Venture capital investment in digital-asset startups tumbled 20% in the third quarter from the prior three months, to $2.4 billion, according to Galaxy. VC deals remain a far way off the go-go days or the 2021 bull market, showing how confidence has yet to fully recover from the crash that followed. Other areas of crypto, like nonfungible tokens and blockchain-based gaming, never fully recovered from the crisis that ravaged the industry two years ago. Crypto exchanges are a good barometer of overall industry health because they typically list hundreds of tokens big and small. Coinbase, the biggest US platform, missed on both revenue and profit for the third quarter, sending the stock plunging as much as 15% on Thursday. Kraken, which announced its job cuts in a blog post on Wednesday, said it’s making “organizational discipline decisions” to eliminate redundant management layers. As part of the C-suit reshuffle, its chief technology officer and chief product officer have left the company, and it appointed a new finance chief. Consensys, which provides software for the Ethereum network, is trimming 20% of its workforce while DYdX Trading Inc. recently said it’s firing more than a third of its employees. Many firms — including Consensys — attribute their problems at least in part to lack of clarity around US regulations. Perceived hostility from the US Securities and Exchange Commission has galvanized large swathes of the industry behind Trump, who has said he’d fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler if elected. “We’re seeing regulatory uncertainty potentially adding to costs for a number of large US operators including centralized exchanges,” said Evgeny Gokhberg, managing partner at crypto investment firm Re7 Capital. Polymarket, a crypto-based predictions marketplace, currently assigns a 63% chance of Trump winning the election. That’s a far higher probability than in opinion polls, which show the race essentially a toss-up. Such is Trump’s perceived impact on crypto that Bitcoin slumped on Friday as odds on his election fell in some betting markets. But even if he wins, large parts of the crypto industry will still face structural hurdles in turning ideas into profits. The struggles of some digital-asset companies are the result of the difficulty they’ve encountered in generating revenues from their technologies, according to Cristiano Ventricelli, a senior analyst at Moody’s Ratings. “In addition, the industry exhibits high degree [of] fragmentation, both in practices and in the variety of products and services available, resulting in a marked disconnect between demand and supply,” he said in a written response to questions. --With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla and Emily Nicolle.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-reaches-2-of-total-btc-supply-amid-record-inflows/

On Wednesday, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, achieved a significant milestone in the Bitcoin ETF market, recording the largest inflows since the inception of these investment funds in January. According to Bloomberg, approximately $872 million flowed into BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust on Wednesday, marking a daily record for the fund. This influx highlights the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs, with subscriptions for this nine-month-old product ranking among the highest globally for ETFs in 2024. As a result of the inflows, BlackRock’s total holdings in Bitcoin now stand at 429,185 BTC, valued at approximately $31.04 billion. This accounts for about 2.04% of Bitcoin’s total supply, capped at 21 million coins. The recent inflows are being attributed to a phenomenon dubbed the “Trump trade,” as pro-crypto Republican nominee Donald Trump gains momentum in betting markets ahead of the upcoming election day on November 5. Bitcoin is on the verge of reaching new heights, fueled by a 13% rally in October. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted on Bloomberg Television that the demand for these ETFs is palpable, suggesting that investors are responding not only to Bitcoin’s upward momentum but also to Trump’s favorable odds in the political arena. Trump has made headlines with his pledge to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet” and to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the country to halve the US’s $35 trillion national debt. In contrast, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, has pledged to support a regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry but has not provided further details on how her potential new administration will address the community’s calls for a change in leadership at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approach to digital assets. Amid bullish predictions for the leading crypto of the industry, market expert Ali Martinez has shared compelling insights regarding Bitcoin’s potential price trajectory for the months ahead. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Martinez analyzed historical patterns, noting that Bitcoin has typically peaked between the 1.618 and 2.272 Fibonacci retracement levels during past bull cycles. If this trend continues, Martinez predicts that Bitcoin could reach a price range between $174,000 and $462,000 in the current cycle. In addition to these price predictions, Martinez pointed to another bullish indicator: a significant outflow of Bitcoin from cryptocurrency exchanges. Over the past 48 hours, approximately 8,000 BTC, valued at around $576 million, have been withdrawn from exchanges. This trend signifies a growing inclination among investors to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than sell it, which can create upward pressure on prices as BTC inches closer to its all-time high level of $73,700 reached in March. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $71,640. This represents a retracement of 1.2% over the past 24 hours.

It has been a challenging year for restaurants, but despite the odds, the industry remains bold, and a new wave of restaurants made their debut – 18 of which make this list. These new openings are not just in Dublin; places like New Ross and Lismore are seeing exciting new spots, bringing fresh energy to local communities. You will find here also some beautiful places to plan a special night out with pals or family, just in time for the festive season. If you’re after something more low-key, our cosy and casual categories are ideal for laid-back meals with friends, while you can see where exceptional value is to be had in the smart money section. There are lots of options too for those who want to push the boat out for a date night, destination dining, or a glam evening. As always, it is a list of just 100, with a focus on new restaurants, so sadly we couldn’t include everyone. Be sure to support all your local favourites too. The most exciting east-Asian-inspired food in town at the moment comes from this Aston Quay restaurant, where a Santa Maria barbecue that has been custom-made by Smokin’ Soul is at the heart of the menu. Start with the by now legendary chargrilled mussels and work through the menu with some very fine cocktails. Read our review here. Corinna Hardgrave With the opening of casual Baba’de, Chef Ahmet Dede returns to the building where he earned the first of his two Michelin stars with Dede restaurant, partnering once again with Maria Archer. It’s charmingly named for Ahmet’s daughter Aleyna. During the morning, the menu is all about Turkish-style breakfast, while the evening offers an eclectic mixture of beguiling small plates. With the winter months closing in, look out for wine club evenings with guest sommeliers. Joanne Cronin Cork people are known to have deep feelings about the best chipper in the city, with KC & Sons from the Crawford family frequently a top contender. Now Josh Crawford, along with Arkansas-born wife Kate, is moving in a very different direction with the opening of Bayou, a New Orleans-inspired restaurant. For anyone who has ever been to the Big Easy, the menu of fried chicken and biscuits, beignets and muffulettas will feel immediately authentic. JC Jumoke Akintola and Peter Hogan have opened this luxe fish and chip shop in the beautiful first floor of their premises in Tramore. It is open year round – eat in (seating 20, now even cosier with a wood-burning stove), or takeaway – and offers an interesting wine list. A handful of smaller plates includes local seafood from Tramore Bay, such as crab or lobster salad, local prawns, or Duncannon smoked salmon and chowder, all served with their home-made soda bread. Beer battered fish and chips are €19.95; and plaice, John Dory, and turbot are available as daily specials at market prices. The Seafood Restaurant is closed for winter and will reopen in March 2025. CH If you’re starting to wonder whether the restaurant business is all gimmicks and Instagram filters these days, just head straight to Bearú in New Ross. By day, it’s a smart cafe, by night, a proper restaurant – no fuss, no frills – run by chef Dave Rowley and his wife, local woman Siobhán Ward. The menu’s tight, just three choices per course, and that’s because they cook what’s fresh – fish practically flapping in off the boats and seasonal produce. Read our review here. CH Affordable dumplings are the star in this stripped-back, budget-friendly joint, where the glowing neon CN Dumpling sign above your head is just about the fanciest thing in the room. You’ve got options: steamed, grilled, boiled, or drowned in a fierce Sichuan chilli broth, or snowflake style. There are sides too, such as a cucumber and jellyfish salad that’s as refreshing as it is unexpected. It’s the kind of place for popping into for a quick, tasty bite. Read our review here. CH There was a collective cheer when Coppinger swung open its freshly revamped doors back in August, and with chef Daniel Hannigan at the helm, the food has taken a serious step up. It’s a sharing plates affair, with no shortage of tasty options, and – thankfully – no minimum spend to box you in. The cocktails are a triumph. Start with the celery gimlet and work your way through the list. Read our review here. CH Fresh from a morning swim, Elaine Slattery used to drive to Lahinch for a hot chocolate. Wanting something closer to home, she transformed a 200-year-old cottage in Liscannor into Dolly’s coffee shop. Open since August, it’s now the spot for a post-dip hot chocolate, chai latte after a coastal walk, or a yoga-recovery matcha. Pastel de nata, Viennoisserie and sourdough are supplied from Hugo’s, there’s Happy Tummy bread, and organic vegetables and eggs from Moy Hill Farm. Upstairs is a community space for yoga, Pilates and poetry readings. Dogs are very welcome (it’s named after her own pooch). CH Stools hug the counters by the wall and window at chef Derek Kelly and Nicole Keegan’s Mount Merrion restaurant, while the snug delivers a proper sit-down vibe for those who like a bit more intimacy. The menu calls it “small and large plates”, but it easily adapts to starters and mains. Tasty, shareable dishes include free-range, spicy fried chicken and charred baby leeks smothered in ajo blanco, and it’s worth checking out the red prawn fregola. Read our review here. CH Storm Babet’s rampage through Midleton in east Cork in 2023 had a devastating impact on Farmgate Café, which Maróg O’Brien had opened in 1983. Now newly opened in Lismore in a heritage building that once played host to O’Brien’s Pub, there is a long counter area for walk-ins and diningroom at the back. The menu is based on local, seasonal produce which is cooked simply, preserving the original ethos of Farmgate. Read our review here. CH Floritz surely can lay claim to being the most glamorous diningroom in Ireland, bursting with bright colours and a luxe style that can only be described as Georgian tropical. Chef Matt Fuller oversees an extensive menu of small and large plates with a strong Asian influence. Groups can share plates of charcoal grilled yakitori, sushi, bao or dishes such as miso roast black cod. Read our review here. JC Forest Avenue feels like a neighbourhood spot until you taste what John Wyer does with suckling pig and vegetables from the McNally family farm and then you realise it’s quietly exceptional. The three-course lunch is a reasonable €49, while the evening tasting menu will set you back €89, a bargain for what they’re offering. And if that wasn’t enough, owners John and Sandy Wyer are doubling down with plans to open a French bistro next door, charmingly named Forêt. Read our review here. CH Owner Will Monaghan hit the headlines recently when he was candid about the struggle faced by city centre restaurants. Hidden is his latest venture, smack in the heart of Smithfield. The vibe here is similar to sister restaurant One Society, with tasty all-day brunch, switching to tapas, wine and pizza in the evenings, made using a wide range of produce from Irish suppliers. Read our review here. JC It’s a brave move to change a much-loved restaurant but that’s exactly what Andrea and Stephen McAllister did when they transformed The Pig’s Ear into Lotus Eaters. They describe it as serving the type of flavours that they love to cook at home. Pick and mix from dishes such as barbecue pork belly skewers, poached chicken salad with cucumber and rayu, or their signature Wagyu beef burger. Read our review here. JC Nádúr (meaning ‘nature’ in Irish) is the little sister to Cork’s much loved Good Day Deli. Owners Clare Condon and New Zealander Kristin Makirere have taken a unique little 18th century building and fitted it out with Irish oak, bespoke ceramics and Irish linen, while maintaining the style of fresh, seasonal food they have long championed. Visit for breakfast, coffee and lunch. JC It’s all about tequila and grilling at Jules Mak’s new Mexican restaurant. The margarita made with Casamigos tequila and avocado syrup is already a signature serve but there are nine others from which to choose. Chef Hector Gutierrez Ochoa turns out bites, hand-pressed tacos and meaty main courses grilled over open fire, including strip loin steak with chimichurri. The atmosphere is buzzy and booking is essential. Read our review here. JC Not everyone loves a communal table, but if you’re heading to Blackrock’s latest by-day cafe, by-night wine bar, you’ll find more intimate options if you book wisely. Delicious, small plates such as line-caught mackerel in ajo blanco are on the evening menu, and the well-chosen wine list means this is the sort of spot where you could easily find yourself lingering. Read our review here. CH Chef Alex Greene became famous due to the Great British Menu, becoming the first chef from Northern Ireland to secure a course at the banquet. Along with close friend and business partner Bronagh McCormick, he has recently reopened The Buck’s Head in Dundrum. The focus is on traditional pub food, done excellently, so expect lobster Thermidor with salad and fries or the de Terra shorthorn burger topped with pulled beef shin. JC With stone walls, timber beams and a coastal vibe, this Greystones spot has Sheerin Wilde (ex-Avalon) managing and Jaco Pretorius (formerly of La Maison) running the kitchen. The fish-led menu also offers steak, chicken and vegetarian dishes, keeping things flexible. Starters are under €15.50, while mains range from €19.50 for moules marinières to €42 for a 16oz Irish Angus T-bone. It’s as good for a quick bite as it is for something special. Read our review here. CH This may be one of Dublin’s smallest restaurants, but the flavours and dishes far exceed its mere physical dimensions. Named in August as Michelin’s Bib of the Month, its buzzy atmosphere fits in perfectly with the recent adoption of Drury Street by the young and fun. Kick-start the evening with “Amy’s Cherry Sgropino”, a mix of sparkling wine, Campari and saffron. JC Chefs Nicole and Bart Pawlukojć, who met while working in Denmark, marked five years in business by giving their sleek Kilkenny daytime spot a complete refurb. Their famous sourdough stars across the a la carte and brunch menus, showing up in sandwiches such as the kimchi chicken grilled cheese. For something heartier, try the not-so-Turkish eggs with Ballon Farm’s perfectly runny fried eggs, served with roasted Mooncoin beetroot and wilted organic greens. CH This Mediterranean seafood joint, with its Italian-heavy focus, has a menu split into spuntini, smalls, larges and desserts, with specials chalked up daily. Fresh morcilla is flambéed tableside in sambuca, and padella di mare, packed with Kilkeel crab claws and Killary Fjord mussels sautéed in a vermouth, comes sizzling in cast iron. Don’t skip the home-made gelato. Read our review here. CH Fish Shop’s charm lies in its confident simplicity. Start with sherry and a gilda, then move on to impeccably cooked fish, perhaps paired with a Jura white from their 200-bottle wine list. With just 15 counter stools, booking ahead is essential. The menu features cockles with chorizo, anchovies on toast, and the best crispy fish and chips in town. Grower Champagne by the glass is an added bonus. CH Owners Gilles Gaillot and Emma Gray have transformed this former bookies into a neighbourhood treasure. The wood-fired oven is in constant service, turning out pastries and breads in the morning, before switching to French-style pizzas in the evening. Loyal customers stop to fill up on lunchtime soup and hearty sandwiches, while young couples linger over pizzas topped with Bayonne ham, merguez sausage and Emmental cheese. JC The bright neon “Saigon” sign mounted on the rear wall gives a good clue as to what’s on offer. Through the open pass, chef Phillip Hughes oversees delivery of the east-Asia-inspired menu, with options such as Crying Tiger marinated Irish beef, classic Pad Thai or red curry with Skeaghanore duck leg, served with elegant cocktails. There’s a well priced lunch menu and a private room upstairs for groups. JC A fixture on the Cork food scene which has recently doubled in size, at Izz Cafe, Izz and Eman Alkarajeh serve up a mixture of mezze-style Palestinian foods and manaeesh-topped flatbreads, with breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Ingredients are sourced from Palestine, or closer to home from the English Market and the Cork Rooftop Garden. Watch out for their Coffee for Palestine fundraiser in conjunction with more than 90 Cork cafes. JC The interiors at Kai are always as seasonal as the food. With windows currently full of beautiful, orange pumpkins and autumnal foliage, dishes such as John Dory with burnt butter cauliflower and fried cob nuts reflect the time of year. Holding the only Michelin Green Star in Ireland, chef and owner Jess Murphy is a firm advocate of farm to fork, and desserts are made by sister business Hapi Bakery. JC Earlier this year, Sham Hanifa released his first cookbook, Agak Agak, a tribute to his heritage which spans China, Thailand, Malaysia and India. Readers will be drawn into his world of deep aromatics and rich flavours, just as if they were sitting in his restaurant, open every day from breakfast to evening. Try classics such as the chicken satay or beef rending. JC Alain Morice’s 20-seater deli, daytime bistro and wine bar blends French charm with Irish produce. The small menu features a weekly pâté en croute, a labour of love, which could be pork, figs and herbs wrapped in crisp, golden pastry. Galway snails swim in garlicky butter and the roast chicken Dauphinoise is pure comfort. Desserts by Morice’s sister finish things off perfectly. Read our review here. CH After five years in business, chef Conor Halpenny briefly closed Square earlier this year to allow time for a recharge and reset, before reopening with a fresh new menu. This restaurant’s joy and love is evident in every dish, from home-made crisps snowed under by cheese, the Square “KFC”, and trofie pasta with courgette and Boyne Valley Bán cheese. Look out for wine glasses with a little dog motif, a tribute to Alfie, the restaurant dog. JC With three cafes dotted around Dublin city, Stephen O’Dwyer’s Tang is a popular choice for a healthy, nutritious and joyous lunch. But it’s gone up another level with the arrival of the casual evening menu at Cumberland Place. Home-grown chef Aoibheann’s menu is heavily influenced by flavours of the Middle East, with pillowy focaccia, smoky aubergine dip and halloumi in bright, vibrant harissa yoghurt, all enjoyed with glasses from the short wine list. JC With an open wood grill burning in the heart of the kitchen, and home-brewed beers to accompany their fine steaks, Elbow Lane is a Cork treasure. JC Whether you’re dining in the elaborate main room or on the beautiful terrace, Fire remains one of Dublin’s most popular spots for steak. JC Quality steaks in a casual setting at very pocket friendly prices. JC Given that the Buckley family started as butchers, it’s no surprise that this award-winning group of restaurants serve some of Ireland’s finest steaks. JC This award-winning gastropub knows how to serve up great steaks, paired perfectly with one of their own craft beers. JC Whether it’s the good value rump steak at lunch, or a hearty porterhouse for dinner, enjoy them all in Dublin’s most stunning diningroom. Read our review here. JC Charcoal-grilled Tyrone beef, wine and cocktails make James St the smart choice for steaks in Belfast. JC Enjoy Gilligan’s Farm dry-aged steaks, cooked in a charcoal Josper oven in this busy Galway spot. JC This luxe gastropub in the heart of Cashel serves fine, hearty steaks, best enjoyed with triple-cooked chips and their shallot and Bourguignon sauce. JC With restaurants in Cork and Limerick, the stylish Cornstore serves up premium dry-aged steaks and fun cocktails. JC Kilian Walsh, formerly of L’Enclume, heads the kitchen at this Michelin-starred restaurant. The €105 tasting menu features inventive dishes such as mushroom custard with ox tongue and sweetcorn, and grilled pork with artichoke barigoule. With a strong focus on seasonal Irish produce from Castleruddery Organic Farm, the restaurant caters particularly well to vegetarians and vegans. A recent mini refurb has added new flooring and banquet seating, keeping the space casual but fresh. Read our review here. CH Located a short distance from Belfast, Frae is to be found in the food Mecca that is Holywood. The constantly changing menu from chef Shaun Tinman is always fun and creative, with specials featuring veal scallopine with Gorgonzola butter and sherry sauce, or chargrilled chicken Marbella, drawing flavours from right across the island. Choose from the excellent natural wine list and let the relaxed service set you at ease. JC Grano is one of those Dublin restaurants where reservations are rarer than hen’s teeth. Since it opened in 2018, Roberto Mungo’s handmade pasta has had diners coming back for more. To understand his attitude to quality, consider the fact that he only uses flour made from an ancient grain called Senatore Cappelli that is grown near his Calabrian hometown using low-intervention methods. JC Operating from a small but buzzy space, Niall McDermott and Chloe Kearney have built up a loyal customer base with their short and sharp menus of small plates, fresh pasta and large sharing meats. Plates such as pumpkin cappellacci with sage and walnuts or the pork chop from Pigs on the Green have become signature items. When closed, the duo often make the space available for pop-up and charity events. JC With more than 100 wines from which to choose, the wine list at Note is an homage to biodynamic, natural and low-intervention winemaking. In the kitchen, Essa Fakhry has established a unique style of modern Irish cooking that sometimes dances on the edge of austerity but never disappoints in flavour. Try crab crumpet with sea urchin espuma or roast quail with coco beans and girolles to experience for yourself. Read our review here. JC After two years of quietly shaping the menu, head chef Miguel Frutos is now making Paradiso unmistakably his. The vegetable-led dishes, sourced from Gortnanain Farm, are nothing short of remarkable, and the €68 six-course tasting menu feels like a steal. The wine list, too, stands out for its accessibility. Meanwhile, long-time manager Dave O’Mahony is stepping into ownership alongside Miguel, marking a new chapter for this Cork institution. Read our review here. CH Sometimes it’s easy to overlook the classics in favour of the new, but the Saddle Room at Dublin’s own grande dame hotel remains an excellent choice for relaxed smart dining, whether for lunch or a special occasion. Stop at the seafood bar for some oysters and champagne, or indulge in a magnificent chateaubriand carved table side, all in a cosy cocoon right in the city centre. JC Paul McNamara, Simon Barrett, and Liz Matthews run a Spanish-influenced restaurant where the menu includes dishes such as Cantabrian anchovies, Ibérico pork presa, Coolea agnolotti and brill à la plancha. For two, the salt-aged Delmonico with Béarnaise, beef dripping potatoes, and Bordelaise sauce (€82) is a regular favourite. The 300-bottle wine list covers sherries, Spanish small producers and a strong line-up of grower champagnes. CH The €90, six-course tasting menu at Michelin-starred Variety Jones ranks among the best meals I’ve had this year – no fuss, just superb cooking in a relaxed setting. Chef-patron Keelan Higgs has an obsession with local, organic and seasonal produce, all seared by the intense heat of the open fire. Highlights include oysters dressed in a punchy Vietnamese sauce, duck liver parfait with waffles, a gloriously rich spaghetti Alfredo, and barbecued monkfish. The food manages to be both precise and bold, yet never loses its playful edge. CH This small premises on Kevin Street is from the people behind the Fish Shop in Stoneybatter and the Beach House restaurant in Tramore, Co Waterford, so it should be no surprise that both the food and the wines are superb. Read our review here. CH Nelly’s Café in Drumcondra transforms into Brut Wine Bar on Friday and Saturday evenings, offering small bites and interesting wines. CH From Enda McEvoy of the late, lamented Loam in Galway, Éan is a bakery and casual lunch place that at night becomes a creative restaurant and friendly wine bar, with a great selection of natural and organic wines. CH A long-established food shop and restaurant upstairs, their wine cellar offers 300 different bottles as well as beers and cocktails, and a great selection of food from the Italian-focused menu. CH A wine shop and casual wine bar serving low-intervention wines and light snacks around a friendly communal table. Read our review here. CH With charming sommelier Nick Fajours (previously of Knockranny House) behind this venture, an interesting wine list is no surprise. There’s also plenty of emphasis on cocktails, with old classics and more inventive creations. CH A great addition to the neighbourhood scene in Kimmage, with a menu focused on small snacks and a great selection of wines by the glass. CH A spin-off from Elaine Murphy’s Washerwoman restaurant next door, Little Washer offers pizzas, pasta and small plates, as well as an extensive wine list. CH A coffee shop by day, just opposite the RDS, Mr Magpie turns into a wine bar with small plates on Friday and Saturday nights. CH Here’s a change from all the cafes that turn into wine bars – a bookshop that turns into a wine bar. Thursday through Sunday from 5pm the bar is open, with an interesting variety of sherries and good selection of wines. CH More than 100 wines by the glass (and 250 by the bottle) plus a broad food menu with an emphasis on local seafood. CH On Montague Street in Dublin, this tiny, oh-so-cool space offers coffee, breakfast and lunch, then 40 different wines and sharing plates of food later in the evening. CH The wine list in this Waterford city spot is exceptional – which is hardly surprising, as Morgan VanderKamer, president of the Irish Guild of Sommeliers, co-owns it. Her partner, Stephen McArdle, ensures the food is equally impressive. Read our review here. CH For those craving a Michelin-starred experience without remortgaging the house, Garrett Byrne and Bríd Hannon’s restaurant offers a lunch and early bird menu at an astonishing €48 for three courses. Dinner, naturally, pushes things a little higher at €78, but what you get in return are dishes rooted in the classics, such as foie gras “crème caramel”, saddle of lamb and roast almond ice cream. CH Mirco Fondrini’s osteria offers a slice of Lombardy right in the heart of town, with pasta and sauces crafted in-house. The menu is pure comfort, with dishes such as home-made tagliatelle with porcini, oven-baked cannelloni stuffed with ragú bianco, and Skeaghanore duck breast paired with braised shallots in agrodolce. Bruno Pangia from Naples now heads the kitchen, and with prices at €39 for starter and main, or €32 for main and dessert, it’s great value for what’s on offer. Read our review here. CH The historic heart of Waterford City is beating strongly once more, and Peter Everett’s modern Irish restaurant is bang in the middle. It occupies the remains of a 15th-century building, a claim few others can match. Everett’s consistently offers excellent value for money, while Waterford and local producers are represented on the menu by the likes of Tuskar crab, Comeragh lamb and Clashganny apples. JC It’s rare for a chef to relinquish a Michelin star but that is exactly what Takashi Miyazaki did when he decided to transform his fine-dining kaiseki restaurant into a more relaxed bistro and natural wine bar serving handmade buckwheat noodles, donburi bowls and tasty snacks. Cork folk rewarded him with even more business, and customer demand has resulted in the launch of dedicated sushi nights. Read our review here. JC With a newly minted Michelin Bib Gourmand, Lottie’s is a solid choice for dinner with pals. If you’re after something quick and casual, the two/three course, €29/€35 early evening menu (Wednesday-Friday from 5pm-6pm) is great value. For a longer evening, the ground-floor terrace (heated and covered) is open for outdoor dining or pre-dinner drinks. Menu highlights include Castledermot lamb with flatbread, Andarl Farm pork chop, and free-range chicken, all cooked over the live fire grill. Read our review here. CH With its €30/€35 early bird menu, Thursday steak nights and solid Sunday roasts, you’d be forgiven for thinking this place is just about neighbourhood comfort food. But behind the scenes, Gareth Naughton is quietly taking things up a level. And things are about to get more interesting with the launch of his intimate 12-seater upstairs, where he’ll be serving a chef’s tasting menu. Read our review here. CH A review of One Pico’s Instagram account will reveal beautiful dishes, plated with elegance and flair. It’s all due to head chef Zhan Sergejev, who combines a background in art and photography with his style of flavourful, modern French cooking. The diningroom remains ever elegant, a lovely spot for lunch or dinner, with a wine list heavily influenced by terroir and organic or biodynamic winemaking. Read our review here. JC Though many places have dropped the early bird menu, this bustling neighbourhood favourite still offers two/three courses for €40/€46 each evening. The menu is anything but ordinary. Starters such as roast beetroot with ricotta, courgette and black olive, or cured mackerel with tomato and smoked eel cream bring a fresh twist. Mains include pan-seared halibut with squid marinière or the indulgent suckling pig loin paired with ham hock, sausage and an Iberico ham doughnut. CH John and Tara Coffey are celebrating 18 years in business, just in time for game season, their favourite time of the year. Over the next few months the menu will feature partridge, venison, mallard, wood pigeon and pheasant, all supplied by Eamon Giblin of Gourmet Game. Their cosy restaurant is truly one of Ireland’s low-key treasures, and well worth a stop when travelling across the country. JC David Devereaux may jokingly say that he is the “worst home cook on the planet” but his food at this lovely Cork city restaurant continues to go from strength to strength. Along with partner Anne Zagar, they now focus on evening service, which is proving hugely popular with Corkonians. Stand-out dishes include confit pork belly with rhubarb and mustard cream, and ricotta and hen’s yolk raviolo in onion broth. JC Daróg, run by Zsolt Lukács (ex-Aniar sommelier) and his wife Edel McMahon, is a wine bar at heart but also a serious restaurant. Attila Galambos (formerly of Aniar and Lignum) seems to really have hit his stride here, with dishes like softshell crab tempura with wasabi emulsion, kingfish crudo with yuzu, and king scallops with Connemara surf clams. There is now an option of a five-course tasting menu (€55), and the wine list is as sharp as the food. Read our review here. CH It’s hard to believe that Dax is celebrating 20 years in business. There’s no shouting from the rooftops or splashy renovations – just Graham Neville serving up some of the best classic French food in Dublin, long before “quiet luxury” was a thing. Olivier Meisonnave’s very fine wine list and impeccable service adds to the sheer joy of dining here. The two/three course lunch menu (€42/€58), is one of the most wonderful escapes on a dreary Friday afternoon, and the three-course dinner (€89) is equally lovely. CH Killian Durkin and Jess D’Arcy have their eyes set on the flavours of autumn at Mamó. Dishes such as rabbit strozzapretti or sika venison with parfait, Roscoff onion and braised leeks are sure to warm the heart and stomach, but rest assured, their signature “cod chip” remains. Set lunch is available on weekdays with a la carte in the evenings. JC There’s a true joy and warmth to be found in Barbara Nealon’s popular restaurant where chef Rebeca Recarey Sanchez continues to tempt with specials such as chard with pine nuts, raisins and ajo blanco, or mackerel escabeche with leeks and a jammy egg. The popular “Somewich Sunday”, combining sandwiches and wine, returns soon, as does Provisions, the take-home service of tasty bits and cook-at-home meals. JC Celebrating 10 years in business, The Old Spot has just published a magnificent cookbook which beautifully captures the warmth and friendliness of this cosy gastropub. It’s all about comfort food here, including free-range scotch egg made with Andarl pork and Sneem black pudding, roast chicken supreme with dumplings, and perfect panna cottas. With a great selection of cocktails and drinks, you’ll find it hard to leave. JC This 1820s coach house is exactly where you want to land after a brisk walk in the Wicklow Hills. The kitchen works with suppliers including Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach Organic and Higgins Family Butchers, and the menu has hearty options such as Dundrum Bay crab fazzoletti with heirloom tomatoes, cod and chips, and a rich Wagyu cheeseburger. For something more casual, pop into their next-door sister spot, Roundwood Stores bakery. Read our review here. CH Vaughan’s Pub in Liscannor has been a go-to for more than 40 years, serving up lobster bisque, foie gras, steaks and freshly caught fish alongside a 200-bottle wine list. James Vaughan leads the kitchen here, while his father Denis runs the more laid-back Vaughan’s on the Pier in Lahinch. Seafood is landed daily and the seafood chowder, classic fish and chips, and fresh catches are the stars. CH Chapter One remains the one to beat, not just for its two Michelin stars or the three-course €85 lunch menu, but because it is resolutely one of the best restaurants in the world. Exquisite use of produce and meticulous and detailed cooking mean every morsel, from the first amuse bouche to the petits fours, is likely to be among the best you will ever taste. CH Having joined the ranks of Ireland’s Michelin-starred restaurants this year, D’Olier Street is one of the hottest tickets in town. Book one of the prime seats at the low kitchen counter to watch James Moore and team move smoothly through service, or relax at a table in the sleekly aesthetic diningroom. For the non-drinkers, there’s a creative non-alcoholic cocktail pairing to go with the tasting menu. Read our review here. JC This Cork stalwart has recently undergone a dramatic glow up, shedding its formerly muted tones for a plush floral and green inspired decor that reflects the small courtyard garden. With the English Market nearby, the new menu is firmly anchored by comforting favourites such as seafood chowder made with catch from Ballycotton, beef and Beamish stew and Quigley’s lamb shank. JC The sleek styling, large glass windows and Scandi vibes at Lignum are in strong contrast to Danny Africano’s preferred cooking style over primal fire. The end result, though, is modern and elegant, with dishes retaining just a lingering imprint of the flames. Current specials include Killary Fjord mussel and sea urchin flan and a glorious mixed seafood pasta with red mullet and gambero rosso di Mazara. Read our review here. JC Open for more than 20 years, this fine-dining venue with impeccable hospitality remains one of the top choices for special occasions and chic lunches. The classic French-style cooking is elegant and subtle, with occasional lively touches. Whatever you order, be sure to indulge in the luxurious pomme purée and the wonderful cheese trolley that is wheeled table side. JC The arched vaults of the Bishop’s Buttery, which boasts one of Ireland’s newest Michelin stars, are on the basement level of the beautifully restored Cashel Palace Hotel. The cooking style is classically French, while making extensive use of Tipperary and Irish producers. Look out for an upcoming series of dinners in conjunction with luxury beverage producers including Deutz champagne and Macallan whisky. Read our review here. JC Executive head chef Mark Treacy brings a wealth of experience to Kenmare, having previously worked in Dromoland Castle, Thornton’s and L’Ecrivain. Since taking over in 2022 he has steered this large, elegant diningroom towards modern classics, prepared using seasonal Irish ingredients. Dishes such as ravioli filled with Coolea cheese in onion broth, or cod with mussels, peas and girolles in Vin Jaune sauce are sure to please all comers. JC The Lady Helen at Mount Juliet Estate, now beautifully refurbished to highlight its elegant stuccowork, is a Michelin-starred diningroom led by John Kelly. His French-influenced, eight-course tasting menu (€160) showcases top Irish ingredients with dishes such as Mullaghmore lobster with violet artichoke and bouillabaisse, and Tipperary organic veal with black truffle and aged Comté. Kelly’s cooking is precise and ingredient-driven, perfectly complementing the grandeur of the room. CH Set against stunning views of the Burren, every dish here is crafted with meticulous technique. The €95 menu starts with canapés, including warm miso velouté with smoked eel. Atlantic scallops are sliced, cured and paired with rhubarb, while roast halibut is served with peas and broad beans fresh from the kitchen garden, bathed in butter. Jonathan Farrell, ex-sous chef at Bastible, leads the kitchen with confidence and skill – one of my top predictions for a Michelin star in 2025. Read our review here. CH The Morrisson Room oozes old-world grandeur, complete with Lafranchini stuccowork and a menu that matches the surroundings. Chef Adam Nevin (former head chef at The Dorchester) returned to his native Maynooth in 2023 and has been turning out refined, thoughtful dishes ever since. The dinner tasting menu runs at €110, with a signature menu at €140. Expect plenty of luxury ingredients and tableside theatre. Sunday lunch is a more laid-back affair, with two courses for €55, or three for €65. Closed for the month of January. Read our review here. CH Aniar is so much more than a Michelin-starred restaurant. After all, owner JP McMahon is truly dedicated to Irish food. Following 13 years in business, Aniar recently underwent a refit in conjunction with Marmar Architects, and the result is an interior that guides the diner through the 24-course tasting menu experience, all the time subtly mirroring the landscape of the west of Ireland. JC There’s a lot of talk about Ballyfin this year, the ultra-expensive hotel where Amal and George Clooney once stayed and Kanye and Kim honeymooned. The Michelin guide awarded the hotel three keys (the equivalent of three stars for hotels) and posted glowing pictures of the food, promptly adding to the speculation that it is primed to land a star. UK chef Richard Picard-Edwards has made no secret of his ambition, and with dishes like pea cream and broad beans with Belgian caviar, Mossfield ravioli in onion consommé and squab pigeon with foie gras and leg ravioli, it may just be the time to pop an email to see if one of those non-resident tables for the €145 tasting menu is available. CH Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix focuses on local, seasonal ingredients and precise cooking, drawing on Sam’s pedigree (Ballyfin, Bath Priory). The lunch menu and midweek “Supper at Six” offer great value but dinner is where the kitchen shines, with a la carte and tasting menus (€75) using vegetables from their walled garden. Highlights include honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion and organic slow roast duck. Read our review here. CH Change is in the air at Ashford Castle. The stately, dark wood panelling of the George V diningroom is now home to executive head chef Liam Finnegan, who works closely with the estate’s newly planted kitchen garden and local suppliers to bring a modern touch to the classics-inspired menu. The wine cellar is famously richly stocked, and has an extensive list of wines by the glass. JC In a restored 200-year-old cottage, Michelin-starred chef Robbie McCauley crafts precise, seasonal dishes, using produce from his own organic garden and ducks he raises himself. With his wife Sophie running the front of house, the experience is both personal and polished. Dishes such as fallow deer with fermented red cabbage or Liscannor Bay crab with garden kohlrabi show the kitchen’s sensitivity to seasonality on the eight-course tasting menu (€109). From November a seven-course afternoon menu (€70), running from 2pm-6pm, adds another option. Read our review here. CH Owner Damien Grey recently announced on Instagram that Liath is looking for a new home. But fear not – for the time being the Blackrock Market continues to host this tiny fine-dining powerhouse. Liath has a philosophy that espouses exploration of the senses, so the diner is drawn inward over the course of the meal into the imagination of Grey and head chef, Jozef Radacovsky. JC Despite being possibly the busiest man in Irish cooking, with television shows, demonstrations and cookware ranges, Neven Maguire’s MacNean House and Restaurant remains one of the most popular destinations in Ireland for a special meal. Often booked out months in advance, the generous hospitality and even more generous cooking from head chef Carmel McGirr feels very special indeed. JC Rob Krawczyk’s Michelin-starred tasting menu is all about restraint, showcasing local ingredients with skill. His home-made charcuterie and organic produce from Lisheen Greens flow through the courses. The four-course menu (€70) offers a taste of his craft, while the Signature Tasting (€149) includes wild halibut with Roaring Water Bay mussels. Upstairs, it’s more laid-back with “Small Plates, Nibbles & Snacks.” Closes through January. CH Dining at Terre is a spectacle from the moment you set foot inside, and it’s not just the open kitchen where French chef Vincent Crepel overseas the dramatically lit pass. It’s the quality of produce and the precision of cooking that makes this two-Michelin-starred restaurant so special. Age-old French cooking methods are coupled with a strong Asian influence on the €250, 11-course tasting menu, with dishes such as hamachi with home-made kosho and Ballycotton lobster with whey sauce. Read our review here. CH The lavish Oak Room delivers all the grandeur that one would expect at one of Ireland’s finest hotels. Service is impeccable, allowing the spotlight to shine on chef Mike Tweedie’s elegant and polished cooking. Since taking over in 2017, Tweedie has truly settled in, finding his way unerringly to the best Irish produce including Doonbeg lobster, Dooncastle oysters and meat from Higgin’s butchers. JC Chef Danni Barry works magic with the freshest seasonal ingredients, crafting visually stunning plates with a light, refined touch. The four-course table d’hote menu (€90) highlights this simplicity: cured scallops with cucumber and nasturtiums, perfectly cooked halibut with morels, and wild venison with garden beets. The Library, which was recently redecorated, now has a conservatory and terrace, and is perfect for a pre-dinner cocktail.

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the IBIT fund, continues to be a preferred option for financial investors. The fund attracted around $318 million in net inflows on Oct. 31 despite Bitcoin’s price falling 4% to $68,800. The inflow followed IBIT’s record-breaking performance of $875 million on Oct. 30, which exceeded its previous high of $849 million. The fund’s weekly inflows have now surpassed $2 billion, according to Farside Investors data. Valkyrie’s BRRR fund also added nearly $2 million on Thursday. In contrast, other ETF providers faced significant redemptions. Fidelity’s FBTC ended its two-week positive streak with over $75 million in net outflows. ARK Invest/21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale ETFs collectively reported $213 million in outflows. Despite the mixed performance across ETFs, IBIT’s massive influx efficiently helped the US spot Bitcoin ETF group maintain positive momentum, adding over $30 million in new investments. This marks the seventh consecutive day of net inflows for the sector. IBIT has accumulated almost $30 billion in assets since its launch, with approximately half of that amount gathered in the past month. The combined holdings of US spot ETFs have now exceeded 1 million Bitcoin. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT has attracted more investment than any other ETF in the past week, surpassing established funds like VOO, IVV, and AGG, despite launching less than ten months ago. $IBIT took in more cash than any other ETF in the world over the past week. This is out of 13,227 ETFs, which includes $VOO $IVV $AGG etc. It's so hard to beat those veteran Cash Vacuum Cleaners, even for a week, especially for an infant ETF (3mo-1yr old) pic.twitter.com/S443lUXVQk — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 31, 2024 Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Don’t let Gladys and the Loons Win

A couple of weeks ago, on a balmy autumn day, I proudly planted a Trump yard sign in my lawn. My wife was on the porch. Across the way came a shout. “Your husband didn’t make you do that, did he?’ I looked across the way to see our neighborhood’s version of Gladys Kravitz. The decibels suddenly rose. “Trump is gonna take away my rights,” she screeched. “You disappoint me, girl!” My wife smiled, put a hand to her ear, pretending not to hear, pulling a Reagan. Gladys’ hubby scampered out and ushered her into the house. The trauma must have made it a whiskey night for vexed Gladys. No rocks, straight up. Afterwards, we wondered about what rights Gladys feared that Trump would snatch. Gladys is past childbearing age -- unless something biblical happens. She certainly isn’t worried about having access to an abortion clinic -- and what does she have to fear but fear itself in a bluish state? Maybe she doesn’t want grandkids? Or like Bill Gates and every other conscientious Malthusian, maybe she hopes to depopulate the planet? “Manmade” climate change can’t be stopped just by banning plastic straws and curtailing cow flatulence, though those earn gold stars for fine starts. Who doesn’t want to eat bugs instead of a T-bone? Maybe Gladys hopes to transition -- you know, not in a job but in gender. Trump and most Americans could care less. Yes, Rachel “Dick” Levine is weird and, no, embracing your DNA and accepting your biological maleness or femaleness isn’t weird, despite progressives’ relentless attempts to “Twilight Zone” female sports. What Trump and common-sense people are aghast at is mutilating kids’ bodies. Crazy them, but they contend that Frankensteinian science can’t turn a 12-year-old boy into a 12-year-old girl. They claim this is a cruel hoax and must stop. Children, say fab progressive parents and well-paid Manhattan child psychologists, “feel” they’re “misgendered” so they are misgendered. In the Brave New World, bodies -- 100% nature made -- are subordinate to feelings. It’s kinda tabula rasa. Charge critics, it’s a cuckoo’s nest worth of refugees from reality cursing and shaking fists at God. Nature, normies are informed, can and must bend to fickle desires. Let’s not skip the fact that mutilating kids’ bodies is a profit center. When medical center suits sniffed a new revenue stream, well, how hard was it to find surgeons willing to do the cutting? Cha-jing! Maybe Gladys is worried that Trump will take away her right to have her community invaded by opened to illegals migrants? Diversity is strength and all that word salad stuff. It hasn’t happened in Gladys’ neck of the woods yet, but if momala creatively ballots her way into the White House, a new torrent of migrants will wash across red and blue communities everywhere… for four more years. Or longer, because momala and the cabal that employs her will set about fixing our broken election system. Surely honest elections are a right, and Democrats know how to safeguard rights. In January 2021, wizened House Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer unveiled H.R. 1. That comprehensive elections reform measure was cleverly labeled “For the People Act of 2021.” Had Congress passed it, it would have centralized control of elections in Washington, D.C. Gladys’ Democrats claimed that Washington’s control of elections is democracy in action. Concentrations of power ensure our rights. But, finally, why care what the Founders wanted? Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, and other slaveholders and misogynists -- and egads, lots of other dead white men -- were vile creatures whose statues deserve to be graffitied and sledgehammered. Gladys loves the word “democracy.” It trips off Kamala’s tongue routinely. Democracy means everything to end-stage progressivism and means just about what comrades Stalin and Mao intended: We decide, you submit -- with nice, big smiles on the proletariat’s faces. Vox populi requires that a few extra chairs be added in U.S. Supreme Court. Conservatives disparage that act of democracy as “court packing.” They preach about original intent. Guys like Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito, and Neil Gorsuch refuse to eat from FDR’s old crock of stew. A law’s intent is pretty much what’s felt, say the Sotomayors, Kagans, and Brown-Jacksons, whose feminism informs them unerringly. Ouija boards may also help. If you want to figure out what’s on your rights menu, do as Gladys does, tune into MSNBC or CNN daily. Otherwise, shut up, sit down, and be grateful that you haven’t been cancelled into oblivion. Did someone say, “Free speech?” Gladys, like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, is emphatically for free speech -- within proper bounds, of course. The 1st Amendment requires guard rails, lest speech veer into hate speech and misinformation. Yard signs bearing the names of disapproved candidates are on the wrong side of the guard rails. Der Führer Donald Trump and his hordes are reckless with speech. Questioning the governance and policies of the benighted cabal running the Biden-Harris administration is undemocratic. Charging that Uncle Sam has been bound and gagged and stuffed into the U.S. Senate cloakroom by Chuck Schumer, while an imposter, oozing corruption, is paraded, amounts to incitement. ls incitement uttering “Deep State” publicly? What Deep State? And how dare Trump ruffians disparage Chris Wray’s FBI? An East German Stasi Lite? Would the FBI get a spanking new HQ if they were bad boys and bad girls? Who serves as arbiters of good and bad speech? Perhaps bad speech is like porn: elites know it when they see it. Or in Hillary parlance, the village will know it. The village is a collective, more in the Animal Farm mold than Mayberry. Every collective has a vanguard. Hillary, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Susan Rice, the faculties at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia and too many Gladyses to count will arbitrate. What must keep Gladys crawling walls nights is that a monster is on the loose. Hitler’s doppelganger prowls the fruited plain, meaning to whip inflation, boot illegals, round up criminals, and keep the U.S. out of war. The UFC fights Trump attends just don’t stack up to real bloodletting. Democracy has never been more imperiled. Trump has even teamed up with renegade progressive RFK Jr. to “Make America Healthy Again.” How can anyone suspect the efficacy of Covid vaccines and wholesomeness of Cap’n Crunch? No decent soul doubts the CDC and FDA. And how this side of Genghis Khan can the economy prosper without wars? War is peace, and peace is a fascist scheme to help Putin and waylay democracy. What fate would befall Larry Fink and BlackRock without Ukraine to exploit -- err, develop? As BlackRock goes, so goes America. Ask Dick and Liz Cheney about that. To date, the vaunted efforts of Democrats’ lawfare warriors have failed to hurl Trump into a U.S. version of Landsberg prison. A frazzled Gladys is further distraught. Hillary and the gals on The View warned that Hitler rose to power through elections. For Trump, this election looks promising. A nightmare scenario is unfolding. Kamala is closing her campaign thundering about the coming Trump dictatorship. In the waning days of Election 2024, the D.C. establishment is doubtlessly huddling to figure out ways to thwart Trump. Democracy demands responses. Alas, whatever schemes they hatch to save democracy may have to wait until the interregnum. Whatever the conspirators decide will square with Gladys. Meanwhile, Gladys plots. There’s a Trump sign across the street that the world needs to be saved from. J. Robert Smith can be found at X. His handle is @JRobertSmith1. At Gab, @JRobertSmith.
