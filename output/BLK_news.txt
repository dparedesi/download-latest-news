We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:TVGN) stands against the other AI news investors should not miss. As we look toward 2025, the AI investment landscape is evolving from a focus on general-purpose computing to custom-built solutions tailored to specific needs. This shift opens up opportunities for suppliers of specialized technology and software companies to incorporate AI into their offerings. Meanwhile, higher interest rates may push investors toward established players with strong growth potential in the AI space. READ ALSO: 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Are Watching Right Now and Jim Cramer's Latest Lightning Round: 8 Stocks in Focus. At CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell,’ Doug Clinton of Intelligent Alpha and Deepwater Asset Management discussed the shifting dynamics of AI investments heading into 2025. He explained that while Nvidia has been a key beneficiary of AI-driven spending over the past two years, with companies investing heavily in general-purpose AI compute, the focus is now transitioning to custom silicon. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon have developed their own custom chips designed to handle their specific AI needs. Clinton believes that as these companies begin to deploy their custom chips more aggressively, suppliers like Broadcom, which works with most of these tech giants, and Marvell, another stock in Intelligent Alpha's portfolio, could see growth. He compared the current AI trend to the dot-com era, where Cisco was a dominant player. He stressed that the AI market is not solely about one company, and as the sector evolves, more companies will emerge as key players, broadening the scope of AI investments. Regarding the impact of interest rates, Clinton noted that higher rates might push investors back to mega-cap stocks, but also highlighted that companies with strong AI growth potential, like Snowflake, could still thrive. The company has been expanding its AI offerings and could attract attention as more customers deploy its services for AI applications. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 10 Tevogen Bio Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:TVGN) is a clinical-stage company specializing in immunotherapy, creating targeted T-cell treatments to meet unaddressed medical needs. The company owns a portfolio of patents and applications related to AI, developed without relying on third-party licenses. Tevogen Bio (NASDAQ:TVGN) announced it will host an AI-focused panel at the 43rd Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Titled "AI in Biopharma: Next Frontier of Medical Innovation," the panel will feature experts from Tevogen.AI, Microsoft, and Rubix Health, discussing AI's role in transforming biopharma. Topics will include advancements in drug discovery, faster development, improved patient access, and cost efficiency, with a focus on Tevogen's AI-driven efforts to improve precision T-cell therapies. Overall, TVGN ranks 8th on our list of AI news investors should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of TVGN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: From Wall Street to Crypto: How Top Finance Talent Braved Risks for Blockchain Rewards
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/from-wall-street-to-crypto-how-top-finance-talent-braved-risks-for-blockchain-rewards/

The transition from Wall Street to cryptocurrency has been both risky and transformative for finance professionals who made the leap. Many who left lucrative roles at top institutions during the last bull market are now reportedly seeing their decisions validated. Bitcoin’s historic surge past $100,000 marks a dramatic recovery from the 2022 crypto winter, when the market was plagued by skepticism and losses. A key driver of Bitcoin’s resurgence has been the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024. Major firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco introduced ETFs that simplify access to Bitcoin for institutional and retail investors. According to data from Farside Investors, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust saw strong inflows, highlighting the growing institutional interest in digital assets. In December 2024 alone, Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted billions of dollars, demonstrating heightened confidence in the crypto market. The ETFs have played a pivotal role in mainstreaming cryptocurrency, offering regulatory safeguards that address long-standing concerns about volatility and security. This institutional backing has not only increased investor confidence but also reduced barriers for entry, bringing cryptocurrency closer to the mainstream. Retail adoption of cryptocurrency has also grown significantly. Recent surveys offer varying estimates: Security.org reports that 40% of American adults now own crypto, up from 30% in 2023, while Pew Research estimates 17% of Americans have invested in or used cryptocurrency. Ownership trends reveal that younger generations, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, are driving this growth. Men under 50 are significantly more likely to own cryptocurrency than other demographic groups, reflecting a generational shift in financial priorities. While these statistics vary, they collectively underscore the increasing acceptance of cryptocurrency across diverse demographics. However, Federal Reserve data suggests that only 7% of Americans used or held cryptocurrency in 2023, reflecting a more conservative view on adoption rates. These discrepancies highlight the evolving nature of the market and the different methodologies used to assess its growth. The future of the crypto market could hinge on regulatory developments in early 2025. Gary Gensler, the current SEC Chair known for his stringent approach to cryptocurrency, will step down on January 20, 2025. On January 20, 2025 I will be stepping down as @SECGov Chair.A thread 🧵⬇️ This coincides with Donald Trump’s inauguration for a second presidential term, raising expectations for a potential shift toward more crypto-friendly policies. Industry participants are optimistic that clearer regulatory frameworks could unlock further growth and innovation. For finance professionals who transitioned from Wall Street to crypto, the current market environment represents both validation and caution. According to a recent article by Francesca Maglione and Charlie Wells for Bloomberg News, Vivek Raman—a former Morgan Stanley trader who shifted to blockchain to explore trading bonds on Ethereum—and Patrick Liou, a former BlackRock trader who joined Gemini, are among those who stayed committed despite the challenges of the 2022 downturn. Liou described moments of doubt but emphasized the importance of resilience and belief in blockchain’s transformative potential. Other examples include Michael Harvey, who joined Galaxy in 2023 after nearly two decades in traditional finance. As Bitcoin surged to new highs, Harvey finally considered opening a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue Label gifted to him on his first day—a symbol of perseverance and celebration. These stories illustrate the cautious optimism shared by many crypto professionals who recognize the market’s cyclical nature. The journey from Wall Street to crypto has been marked by risk, resilience, and reward. Bitcoin’s rally past $100,000, driven by institutional adoption and increasing retail interest, underscores the maturity and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency industry. As 2025 approaches, the combination of regulatory shifts, institutional backing, and demographic changes signals a promising future for the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology.

Title: Brokers’ Picks 2025: Why energy, tech and retirement remain favourites

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. It was a stellar year for investors here and abroad, with some stand-out stocks on our market as interest rate cuts start to relieve some economic pressure. In January, the Herald asked professional stock pickers which companies they were backing on the New Zealand, Australia and US stock markets. This article reveals how their picks performed in the year to December, and the stocks they’re picking for 2025. Scroll to the end to see a graphic of all the results and picks. It was a year of two halves for our share market with almost all of the gains coming after interest rates were cut, although economic challenges saw many companies dim their lights this year, including some notable names. Spark suffered under the weight of reduced corporate and Government spending, but its loss was Infratil’s gain as the owner of One NZ saw its early data centre bets pay off. Surprisingly, stock brokers remain committed to some of the poorest performers, such as retirement village operator Ryman Healthcare, with optimism that interest rate cuts may finally result in improved finances, especially in an industry tied to the housing market. Energy was a consistent pick for the new year, with Contact and Mercury specifically in sight, after a crisis period that made electricity generation’s importance clear. Firms were increasingly investing in companies offshore, with some firms' picks for 2025 allocated entirely internationally where they could get more exposure to technology. “The global economy is expected to grow at around 3% in 2025, with inflation continuing to normalise after the highs of recent years,” Hamilton Hindin Green investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said. “However, growth may be uneven across regions due to varying impacts of tariff and immigration policies, particularly in the US and China. “Despite these challenges, the ongoing recovery and advancements in technology offer significant opportunities for growth and development. Retirement village operator Summerset was a favourite for the new year, following its outperformance in 2024. The company made a total shareholder return of 26.6% in the year to December 9, according to figures collated for the Herald by Forsyth Barr. “Summerset has been a standout performer in 2024 and remains our top pick in the retirement sector,“ Craigs Investment Partner’s head of private wealth research Hamish Don said. “We have a favourable view of Summerset’s development strategy and think it can deliver strong cash flows and significant value for shareholders in the future.” Infratil was another crowd favourite for a repeated year with firms expecting it could keep building on top of this year’s 23.3% total return and its addition to the MSCI World Index. “The demand for and valuation of data centres is central to Infratil’s positive outlook,” Nikko Asset Management’s head of New Zealand equities Michael Shrerrock said. “Furthermore, should Contact’s takeover of Manawa Energy be approved by [the] Commerce Commission, then Infratil will receive Contact shares and cash for its Manawa holding.” Nikko and Forsyth Barr both had Contact on their lists for the new year, after it added more geothermal generation to its portfolio. “Contact Energy trades at a significant discount to Mercury and Meridian Energy and offers similar or better earnings growth.” Forsyth Barr senior equities analyst Aaron Ibbotson said. Although, Salt Funds was picking Mercury as its power play, purely because it was priced cheap. “Occasionally, the forced idiocy of passive funds gives active investors a free hit in large cap stocks,” Salt’s managing director Matt Goodson said. Stock broking firm Hamilton Hindin Greene picked only international stocks for 2025, with United States household names Walmart and BlackRock among its picks. “Walmart had a strong fiscal year 2024, with a 6% increase in revenue to US$648.1 billion,” Investment adviser Jeremy Sulllivan said. “The company also saw significant growth in its eCommerce sales, which surpassed $100 billion for the year.” Hamilton Hindin Greene’s Australian-listed picks included Xero and WiseTech Global. “Xero’s focus on expanding its subscriber base and enhancing its product offerings, particularly in the US market, is expected to drive growth,” Sullivan said. Some of the firms also had an international technology play in their investment line-up, including Amazon and Uber. The well-known ride-share app “getting good traction with its loyalty scheme and with selling advertising, which is very profitable,” Forsyth Barr’s Ibbotson explained. Getting the bad news out of the way first, Spark and Ryman Healthcare turned out to be poor performers, despite some firms backing them at the outset of 2024. The telecommunications company Spark was deemed somewhat defensive in an economic downturn, however, it had suffered more than stock pickers expected, with its share price hitting its lowest level since 2015 this year. Spark’s total shareholder return for the year to December 9 was -40.2%, including its share price fall buffered by any dividends paid, according to figures collated for the Herald by Forsyth Barr. “It’s fair to say that Spark surprised and disappointed the market with its poor earnings result,” Nikko Asset Management’s Michael Sherrock said of its early 2024 pick. “Its removal from the MSCI World Index, which forced a significant sell down of stock, further weakened its share price.” The company recently sold the rest of its cell tower infrastructure business and announced an earnings and dividend downgrade. “The board and management acknowledge that our current financial performance falls short of what is acceptable, and we understand the disappointment our shareholders will be feeling,” Spark chairwoman Justine Smyth said in October. However, two analysts have since upgraded their rating on Spark’s stock, suggesting it could be oversold. On a similar note, retirement village developer and operator Ryman’s total return for the year to December was -28.8%, making it among one of the worst performing on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (NZX) this year. Chairman Dean Hamilton recently announced a near halving in its half-year net profit and rising vacancies across its properties. Its struggles speak to the housing-tied difficulties more broadly, where higher interest rates may still be having an impact, but much of Ryman’s problems were its own doing, as Hamilton explained to the Herald in June. “The financial performance has slowly deteriorated,” the chairman said. “A bit like being in a boiling pot and then when you look at it five years later you go, ‘how did the business get to this position?’” It surprised stock pickers at Forsyth Barr who were backing the company to be one of the best performing this year as interest rates were expected to come down. “We believe Ryman to be the most attractive mid to large-cap opportunity in New Zealand over the coming 12 months,” Forsyth Barr senior equity analyst Aaron Ibbotson said in January. One month after making that statement, the company raised $902 million from investors to help repay debt, followed by its chief executive resigning. In Ibbotson’s defence, he was sticking with the stock for 2025. Another of Forsyth Barr’s picks did not play out as hoped, with AFT Pharmaceuticals making a -18.2% total return in the year. The Maxigesic pain-relief producer announced a significant operating profit downgrade in November. Hamilton Hindin Greene’s own property pick played out poorly - Vital Healthcare, which owns medical properties such as private hospitals, made a -12.1% total return. “Despite a solid dividend yield of 6.42%, the stock’s capital value declined,” Hamilton Hindin Greene investment adviser Jeremy Sullivan said. “The company focused on divesting non-core assets and reinvesting in new developments, which, while strategically sound, impacted short-term performance.” Sky Television was among the favourites for both Craigs and Nikko Asset, who liked it because of its dividend payout potential. While the media company did pay a solid dividend, it failed to help the share price, finishing the year to December with a total return of just 0.2%. “Sky has not been immune to a weak economy, and has bounced around over the year a bit like a rugby ball,” Nikko’s Sherrock said. “Sky Network Television has been a disappointing pick,” Craigs’ Hamish Don said. “In August, the company reported slightly lower-than-expected profit and tempered investor expectations by reducing its revenue guidance.” Both raised investor concerns about renewing expensive New Zealand rugby rights going forward, although they both believed its decent dividend of 30 cents per share next year was attractive. “We continue to see value in Sky Network Television,” Don said. Nikko was sticking with Sky as a top pick for 2025. Despite Ryman’s woes, a competing retirement village developer was one of the best performing picks for the year. “Summerset has been a standout performer in 2024 and remains our top pick in the retirement sector,“ Craigs’ Don said. “We have a favourable view of Summerset’s development strategy and think it can deliver strong cash flows and significant value for shareholders in the future.” Both Craigs and Nikko cited official interest rate cuts as benefiting the company’s position. “These rate cuts oil the wheels of the housing market, increasing turnover, and making it easier for retirees to sell up and move into retirement villages, therefore stock sentiment continues to improve,” Nikko’s Sherrock said. Infratil was the most shared pick for the year and played out as expected with a 23.3% total return, largely due to a higher revaluation of its CDC data centres investment. “Although, CDC didn’t catch quite the degree of euphoria and hype that propelled some other data centre names around the world,” Salt Funds Management’s Matt Goodson said of his team’s pick. In comparison to Spark, Infratil, which owns the telecommunications company One New Zealand, was added to the MSCI World index, which resulted in a large amount of stock buying. Salt Funds was the best-performing stock picker of the year, with its backing of insurer Tower, which managed to hike premiums on the back of a tough period of claim volumes following Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding events. Tower’s total return came in at 127.8% in 2024, making it a market stand out. “Tower played out as well as we could have hoped with a very supportive insurance cycle for the first time in years,” Goodson said. “Having no major [weather] events was a piece of overdue luck. “We still see Tower as being cheap. Premium growth will be a lot slower from here, but they have a number of growth levers and the market still values them as though they get hit by their full retained exposure to large disasters each and every year forever.” Salt’s outperformance was also bolstered by its Freightways pick, which made a total return of 27.8%, “despite the hideously weak NZ economy," Goodson said. “October onwards has been a lot better for many cyclical companies as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand reverses its earlier over-tightening.” Salt was continuing to back Freightways in 2025. Another benefiter of interest rate cuts was Contact Energy, which made a bullish $1.86 billion takeover offer for retail power player Manawa and opened its new geothermal station outside of Taupō in the year. The power player was picked by both Craigs and Nikko Asset this year, and Nikko and Forsyth Barr had it as a top pick for 2025. “Performance has been supported by solid customer demand and sales channel options, confirmation that the Tiwai Point aluminium smelter will keep operating for a further 20 years, and the RBNZ lowering the Official Cash Rate,” Craigs’ Don said. On its potential Manawa purchase which was yet to be approved, Don said: “The generation assets of these businesses are complementary and we think there is a high probability the Commerce Commission will approve the transaction.” Forsyth Barr’s best pick for the year turned out to be a2 Milk, which by mid-year was the best performing stock on the NZX. It defied concerns of the impact a declining birth rate in China could have on its infant formula product, and was now sitting on $1b in cash and looking to pay a dividend for the first time in its 20-year history. Hamilton Hindin Greene made a bold bet on the market itself in 2024, picking the NZX to be a stand out - and it was. “The company’s revenue and net income saw significant growth, driven by increased trading volumes and new product offerings,” Jeremy Sullivan said. “This strong financial performance was reflected in the substantial capital appreciation and a healthy dividend yield.” In total, the NZX Top 50 index was sitting 9.7% higher by mid-December, on par with Australia’s Top 200 index, but well below the major US market, the S&P500, which had returned 27% year to date by December. The offshore outperformance in 2024 paid off for investors with international exposure, especially for those in technology stocks. Craigs' US-based pick Amazon “has had an excellent year and has consistently outperformed analyst estimates,” Hamish Don said, with a total shareholder return of 51.5%. While it was commonly known for its online retail business, the technology giant’s data centre and artificial intelligence division, Amazon Web Services, was increasingly impressive. “AWS is an exceptional business with growing earnings and margins,” Don said. “The company should benefit from ongoing advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and management is becoming more convinced of the opportunities that AI presents.” Australia delivered for Forsyth Barr, with its Fisher & Paykel Healthcare competitor pick ResMed returning 50.6%. Although healthcare was inconsistent, with Johnson & Johnson coming in negative for the year for Hamilton Hindin Greene. The best-performing stock-picking firm for 2024 was Salt Funds Management, with an average total shareholder return of 36%. Salt knocked Forsyth Barr from its previously highly ranked spot - it made the smallest return for the year with a, still positive, 13.7%.

We recently published a list of 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Are Watching Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news and ratings investors are watching right now. At CNBC’s ‘Money Movers’, Jack Hidary, CEO of Sandbox AQ, emphasized the shift towards B2B-focused AI, positioning it as the next major evolution in artificial intelligence. While language models like those from OpenAI have excelled in consumer applications, Hidary highlighted the untapped potential of quantitative AI (QAI) in driving innovation across industries like pharmaceuticals, automotive, and energy. QAI uses fundamental equations to generate new data, which enables advancements in drug development, materials for energy storage, and aerospace. Hidary pointed out that large quantitative models are set to transform product development by creating significant economic value, unlike large language models, which primarily reduce operational costs. He predicts that 2025 and beyond will see a growing focus on AI’s role in addressing critical challenges in B2B sectors, from building better batteries to accelerating medical breakthroughs. This evolution underscores a future where AI goes beyond text-based applications, becoming a cornerstone for innovation across various industries.

While the core role of sellers including building trust, creating value, and minimizing friction remains unchanged, generative AI enables productivity gains through automation, personalized insights, and strategic guidance. Companies adopting these tools report improved customer experiences, faster sales processes, and new growth opportunities. Looking ahead, AI integration is expected to redefine sales models, emphasizing customer outcomes, long-term success, and collaboration between human and AI-driven agents. To adapt, businesses must embrace agile strategies, invest in AI-driven capabilities, and align their sales approaches with evolving customer expectations.

We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor company that specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering advanced computing platforms, networking technologies, and software for various industries, including gaming, automotive, and data centers. Morgan Stanley remains optimistic about Nvidia, especially when short-term data appears uncertain but long-term fundamentals remain strong. The firm also named the company its “Top Pick.” Concerns include slower demand for previous-generation Hopper products and staggered availability of Blackwell versions. The firm sees this as a natural phase-out rather than a revenue decline, given a substantial backlog expected to sustain sales for several quarters Despite these challenges, the firm expects strong demand for Blackwell to persist and continues to rate Nvidia shares as Overweight, adjusting the price target slightly to $166 from $168. Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news and ratings investors are watching right now. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy Under $50. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other dividend stocks. AI stocks are stealing the spotlight today as the appetite for these services continues to gain traction globally. This surge in interest has temporarily diverted investor attention from dividend-paying equities. This year, dividend stocks have once again lagged behind the market, a trend highlighted by Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist at Morningstar Indexes, during a recent interview with the firm. Here are some commeants from the analyst: “I just want to mention two interesting observations. One, interest rates have come down this year, yet dividend-paying stocks have underperformed. There’s this conventional wisdom that we’ve talked about in the past that falling rates are good for dividend payers and rising rates are bad for dividend payers, yet dividend stocks have underperformed in a falling rate environment. Second, outside of the US, dividend stocks are a little bit ahead of the broad market. We can table those, but I just thought they’re interesting to note.” That said, analysts predict this trend won't persist, as dividend stocks are expected to regain their strength and prominence soon. Bank of America analyst Ohsung Kwon suggested that a dividend revival might be on the horizon. His team anticipates a 10% increase in overall dividends from the companies in the broader market in 2025, driven by investors' growing preference for cash. Highlighting this trend, major tech firms began paying dividends for the first time this year. According to Janus Henderson, these tech giants accounted for roughly 25% of the total underlying dividend growth in the US during the third quarter. Also read: 10 Best European Dividend Stocks To Buy When it comes to dividend stocks, analysts consistently recommend prioritizing dividend growth over chasing high yields. Dan Lefkovitz, a strategist with Morningstar's Index team, emphasized this approach, pointing out that dividend growth is a completely different ball game compared to high-dividend investing. He explained that dividend growth signals a company's strong competitive position and improving prospects. A dividend-growth portfolio typically mirrors the market more closely in terms of sector exposure and growth-versus-value traits, including metrics like price-to-earnings ratios. While it maintains a value bias, it leans more toward the core market than a high-dividend portfolio. Over the years, companies with a track record of steadily increasing their dividends have generally outperformed non-dividend-paying firms while experiencing lower volatility. Although dividends are not set in stone and can vary, as seen in the current climate, they have significantly contributed to overall equity returns over time. Between 1930 and 2023, dividends and their reinvestment made up 40% of the annualized total returns in the broader market, with the rest driven by capital gains. Maintaining steady dividend growth is a demanding goal, as it necessitates exceptional financial stability. For businesses still in their growth phase with relatively lower stock prices, assessing the sustainability of their dividends becomes an essential and simple factor to analyze. This article explores some of the top dividend stocks currently priced under $50. Our Methodology: For this list, we used a Finviz stock screener to find dividend stocks trading below $50 as of the close of December 20. From the initial list, we narrowed down the selection to companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders and possess strong dividend policies, ensuring consistent future dividends. From the resultant list, we picked 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 hedge funds and their holdings. These stocks are ranked in ascending order of hedge funds having stakes in them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Overall VZ ranks 4th on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy under $5. While we acknowledge the potential of VZ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Listed below are the key takeaways for the month of December 2024: December 2024 will be remembered as the month Bitcoin breached the psychological $100,000 barrier, reaching a peak of $106,496 on December 16. This milestone solidified Bitcoin’s standing as a cornerstone financial asset, driven by institutional demand, macroeconomic trends, and regulatory support. IBIT 6-Month Fund Flows Chart | Source: ETF.com Bitcoin’s bullish breakout | Source: TradingView Number of Active Addresses | Source: Glassnode Investor sentiment turned bullish in December, with a marked shift toward “greed” as Bitcoin climbed past $100,000. However, caution emerged as: Gold vs Bitcoin Bitcoin’s milestone of surpassing $100,000 underscores its evolution from a speculative asset to a recognized financial instrument. While the rally reflects growing adoption and institutional interest, its sustainability hinges on a balance between regulatory developments, technological progress, and market dynamics. As 2025 approaches, Bitcoin’s role in the global financial ecosystem is poised to grow further. Key global crypto regulatory updates The cryptocurrency regulatory landscape in December 2024 witnessed significant strides globally, marked by pro-crypto policies, pivotal legal precedents, and increased institutional adoption. These developments not only bolstered investor confidence but also highlighted the growing acceptance of digital assets as a mainstream financial category. As institutional players continue to dominate the cryptocurrency market, retail investors are grappling with a rapidly shifting landscape.

Retail investors lagged significantly at 13.6%, while 28.9% believed both groups contributed equally to shaping trends. Crypto market trust and institutional concerns The increasing involvement of institutions has fundamentally altered market perception. An overwhelming 64.8% of respondents stated that institutional presence significantly boosted trust, thanks to enhanced legitimacy and stability. In contrast, only 9.4% reported a decline in trust.

Liquidity gains vs. manipulation risks Respondents highlighted significant changes in market behavior due to institutional involvement: Retail investors’ resilience and market prediction The survey revealed a mixed outlook on retail investors’ future: When asked about leadership in 2025, 49.4% predicted institutional dominance, while just 12.8% foresaw retail investors regaining influence. Regulations vs. innovation Institutions are viewed as both enablers and potential barriers: AMBCrypto’s survey highlights the growing prominence of institutional players in the crypto market, reflecting their ability to bring trust and liquidity while raising questions about decentralization and fairness. As 2025 approaches, the balance between institutional and retail influence will be pivotal in defining the future trajectory of cryptocurrencies.

On track to build the most powerful supercomputer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Elon Musk's xAI has raised $6 billion in its latest funding round, pushing its total capital raised to $12 billion at a valuation of $50 billion, reports TechCrunch. The round, which involved 97 investors, followed a doubling of xAI's valuation within six months and solidified the company's position as a growing competitor in the AI sector. Major investors in this funding round include Nvidia, AMD, Andreessen Horowitz, Blackrock, Fidelity, Kingdom Holdings, and Sequoia Capital, among others. Only previous investors who backed Musk's earlier ventures, such as the Twitter acquisition, could participate. The minimum investment per participant was $77,593, but the identities of most investors remain undisclosed. The company plans to raise additional funds next year to sustain its growth as it seeks to challenge larger rivals in the generative AI market. xAI has already built the Colossus supercomputer, which is powered by 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs. In the coming months, it is expected to expand to 200,000 Nvidia GPUs, and eventually, Elon Musk hopes to build a supercomputer with one million GPUs. For reference, $6 billion is roughly enough to procure a supercomputer with servers containing 100,000 Nvidia GPUs at $30,000 per processor. Typically, GPUs account for around half of the cost of a supercomputer cluster. With more powerful supercomputers, xAI will be able to train more sophisticated large language models to gain an edge over OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Musk has positioned xAI to compete directly with industry leaders like OpenAI. He has accused OpenAI and its partner Microsoft of engaging in anti-competitive practices that hinder funding for alternative companies. Also, Musk claims that xAI benefits from data drawn from X. At the same time, X's recent privacy policy change allows xAI to train its models using user-generated content on the X platform. Beyond X, xAI leverages data from other Musk enterprises like Tesla and SpaceX to enhance its AI models. xAI has rapidly advanced its technology with its flagship AI model, Grok, which powers several tools on X, including a chatbot accessible to X Premium users and image generator Flux. Unlike politically correct OpenAI, Grok can answer provocative questions while maintaining some boundaries on sensitive topics. Grok currently supports customer service for SpaceX's Starlink internet service, and xAI is exploring potential collaborations with Tesla for R&D purposes. However, some Tesla shareholders have expressed concerns, accusing Musk of reallocating resources from Tesla to xAI and viewing the two companies as competitors. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. xAI generates approximately $100 million annually, significantly trailing competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI, which are targeting billions in revenue. They also received significantly more funding: Anthropic and OpenAI have secured billions in funding. The report claims that AI venture capital activity reached $31 billion in Q3 2024, and as xAI accelerates its development, it aims to carve out a larger share of this booming market.

By exploring crypto trends, investors, businesses and policymakers alike can harness the ... [+] transformative power of blockchain technology to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. The world of cryptocurrency is evolving rapidly, moving beyond the headlines of Bitcoin’s market dominance and Ethereum’s smart contracts. In 2025, this ecosystem will witness profound changes influenced by global economic trends, regulatory clarity and technological advancements. In this article, we’ll explore five key trends shaping the future of cryptocurrencies—some widely anticipated, others emerging quietly but promising transformative impacts. By understanding these trends, readers can prepare for the opportunities and challenges ahead in this dynamic landscape. Cryptocurrencies have made monumental strides in recent years, moving from niche interest to mainstream adoption. The year 2024 was pivotal, marked by the approval of multiple Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), legitimizing digital assets as a mainstream financial tool. Bitcoin’s halving event further spurred a bullish market, propelling the cryptocurrency to new all-time highs. Simultaneously, institutional adoption surged as major financial players like BlackRock and Fidelity entered the crypto space, while decentralized finance (DeFi) continued to disrupt traditional financial services. However, challenges remain, including navigating fragmented regulations and addressing environmental concerns tied to blockchain technologies. These developments set the stage for 2025, a year that promises even more innovation and integration. Environmental sustainability is a critical concern in the crypto industry, and regenerative finance (ReFi) aims to address this by funding ecological restoration projects through blockchain. ReFi goes beyond sustainability to actively repair environmental damage, leveraging financial incentives to achieve these goals. Projects utilizing carbon-negative mechanisms and renewable energy-powered mining operations are leading the charge. The implications of these innovations are vast. Not only could ReFi reshape public perception of blockchain technology, but it also paves the way for crypto’s integration with global environmental goals. With public and private partnerships focusing on green technology, ReFi projects may become a cornerstone of crypto’s future. As blockchain networks grow, the need for efficient dispute resolution mechanisms has become apparent. In 2025, on-chain governance systems and smart contract-based arbitration are gaining traction as viable solutions to disputes arising in decentralized ecosystems. These systems offer automated and transparent ways to address conflicts without relying on traditional legal frameworks. The benefits are clear: faster resolution times, reduced costs and enhanced trust among network participants. This trend holds particular importance for enterprises adopting blockchain technology, as robust governance structures will be essential to scaling their operations securely and confidently. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have become a focal point in the financial world, and 2025 is poised to be their breakout year. Countries across both developed and emerging markets are actively rolling out CBDC projects to modernize payment systems and promote financial inclusion. According to a 2024 report from PYMNTS.com, 134 nations are currently exploring digital currency initiatives. For underbanked populations, CBDCs represent a secure, low-cost alternative to traditional banking. “CBDCs, designed as virtual tokens, hold the promise of providing a modern and efficient digital infrastructure for the most liquid and trusted financial asset in the world: central bank money, also known as cash,” says Carmelle Cadet, founder and CEO of EMTECH. “Digital cash not only enables anyone with trusted onboarding to access financial markets but also provides essential liquidity for the new digital rails, all while minimizing money laundering and protecting consumers.” By reducing reliance on physical cash and enhancing transaction efficiency, CBDCs have the potential to reshape economic policy and boost financial literacy. However, their integration into existing financial systems is likely to spark critical debates about privacy and centralization—especially in countries where governments maintain strict control over monetary systems. The rise of decentralized identity (DID) systems is reshaping how individuals manage and protect their digital identities. Built on blockchain technology, DID systems allow users to maintain control over their personal data while providing secure authentication for online services. Unlike traditional identity solutions, these systems eliminate the need for centralized authorities, reducing the risks of data breaches and identity theft. DID solutions are poised to transform industries such as healthcare and e-commerce, offering more secure and user-centric experiences. As concerns about privacy and data misuse grow, DID systems represent a critical step toward empowering individuals in the digital age. As I explain in Top Decentralized AI Projects Of 2025 Amid OpenAI Copyright Concerns, decentralized artificial intelligence (deAI) is set to reshape how AI operates by leveraging blockchain to distribute computation and data storage across a decentralized network. Unlike traditional AI systems controlled by centralized entities, deAI enhances transparency, security and privacy by enabling individuals and organizations to access machine learning tools while retaining control over their data. This shift addresses growing concerns about data misuse and centralized monopolies. The integration of deAI with blockchain is unlocking transformative potential across industries like healthcare, finance and logistics. For example, anonymized patient data shared via deAI networks can improve diagnostics while safeguarding privacy, and financial institutions can use decentralized models to detect fraud collaboratively without exposing proprietary data. These advancements democratize AI access, empowering smaller players to compete in traditionally closed markets. As we move into 2025, deAI's role in decentralizing innovation will be pivotal, addressing ethical concerns around AI governance and fostering collaboration across sectors. By combining the strengths of blockchain and AI, deAI represents a major step toward equitable and secure technology solutions in an increasingly data-driven world. Cryptocurrencies are no longer confined to speculative trading. As the trends for 2025 demonstrate, they are becoming integral to global finance, technology and social equity. From ReFi’s environmental solutions to CBDCs’ potential for financial inclusion, the crypto ecosystem is tackling some of the world’s most pressing challenges. At the same time, advances in governance and decentralized identity are ensuring these innovations remain secure and trustworthy. To thrive in this evolving space, staying informed and engaged is essential. By exploring these trends, investors, businesses and policymakers alike can harness the transformative power of blockchain technology to build a more inclusive and sustainable future. The crypto industry’s key challenges include navigating a fragmented and evolving regulatory landscape, addressing scalability and energy efficiency concerns and increasing public trust through education and transparent governance. Privacy debates surrounding CBDCs and regulatory clarity for DeFi projects will also be pivotal. Over regulations could slow innovation in the short term, particularly for decentralized platforms and privacy-focused projects. However, the establishment of clear, uniform rules and fair enforcement could enhance trust, attract institutional players, and promote sustainable growth in the long term. The most transformative trends include institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, the mainstream rollout of CBDCs to enhance financial inclusion and the rapid rise of green crypto projects aligning blockchain innovation with global sustainability goals. These developments will shape the future of both the industry and global financial systems.

Title: Jim Cramer Calls Nucor Corporation (NUE) The ‘Gold Standard’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses 17 Stocks And Blasts Zero Day Options. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) stands against the other stocks. In his second appearance on Squawk on the Street after the Fed's interest rate cut, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about the Fed's decision and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data release. The PCE data was a boon for investors as it signaled that inflation was dropping. Cramer started by pointing out that the PCE data release was "somewhat reassuring. Because if we do get lower inflation, I think it's certainly a possibility because we're starting to get our arms around what's really causing inflation. Then it doesn't seem so devastating, what happened on Wednesday." He added that the release doesn't reverse the market fall since he thinks that the market fell after "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing, after speculation in what I regard as being these, really kind of, I'll put them in commercial aerospace, because of Musk." Cramer believes that the central bank officials " don't wanna see that. They don't point blank say it. I wish they had. But that's what's going on here, it's the air going out of that balloon." However, while he believes that the market might have fallen because of the balloon 'deflating', this has created an interesting opportunity. According to Cramer, the speculation in the market has been replaced by "some really interesting fundamental news. And I think that we are the most oversold that we've been in, you're up there in terms of the ten-year low, if you bought, and I've got some numbers that are saying if you bought today, three months later, you made money. In every single case, it's really rather extraordinary." While the threat of a US government shutdown over the holidays has been averted, Cramer also had some interesting takes on the conflict in Congress. He shared that "I studied shutdowns for my last book. And every shutdown was a buying opportunity. They're always as frightening as the way we've been covering this morning. Uh, and they always end up being a buying opportunity. Because they are considered to be so frightening." Cramer backed his claims by sharing data that took all night to calculate. He added "What I'm saying, I know this is against the grain of what I'm hearing, but you're supposed to buy today not sell it. All the data I have, all the data I have, I mean I've got data going back ten years. And. . . [THE] oscillator, the S&P oscillator that I follow. It's minus eight, uh, thank you to the S&P people." The negative oscillator reading means that buying stocks at the dip and then holding them for certain time periods has historically yielded returns. Cramer pointed out "You have a median gain three months later of 4.55, sixty days, 11.0. I mean, this is unassailable stuff. I couldn't believe it. I asked them to calculate it. Took them all night to calculate. But oh my! You buy today, you make money! I don't know what to say, the data is the data! The forecast is the forecast! The guidance is the guidance!" He continued and added that while watching the markets early morning on Friday, he wondered "Who are these numbskulls who're doing this. They are people who are sleep-deprived, they don't know what they're doing. And frankly, we now know we have become the crack house. We are the crack house!" Cramer didn't hold back when criticizing investors who are obsessed with zero-day options. These options expire after the trading day ends, and therefore, they are for those investors who seek to profit from the market's daily moves. According to Cramer, people who trade these options "are debilitated. They are, they believe the long term means you gotta hold it to the afternoon. Uh, these people I feel bad for them because they're losing fortunes, they don't know what they're doing." He believes that day trading is more "addictive" than online gambling. "Depression, anxiety, all the things that are tell-tale of how to wreck your life are now part of our market," believes Cramer. In fact, according to him, options trading needs to be talked about more. Cramer pointed out that "$538 million is options! Out of $1.9 billion. $538 million! Crypto is $268 million! Their next big line is margin interest! $220 mil! Why aren't people talking about this?" According to Cramer, "These people are losing a lot of money. And maybe they ought to take a little more long-term approach. We have to say, look, if you think that you can trade up against professionals, and the professionals have software, the professionals have algorithms, the professionals know more than the people who are day trading. That's what I'm saying." However, he does believe that "you can balance it. You can do some of this stuff for fun if you want to. But my father was wiped out by trading the National Video. Now go Google National Video. He did day trading for it all the way down." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired on Friday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A close-up of a worker inspecting a galvanised sheet steel product in a well-lit warehouse. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 32 Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is an American steel company that sells manufactured products and iron-based raw materials. Steel has been one of the poorest-performing sectors in the American economy in 2024. Steel spot prices have struggled throughout 2024, leading to Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)'s peers such as US Steel posting disappointing earnings. Amidst industry troubles, the firm has kept up with stock repurchases despite the fact that its shares have lost 33.6% year-to-date. These repurchases were also on Cramer's mind as he noted: "Well Nucor bought a ton of stock when it was much much higher. And in many of the greats are going down in this country. If you looked at Nucor which is obviously the gold standard. I mean this company has lost 34% of its value this year and that's an example Carl of why if you really think that the Fed made a mistake, you would say well listen I'm looking at that company which is incredibly important for construction. Or incredibly important for, uh, every single manufacturing plant in this country. And it shows you, look out, we're, we're showing real weakness there. So we've got an economy that's weak and an economy that's strong. It's hard to reconcile." Overall NUE ranks 16th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NUE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NUE but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Wall Street shares 4 predictions for AI going into 2025 — including 3 trades to maximize returns

It's looking like the AI hype will continue for a third consecutive year. The technology has polarized investors and market experts across Wall Street, with some believing it'll completely transform the economy and others believing it's creating a stock-market bubble ripe for popping. Regardless of what you think about AI, it's had an undeniable impact on the market. Hardware, Big Tech, anything data-center-related — investors who bet on these areas of the market this year reaped handsome rewards. But technology advances fast, and today's AI playbook may very well become outdated in the new year. Business Insider compiled views from four Wall Street firms to see what some of the most influential financial institutions think about the future of AI. Here's what Wall Street is predicting about the technology and how you can update your portfolio. If there's one thing that AI proponents and naysayers can agree on, it's that the technology is expensive to produce. Building data centers, stocking up on GPUs, powering AI — all of that doesn't come cheap. In 2024, Big Tech companies poured mind-boggling amounts of capital into building out AI infrastructure. By the end of the year, it's likely that Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft will have spent $222 billion on AI capital expenditures, which is a 50% increase from last year, according to UBS. But that's just the tip of the iceberg, according to some Wall Street firms. According to BlackRock's 2025 outlook, "major tech companies are starting to rival the U.S. government on research and development spending." "We estimate spending on this infrastructure could top $700 billion by 2030, equivalent to 2% of U.S. GDP," the asset manager added. Expect continued investment in data centers, chips, and power systems as AI models become more complex. That means investors who bought into the picks and shovels AI trade in 2024 should stay invested, UBS argues. Going into next year, the bank recommends looking into utilities, as the electricity providers fueling AI data centers are seeing a steady uptick in demand. Examples of utilities funds include the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) and the Fidelity MSCI Utilities Index ETF (FUTY). AI investing in 2024 was largely defined by what Goldman Sachs calls the Phase 1 and Phase 2 trades of AI infrastructure. Investors flocked to Nvidia, the superstar Phase 1 stock, as well as the Phase 2 AI picks and shovels, including data centers and other semiconductor companies. While those trades are clearly still hot, there'll be new opportunities to invest in AI as more use cases emerge, many on Wall Street believe. 2025 will see a widening field of investment opportunities, particularly in so-called Phase 3 companies that are monetizing AI and using it to boost their revenue streams, Goldman Sachs says. The bank has identified 11 stocks that are using AI to increase their revenues, per their last quarterly earnings calls. They include ACV Auctions, Commvault Systems, Cloudflare, Datadog, DigitalOcean, Dynatrace, Fortinet, Gartner, Hubspot, Mastercard, and ServiceNow. UBS also highlights a few areas of the market in particular for investors to keep an eye out for in the coming years. "We expect successful generative AI applications across a range of industries, including in health care, cybersecurity, and fintech," UBS said. US stocks have outperformed global markets in 2024 thanks in large part to AI. The large sums being spent on AI are paying off for US companies. According to Apollo, the US has more data centers than all other major countries combined, giving it a significant advantage in the industry. "The US is experiencing a surge in corporate and research spending on the back of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution—a dynamic not seen in other developing nations or even China," Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo, wrote in the firm's 2025 outlook. Robust AI investment may be part of the reason why the overall US economy has performed so well. "The federal government's investments in green energy and infrastructure, along with private sector investments in AI, have been crucial to the nation's economic resilience," Sløk added. The boom in construction from building AI infrastructure, as well as the ongoing energy transition to power data centers, is a powerful tailwind for the US economy and the AI trade going into 2025. For that reason, BlackRock is betting on US equities going into 2025. "We think the AI mega force will benefit U.S. stocks more and that's why we stay overweight, particularly relative to international peers such as European stocks," the asset manager wrote in its 2025 outlook. Some examples of US-based AI funds include the Xtrackers Artificial Intelligence and Big Data ETF (XAIX) and the iShares US Technology ETF (IYW). AI could have an overlooked benefit to the stocks in your portfolio: it could lower inflation. The technology has the potential to usher in a new era of labor and productivity gains for the economy, according to BlackRock and UBS. As more companies adopt AI tools, routine tasks will be automated and new business models will be implemented. That'll lead to decreasing inflation as the supply of goods and services increases, thanks to automation. This won't be an instantaneous change, but rather one that slowly emerges over the next few years, UBS said in its 2025 outlook. That's a promising side effect of AI, especially as the Federal Reserve has battled to bring inflation down in 2024 and some economists speculate that inflation could remain elevated in the long term. "If AI's potential can be realized, we believe it could augur a productivity revolution and contribute to lower prices for various goods and services and higher rates of economic growth," UBS said. "For investors, at a macroeconomic level, we believe the AI revolution is likely to help lower inflation, boost growth, and therefore result in higher real interest rates in the years ahead," the bank added.

Title: More Reasons for Cautious Optimism About the Demise of The Green Energy Fantasy
URL: https://wattsupwiththat.com/2024/12/25/more-reasons-for-cautious-optimism-about-the-demise-of-the-green-energy-fantasy/
Time Published: 2024-12-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the MANHATTAN CONTRARIAN Francis Menton My post on Saturday noted one big reason for optimism that the green energy fantasy is coming to the end of its run: the first country, Germany, has apparently begun to hit the green energy “wall.” Although Germany has never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar, its ability to continue its green energy dreams has stalled: its electricity prices have soared, its manufacturing sector has been seriously undermined, its economy is in recession, and recently its green-promoting government has fallen. Its failed example now stands for others to see and avoid. And as I look around at developments since the election, I see a number of other reasons to reinforce my cautious optimism. Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both. Here are examples: Banks and investment firms quitting net zero “alliances” On Saturday’s post, commenter William Bell asked “Who, exactly, is preventing third-world inhabitants from using wood, charcoal, coal, petroleum derivatives, and/or natural gas for fuel and by what means?” Apparently Mr. Bell, and maybe many others, is unaware of the many “alliances” of banks and investors seeking to starve fossil fuels of investment capital, and thus prevent third-world countries (and everybody else) from continuing to use them. Most of these groups are somehow directed and overseen by the UN. Examples of these groups include the Net Zero Banking Alliance (“Bank-led, UN-convened”), the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, and Climate Action 100+. I’m sure that I have not got them all. The members are, or have been, a who’s who of all the biggest banks and investment firms in the world. The Center Square reports here on December 20 that two rather significant banks, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, have just quit the NZBA: Not soon after the general election, and within two weeks of each other, two major financial institutions have left a United Nations Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA). This is after they joined three years ago, pledging to require environmental social governance standards (ESG) across their platforms, products and systems. House Judiciary Committee issues report accusing large money managers of running a “climate cartel” On December 13, the House Judiciary Committee issued a Report titled “Sustainability Shakedown: How a Climate Cartel of Money Managers Colluded to Take Over the Board of America’s Largest Energy Company.” The Report documents the process by which the Climate Action 100+ alliance, “emboldened” by encouragement from the Biden/Harris administration, orchestrated replacement of three board members of Exxon in May 2021. The collusive actions of the largest investment firms and proxy advisors are described as a “cartel” clearly violative of the antitrust laws. Red state AGs sue investment firms for antitrust violations for colluding on “climate” issues Maybe it’s coincidence, but shortly before the issuance of the Judiciary Committee Report, an antitrust suit was brought on November 27 by eleven red state AGs, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, accusing participants in the investment industry of collusive conduct in enforcing “climate” and other “ESG” goals. The defendants in the case include the three largest money managers, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street. From Bloomberg Law, November 27: BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. TotalEnergies pauses major wind farm in the waters off New York and New Jersey Also on November 27, French energy giant TotalEnergies announced that it was “pausing” its major Attentive Energy off-shore wind project in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey. In his announcement of the “pause,” Total’s Chairman specifically attributed the action to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. From Offshore, November 27: TotalEnergies has reportedly paused development of the Attentive Energy wind farm it planned to build off the coast of New York and New Jersey, CEO Patrick Pouyanne said Tuesday at an energy industry conference in London. “I have decided to put the project on pause,” TotalEnergies’ CEO Patrick Pouyanne said at the Energy Intelligence Forum, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters. The decision is one of the first tangible signs of a halt in investment in renewable power sources due to the anticipated policies of the incoming Trump administration. Trump has vowed to stop offshore wind energy development “on day one” of his next term starting in January 2025. The new Trump administration is still almost a month away from taking office, but already the anticipation of its arrival is having the positive effect of driving some of the parasites into hiding. There are many more such positive developments out there. I’ll see if I can assemble a few more before year’s end. Meanwhile, I’m as hopeful as I’ve ever been that the green energy mania is fading. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe It looks as if the green energy bandwagon may be slowing in America. However, in Europe, it’s still full steam ahead. Ed Miliband is utterly determined that Britain will be the first lemming off the edge of the cliff and will do absolutely anything to achieve this. He wouldn’t care if a million Britons froze to death in winter if his insane climate goals were achieved. Miliband is not dictator for life. The UK is still a democracy and the voters will be heard. The outcome of the Labour foolishness is predetermined – it is only a matter of time before the voters demand change. The support for Net Zero will only end in the UK when the actual electricity grid cannot support the population and randomly fails during the coldest weather. Therefore Labour/Conservative/LibDem alliance is in not danger at the moment. It’s probably going to be more problematic as Rachel from Complaints will have to raise more taxes in April at the current rate of progress. In the mean time percentage on ZE vehicles being sold rises as total sales of cars falls. That part of the plan is working well. The UK is not a functional democracy since the choices we have are limited and as many already know, the Davos Uniparty have infected our system so all the main parties are variants of socialism. But the fastest growing party Reform gives us hope as while they may have got only 5 MPs, their proportion of the vote was higher than the LimpDumbs who got the third highest number of MPs. Reform were very close to winning a lot of seats that went to Labour in the north and are close to Tory seats in the south. The local council elections in May will be a popularity poll on our Student Union government and the signs are they will get hammered. That could bring about a new leader for Labour. As for the inexperienced Rachel from Accounts/Complaints? She might be toast come the spring as the UK will be in recession with inflation rising and interest rates stuck, but more importantly government bond rates will be high and that drives the mortgage interest rates which ‘working people’ – something Labour have struggled to define – will be feeling. You are almost right. actually, all political parties are variants of socialism and this includes Reform. I see a small chink of light growing as the notion of independents takes root. This is where the future of the right lays. Eventually, we will see democracy by the people, of the people, and for the people. Aren’t lemmings closely related to ‘rats’? RATS was the last UK coal fired power station (Ratcliffe on Soar). A target of 50% “green” energy – in itself, difficult to achieve – would have reduced CO2 emissions by, errr… 50%, but zealots are never happy, for them it’s 100% or nothing – except, of course, that it never can be 100%. That’s why I doubt the sanity of people like Red Ed Miliband. The most dangerous man since that bloke in Germany some while back… Happy Christmas everyone! Actually, it is doubtful that “green energy” (whatever that is**) reduces CO2 emission much at all The US reduced its CO2 emissions by converting coal to gas. Germany and the UK have reduced their emissions by destroying their manufacturing base and sending it to China , India etc, probably increasing the overall CO2 released. ** wind and solar are the exact opposite of “green”.. Both are hugely environmentally polluting at every stage… mining , manufacture (absolutely horrendous), installation (environmentally destructive), usage (avian destruction), and final disposal in landfill , or left to rot in place. I don’t disagree, Brice, I was just arguing on the “Even if one accepts that “green” energy is desireable…” basis in order to underline Miliband’s madness in trying to get to 100%. I agree Bnice, Green and Energy do not belong together as the result is an oxymoron! The Greens have had enough say about what they want about energy, now it’s time for the rest of us ordinary people-90% to demand, cheap reliable electricity by whatever means are available, be it fossil fuels, hydro, nuclear and even solar in moderation. None of this energy business has anything to do with climate change, so people get over this non- existent fake environmental climate crisis. If we don’t get a positive response about our cheap energy requirements from responsible governments, we will vote them out sooner rather than later. First was the US then Germany and Australia will follow if they are smart enough in 2025! However, in the UK, Labour is totally delusional about energy, so the process will take longer unless the people riot or occupy the House of Commons. Just yesterday in another thread that Warren Beeton fool was trying gaslight me, claiming that steel manufacturing with electric blast furnaces was feasible. They can’t even keep the lights on now, how is uninterrupted power for molten steel possible with wind turbines? Any manufacturer trying this insanity would be quickly out-of-business. Swedish SSAB plans to be the first steel company in the world to deliver ‘fossil free steel’ to the market on a commercial scale in 2026. How successful and competitively priced it will be remains to be seen. Access to plentiful hydro electric power is probably essential. I want to see what the metallurgy reports on this hydrogen-reduced steel say. How they overcome the embrittlement problem has been mostly a hand-wave in the press releases. I am not sure I want to live on the 12th floor of a high-rise made with H2Steel. Agree. SSAB have been collaborating with Mercedes for some time so I think steel for vehicle production will be their initial step. According to current data, around 70% of steel in the United States is manufactured using electric arc furnaces (EAFs), which are considered electric furnaces; this means a significant majority of American steel production relies on electric furnaces. Big River Steel In 2024, this facility in Osceola, Arkansas became the first steel plant in the world to receive ResponsibleSteel certification. ResponsibleSteel is a nonprofit that audits companies’ progress toward “net-zero steel” production. Big River Steel also gets more than 60% of its electricity from non-fossil-fuel sources. THAT IS THE CLOSEST TO GREEN STEEL IN THE US. I did a Bing search on electric arc furnaces and found that these are used for recycling scrap steel. Blast furnaces are still used for smelting iron ore. Didn’t find any info on use of hydrogen for smelting iron ore. I recall reading awhile back that a pilot process for smelting iron ore with hydrogen malfunctioned, resulting in an explosion that killed a worker and injured several other workers. particularly for reducing iron to make steel possible, a coking furnace is required. After the iron is in the right oxidation state it really doesn’t matter how one heats it for the final mix. The innovation is with using hydrogen as the reducing agent, but any hydrogen left in the matrix will lead to brittle steal that won’t hold up to stresses as well as the traditional carbon-reduced steal. I doubt that Millivolt is insane, atticman. But he has a very low (and alas accurate) assessment of how well British education prepares the population for critical thinking. In plain sight, he and Sir Stalin are obliterating the ancient rights of Englishmen along with the utter replacement of Englishmen. I don’t believe that it is the accidental outcome of insanity. But indeed, happy Christmas! Turn to thoughts of hope and joy. ancient rights- maybe time for a constitution and bill of rights? nobody pitching for that? Perhaps not – we wouldn’t be $34T in debt if our Federales had actually been constrained by our Constitution. How often is it even 50% in Germany? Under ideal conditions only? At night in windy weather? If it’s only under ideal conditions- it would be useful to get the average for all the hours in a year. Even if “green energy” was to reach 50%, the CO2 “reduction” wouldn’t be anywhere close to 50%. This is because fossil fuel plants need to kept on warm standby, at a minimum, so that they can take over whenever “green energy” fails. I’ve seen no blowback from Microsoft’s announcement that they will be reopening Three Mile Island — certainly a good sign. Yes, I agree it’s a good thing. I hope Microsoft has employed some experienced “restart” experts who know what they are getting into. I have no knowledge of Three Mile Island’s current mechanical condition. However, recommissioning equipment that has sat idle, unpowered and/or unmaintained for any number of years can quickly become uneconomical. I’m not sure you just walk back in and flip on the switches. Microsoft isn’t restarting Three Mile Island, they contracted to use the electricity, if I’m not mistaken. Doesn’t someone have to restart it first? Reactor 1 was running until 2019. Thanks Bob. Those that haven’t kept up could start here: Restarting Three Mile Island: Quick Facts “Maybe it’s that the political environment has changed, and maybe it’s that some people are starting to recognize that you can’t beat the laws of physics; and maybe it’s some of both.” The myopic obsession with the physics of the so-called “greenhouse effect” must come to an end one way or another. And the physics of electrical power generation and hydrocarbon fuels cannot be faked. It may take a few more years for this to be fully realized, but it is from the physics of the general circulation that the claims of GHG “warming” are directly refuted. Are rising concentrations of CO2 capable of “forcing” absorbed energy to accumulate down here (i.e. “warming.”) as sensible heat gain in the land + ocean + atmosphere system? No. Energy conversion explains why not. [internal energy + potential energy] is constantly being converted to/from [kinetic energy]. Lorenz described this concept. The ERA5 reanalysis model explicitly computes it. More here. Please read the full text description of this very short time-lapse video. I will paste that full text in a reply. In my view, this is important for skeptics of the climate movement to understand. https://youtu.be/hDurP-4gVrY The text description for that video. ************ Are CO2 emissions a risk to the climate? No. The static “warming” effect of incremental CO2 (~4 W/m^2 for 2XCO2) disappears as kinetic energy (wind) is converted to/from internal energy (including temperature) + potential energy (altitude). This time lapse video shows the daily minimum, median, and maximum values of the computed “vertical integral of energy conversion” hourly parameter from the ERA5 reanalysis for 2022. Values for each 1/4 degree longitude gridpoint at 45N latitude are given. The vertical scale is from -10,000 to +10,000 W/m^2. The minor incremental radiative absorbing power of non-condensing GHGs such as CO2, CH4, and N2O vanishes on the vertical scale as the rapidly changing energy conversion in both directions is tens to thousands of times greater. So what? The assumed GHG “forcings” cannot be isolated for reliable attribution of reported surface warming. And with all the circulation and energy conversion throughout the depth of the troposphere, heat energy need not be expected to accumulate on land and in the oceans to harmful effect from incremental non-condensing GHGs. The GHGs add no energy to the land + ocean + atmosphere system. Therefore the radiative properties of CO2, CH4, and N2O, and other molecules of similar nature, should not be assumed to produce a perturbing climate “forcing.” The concept of energy conversion helps us understand the self-regulating delivery of energy to high altitude for just enough longwave radiation to be emitted to space. References: The ERA5 reanalysis model is a product of ECMWF, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The computed parameters “vertical integral of potential + internal energy” and “vertical integral of energy conversion” are described at these links. https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162061 https://codes.ecmwf.int/grib/param-db/?id=162064 Further comment: This is for just one latitude band at 45N. Similar results were observed for 45S, 10N/S, 23.5N/S, and 66N/S. More Background: From Edward N. Lorenz (1960) “Energy and Numerical Weather Prediction” https://doi.org/10.3402/tellusa.v12i4.9420 “2. Energy, available potential energy, and gross static stability Of the various forms of energy present in the atmosphere, kinetic energy has often received the most attention. Often the total kinetic energy of a weather system is regarded as a measure of its intensity. The only other forms of atmospheric energy which appear to play a major role in the kinetic energy budget of the troposphere and lower stratosphere are potential energy, internal energy, and the latent energy of water vapor. Potential and internal energy may be transformed directly into kinetic energy, while latent energy may be transformed directly into internal energy, which is then transformed into kinetic energy. It is easily shown by means of the hydrostatic approximation that the changes of the potential energy P and the internal energy l of the whole atmosphere are approximately proportional, so that it is convenient to regard potential and internal energy as constituting a single form of energy. This form has been called total potential energy by Margules (1903). … In the long run, there must be a net depletionof kinetic energy by dissipative processes. It follows that there must be an equal net generation of kinetic energy by reversible adiabatic processes; this generation must occur at the expense of total potential energy. It follows in turn that there must be an equal net generation of total potential energy by heating of all kinds. These three steps comprise the basic energy cycle of the atmosphere. The rate at which these steps proceed is a fundamental characteristic of the general circulation.” ************** Yep, as I keep saying, “There are no free lunches in physics.” I concur. It seems to me the most realistic mechanism. The uncertainty comes w the attribution equations which rely on assumed mechanisms that cannot be properly equated as in essense one cannot separate the signals as one could in a lab. That guesswork is fine as far as im concerned. The issue is w politics in regards to ‘settled science’. I understand that particular mechanism. In order to implement impactful policies you A: create a narrative of ‘settled science’ and act like a religious group w a control/ comply structure, coupled w B: a fear of Armageddon and percecution of heretics. People are fed up with woke left wing insanity. There’s some evidence that led to Trump’s election, and the Republicans taking both senate and house. Peter Zeihan points out that the voting patterns in the election weren’t typical. … it means the culture war is a big determining factor on how people vote … Folks who have enough education can convince themselves that CAGW is a serious problem, that Anthony Fauci is a hero, and that a woman can have a penis. Fortunately, the majority of voters know better. Defund the universities. This video, Why Smart People Believe Stupid Things, is worth a look. I don’t think it’s clear that Republicans have a firm grip on the Senate. Too many RINOs can still spoil the soup. And isn’t the House majority even narrower than it was before the election? True but even just a one seat majority means control of all the committees which means bad democrat legislative junk will seldom get to the floor for a vote. Why sources always brag on renewable wind and solar Capacity rather than actual production? 2023 annual World wind production 2.33 milllion GWh; wind capacity 1017.2 GW ((2,330,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1017.2)) equals actual production of 26.14% of Capacity. 2023 annual World Solar production 1.64 milllion GWh; solar capacity 1419.0 GW ((1.640,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/1419.0)) equals actual production of 13.2% of Capacity. 2023 annual combined World production 3.97 milllion GWh; combined capacity 2436.2 GW ((3.970,000/8760 Hrs/Yr)/2436.2)) equals actual production of 18.6% of Capacity. 2023 Wind and Solar renewable production was 18.6% of capacity and I suspect that 2024 will be some what lower. Depending on the source wind and Solar contributed 11-13.4% of total world electricity production during 2023. Forgot the sources: https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wind-energy-consumption-vs-installed-wind-energy-capacity https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-energy-consumption-vs-solar-pv-capacity And specifically for Germany:  Wind Energy: Around 142.1 TWh, which accounted for approximately 27% of Germany’s total electricity consumption in 2023.  Solar Energy: Approximately 59.9 TWh, which should account for roughly 11-12% of the total electricity consumption. Germany wind and solar are both grid saturated according to “The Pollack Limit” discussed at length a couple years ago here on WUWT. The Wind CF in Germany is right at 27% and Solar at 12%.Time to give it up, it was an irresponsible waste of capital up to this point, continuing the insanity is well, insane. The new German ruling Coalition after The February 2025 will surely early on end the energewende.. Leftist fantasies never end but eventually they run out of other people’s money to waste. In the US the investment growth rate for wind power is slow. But solar power and EV investment growth rates still far too high: The United States’ solar energy capacity has been growing rapidly in recent years, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projecting a 75% increase in solar power capacity from 2023 to 2025 In 2023, the United States’ wind capacity increased by 4% from 2022, reaching a total of 147.5 gigawatts (GW). This is a 10% average annual increase since 2010, when the capacity was 45 GW. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects wind capacity to increase by 7 gigawatts (GW) in 2024, which is a 5% increase from the previous year. This would bring the total wind capacity in the U.S. to 153.8 GW by the end of 2024. In 2024, the US is expected to invest $312 billion in EV manufacturing, with $223 billion already allocated to specific initiatives. This is a nearly $66 billion increase from January 2023 All cash down the crapper. Oh, and “capacity” does not equal production. The percentage increase of investment correlates with the percentage increase of capacity. Exactly. It has absolutely nothing to do with electricity actually generated that can be used when generated. Yes — Greene can’t read. Number of bad investments correlates well with number of government investments. Germany may have fatally damaged its manufacturing base as companies close or announce job cuts or relocations out of Germany virtually every week. Sky high energy costs mean that a twelfth of the population are not able to fund a full year forcing consideration to be given to banning disconnections for non-payment even if only during the winter months. Energy companies in the UK are facing an increasing amount of customers in debt and these may be pushed on to those of us who are paying, as if our costs were not high enough already. Many of the companies that haven’t moved or downsized already, are having trouble finding enough money to maintain their equipment, much less modernize it. This will hamper those companies in the future. Germany is poised to begin repairing Merkel’s damage: (It won’t be easy and it won’t be quick). Christoph Strack 4 hours ago4 hours ago Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany’s leader. Merz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as “ugly” wind turbines. He drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner’s wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine. Merz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees. He represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).(We’ll see about that, I think he’ll change his mind, he must IMHO) Shortly after Germany’s center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz’s coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming. Merz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government. The renewable energy business has been built on lies pure and simple. If we had the strength to hold government, media and academia accountable we wouldn’t be in this mess. If we held individuals accountable and didn’t allow them to hide behind their organizations all of this would end. Remove the free money, remove the commitment. The clear indicator of a specious cause. RE has always been a means for the wealthy to extract public money through subsidies, never about reducing CO2 emissions. I am optimistic for a different reason. For years, it seemed like the climate skeptics spoke alone, and in a disjointed fashion, making no headway with GQ public. Now, I’m watching organizations pull together, and some even coordinate their efforts. Recently, someone told me that 20% of people are hypnotized idiots, 20% question everything, and 60% can be convinced with logic but mostly they just go along with whichever group is loudest. By coordinating efforts, we can appear to be the winners and pull in the 60%. Just a thought about “ never consistently reached even 50% of its electricity production from wind and solar” A true but misleading statement. “Electricity production” is not full-time electric service–as we are used to and require. “Electricity” from intermittent, sporadic machines does not/cannot provide full time, on-demand electric service. (for typical residential, commercial, industrial use). To contribute at all, solar and wind must connect to a grid of rotating generation from coal, natural gas, oil, large hydro, or nuclear. With specialized equipment at various grid locations calculated for reliability, stability and regulation. AC frequency, voltage, current, reactances, and other instant (frequency in HZ or AC cycles are usually 1/50 or 1/60 of a second. A transmission grid or distribution network requires controls that continuously monitor and take stabilizing actions as needed to provide AC within best engineering practices. Best engineering practices used to include lowest capital, construction, and operational costs. Sadly no longer used.

RAIN, HAIL, OR snow, every Christmas Day troves of people across the country take to bodies of water for a Christmas Day swim. Luckily, today you don’t need to worry about hail or snow if you are planning on participating. According to the Met Éireann forecast, today will be mild and quite cloudy, though some brighter breaks will develop. Speaking to The Journal, meteorologist Brandon Creagh said that it is unseasonably mild, and this morning will have temperatures of between 10 and 11 degrees across the whole country. “The sea is actually going to be pretty much fairly close to that as well,” he said. “The sea surface temperatures are forecast to be around 10 or 11 degrees. “But I would encourage people to keep an eye on the advice from water safety Ireland and the Irish coast guard, which has been circling around on Christmas Day.” Advertisement Creagh said that the unseasonable weather is the result of mild air that has been pushed up from the south due to a high pressure system centered around Europe. “So the whole country is going to experience fairly similar conditions tomorrow, some places might get a little bit more sun than others, but exactly where that will be remains to be seen,” he said. Most places will be dry but a few patches of light rain and drizzle will affect the western half of the country. Highest temperatures of 11 to 13 degrees in moderate southwest winds, fresh at times on west and northwest coasts.

Alamy Stock Photo Alamy Stock Photo COPE Galway has issued a list of precautions for swimmers to be aware of as they take on the Christmas Day swim. The charity is organising the swim, which takes place this morning at Blackrock Pier in Salthill. Last year, over 850 people took place in the swim. COPE Galway said for swimmers to stay visible, not to swim alone, avoid diving and swimming after consuming alcohol or a large meal. It also said to avoid staying in the water for too long and to bring a warm drink and warm clothes to change into. Lifeguards will be present at the swim, but it warned that participants should be aware of the safety guidelines. Organised swims are taking place all across the country today. Despite the mild weather, it is still recommended to wrap up warm and not too spend too long in the water. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Elon Musk’s xAI raises $6B to bolster battle against OpenAI: ‘Gonna need a bigger compute!’

Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence startup xAI revealed that it raised $6 billion in its latest funding round as the startup continues to ramp up in its battle against bitter rival OpenAI. Musk took a victory lap after announcing Monday on his social media platform X that the company concluded its Series C funding round — which is usually the final stage of venture capital financing. “We are gonna need a bigger compute!” Musk wrote, in an apparent reference to the famous line from “Jaws.” The need for a “bigger compute” is likely an indication that Musk plans to use the investment to build larger processing centers to warehouse super computers that will be needed to train and run more sophisticated AI models. The company had raised $6 billion in a Series B funding round in May at a post-money valuation of $24 billion. In late November, xAI raised another $5 billion at a $50 billion valuation, according to the Wall Street Journal. Now, it appears xAI raised a bigger round of $6 billion, but Musk didn’t disclose the valuation. Investors in the latest funding round included Sequoia Capital, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Fidelity, Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holdings, the sovereign wealth funds of Oman and Qatar, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Valor Equity Partners, Dubai-based Vy Capital and UAE-based MGX, the company said. In its latest announcement, xAI said that it is training Grok 3, the latest version of its chatbot, which was originally scheduled to be available by the end of this year. The infusion of cash comes as Musk is engaged in an AI arms race against ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the company he co-founded and which is now run by Sam Altman. Musk, who left OpenAI after losing a power struggle against Altman and other co-founders, is suing the company and its key financial backer Microsoft. He is alleging that Microsoft and OpenAI, which as of October was valued at around $157 billion, illegally sought to monopolize the market for generative artificial intelligence and sideline competitors.

Title: My Top Retirement Strategy For 14% Dividends In 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelfoster/2024/12/24/my-top-retirement-strategy-for-14-dividends-in-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-24T18:38:00Z
Full Content:
Adirondack chairs on a wooden dock on a calm lake in Muskoka, Ontario Canada. Cottages nestled ... [+] between trees are visible across the water. Not many people know this, but if you really want to diversify—deftly balancing and rebalancing to maximize (and protect) your gains, you need to invest in closed-end funds (CEFs). Doing this with CEFs, which yield around 8% on average, gives you two key advantages: First, you get a much bigger income stream. That’s great on its own. But if you’re reinvesting your income, you get an even bigger edge because you can easily redirect your dividends from one CEF to another in a different sector. You just can’t do this with an index fund. Let’s dig into how that works in practice. While 2024 has been a great year for stocks, some sectors are lagging, as is always the case. And right now, as we look ahead to 2025, is a good time to reallocate a bit from your winners into the stragglers. That’s because, over time, these laggards will likely revert to their long-term average performance. A look at the sectors making up the S&P 500 tells us that the biggest winners this year have been the communication services, finance, consumer discretionary and tech sectors. These firms are picking up the slack we’ve seen in materials, energy and healthcare. I want to focus on healthcare, because the gap between this year’s performance (up just around 1.1% following last week’s selloff) and what the sector has done in the long run is striking. With about a 9% annualized return over the last decade, healthcare has performed relatively well, making it a good target for rebalancing by moving profits (or CEF dividends) into it from the stronger-performing sectors of 2024. The highest-yielding healthcare CEF is the abrdn Healthcare Investors Fund (HQH), a 14.2% payer whose portfolio includes key pharma names like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY). It would take just $705,000 invested in this fund to get $100,000 per year in income. Plus, HQH’s focus on healthcare means we could pair it with other sector-specific CEFs and rebalance to ensure we aren’t overexposed to any particular industry—and also profit from the performance differences between those sectors. But to make certain HQH is the best CEF for this strategy, we need to dig deeper. As of this writing, HQH has beaten the healthcare sector as a whole, with a 7.9% total NAV return year to date (this is a CEF-specific measure that examines the performance of a fund’s underlying portfolio, rather than its price on the open market), about seven times the return of the benchmark Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV). However, on the open market, the fund has returned 10.6%, including dividends paid out. This gap largely stems from the fund’s big discount to NAV (or the difference between the NAV- and market price–based return), which was over 15% at the start of the year and has now returned to that overly generous discount following the big selloff last week. This is a new buying opportunity, and momentum could drive that discount smaller still over the coming months if the market’s recent panic subsides, pulling up the fund’s market price with it. And if HQH doesn’t cut its payout, we may indeed see that discount get smaller still. There are two problems, however: Obviously, the market pullback might not yet be done and, more importantly, HQH raised its dividend in May, which means it’s now paying a 12.6% yield on NAV, much higher than that 7.9% total NAV return we just talked about. This means the dividend might need to be cut. Or HQH will need to pay out shareholder capital, shrinking the fund’s size—and its gain potential. That’s a tough situation, made worse by management’s decision to raise the payout. Now let’s consider the BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (BME), whose 7% yield is half that of HQH. BME trades at a less generous 10.3% discount, but the trend in this discount (in orange below) is very different than that of HQH (in purple). BME Discount HQH went from being priced at par to a huge discount to going back toward par over the last three years to plummeting last week. BME, meantime, has been on a steady descent toward a bigger discount (although the vector of decline has flattened out significantly in 2024, and it didn’t change all that much with the recent selloff). This would suggest BME is at risk of getting cheaper, but there’s a key detail: The fund is part of BlackRock’s “discount management program,” under which the company buys a certain amount of some CEFs (including BME) if their average discount is more than 7.5% during a three-month measurement period. HQH has no such initiative, which is why its discount grew so large late last year and why its discount could grow so massively. This means BME is unlikely to see its discount go much lower. And even if it does, BlackRock’s discount-management program means the firm will buy back shares on a quarterly basis at a 2% discount. If you tender your shares during this offer after buying at the fund’s current price, the result would be an instant 9.3% profit. There’s one more reason to prefer BME over HQH, despite its lower yield. BME Total Returns Over the last five years, BME (in orange above) has outperformed HQH on a total-NAV-return basis. This suggests it should be priced at a much smaller discount than HQH, on the strength of its stronger management. This also suggests BME is the better buy when its discount gets unusually wide. Thus, while HQH’s huge dividends make it look like the better choice, if you want to buy and hold a sector fund for the long term, BME is likely to outperform HQH, especially if BlackRock continues its discount-management program. However, if abrdn were to start its own discount-management program, HQH might have the edge. Until that happens, though, my money’s on BME.

From crypto CEOs who advocate for the industry to NFT project founders who use their good fortune to help others, several Web3 workhorses made their way onto Saint Nick's “nice list” this year. Here's who can expect presents under the tree when Santa comes to town. Brian Armstrong is the face of the digital assets industry's fight for more favorable regulations in the U.S. The soft-spoken CEO of Coinbase spent ample time in Washington this year, participating in discussions with Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike on the future of crypto in the U.S. Meanwhile, Armstrong’s team led initiatives to center digital assets-related issues in the 2024 U.S. elections, sponsoring studies on crypto holders' political leanings and facilitating Republican candidate Donald Trump's push to accept campaign donations in crypto. Armstrong and his team were instrumental in building up pro-crypto super PAC Fairshake's $200 million war chest. Coinbase donated roughly $50 million each to Fairshake between 2023 and 2024, helping secure the election of the most pro-crypto U.S. Congress ever. Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo is the face of the crypto industry’s tokenization craze—a trend that has helped catapult digital asset prices to new heights in 2024. In June, the executive delivered testimony on Capitol Hill about the importance of real-world asset tokenization and its implications for the future of finance. Domingo is also an important ally to institutional investors looking to pour funds into crypto. Earlier this year, the Spanish founder's tokenization platform partnered with BlackRock to launch the investment titan's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL). MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor has continued to be a fierce advocate for Bitcoin, adding more than $15 billion worth of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency to his company’s balance sheet in the last few weeks, according to the company’s filing with U.S. regulators. Saylor’s firm holds 423,650 Bitcoin (worth $41.5 billion) as of publication time, the company’s financial statements show. Despite HODLing roughly 2% of all the Bitcoin that will ever be mined, Saylor has contributed to the future of the cryptocurrency in another big way—by encouraging other tech giants to hold the asset. Earlier this month, Saylor pitched Microsoft’s directors on a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet—a proposal its shareholders ultimately rejected. In addition, he urged Amazon shareholders to also nudge the delivery company toward investing in the digital currency. Many other smaller companies have also followed MicroStrategy’s playbook. Maggie Love is the founder of SheFi, a community for women in the cryptocurrency industry. SheFi offers dedicated job boards, courses and networking opportunities for women, a demographic group that remains largely underrepresented in Web3 and the broader technology sector. Less than 15% of startups within the Web3 ecosystem have at least one female founder, while just 3% have an all-female founding team, according to a Boston Consulting Group analysis of Crunchbase data. A year ago, SheFi Summit was an experiment. Today it's a movement. Grateful to all 500+ of you who came out to the biggest SheFi Summit yet and made it incredibly clear: The frontier is feminine. pic.twitter.com/PnuUZgv2Az — maggie love wu (@maggielove_) July 7, 2024 SheFi is challenging that lack of representation, however. Since its inception, SheFi has amassed more than 3,000 members, making it one of the largest women-led communities in crypto. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has continued to advocate for privacy rights at a time when cryptocurrency and blockchain network adoption is accelerating. The vector of development that the internet and society is traveling leads away from extraordinary people sharing unique beliefs, and toward a tyranny of mediocrity. It is a preference for "normal" so strong that it extinguishes excellence; a ruthless allegiance to the average. — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 16, 2024 At the annual Bitcoin conference in Nashville, TN, this summer, Snowden warned the conference’s attendees to vote independently in the upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which posed major consequences for the future of the crypto industry. He also flagged that governments could use artificial intelligence-powered tools to mine people’s metadata—a much-needed warning at a time when the use of AI tools is gaining traction. Pudgy Penguins CEO and IP owner Luca Netz has built an NFT empire of adorable avian creatures despite a deep downturn in the market for crypto collectibles. Pudgy Penguins’ remarkable growth kicked into high gear with the launch of Webkinz-like Pudgy World in 2024, and it was later helped by the hype around its upcoming Solana-based PENGU token launch. The future is tokenized 🐧 pic.twitter.com/ismhUS5KLW — Luca Netz 🐧✳️ (@LucaNetz) December 8, 2024 Pudgy Penguins’ floor price—meaning the price of a given collection's least valuable token—surged to an all-time high of about $134,000 worth of Ethereum in mid-December, more than tripling in price since the start of the year, CoinGecko data shows. It’s the second most valuable profile picture (PFP) project on the market as of this writing, behind only the influential CryptoPunks. Pudgy Penguins also continued to waddle its way into the hearts of mainstream consumers in 2024, as its real-world toy collection expanded into Walmart, Target, and Walgreens shelves across the U.S. and Canada. In addition to his work on Pudgy Penguins, Netz is also a devoted angel investor to several Web3 projects, including women-led companies such as Chipped. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen has led the world's 11th-largest exchange by daily trading volume since May 2024. And despite the newness of her tenure, Chen is already making her mark. Chen helped the trading platform strike a major deal with Spanish soccer league La Liga, raising the exchange’s profile in Europe and Latin America. And under her leadership, Bitget also expanded its presence in Europe, establishing its first regional hub in Lithuania. The moves are part of the platform's broader strategy to court new users in markets throughout the world. Meanwhile, Chen’s Bitget has promoted the development of the crypto industry through its $100 million “Web3 Fund.” In addition to her work at Bitget, the executive has also spearheaded charitable programs such as Blockchain4Her, an initiative that aims to promote gender inclusivity and diversity in the crypto industry. Chen is also a delegate to the United Nations’ Conference on the Status of Women.

Title: Why NextEra Energy (NEE) Is Among the Best Solar Energy Stocks to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Solar Energy Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to look at where NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) stands against other best solar energy stocks to buy now. During Joe Biden’s presidency, the U.S. solar industry experienced a significant boost, primarily driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This $369 billion package, signed into law in 2022, has been a game-changer for the renewable energy sector. The IRA provided substantial incentives for renewable energy, including tax credits, grants, and investments in clean energy infrastructure. The IRA has also reduced the U.S. reliance on imported energy resources. The economic benefits of the IRA have been widely recognized, with bipartisan support from both Democratic and Republican leaders. According to a report by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) published on December 4, the US solar market installed 8.6 GW of capacity in Q3, continuing the trend of record-setting quarterly volumes this year and marking a notable 21% increase compared to the same quarter in the prior year. The report also highlights significant growth in domestic solar module manufacturing capacity, which increased by over 9 GW in Q3, reaching nearly 40 GW. This marks a substantial rise from less than 7 GW at the end of Q2 2022, before the introduction of domestic manufacturing and procurement tax credits under the IRA. Additionally, the first US cell manufacturing facility opened in Q3 marking a significant milestone in reshoring cell production for the first time since 2019. Utility-scale solar remained the largest contributor, with 6.6 GW installed in Q3, which signifies a 44% increase year-over-year and marks the highest third-quarter performance on record for the segment. As Donald Trump prepares for a second term as president, the future of the U.S. solar industry is a topic of significant interest. Trump’s campaign rhetoric has signaled intentions to bolster the fossil fuel industry, repeal Biden-era policies such as the IRA, and increase trade tariffs. In an interview with CNBC on November 9, John Berger, CEO of Sunnova, discussed the impact of a potential second Trump administration on the solar industry. Berger emphasized that the market is currently driven by wild speculation and emotional responses, but he believes that the fundamentals of the solar industry remain strong and the demand for energy is increasing, suggesting it could bring even more success and growth for the solar industry and his company. Berger addressed the speculation about future policy changes, particularly regarding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). He stated that the IRA is unlikely to change significantly, noting its success and the bipartisan support for domestic manufacturing, especially in the production of solar panels, batteries, inverters, and electric vehicles. He also stated that 85% of the plants that manufacture solar panels and batteries are located in Republican districts. Berger concluded by praising the IRA, particularly the tax credit for manufacturing (45X), which has played an instrumental role in growing and building domestic manufacturing plants in the U.S. Despite the potential for federal policy changes, the solar industry will undoubtedly play an increasingly vital role in global energy systems. To compile our list of the 10 best solar energy stocks to buy now, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners, clean energy ETFs, and online rankings to compile an initial list of 25 solar energy stocks. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 69 NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is a global leader in renewable energy, specializing in wind and solar power generation. The company operates through its subsidiaries, including Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy Resources. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is recognized for its massive investments in clean energy infrastructure and commitment to a sustainable future. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) is expanding its renewable energy portfolio by partnering with Phillips 66 to power its refinery in Rodeo, California with a new solar facility. This 30.2-megawatt solar plant, set to begin operations in January 2025, will be built on 88 acres of land adjacent to Phillips 66’s facility in the San Francisco Bay Area. The facility, consisting of more than 70,000 solar modules, is expected to generate around 60,000 megawatt hours of electricity annually. By reducing the refinery’s grid power demand by half and lowering carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 33,000 metric tons per year, the solar plant will play a crucial role in Phillips 66’s transition to more sustainable and renewable energy sources. NextEra Energy Inc.’s (NYSE:NEE) expertise in developing and operating large-scale solar projects positions it as a leader in the industry. The company is investing heavily in the development of new solar projects, with a focus on low-cost and battery storage. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) has also announced incremental framework agreements with two Fortune 50 customers for the potential development of renewables and storage projects, totaling up to 10.5 gigawatts till 2030. Overall, NEE ranks 2nd on our list of best solar energy stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of NEE to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The report also highlights significant growth in domestic solar module manufacturing capacity, which increased by over 9 GW in Q3, reaching nearly 40 GW. This marks a substantial rise from less than 7 GW at the end of Q2 2022, before the introduction of domestic manufacturing and procurement tax credits under the IRA. Additionally, the first US cell manufacturing facility opened in Q3 marking a significant milestone in reshoring cell production for the first time since 2019. Utility-scale solar remained the largest contributor, with 6.6 GW installed in Q3, which signifies a 44% increase year-over-year and marks the highest third-quarter performance on record for the segment. As Donald Trump prepares for a second term as president, the future of the U.S. solar industry is a topic of significant interest. Trump’s campaign rhetoric has signaled intentions to bolster the fossil fuel industry, repeal Biden-era policies such as the IRA, and increase trade tariffs. In an interview with CNBC on November 9, John Berger, CEO of Sunnova, discussed the impact of a potential second Trump administration on the solar industry. Berger emphasized that the market is currently driven by wild speculation and emotional responses, but he believes that the fundamentals of the solar industry remain strong and the demand for energy is increasing, suggesting it could bring even more success and growth for the solar industry and his company. Berger addressed the speculation about future policy changes, particularly regarding the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). He stated that the IRA is unlikely to change significantly, noting its success and the bipartisan support for domestic manufacturing, especially in the production of solar panels, batteries, inverters, and electric vehicles. He also stated that 85% of the plants that manufacture solar panels and batteries are located in Republican districts. Berger concluded by praising the IRA, particularly the tax credit for manufacturing (45X), which has played an instrumental role in growing and building domestic manufacturing plants in the U.S. Despite the potential for federal policy changes, the solar industry will undoubtedly play an increasingly vital role in global energy systems.

Title: BlackRock Bets on Bitcoin: Is the US Dollar Era Over?

"The rewiring of globalization is also playing out in reserve currencies," writes Tom Donilon, Chairman of the BlackRock Investment Institute. "As the world divides into competing blocs, and the US and Western governments lean on sanctions and other restrictions, some countries are shifting their reserves out of US dollars into gold and other assets, while increasingly conducting trade finance in non-dollar currencies." "As others have learned through history it is dangerous for private investors to challenge governments. That said, George Soros broke the Bank of England [in 1992] so, perhaps, a firm like BlackRock will believe it can profit from breaking over-leveraged nations that today still have 'hard' fiat currencies," Ortel concludes, referring to the 1992 sterling crisis which was estimated to have cost the British Treasury over $3.7 billion.

Title: Fintech Wrapped: Three Surprising Things That Happened In Fintech In 2024

Full Content:
Fintech wrapped for 2024 It’s always fun to do a retrospective on the year. 2024 was a year of surprises for the fintech sector. Some trends cooled. Others reignited with fervor. From a crypto renaissance in recent months, a continued slow exit environment and important shifts in emerging markets, 2024 was also a year of transformation. Here are three trends that stood out. 2024 witnessed a dramatic rebound in the cryptocurrency market. Despite a recent pull-back, bitcoin hit $100K, shattering previous highs, driven by institutional interest, macroeconomic factors and the US election. Beyond political speculation, one real driver is growing institutional interest. Nearly half of traditional hedge funds reported exposure to digital assets in 2024, up from 29% in 2023. Among these, 33% plan to increase their crypto investments by year's end. Retail investors can now access crypto more easily. U.S. regulators approved several Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock recommends bitcoin portfolio weighting of up to 2% for interested investors. Central banks are also continuing to experiment in the space. Approximately 134 countries, including across the G20, are exploring digital versions of their currencies. Major economies like India and Brazil moved from pilots to early-stage implementation of CBDCs. Perhaps most interesting is that blockchain technology may be finding its first real use case (beyond speculation of future use cases): stablecoins. The market cap of commodity-backed stablecoins hit $1.3 billion as of August 1, 2024. This is being driven by use in ecommerce, remittances and treasury. This was one of the big stories coming out of Money 2020 this year. 2024 was certainly the year crypto came back, with new real applications emerging. Despite signs of economic recovery, fintech IPOs were nearly non-existent. Companies like Stripe and Klarna, expected to go public, opted to delay due to market volatility. However, things might change. A number of companies are predicted to go public in 2025. At Money2020 this year, one of the buzziest topics was who would be the most likely next IPO. Scott Sanborn predicted Stripe and Chime (which received a few other votes) as likely candidates, while Sandy Kimura of Money Forward suggested Klarna and Plaid (note Chime is a former portfolio company). Despite the dearth of IPOs, the exit markets were still active, particularly in strategically minded M&A transactions and other deals. The most significant deals were in the payments sector, including Capital One Financial Corp.'s $35 billion proposal to acquire Discover Financial Services and an investor group's $5.04 billion plan to take Canadian payments firm Nuvei Corp. private. Crypto & stable coins were also not left out. BRD-GE, a stablecoin infrastructure provider was acquired by Stripe for over a billion. 2024 reaffirmed that innovation thrives outside traditional hubs, particularly in emerging ecosystems. Emerging market fintech innovation is arguably most strongly seen today by the government. Real-time money transfers continue their march forward in emerging market – like India, Brazil and now a handful of other markets. The impact is clear. McKinsey & Co predicts the cash economy in many emerging markets like India, will decline from 23% today to less than 10% within this decade. Emerging markets have created regional powerhouses. Nubank is among the largest neobanks. Jio is building a multibillion-dollar ecosystem in India. Many are expanding across markets. Dlocal for example has scaled across South America, Africa, and Asia. We will see more of this over time. A number of sectors cooled, while others heated up. ESG-focused fintechs struggled as investor focus shifted away from sustainable investments, particularly in light of disappointing financial returns in 2023. Conversely, generative AI became fintech’s darling, driving personalized financial services, fraud detection, and operational automation. Examples include OpenAI’s collaboration with major banks for automated underwriting models. What I enjoyed was the comeback stories. For example, companies like Root and Dave, once fintech darlings, found themselves in the doldrums at the beginning of the year. In January, Root traded under $10/share (down from over $350 at its peak). The company grew its stock price 7x this year to over $70 as of writing. Hippo, the home insurance provider, similarly scaled from under 10 to nearly $30 today (source Yahoo Finance). 2024 was a year of unexpected twists in fintech. But like some of the stock and crypto prices, fintech has gone from down-and-out category, to a core investment area. As we look to 2025, the stage is set for further surprises in an industry that never stays static for long. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Why New Gold Inc. (NGD) Is One of the Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Gold Royalty and Small-Cap Gold Stocks to Buy. In this article, we are going to look at where New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) stands against other best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. The U.S. Federal Reserve now anticipates just two interest rate cuts next year, a reduction from the four previously forecasted in September, due to inflation concerns and the potential economic impact of President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed trade tariffs. On November 18, in the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s announcement, the U.S. dollar surged, with the dollar index reaching a two-year high. This rally placed downward pressure on gold prices, which fell 2% to their lowest levels in a month. Traditionally, a stronger dollar and higher U.S. Treasury yields make gold less attractive as an investment. However, analysts suggest that these traditional relationships between gold, the dollar, and interest rates have become less predictable in recent years. In an interview with CNBC on December 18, Thomas Rupf, Chief Investment Officer and Head of Trading at VP Bank Asia provided detailed insights into the current market conditions and future projections for the U.S. dollar and gold. Rupf acknowledged the resilience of the U.S. dollar and attributed it to the perception of the continued strength of the U.S. economy. However, he also pointed out that the U.S. dollar is currently overvalued and expects the US economy to slow down, which could contribute to a weaker US dollar by the end of next year. Regarding gold, Rupf is optimistic and noted that the potential slowdown in the US economy and dollar as well as the ongoing trend of de-dollarization are all bullish factors for gold prices. He mentioned that ETF flows, which are still 20% below historical levels, indicate that there is significant room for retail investors to increase their investment in gold ETFs. Rupf concluded by agreeing that gold prices could realistically reach $2,800 to $2,900. He also mentioned the possibility of gold reaching up to $3,000, which he considers the top end of his forecast. Gold has historically been recognized as a reliable investment, known for its enduring value and resilience against economic uncertainties. This precious metal has been a cornerstone in many diversified investment portfolios, offering a sense of security and stability in times of financial turmoil. To compile our list of the 10 best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy, we used Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, financing, or sale of gold and have a market capitalization between $200 million and $10 billion as of December 23. Then we used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do?

Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 23 Market Capitalization as of December 23: $1.98 Billion New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is a prominent intermediate gold mining company with a diversified portfolio of high-quality assets across North America. The company operates two flagship mines: Rainy River in Ontario, Canada, and New Afton in British Columbia, Canada. New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) prioritizes exploration to generate additional value and extend the operational life of its mines. At Rainy River, the company has identified promising opportunities in the main pit and several smaller satellite pits. These prospects could further extend the open-pit mine’s life while minimizing capital expenditures. At New Afton mine, New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is focusing on optimizing the C-Zone, the fourth block cave at the mine, and advancing the technical study for the East Extension, which has the potential to introduce a high-grade zone in the mine’s eastern section. New Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:NGD) is also advancing several critical projects aimed at boosting production capacity and improving cost efficiency. At the C-Zone, the company has successfully commissioned the gyratory crusher and conveyor system, eliminating the need for truck haulage. At the Rainy River Mine, efforts are concentrated on developing the Underground Main Zone, the second and much larger sector of the mine compared to Intrepid. The Underground Main Zone is slated to begin production in the first half of 2025 and is expected to ramp up to processing 5,500 tonnes of gold ore per day by 2027. Overall, NGD ranks 2nd on our list of best gold royalty and small-cap gold stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of NGD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Serious $4.1 Trillion 2025 Fed Warning Sparks $20,000 Bitcoin Price Crash Fear

Bitcoin has dropped back from its all-time high of over $100,000 in the last week as BlackRock quietly confirmed a worrying bitcoin bombshell. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has plunged toward $90,000 per bitcoin, with the Federal Reserve's "biggest nightmare" weighing on the crypto market. Now, as Donald Trump confirms he has huge plans for bitcoin, a financial analyst has warned a $4.1 trillion drop in the global money supply could be about to trigger a bitcoin price crash of $20,000. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has overseen a $4.1 trillion drop in the global money supply, ... [+] something some fear could cause a bitcoin price crash. "In the past, bitcoin prices have followed global money supply with ~10 week lag," analysts with The Kobeissi Letter posted to X, asking: "Is bitcoin overdue for a correction?" Kobeissi analysts pointed to the money supply dropping by $4.1 trillion, to $104.4 trillion, the lowest since August, after hitting a peak of $108.5 trillion in October. "If the relationship still holds, this suggests that bitcoin prices could fall as much as $20,000 over the next few weeks. Bitcoin's red hot run may take a pause." The Federal Reserve, which controls the money supply through monetary policy, has been fighting to keep a lid on inflation this year while also attempting to bring down interest rates to prevent the economy falling into recession. Last week, the Fed cut interest rates by a well-telegraphed 25 basis points despite prices beginning to rise again but signaled it will move more slowly along next year's expected path of rate cuts. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged to record highs of over $100,000 per bitcoin this year, a huge rally ... [+] that's led to fears of a looming bitcoin price crash. The Fed's "economic outlook and chair Powell's press conference suggested that inflation is going to be stickier than previously thought. This means that they will proceed with the current rate cut cycle slowly and with caution to inflation, which seems to be re-accelerating for the past couple of months," Yuya Hasegawa, bitcoin and crypto market analyst with Tokyo-based Bitbank, said in emailed comments. "There also is a chance for Fed to stop cutting rates sometime during 2025 if inflation becomes too hot, and in the worst case scenario, they might start raising again. Monetary easing has almost always favored the price of bitcoin, and the opposite has negative impact on the price." U.S. debt has soared over recent years, topping $34 trillion at the beginning of 2024, with Covid and lockdown stimulus measures contributing to massive government spending and helping to send inflation spiraling out of control in 2022. Inflation of over 10% forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip, pushing up debt interest payments and fueling fears of a "death spiral." "While Fed's potential policy shift will likely put pressure on bitcoin, high interest rates will keep pressure on the government's debt payments as well," Hasegawa said. "The ballooning Federal government debt is already raising the question about its sustainability and the government's credibility could gradually become one of the topics that the market will pay attention to in 2025."

Title: Elon Musk's xAI raises $6 billion in fresh funding: 'We are gonna need a bigger compute!'

Elon Musk's xAI has completed its Series C funding round, raising a total of $6 billion, it revealed in a Monday blog post. Musk's artificial intelligence company said the participants included a16z, Sequoia Capital, Morgan Stanley, BlackRock, Fidelity, Saudi Arabia's Kingdom Holdings, Oman and Qatar's sovereign wealth funds, California-based Lightspeed Venture Partners, Chicago-based Valor Equity Partners, Dubai-based Vy Capital, and UAE-based tech investor MGX. xAI added that chipmakers Nvidia and AMD took part as strategic investors and "continue to support xAI in rapidly scaling our infrastructure." Musk shared the news on his X platform, writing, "A lot of compute is needed." He also tagged xAI in a meme generated by xAI's Grok chatbot that riffed on a famous line from the movie "Jaws." “We are gonna need a bigger compute!”@xAI https://t.co/ckc78vJhL6 Musk was likely underscoring the vast amount of processing power needed to train and run AI models, which has fueled enormous demand for microchips and underpinned a roughly eightfold rise in Nvidia stock since the start of 2023. xAI, founded in March last year, raised $6 billion at a post-money valuation of $24 billion in its Series B round in May. The Wall Street Journal reported in late November that it had raised a further $5 billion at a $50 billion valuation. It appears xAI ultimately raised a bigger round of $6 billion, but the valuation wasn't disclosed. The startup highlighted its progress since May in its blog post, including its launch of Colossus — the world's largest AI supercomputer powered by 100,000 Nvidia Hopper GPUs, which xAI plans to double in size to 200,000 chips soon. xAI also released version two of Grok, an application programming interface (API) for developers to build on its platform, its Aurora image generation model for Grok, and Grok on X. The company said it's training Grok 3 and "focused on launching innovative new consumer and enterprise products that will leverage the power of Grok, Colossus, and X to transform the way we live, work, and play." Musk's fledgling business said it would use the Series C funds to accelerate its infrastructure growth, ship new products, and speed up its research and development of tech that will enable its "mission to understand the true nature of the universe."

Title: House Judiciary Committee sends letters to investment firms tied to ‘woke ESG cartel’

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/24/2024 2:23:00 AM PST by Libloather The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee took aim at a group of US asset managers over their involvement with a “woke ESG cartel” — adding pressure against environmental efforts by large investors. The committee, chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, sent letters to 60 firms — including BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — that are members of the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, or NZAM, an international group of investors that signed on to a pledge to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The letters, sent Friday, made claims in line with a committee report released on Dec. 13 that Republicans say showed fund firms colluded to cut emissions. That report found that top asset managers in the US were concerned that signing up for an industry climate initiative would make them look like they worked too closely together and attract regulatory scrutiny. The committee’s Democrats have dismissed such claims, and big fund firms have denied similar charges. Jordan alleges in the letter that that companies’ efforts with NZAM and the affiliated Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero “may violate U.S. antitrust law,” citing the earlier report. It asks for information such as how companies’ participation in NZAM changed their stewardship strategies. GOP Judiciary Committee members claim that investor preoccupation with environmental, social and governance (ESG) strategies takes the focus away from delivering profits for shareholders and imposes unnecessary restrictions on business. Republicans previously have taken credit for prompting three fund managers — BlackRock, State Street and JPMorgan Asset Management — to step back from another investor group, the Climate Action 100+.

Unlike traditional for-profit investment firms, Vanguard operates as a mutual company, where the company itself is owned by the funds it manages, and those funds are in turn owned by the investors in those funds. This structure allows Vanguard to focus on benefiting its investors, as the profits from the company are used to reduce costs for fund shareholders rather than being paid out to external shareholders or owners.

Title: Jim Cramer on Reddit (RDDT): ‘I Don’t Know What To Do About It’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Calls Before 2025 Begins: Top 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) stands against other stocks in Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. Jim Cramer in a latest program talked about the market reaction to the Federal Reserve’s latest rate cut and its guidance that suggested fewer rate cuts moving ahead. “I guess you could say the baby got thrown out with the bathwater. It was truly hideous, a little unexpected, and yes, wicked. Even though the market’s barely oversold, we may not get that quick snapback we normally expect in a deeply oversold market,” Cramer said. Jim Cramer said Jerome Powell’s comments and tone were “stern” and his conference call “confounded” investors. Cramer said inflation has not come down enough and that has made the Fed’s job difficult. Cramer then talked about different sectors and companies that need rate cuts amid a slowdown. “I really wish the Fed hadn’t been so defensive about the need to cut rates going forward. A slower approach would have been much better. If they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting, we’d be in a better position. This time, they telegraphed the wrong thing, hence today’s meltdown. However, if the weaker part of the economy deteriorates further or inflation comes down, the Fed still has room to cut. Here’s the bottom line: a previously data-dependent Fed chose not to be data-dependent today with its pronouncements, and that’s what drove the market down. This happened despite the quarter-point rate cut—something that’s typically good news for stocks—but it turned out to be the very opposite.” READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we watched some latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 11 stocks he is talking about. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

In a latest program, Cramer said: “I like Reddit, but you know what? Reddit now has a parabolic chart, and I don’t know what to do about it. It’s just going bonkers, and I wish it had a pullback before I could recommend it. It’s an extraordinary chart, but it has just moved up too much.” With over 80 million daily active users, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) remains one of the fastest-growing social media platforms in the world. While Facebook and Twitter show signs of maturing growth, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT) still has huge upside potential as more and more people flock to Reddit discussion boards for authentic opinions and discussion. User input from millions of people on various topics freely accessible to anyone is Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT)’s moat. As of 2023, users posted 16 billion comments on the platform, according to the company. That’s why companies are flocking to pay money to Reddit to use its data to train their AI models.

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 43 Jim Cramer in a latest program analyzed why Wall Street missed the Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PLTR) rally and how the company defies conventional valuation models. “It has a tremendous business model that could change the entire Defense Department budget, but in some ways, Palantir is a renegade company playing by its own rules. Like AMC, the theater chain, the CEO actually caters not to Wall Street but to Main Street individual investors. What makes Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) one of the top AI stocks? Its technologies are actually solving the problems of businesses. Palantir’s data technology Ontology is solving the famous hallucination problem for AI systems, thanks to the company’s years of experience with military and defense systems. Earlier this year at an event with customers, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) shared some specifics on how its customers are being able to reduce costs and increase profits due to its artificial intelligence platform (AIP) that was launched about a year ago. Airbus accelerated A350 production by 33%, BP reduced costs per barrel by 60%, and Jacobs Connect cut power usage by 30%. Panasonic decreased waste by 12%, ESI Group sped up ERP harmonization by 70%, and PG&E reduced transformer ignitions by 65%. Eaton boosted productivity by 25%, while Tyson Foods achieved $200 million in cost savings. Fidelity Growth Strategies Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Untimely ownership of Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) (+47%) also hurt the fund’s relative result. This software and services firm, which operates in both government and commercial segments, saw strong growth during the quarter, largely driven by its “AIP” – or Artificial Intelligence Platform – offering. In early August, the company reported Q2 financial results that mostly met somewhat lofty expectations. We established a sizable holding in Palantir Technologies during the quarter, and at quarter end it was the second-largest position and a slight overweight.” Overall, PLTR ranks 8th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins.

A Ford truck roaring down a highway, with powerful headlights blazing its way. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 36 Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC expressed his concerns over rising warranty costs of Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and said the stock does not have a lot of “MOJO.” “Ford does not have a lot of mojo in this note by Jefferies. This is one of the reasons—what can save the Fed when they cut. Ford has an inventory drifting up to 96 days. That says to me price cut, way too much, way too much. And by the way, that’s far more than GM—26. Wow. I mean, GM and Stellantis have much lower inventories.” Ford shares have gained about 10% over the past 10 years, a stark contrast to the S&P 500’s 250%. Legacy automakers like Ford are grappling with challenges from newer competitors, the shift to electric vehicles (EVs), and the rapid rise of autonomous technology. Ford’s Model e segment continues to drain cash as Ford works to strengthen its EV business. While the company has some strong products, it faces stiff competition from Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Rivian Automotive, Inc. (RIVN), and other EV makers, leading to significant losses. Year-to-date, Ford’s EBIT has dropped to $8.1 billion, down from $9.4 billion in the same period last year. Ford’s struggle to reduce warranty costs remains a concern. The company issued 62 recalls in 2024, far surpassing General Motors Company (GM), which had 33. Since 2021, Ford has had the industry’s highest recall rate, reflecting poorly on management’s efforts to lower warranty expenses and damaging the brand’s reputation. Overall, F ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer’s latest calls before 2025 begins. While we acknowledge the potential of F, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Biggest Gainers of Last Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Quantum Computing Inc. (NASDAQ:QUBT) stands against other biggest gainers of last week. Investors gobbled up shares of predominantly technology companies last week, following announcements of multi-billion dollars of investments, quantum technology backing, and new contracts, among others. Let’s take a look at last week’s Top 10 Gainers and explore the reasons behind their impressive performance. To come up with the biggest winners of last week, we considered only the stocks that have at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A data analyst pouring over a chart, the intricacies of its lines being revealed. Shares of Quantum Computing posted the highest gains in last week’s trading, recording a whopping 147 percent to end at $17.62 apiece on Friday versus the $7.12 registered on Monday. Quantum Computing posted notable gains last week after announcements that the company secured a contract from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center for its imaging technology called Dirac-3. Financial terms were not disclosed. Similar to IonQ and Rigetti, Quantum Computing posted notable gains following news of further advancements in the quantum industry, led by Google’s Willow chip. Momentum for quantum computing is also accelerating fast, with US lawmakers announcing a $2.7 billion government funding to supercharge quantum innovation across computing, sensing, and communications. Overall, QUBT ranks 1st on our list of biggest gainers of last week. While we acknowledge the potential of QUBT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than QUBT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: People With Extreme Wealth Should Give It Away—or Be Penalized

If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Please also consider subscribing to WIRED In 2024, wealth concentration rose to an all-time high. According to Forbes’ Billionaires List, not only are there more billionaires than ever—2,781—but those billionaires are also richer than ever, with an aggregate worth of $14.2 trillion. This is a trend that looks set to continue unabated. A recent report from the financial data company Altrata estimated that about 1.2 million individuals who are worth more than $5 million will pass on a collective wealth of almost $31 trillion over the next decade. Discontentment and concern over the consequences of extreme wealth in our society is growing. Senator Bernie Sanders, for instance, stated that the “obscene level of income and wealth inequality in America is a profoundly moral issue.” In a joint op-ed for CNN in 2023, Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee and Disney heiress Abigail Disney wrote that “extreme wealth inequality is a threat to our economy and democracy.” In 2024, when the board of Tesla put to vote a $56 billion pay package for Elon Musk, some major shareholders voted against it, declaring that such a compensation level was “absurd” and “ridiculous.” In 2025, the fight against rising wealth inequality will be high on the political agenda. In July 2024, the G20—the world’s 20 biggest economies—agreed to work on a proposal by Brazil to introduce a new global “billionaire tax” that would levy a 2 percent tax on assets worth more than $1 billion. This would raise an estimated $250 billion a year. While this specific proposal was not endorsed in the Rio declaration, the G20 countries agreed that the super rich should be taxed more. Progressive politicians won’t be the only ones trying to address this problem. In 2025, millionaires themselves will increasingly mobilize and put pressure on political leaders. One such movement is Patriotic Millionaires, a nonpartisan group of multimillionaires who are already publicly campaigning and privately lobbying the American Congress for a guaranteed living wage for all, a fair tax system, and the protection of equal representation. “Millionaires and large corporations—who have benefited most from our country’s assets—should pay a larger percentage of the tab for running the country,” reads their value statement. Members include Abigail Disney, former BlackRock executive Morris Pearl, legal scholar Lawrence Lessig, screenwriter Norman Lear, and investor Lawrence Benenson. This story is from the WIRED World in 2025, our annual trends briefing. Another example is TaxMeNow, a lobby group founded in 2021 by young multimillionaires in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland which also advocates for higher wealth taxation. Its most famous member is the 32-year old Marlene Engelhorn, descendant of Friedrich Engelhorn, founder of German pharma giant BASF. She recently set up a council made up of 50 randomly selected Austrian citizens to decide what should happen to her €25 million inheritance. “I have inherited a fortune, and therefore power, without having done anything for it,” she said in a statement. “If politicians don’t do their job and redistribute, then I have to redistribute my wealth myself.” Earlier this year, Patriotic Millionaires, TaxMeNow, Oxfam, and another activist group called Millionaires For Humanity formed a coalition called Proud to Pay More, and addressed a letter to global leaders during the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Signed by hundreds of high-net-worth individuals—including heiress Valerie Rockefeller, actor Simon Pegg, and filmmaker Richard Curtis—the letter stated: “We all know that ‘trickle down economics’ has not translated into reality. Instead it has given us stagnating wages, crumbling infrastructure, failing public services, and destabilized the very institution of democracy.” It concluded: “We ask you to take this necessary and inevitable step before it’s too late. Make your countries proud. Tax extreme wealth.” In 2025, thanks to the nascent movement of activist millionaires, these calls will grow even louder.

Over the past several months, xAI has aggressively pursued funding to support its rapid growth and ambitious goals in the competitive AI landscape. In May, xAI announced its Series B funding round of $6 billion. Last night, xAI announced that it had closed its Series C funding round of $6 billion. Popular VC firms including A16Z, Blackrock, Fidelity, Kingdom Holdings, Lightspeed, MGX, Morgan Stanley, OIA, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Valor Equity Partners, and Vy Capital participated in this funding round. xAI also announced that NVIDIA and AMD participated in the round as strategic investors that will help them rapidly scale their AI infrastructure. As expected, xAI will use the funds to further improve its computing infrastructure, develop products, and accelerate the research and development of future technologies. xAI is also hiring aggressively to pursue its mission. Since its Series B announcement in May of this year, xAI has made the following progress: With this substantial investment, xAI is well-positioned to compete with other major players including OpenAI, Google and Meta in the AI landscape.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 17 Stocks After The Fed's Rate Cut. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. The Federal Reserve created quite a bit of turmoil in the stock market on Wednesday when despite cutting interest rates, it signaled to investors that the journey to low rates was far from over and would take longer than initially expected. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that "We have been moving sideways on 12-month inflation," and used the data observation to project two rate cuts in 2025 instead of the earlier four. In Squawk on the Street's episode the day after the Fed's rate cut, Cramer called the latest Fed outcome"a new phase in the process." He outlined that the Fed might have missed the mark in being data-dependent. According to him "Look I think that they are data dependent. But they made a prediction and the prediction was not right. They should have just stayed data-dependent. They could've looked at the long bond and realized, you know wait a second, we're on the wrong track here. And signal that. And they didn't signal it." Cramer was pressed about what Chair Powell got wrong, and in response, he shared that it was "The messaging. Right, because what happened is this that . . .we have a data-dependent Fed, and they chose not to be data-dependant." Cramer added that the apparent miss from being data-dependant meant that the Fed's "message was off. They're not wrong, but all the people who thought that they were gonna be kind and dovish, I mean they were, uh, black dovish." The morning show host also shared his thoughts about the current tussle in Congress related to spending bills and electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk's role in it. "Look they got a real guy, Musk. Do you want to mess with Musk? I'm not messing with Musk. I tried it once. I was pantsed. You don't want to be pantsed by this man," said Cramer. He added "But I do want to make a point that there are a lot of people who are hopeful that he can do something about that. The $36 trillion that we have." According to Cramer, to achieve the cut maybe Musk and his team "shame people, maybe he shames people who are giveaway guys," as he believes that "he [MUSK] represents this chain of thought in this country that there's hope. That this government can get its act together." Cramer's remarks in the morning show weren't the only ones covering the rate cut. Immediately after the cut, in Mad Money, he commented on Chair Powell "Because he seemed to get caught having to fulfill a prediction of the need for a rate cut, and that need was no longer self-evident. The data didn't back it up. It would have been much better off if they had explicitly taken a wait-and-see approach before this meeting. This time they telegraphed the wrong thing. Hence today's meltdown." Building on the comments, the next day he outlined "There were some very cogent questions at the press conference about whether, when you study it, after his statement, did they really need a cut? By their own admission? And, I think it confused people. It confused people because they cut rates and then gave exactly the, what I would call the [inaudible] for not cutting rates. David, this is that same problem that I keep saying which is that, if they had not set us up, not told certain people in the media, whatever, that we need a cut, and then they kind of like regretted it. And they regretted it because business is so strong, like GDP, inflation is a little bit higher." Cramer concluded by stating that he believes the Fed "got trapped, Jay got trapped." As for China, the CNBC host didn't mince any words either. According to him, China has "done nothing but build up" its military. Cramer does not trust the Chinese either. Quoting from the former Trump Administration's Secretary of Defense General Jim Mattis' book, Cramer shared that where "the Chinese meet with Obama and they agree to everything and it's really terrific and then they, a day later, they violate everything with the South China Sea." Situations like these make him "think that we've been taken advantage of." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC's Squawk on the Street aired the day after the Fed's rate cut. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Potatoes being sorted on a conveyor belt in a modern packing facility. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 37 Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) is a well-known American firm that sells french fries. It is one of the worst-performing stocks on the market in 2024 as the shares are down 42% year-to-date. Like Conagra, the firm has struggled with declining volumes due to consumers struggling with high inflation. However, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) has also dealt with rising potato prices, which a lawsuit claims stems from due actions of a 'potato cartel.' The firm is also purportedly part of this cartel. US potato production dropped to a new low since 2010 by June 2024 and prices had surged by 36%. Cramer's comments around Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:LW) revolved around management changes forced by activist investor Jana Partners: "What do they think the financial results are? What are the financial results of this man coming in. . . .of this change, the COO coming in [AS CEO]? . . . Disastrous! "Look, this company was doing better than its spin-off would have been, the company was spun off from Conagra. Uh, and I always felt, but hold on, wait a second, maybe Conagra should have kept french fries but in the end this is a company that is now worth $9 billion versus $12 billion when Conagra completely reversed. There was some way to make this company better. And you don't pick the guy who is part of the regime. Overall LW ranks 13th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of LW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI announced Monday it had raised $6 billion in a Series C funding round, with backing from major investors including BlackRock, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and other high-profile investors. Strategic investors NVIDIA and AMD also participated in the round, continuing their support for xAI’s infrastructure scaling efforts. The funding round was exclusive to xAI’s existing investors, many of whom had previously supported Musk’s acquisition of X, according to Financial Times. The latest financing, first revealed through a SEC filing last week, brings xAI’s total funding to $12 billion. It follows a previous $6 billion round completed earlier in 2024. According to CNBC, Musk’s AI business targets a valuation of around $50 billion, which would double its valuation six months ago. The fresh capital will be used to support the research and development of xAI’s generative AI model, Grok, and to expand its infrastructure, the team shared in the announcement. Since its Series B funding in May 2024, xAI has launched several key initiatives, including Colossus, which it describes as “the world’s largest AI supercomputer,” Grok 2, and the xAI API for developers. The company also introduced Aurora, its proprietary image generation model, and integrated Grok with the X platform to provide real-time information processing capabilities. xAI is currently training Grok 3, which it calls its “most powerful model yet.” The company aims for it to be comparable to or even surpass OpenAI’s GPT-5, with a focus on enhancing its capabilities in natural language understanding, image generation, and coding tasks. Musk anticipates that Grok 3 will be launched by the end of this year. Following its release, xAI plans to expand its infrastructure to include 200,000 GPUs, with the potential to scale up to as many as 300,000 GPUs in the future.
