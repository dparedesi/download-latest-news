Title: From Wild West to Wall Street: Crypto is boring now because ‘we won’

Once the Wild West of finance, crypto has matured into a Wall Street fixture with regulators and ETFs. We won. That’s why crypto is boring now. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Remember when Crypto Twitter was like taking a front-row seat to the movies? Markets were a runaway rollercoaster, narratives flipped like pancakes, and every week had the energy of a new heist movie. What happened? If you’re lamenting the days of God candles and 20% BTC pumps, Nic Carter wants you to smile through the tears: crypto is boring now because we won. From major exchange collapses to China bans, Elon Musk pumps to COVID black swans, it’s been quite a ride. Jamie Dimon lambasted Bitcoin as a “fraud” and threatened to fire anyone caught trading it at JPMorgan. Now the world’s biggest banks are stacking stablecoins, and even Dimon admits, “Crypto is real. Stablecoins are real,” as JPMorgan invites clients to post BTC and ETH as collateral for loans and launches its own blockchain rails. Are all the crazy days behind us now, and crypto is boring? Is it time to seek a new asset class for our thrills? Turns out, Gandhi’s saying, “first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win,” might fit crypto better than anyone expected.​ At the heart of the vibe shift is what Nic Carter nailed in a post on X. The reason the volatility has dampened is because we won. As he states: “Crypto is boring because so many of the open questions have been answered.” Gone is the existential guessing game about whether stablecoins will be banned or if writing smart contracts will get you thrown in jail. The old school volatility, the kind that made fortunes and wiped them out by lunchtime, came straight from regulatory Russian roulette and the sense that rules might change at any moment.​ Now? The GENIUS Act pins down rules for stablecoins, the Clarity Act sets out bright lines for what is a security and what isn’t. And even the question of crypto’s marriage with TradFi is a historical footnote, not a juicy risk premium. When you live in a world where holding T-bills on-chain is business casual and BlackRock’s ETF isn’t controversial, that means dampened volatility. Which means that crypto is boring. Even as price action grinds along, what used to be wild opportunity now feels, to many, like a playground being turned into a parking lot.​ As BTC analyst Will Clemente commented: “The vibes in the crypto groupchats that I’m in are just sad honestly, people completely giving up and pivoting to other asset classes if they haven’t already.” But Carter isn’t mourning. As he sees it, regulatory clarity, Wall Street adoption, and boring stability are proof that crypto won. The whole space has matured. What was once a technological risk-fest is now a “technological substrate” adopted by the world’s biggest firms. The new game isn’t about skirting the law; it’s about building products that actually generate value in clear daylight.​ Wall Street didn’t just join the party; it put on the DJ headphones. BlackRock. JPMorgan. Even Jamie Dimon’s about-face is now crypto lore. From denier to builder, the old guard’s pivot closes the loop on a playbook that once prioritized chaos and rewarded pirates. Now, crypto is boring. TradFi’s seriousness brings real capital, real custody, and real infrastructure. The legends of the wild west are being replaced by compliance teams, pension allocators, and crash-helmeted bankers. And that’s all great… except some of us miss the outlaws.

Title: When the wrench comes for the wallet: Why Bitcoin’s biggest believers are handing over their keys

Self-custody is under fire as wrench attacks become a real threat for crypto holders, with physical coercion and organized crime targeting those with on-chain wealth. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Welcome to Slate Sunday, CryptoSlate’s weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. Self‑custody was once the ultimate badge of credibility in crypto. A declaration of faith in sovereignty over convenience, code over blind trust, and cryptography over legal fine print. But for many of the space’s earliest and wealthiest adopters, that belief is starting to bend under a different kind of pressure: wrench attacks. In a world now flush with organized crime, doxxing, and $5 wrench attacks, even the most battle‑hardened Bitcoiners are locking away more than their coins; their ideology is going in the vault as well. A decade ago, wrench attack jokes circulated mostly in privacy forums. The meme, coined from a 2015 XKCD comic, encapsulates a brutal truth. You can’t brute‑force a passphrase, but you can threaten someone with a $5 wrench until they tell you it. OG Bitcoiner Jameson Lopp, co‑founder of Casa and maintainer of the “Physical Bitcoin Attacks” directory, has spent years documenting cases of wrench attacks where everyday crypto holders are beaten, held hostage, or worse because of their on‑chain visibility. The directory now lists more than 200 verified incidents spanning at least 34 countries. From European traders kidnapped at gunpoint to influencers targeted after posting wealth flexes online. As of October 2025, the directory records 52 wrench attacks this year alone (more than one per week), with overall physical assaults increasing 169% since February. In late October 2025, Russian influencer Sergei Domogatskii was kidnapped in Bali by masked assailants who tased and beat him, forcing him to transfer approximately $4,600 in crypto from his mobile phone to their accounts. This is part of a rising trend of wrench attacks in this region, as Lopp previously told me: “I’ve seen a number of attacks, for example, where Russian citizens who are either vacationing or living in Southeast Asia are getting hit by Russian organized crime. They’re coming into the country, wrench attacking them, and then trying to get out as quickly as possible, and presumably trying to leverage jurisdictional arbitrage.” Even veteran cypherpunks are taking notice. In a recent interview on What Bitcoin Did, on‑chain analyst Willy Woo admitted: “I’m not self‑custodying anymore… I think you’ll see a lot more people who’ve been in this space a long time doing the same.” Woo reinforced that smaller holders should absolutely keep control of their own coins, but large balances and public profiles create an entirely different threat model. It’s not about losing a hardware wallet anymore; it’s about personal safety. Many others share his view. The Bitcoin Family, known for selling everything to live off Bitcoin, told CNBC in June that they’ve abandoned single‑device wallets for a scattered analog‑digital fortress. They’ve split seed phrases and encrypted data across four continents. Family patriarch Didi Taihuttu said: “Even if someone held me at gunpoint, I can’t give them more than what’s on my wallet or my phone. And that’s not a lot.” Both Woo and Taihuttu were once among the poster children for full sovereignty. Their quiet retreat marks a broader sentiment shift (one now confirmed by the numbers). Somehow, Wall Street has managed to do what few thought possible: lure long-time Bitcoin whales into its regulated fold. According to a recent Bloomberg article, a new breed of discreet, ultra-wealthy holders is quietly offloading their cold wallets and moving billions into spot ETFs (sometimes without so much as a murmur on the blockchain). Thanks to “in-kind transfers,” these whales can dodge a taxable sale, swapping their BTC directly for ETF shares. BlackRock alone has taken in over $3 billion since July through this channel. Suddenly, what used to be a wild-west game of keys and ledgers is starting to look a lot more like traditional finance. All packaged up with a shiny ticker symbol and plenty of paperwork to go around. “This terrified me a bit,” commented Bitcoin advocate and human rights activist Alex Gladstein. For someone who’s spent his career documenting the way repressive regimes freeze assets and lock citizens out of the global financial system, watching Bitcoin drift toward mainstream financial custody feels like watching the escape hatch slowly close. Why? Because safety, reporting, and inheritance are finally trumping ideology. Srbuhi Avetisyan, research and analytics lead at Owner.One and co‑author of Penguin Analytics recently helped analyze 13,500 high‑net‑worth families across 18 countries. She shares: “At high balances, the risk isn’t blockchain failure—it’s physical coercion and OPSEC drift (lost seeds, single-point wallets). 87% of families keep incomplete asset records, and 99.4% lack a verified digital twin of their holdings. Crypto often disappears at incapacity/death—not from volatility, but from missing credentials and unclear rights.” For these families, ETFs and qualified custodians aren’t about giving in to TradFi. They’re about ensuring heirs can locate and transfer what might otherwise vanish. Still, not everyone’s ready to hand the entire stack back to banks. There’s a rising class of “hybrid” custodians building bridges between full self‑sovereignty and institutional protection. Seth for Privacy, vice president of the self‑custodial app Cake Wallet, says the wrench attacks problem doesn’t have to end self‑custody; it just forces it to evolve. He explains: “Crypto has become mainstream, and self-custody solutions have to keep up.” Beyond leveraging privacy tools, like Silent Payments and Payjoin, where possible, to keep their transactions out of public view, he believes the best protection for high‑profile individuals is to stop talking about their wealth. That was a point hammered home by Lopp, as well, who told me: “If you are on any sort of public network and you are flaunting your wealth, that’s one of the more risky things that you could be doing.” Seth points to Lopp’s company, Casa, Unchained, or some newer entrants like Nunchuk and Liana as examples of “collaborative custody.” These setups enable users to maintain control while distributing risk through multi‑signature arrangements, such as a 2‑of‑3 or 3‑of‑5 scheme, with a fiduciary or geographically separate co‑signer to remove the single point of failure. Anthony Yeung, chief commercial officer at CoinCover, also sees hybrid models as the pragmatic path forward. “Complete independence also comes with risk. If a private key is lost or compromised, the assets are often gone forever. A hybrid model addresses this by combining the best of both worlds: individuals retain direct control and ownership of their assets, while a trusted institution provides a safety net through secure backup and recovery mechanisms.” He calls this “a digital Fort Knox”: still user‑controlled, but institutionalized enough to enable secure backups, key recovery, and even inheritance triggers. Yeung adds: “They may well be the bridge that brings the next generation of users from web2 to web3.” Thomas Chen, CEO of Function and managing director at BitGo for six years, agrees, although he emphasizes personalization and risk tolerance. “I think a future for hybrid models ultimately depends on the user’s risk profile and what they’re comfortable with.” Those who self‑custody gain sovereignty but lose convenience, he says, particularly when they want to pledge assets as collateral, trade at scale, or interact with smart contracts in general. That’s not the experience that institutional investors want, and it may not be right for HNW individuals either. ETFs and custodial structures allow Bitcoin to act like a financial asset, not just a collectible. For institutions, that’s non‑negotiable. As Andrew Gibb, CEO of Twinstake institutional-grade, non-custodial staking platform, put it: “The custody landscape is shifting from the crypto-native ideal of total self-control toward models that match the risk appetite and operational rigor of institutional investors.” Fiduciary duty, in his view, forbids relying on untested personal key setups. Yet not everyone’s convinced this convenience is worth the compromise. Tony Yazbeck, co‑founder of The Bitcoin Way, offers a sharper take: “People love to overcomplicate this, but it really comes down to common sense. Some wealthy holders and institutions convince themselves they are safer putting their Bitcoin into ETFs or custodial accounts. They say it protects them from mistakes, inheritance issues, or even physical threats. In reality, it just hands control of the world’s scarcest asset to someone else and replaces ownership with paperwork.” Having lived through Lebanon’s banking collapse, Yazbeck warns that history has proven that third parties fail, exchanges collapse, governments seize assets, and custodians freeze withdrawals. His advice is refreshingly non‑technical. “The risk of losing your Bitcoin because you trusted a middleman is far higher than the risk of losing access to your own keys if you handle them properly. Multisig setups, secure backups, and simple operational discipline solve almost every real self-custody problem.” But the best defense? Once again, stop attracting attention to yourself. “Stay quiet about what you hold and live a normal life.” His mantra: protect privacy, take responsibility, and never outsource what Bitcoin was invented to make trustless. EY blockchain specialist Yaniv Sofer believes we’re witnessing a financial re‑tiering rather than an ideological rupture. He explains: “Financial institutions are accelerating their entry into digital assets use cases, and custody is a critical core capability.” While some firms buy access through third‑party providers like Fireblocks and BitGo, others build internal systems to integrate tokenization and payments. Sofer cautions: “Hybrid custody models have not yet gained significant traction among financial institutions but remain a topic of interest. Regulatory requirements for qualified custodians continue to favor centralized solutions… but hybrid models could emerge as a differentiator as the market matures.” In Avetisyan’s view, the long‑term equilibrium is clear. Most founders will run dual rails: core exposure in ETFs or qualified custody for reporting and collateralization, with a smaller self‑custody satellite for censorship resistance. This dual-rail system, she says, is already shifting how liquidity flows through the crypto economy. As more Bitcoin migrates to custodial wrappers, traditional funding markets gain depth and stability. The flip side? Sovereignty becomes optional, not default. Maybe what’s happening now isn’t so much an ideological defeat as a maturation. Bitcoin’s promise of self‑sovereignty remains intact for those who choose to uphold it. As the Bitcoin lead at Sygnum Bank, Pascal Eberle, comments: “The future of “Freedom Money” lies in choice – investors can opt for full self-custody, institutional-grade protection, or hybrid models that balance both.” Hybrid custody, institutional wrappers, and ETF liquidity are all symptoms of the same evolution: crypto crossing into the realm of structured finance. For early believers, that can feel like a betrayal, with self-custody becoming sidelined to the margins. As Yazbeck framed it: “Thinking you are safer by giving your Bitcoin to someone else is like a rich person surrounding themselves with a military convoy out of paranoia. It looks strong but it is actually weak.” Yet perhaps this is decentralization in action; a dispersion of risk, trust, and control according to every individual’s appetite. Each generation of holder must redraw its own line between freedom and fear. In 2025, that line runs straight through the vault door.

Title: How Fintech Is Redefining Retirement Planning For The Private Markets Era

ByIlona Limonta-Volkova, Contributor. Most Americans are preparing for retirement with yesterday’s tools. The rules of retirement planning are changing, but few have noticed. Financial innovation often promises greater access and equality, yet adoption rarely keeps pace with aspiration. A recent Harris Poll found that nearly 40% of Americans have never heard of private-credit funds, a class of alternative investments that Wall Street is racing to bring to 401(k)s. Only 10% say they want more nontraditional options in their retirement accounts. Yet once investors learn that most U.S. businesses generating over $100 million in annual revenue are privately held, nearly 60% say they would consider investing in them, and 90% would allocate part of their savings to private markets. It is not that Americans do not want these investments. They just do not know they exist. The disconnect between awareness and appetite points to a fundamental problem: the infrastructure to connect regular investors with private credit simply has not existed until recently. For decades, these investments remained locked behind institutional walls, accessible only to pension funds, endowments, and the ultra-wealthy. That is changing as technology platforms modernize an industry that has historically run on spreadsheets and handshakes. "Private credit shouldn’t be a black box," asserts Nelson Chu, co-founder and president of Percent, a fintech platform democratizing access to private credit markets. His company is one of several working to crack open what has long been an opaque, insider-only market. "By standardizing issuance and surfacing live order books and post-close surveillance, we've opened a historically institutional market to accredited investors with shorter durations, lower minimums, and clearer visibility into risk and cash flows." What Chu describes addresses one of the biggest obstacles to bringing these investments mainstream: transparency. Traditional private credit deals are typically opaque, illiquid, and require enormous capital commitments. Modern platforms are changing the equation by building digital infrastructure that brings efficiency and visibility to previously murky markets. This matters for a simple reason: 401(k) investors have watched their investment options narrow as the number of publicly traded companies has declined. Private markets now represent a vast universe of investment opportunities that most retirement savers cannot touch, even as their pension fund counterparts have loaded up on these assets for years. The irony is hard to miss. The investments deemed suitable for public pension funds are considered too risky or complex for the individuals those pensions serve. Earlier this year, federal agencies were mandated to ease regulations around alternative investments in retirement plans signals momentum toward broader access. Major asset managers, like Apollo and BlackRock, are already positioning themselves to capture a share of the $13 trillion 401(k) market. The race is on. Success will likely not come from regulatory approval alone. It will require building investor confidence through education and infrastructure. Companies like Percent in the U.S. and Germany's Exaloan are demonstrating that private credit can operate with the same transparency and efficiency that investors expect from their brokerage accounts. Exaloan provides data infrastructure and analytics that enable banks and asset managers to originate, assess, and monitor private debt portfolios with institutional-grade transparency. By digitizing loan-level data and standardizing reporting, platforms like these are proving that private credit can operate with the same clarity and efficiency investors expect from their brokerage accounts. "Retail investor appetite for alternative assets has accelerated dramatically," Chu explains. "We're seeing sophisticated investors, business owners, executives, professionals, actively seeking diversification beyond the 60/40 portfolio. They want assets that don't correlate with public markets, are designed to generate cash flow, and offer transparency into what they're investing in." The question is no longer whether these assets will enter 401(k) plans. It is how fast the system can catch up. The technology is in place, and investor appetite is undeniable. What remains is closing the knowledge gap and creating the transparency that builds lasting trust. This has the potential to redefine retirement planning. And for millions of Americans, that shift cannot happen fast enough.

Title: Hotels catering for families with autistic children: ‘Nobody looks or stares at you’

When Melanie* travelled abroad in July for a family holiday to Mallorca, Spain, with her six-year-old son Luke*, she found Dublin Airport stressful. Originally from Slovakia, Melanie, who works in finance, and her Irish-born husband have younger children – two-year-old twins – but Luke has profound autism and finds airports challenging. “You’re always worried there will be delays. You’re worried the plane could be sitting on the tarmacadam for three hours. If I have to keep him on a plane for five hours, he will probably walk off the plane. It’s too much,” she says. Luke has limited verbal skills and, in common with many autistic children, a tendency to abscond. “He runs away if he feels like it. One year when we were abroad we had to move chairs and luggage to block the door. The same goes for balconies.” Dining on holidays is difficult. “He’s very limited with his diet. He will eat chips or bologna sauce but the one I make because that’s the one he knows,” Melanie says. “So there’s anxiety around food because the food needs to be always the same. If it’s too much for him, he will lie down on the floor. It doesn’t matter where you are, he will just lie down. For us, it’s much easier to stay in Ireland.” For some families with autistic children, going on a break can feel harder than being at home. Lack of predictability, absence of routine and the anxieties and stress that may come with meltdowns in public settings can result in families avoiding holidays altogether. [ Why neurodivergent people are now coveted as highly skilled workers ] But as awareness has improved – it’s estimated one in 20 children in school today has an autism diagnosis – more hotels are retraining staff and improving facilities to cater to families with diverse needs. Adam Harris, of the autism charity AsIAm, which is working with hotels on training and awareness, says: “There’s an important momentum gathering. Contributing to that is our autism-friendly town initiative. Clonakilty, Maynooth, Drumcondra, Killarney and Waterford city have achieved the standard. Dublin city is working towards it. “There’s huge momentum and hotels are at the table in that regard. We’re in the process of doing accreditation with the whole iNua group,” which is Ireland’s largest regional hotel group, “so that’s exciting.” In Dublin, the Ashling Hotel on Parkgate Street, situated near the Zoo in the Phoenix Park and close to hospitals including St James’s, has 11 family rooms. Since 2023, one of these has been transformed into a sensory room, which is kitted out with mood cubes, weighted blankets, vibrating pillows and low levels of lighting. Ciara Barry of the Ashling says: “Some autistic people are sensitive to light, others to noise, others to touch. They’re able to sit down and just hug the pillow and it calms their nervous system.” Ashling staff have also received autism awareness training and the hotel endeavours to keep the same managers on rotation to welcome returning autistic children so they see a face they know. “They’re not just upgrades that we’ve done, they’re meaningful experiences for people under sometimes tough circumstances,” Barry says. The room rate (from around €260 for a family room per night) is the same as for other family rooms in the hotel, an important factor given it is estimated that it costs an additional €28,000 a year to raise an autistic child. “This isn’t something we wanted to financially benefit from. We just wanted to put something out into the community that’s needed,” she says. In developing their facilities, the Ashling took inspiration from other hotels around the country. “We were the first hotel in Dublin, but I linked up with the Pillo hotel in Meath – they were one of the first to implement a sensory bedroom – and the Radisson in Sligo have also done it,” Barry says. [ We need a more nuanced conversation about autism ] The hotel also worked with Keith O’Grady from Sensory House Ireland, which specialises in designing playrooms featuring everything from memory-foam bean bags to weighted teddy bears, lighted bubble tubes and projectors. These help to capture and regulate attention spans O’Grady says: “Ultimately you’re creating a space for calming within spaces like hotels, which can be over-stimulating, or anywhere with high footfall. We’ve done shopping centres, hospitals, the Curragh Racecourse, secondary schools like Blackrock College. “The most important things are to block out natural light and sound. People can be dysregulated by sunbeams hitting their eyes and fluorescent lighting can have the same effect. “The easiest way to explain to people is you’re trying to emulate the feeling of going into a spa. A relaxing environment with nice ambient lighting – that’s the effect you’re trying to create. You’re hopefully giving a space that they can go into, block out stimuli, and it gives them time to re-regulate themselves.” When it works, he says, families build trust with the hotels and come back time and again. “In the Ashling, people are coming back specifically to go to that hotel because they have that sensory bedroom.” It benefits all the family too, not just the autistic child, he says. “If families have a get-together, there might be only one autistic kid within the family, and it’s so they can go to that hotel, everyone can have a good time and it’s inclusive for everyone, the autistic person and not.” In Clonakilty, Co Cork, the Park Hotel and Fernhill House have evolved their offerings for neurodiverse guests. Irene O’Callaghan, of the Park, says: “We have sensory packs: the idea being that they have something to touch, something to smell and something to squeeze.” As soon as you mention that your child is autistic, it’s like ‘no problem’. Nobody looks at you or stares at you Because routine and predictability can be important, the hotel offers a picture guide of what to expect when guests are visiting for the first time. With staff trained in autism awareness, the hotel tries to anticipate issues before any arise. “During the week we had a lady whose child liked a specific kind of pancake. She told us that in advance so we were able to get them in. That really helps,” she says. In addition to family rooms, the Park has 20 apartments and six units that are fully self-catering. “We would have kids who would be flight risks,” O’Callaghan says. “In our apartments we have put additional locks on the inside, so we’ve those extra little mechanisms.” While not overtly geared towards those families, Center Parcs is a popular destination for parents with neurodiverse children – their self-catering lodges set across 400 acres in Longford Forest offer a soothing, low-stimulation environment. “I know many people say Center Parcs is very expensive, but my boy loves it,” Melanie says. “In the kitchen, I can make his meals. He learned to swim in Center Parcs because they have a slide where, to let you on, you have to be able to swim without a swimming aid. So he actually learned to swim from one side of the pool to the other so he could go down the slide. It was amazing. I never thought he would be able to swim. “There’s huge supervision there. As soon as you mention that your child is autistic, it’s like ‘no problem’. Nobody looks at you or stares at you.” For Etain*, an IT professional based in Dublin, who has four-year-old twin sons who are autistic, “the challenges come sideways at you”. Her twins were diagnosed in May, after they had started at preschool. “We just thought, ‘Oh my God, twins are complete chaos’. It took us a while to come around to the idea that our perfect little men might have been a bit different. “What we realised through that process was that we’d set up our life around the boys. Everything inside our bubble suited the boys. We had a nice routine. It was only when you went into the outside world that things got tricky.” The boys have differing needs and challenges. Noise can be a trigger: the white noise of hand-driers in public toilets or crying babies; big crowds another. When the family gets an invitation to go somewhere, Etain thinks long and hard about what’s best. “If it’s not something the boys are going to enjoy, we’re not just going to go so we have an Instagrammable photo.” She gravitates towards holiday homes in autism-friendly towns, where a minimum of 25 per cent of businesses in the town have undergone autism awareness training. “It’s definitely a plus,” she says. “It means you’re more likely to get a warm welcome from local businesses. If a child is finding a situation stressful, it means they don’t look at that child as a ‘bold child’.” When we speak, Etain is packing the car for Clonakilty for a family trip. “Clonakilty has a model railway village, which is a huge hit with our boys who love trains.” In their Airbnb, “the boys can see the sea from the garden. The garden is enclosed. I just love the freedom of them running around.” Having last visited at Easter, the twins have been excited about the upcoming trip for months. “The boys have had a 60-day countdown on the calendar on the fridge,” she says. Etain is willing to stay in a hotel with her sons, but it’s rarely her first choice. What would make a difference? “What hotels need to realise is parents don’t want to bring chaos. You’re not expecting people to roll out the red carpet, but small gestures like having quiet spaces or being accommodating if someone asks for a larger room, or getting your same table in the breakfast room – all those things make a difference. “In the La Mon outside Belfast, we get the same room every time we go. The hotel is spacious with a lovely quiet pool area and very warm, welcoming staff who remember the boys every time we visit, which is why we always go back.” Friendly staff, quiet spaces, a dedication to people’s needs: what’s not to like? Harris hopes more businesses will incorporate inclusive design and autism awareness training once they realise it’s an approach that makes sense for all. “Who doesn’t like clear communication? Who doesn’t like having predictability about what the experience is going to be like? Who doesn’t want to feel welcomed and not judged?” he says. “What is essential for an autistic family coming on holiday can actually be good for everybody.” *Some names have been changed. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: 3 Signs That Institutions Continue To Drive Crypto Adoption

BySean Stein Smith, Contributor. Despite the price of bitcoin still making headlines, states issuing dollar-backed stablecoins, and payments use cases dominating the conversation, there are substantial other headlines that investors might have missed in this flurry of activity. Particularly with the end of 2025 approaching, and with that the increased importance and focus of tax-related conversations, investors and advocates need to be especially vigilant to analyze institutional developments as well as what these deployments might mean for the wider marketplace. Another reason why certain investors and advocates might have overlooked the headlines below is the renewed focus that crypto hacks and breaches have brought to bear on the weaknesses that still exist within the marketplace. Be it the Bybit hack that exposed the dangers of institutionally backed hacking efforts, the debut of the film Code Is Law that examined the elements of the crypto landscape that believe regulatory safeguards are optional, or the billions lost through less spectacular hacking attempts the focus has rightly returned to cybersecurity, risks around client data, and the lack of insurance solutions for crypto products. In short, the tail end of 2025 has had a bevy of headlines (good and bad), policy updates and developments that have the potential to obscure just how widespread institutional adoption has become. Let’s take a look at some of those, as well as what the implications might be for investors and advocates alike. According to several sources, Mastercard is in late-stage talks to acquire stablecoin infrastructure platform Zerohash for nearly $2 billion, and while this specific acquisition is not finalized as of this writing, it is indicative of how payment processing giants are prioritizing stablecoins and on-chain payments. Stablecoins have been in the spotlight recently, with a number of recent wins on the policy front as well as the deployment of stablecoin/stabletoken solutions by several major TradFi institutions. With adjusted annual volume of approximately $9 trillion, taking into account bot-based trading and other potentially artificially inflated trading activity, the sheer size of the stablecoin payment space is appealing to the payment processing space. Even as margins continue to face headwinds from a competitive and legislative point of view, stablecoins have the potential to open up an almost entirely new market for payment processors to expand. Bringing together the familiarity and security that customers have come to expect from household names such as Mastercard with the crypto-native improvements delivered via stablecoins is looking like the “killer-app” that crypto has been looking for. Another payment processing giant, Visa, is also expanding its product and service offerings focusing on stablecoin utilization and payments running on four unique blockchains. Visa CEO Ryan McInerney reiterated the firms commitment. As these new services come online, Visa will have added support for four stablecoins running on four blockchains that will be able to converted into 25 fiat currencies. This announcement expands the support that Visa already provides to other stablecoins including USDC, Euro Coin (EURC), PayPal USD (PYUSD) on multiple blockchains. According to Visa the firm has facilitated $140 billion worth of stablecoin flows since 2020, further cementing the reality that stablecoins have 1) grown rapidly in terms of institutional usage, 2) taken center stage as the “every day” crypto use case, and 3) delivers quantifiable benefits to organizations involved in the transactions. This announcement is the foundational layer for other forthcoming efforts that will allow more banks and TradFi institutions to provide stablecoin related services, including the eventual ability of banks to mint and burn native stablecoins on the Visa tokenized asset platform. Visa continues to move to integrate TradFi banking products and services with the crypto-native space, and is another example of stablecoins are leading the effort to bring crypto to the mainstream via stablecoins. The global asset management giant Blackrock has certainly made its presence known in the crypto marketplace, with its leading spot bitcoin ETF having attracted over $100 billion in assets. Additionally, a recent announcement that Securitize (a Blackrock-backed tokenization firm) will be going public via a SPAC deal valued at $1.25 billion cements. The fact that the merger will occur with an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald, itself a longtime service provider to Tether and the USDT token, cements the pivot of Wall Street to the tokenized ecosystem. Since Securitize operated in the real-world-asset tokenization space, a sector that Blackrock CEO Larry Fink has forecasted could hit a size of $10 trillion, the implications of this merger are significant. Tokenization or RWA is a pivotal part of the forecasted growth of DeFi systems, DAOs, and other blockchain-based applications built for enterprise use. Given the scope and scale of support provided by both Blackrock and Cantor Fitzgerald the effect of this listing are sure to be felt across the space. Crypto makes headlines on a daily basis, but sometimes the most significant ones can fly under the radar; those are the ones investors should be sure to watch.

Title: Mamdani’s God Squad: The clerics, activists and political operatives who have his back

Fox News' Bill Hemmer breaks down the latest on key races to watch nationwide, including the New York City mayoral election and the gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey. When New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani stepped to the microphone outside the Islamic Cultural Center of the Bronx last week near Yankee Stadium, his voice broke as he spoke about "the memory of my aunt who stopped taking the subway after Sept. 11 because she did not feel safe." Behind him, a Yemeni-American educator in sunglasses named Debbie Almontaser nodded. Almost two decades ago, in 2007, she was forced to resign as principal of a city school after defending a T-shirt with the slogan "Intifada NYC." City officials viewed it as a call to violence. She said it was benign. Her case became a rallying cry for Muslim American activists who cast her as a victim of "Islamophobia." FBI AGENTS FROM '93 WTC ATTACK BLAST MAMDANI FOR EMBRACING RADICAL IMAM Now, Almontaser was back, this time as a senior advisor to Emgage Action and a board member of Yemeni American Merchants Association Action, two of 110 political nonprofits, community groups and political action committees backing Mamdani as he alleges "Islamophobia" against him. Recently, when critics questioned Mamdani’s ties to hardline Brooklyn Imam Siraj Wahhaj, she sprang to action, helping to organize a protest to defend Wahhaj. That rapid, coordinated response captured the modus operandi of a network of political operatives and clerics intertwined with the shared mission of catapulting Mamdani into the mayor’s office. Mamdani’s background diverges from many of his co-religionists. In an interview, he said he is a Khoja Shia Muslim, part of a small, relatively liberal sect with roots in India. Many of his New York-area allies are religiously strict Sunni Muslims who practice more conservative interpretations of the faith. But they find common ground in politics. "It’s a sophisticated fusion of religion, politics and identity," said Mansour Al-Hadj, a Washington-based researcher on Muslim political movements and extremism. "The same networks that once focused on community services are now mobilizing voters and producing candidates. This is how political Islam adapts inside democracy." Mansour Al-Hadj, a Washington, D.C.,-based researcher on Muslim political movements and extremism, warns of radical forces backing Zohran Mamdani's bid to be mayor of New York City. (Mansour Al-Hadj) Mamdani’s God Squad includes about a few dozen key players who specialize in painting any critique as an attack on their faith, accusing critics of Islamophobia even as many of them have engaged in strident rhetoric against the U.S., Israel and capitalism. The Original Imam: America is "filthy and sick" Mamdani set off a firestorm Oct. 7 when he walked into Masjid At-Taqwa in Brooklyn and later posted a photo of himself beaming beside the mosque’s imam, or prayer leader, Wahhaj. Zohran Mamdani meets Imam Siraj Wahhaj and Yusef Abdus Salaam Oct. 17, 2025. (@ZohranKMamdani/X) The imam’s checkered past goes back decades. In a 1992 talk, he said American Muslims should elect an "emir" rather than choose between George Bush and Bill Clinton. Soon after, he served as a character witness in the trial of Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, the so-called "Blind Sheikh" convicted for plotting the 1993 World Trade Center bombing that killed six people. "You know what this country is?" Wahhaj said in 1995. "It’s a garbage can. Filthy. Filthy and sick." In 2018, three of Wahhaj's children were arrested after authorities found 11 malnourished children in a New Mexico compound tied to his family; a grandchild had died in what authorities described as an attempted exorcism. He told local news reporters, "Whatever they did wrong … it's not acceptable to us." The Youth Imam: Resist "by any means necessary" In New York, the Muslim American Society recently signed on to a letter to challenge "unmistakably Islamophobic, anti-Black, and xenophobic" attacks on Mamdani. Signatories included CAIR National, the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ New York chapter, Islamic Circle of North America’s New York chapter, the Islamic Center of Five Towns, Muslim American Society of New York, Muslim Community Network, Rockaway Islamic Center and a "Syosset Muslim Community." Members of the Muslim American Society have long been quick to accuse others of Islamophobia even as they unabashedly call for violence against their perceived enemies. At an Eid celebration earlier this year, a cleric at the Muslim American Society cast Muslims as victims worldwide. Mohammad Badawi, youth director at the Muslim American Society, declared the local community’s joy would only be complete when Muslims are "victorious worldwide," adding they would celebrate "after the destruction of the illegitimate Zionist occupiers," Israel. He regularly organizes anti-Israel protests in a campaign against "injustice and oppression." At one protest, Badawi urged youth to "fight back" against injustices "by any means necessary." Abdullah Akl, a charismatic organizer with the Muslim American Society Youth Center, leads many protests under the banner of "Within Our Lifetime," with founder Nerdeen Kiswani. Mamdani joined them before his run for mayor. Akl calls the street protests "sacred activism," a mix of faith and resistance that will "free Palestine." Since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the Muslim American Society Youth Center has organized prayer protests on Wall Street outside the New York Stock Exchange and street protests for "Nakba Day," calling the day Israel was created a "catastrophe," and youth-led demonstrations outside BlackRock. Akl turned a subway car into a protest zone with chants of "Globalize the intifada… There is only one solution: intifada revolution." When the New York Police Department arrested Akl and other activists, the Council on American-Islamic Relation’s New York chapter sent out a press release demanding their release. During the Oct. 7 protests this year against Israel, Akl shouted, "We did not act enough! We will show up, stronger than we did the first Oct. 7." In response to criticism, he posted a message on social media, doubling down and saying, "Saying we didn’t act enough to stop a full blown genocide against palestinians [sic] is incitement?? Saying we need to be louder and protest more and continue to speak up for gaza [sic] is a crime? Zionist tears once again for the most documented genocide in modern history." For decades, Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has served as an aggressive and litigious watchdog for a host of Muslim figures and causes, often at the forefront of fighting legitimate bigotry. But CAIR has also courted controversy. Federal prosecutors named CAIR an unindicted co-conspirator in a federal terrorism-financing case against the Holy Land Foundation, a nonprofit based in Texas. In 2008, five Holy Land leaders were convicted of funneling $12.4 million to Hamas. Ultimately, no CAIR officials were charged in the case. Years ago, Mamdani recorded rap lyrics celebrating the "Holy Land Five," urging listeners, "My love to the Holy Land Five. You better look ‘em up." Basim Elkarra, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations California chapter and one of the founders of a new 501(c)(4) nonprofit, CAIR Action Inc., now seems to be pursuing a new and entirely legal means of financing causes, taking a page from the powerful pro-Israel political action committee AIPAC. He told a meeting of the Islamic Circle of North America, "AIPAC has had the run for 60 years, but it is over now. "We will teach these folks a lesson … we are coming." In another speech, he said, "The game has changed. AIPAC has been around since 1961…and now they have a formidable foe!" This summer, Mehdi Hasan, a former host at Qatar’s Al Jazeera TV network, sat down with Mamdani for a sympathetic interview. As the campaign heated up, Hasan became a full-time defender on social media, swatting at critics and framing Mamdani as the right kind of provocateur, a "once in a generation political talent." Mehdi Hasan speaks onstage during the Crooked Media — Lovett or Leave It: Live on Tour, April 25, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Paul Morigi/Getty Images for Crooked Media) Hasan’s own record includes sermons likening non-Muslims to "animals" and comparing gay people to "sexual deviants." He has said his views have become more progressive since then. After a series of plane crashes earlier this year, Hasan wrote on social media, "Make American Planes Crash Again." He deleted the message amid criticism and said, "I deleted this sarcastic quote-tweet because MAGA and Islamophobic folks are clipping it out of context and trying to ridiculously suggest I’m inciting violence. I was obviously mocking the MAGA slogan ‘Make America… Again’ slogan and highlighting the shocking number of plane crashes under Trump and the FAA cuts. But this tweet was in poor taste, poorly worded, and has allowed people in bad faith to call me a terrorist…" Yasir Qadhi, a high-profile American imam and founder of the AlMaghrib Institute and MuslimMatters.com, selling the puritanical Salafi interpretation of Islam, literally wrote the book on "Understanding Salafism." Recently, he posted a two-part thread on X endorsing the idea of Mamdani’s win as a "civilizational victory." Yasir Qadhi, a high-profile American imam and founder of the AlMaghrib Institute and MuslimMatters.com, has encouraged support for Mamdani for his "courageous stand against Zionism," among other things. (Getty Images) He urged Muslim Americans to move beyond "naive" religious critiques of politicians who are more socially progressive than they are comfortable. Meanwhile, Qadhi once mocked European Jews as "white, crooked nose, blonde hairs" and "not a Semitic people." In the same lecture, he recommended a book, "The Hoax of the Holocaust." Most recently, he has backed the controversial Muslim housing development outside Dallas, "EPIC City." He noted in his Instagram post, "open to non-Americans as well." He touted some of its features, writing, "Islamic schools, college, masjid." Imam Khalid Latif is a popular chaplain at the Islamic Center of New York City, a $22 million project to build a hub and "our own space" on Sixth Avenue for young Muslim professionals. He endorsed Mamdani earlier this year and has been an ardent supporter. He has called him "a bearer of compassion in a time where it is far too rare." Imam Khalid Latif, shown here speaking at Lincoln Center in 2022, is the chaplain at the Islamic Center of New York City. He endorsed Mamdani earlier this year. (Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) In 2012, Latif led a pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia that included Omar Mateen, who would later murder 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the deadliest anti-LGBTQ attack in U.S. history. He has denied radicalizing Mateen, and he hasn’t faced the same type of allegations that surround other imams. After the backlash to Mamdani’s meeting with Wahhaj, he posted, "Happy birthday to my brother Zohran… Keep showing them who we are by showing them who you are." He invoked the divine to bless Mamdani’s mission, revealing the fusion of religion and politics for the Mamdani God Squad: "May your 34th year be one of clarity, courage, and closeness — to your purpose, your people, and your Creator," ending with the Arabic word for amen, "Ameen." On Monday, Latif posted a sassy video from the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, saying, "The name is Mamdani, M-a-m-d-a-n-i," with Latif mouthing the part where the narration turns to, "You should learn how to say it." That day, Latif delivered a speech to support Mamdani, pivoting to allege Mamdani was now a victim of "anti-Black racism," saying, "Anti-Muslim sentiment is always" a symbol of "anti-Black racism." In a glowing portrait, The New York Times called Palestinian American political organizer Linda Sarsour a "Brooklyn home girl in a hijab." Over almost a decade, she has been a political mentor to Mamdani, inviting him into the Muslim Democratic Club of New York, which she co-founded. She later endorsed his race for the New York General Assembly, which he won. Activist Linda Sarsour speaks earlier this year at the Lights for Liberty vigil held in protest of the Trump administration's ICE actions. (Erik McGregor/LightRocket via Getty Images) All the while, she has been a polarizing figure, once saying about two critics, author and ex-Muslim Ayaan Hirsi Ali and activist Brigitte Gabriel, "I wish I could take their vagina away - they don’t deserve to be women." Ali is a survivor of female genital mutilation, a practice that involves cutting the clitoris of a young girl with the idea that it will inhibit sexual promiscuity. As a co-founder of the Women’s March, Sarsour stepped down amid criticism of alleged antisemitism and not welcoming Jewish feminists who support the state of Israel, or "Zionists." At a rally on Sunday night with Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Imam Latif told 13,000 people, "This is our city. This is our moment." Some Muslims beg to differ. "It’s not our moment," said Al-Hadj. "Across the boroughs, the Mamdani God Squad is banging a drumbeat of grievance after grievance, from Staten Island to Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Long Island," he said. "Across the city’s Muslim institutions, you hear the same drumbeat: They smeared us. They silenced us. They fear us. "In that rising volume, something is lost: Muslim pluralism. The God Squad does not speak for every Muslim in New York — nor for every Shia, every Sunni, every immigrant family, or every second-generation kid trying to thread faith and freedom. It speaks for a coalition committed to illiberal ends, with socialist capture of city politics on the one hand and puritanical religious rhetoric on the other. They insist that to oppose them is to betray the community, so they actually push their own tyranny." Win or lose next week, Al-Hadj said, the Mamdani God Squad had actualized the words that had gotten Almontaser into so much trouble years ago: "Intifada NYC." Asra Q. Nomani is the author of "Woke Army: The Left-Green Alliance That Is Undermining America’s Freedom," and the founder of the Pearl Project, a nonprofit journalism initiative. She is co-founder of the Clarity Coalition and Muslim Reform Movement, opposing Islamic extremism and advocating for Muslim reform. She can be reached at asra@asranomani.com and @AsraNomani on X.

Title: Satoshi's Bitcoin Whitepaper Turns 17: From Cypherpunk Rebellion to Wall Street Staple
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/01/satoshi-s-bitcoin-whitepaper-turns-17-from-cypherpunk-rebellion-to-wall-street-staple
Time Published: 2025-11-01T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
The Bitcoin whitepaper, A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System, published by the mysterious and pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, turned seventeen years old yesterday. Released on Oct. 31, 2008, amid the global financial crisis, the nine-page document laid the foundation for what would become the world’s first cryptocurrency. The whitepaper outlined a vision for a decentralized, peer-to-peer financial system built on cryptographic proof rather than trust in third-party intermediaries. Its goal was to eliminate the problem of double-spending and enable online transactions without relying on banks or other trusted third parties. “We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust,” Satoshi wrote. Seventeen years later, Bitcoin’s influence has reached far beyond the cypherpunk forums where it began. The anniversary comes as U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs in less than two years of existence have experienced unprecedented success, seeing total net inflow of over $62 billion and total net assets exceeding $150 billion, according to SoSoValue data. But Bitcoin’s mainstream acceptance extends beyond Wall Street. It has now entered the highest levels of government, including the White House under the current U.S. administration. Some of Bitcoin’s most outspoken critics have become its biggest advocates. In 2021, former President Donald Trump dismissed Bitcoin as a “scam against the dollar.” Yet by the 2024 presidential election, he was urging supporters to “never sell your bitcoin” and went on to sign an executive order establishing a bitcoin strategic reserve. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock the world’s largest asset manager once called Bitcoin an “index of money laundering.” Today, he champions it as one of his firm’s most successful ETF products and views it as a hedge against sovereign debt instability.Likewise, Michael Saylor, the outspoken CEO of Strategy, has become one of Bitcoin’s most persistent evangelists, continuing to accumulate BTC through stock and debt offerings. Saylor himself began as a skeptic, once declaring, “Bitcoin’s days are numbered. It seems like just a matter of time before it suffers the same fate as online gambling.” The last major holdout among prominent financial figures remains JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who continues to voice doubts about Bitcoin’s value and sustainability. His bank though, has heartily moved into the sector, including recently allowing clients to pledge bitcoin as collateral. The financialization of bitcoin through ETFs and corporate treasury adoption has drawn comparisons to the mortgage securitization boom of the 1970s an era that saw asset prices soar to new heights. Yet this evolution has not pleased everyone. Many early Bitcoin believers argue that that its very ethos, a form of money outside the control of the state, has been diluted by institutional adoption. For the cypherpunk movement that birthed Bitcoin, the system’s embrace by Wall Street and Washington feels like a paradox: a rebellion absorbed by the establishment it once sought to disrupt. On an annual basis, the average transaction fee per bitcoin block has fallen to its lowest level since 2010, raising concerns about the network’s long-term sustainability. Low fees, while attractive for users, reduce incentives for miners who secure the network, especially as block rewards continue to halve every four years. Originally envisioned as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Bitcoin has increasingly been overshadowed by the “store of value” narrative. "Never sell your bitcoin," is a common refrain from Michael Saylor to the Trump family and many voices in between. At the same time, controversy continues within the developer community particularly between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots over whether the network should allow non-monetary data like Ordinals or enforce stricter rules to block it. Some see such restrictions as necessary to preserve the network’s integrity, while others view them as a form of censorship that alters bitcoin’s open and permissionless nature. Beyond internal debates, the looming question of quantum computing also poses an unresolved risk. The potential for future quantum machines to break existing cryptographic standards could threaten Bitcoin’s security, with no definitive solution in place yet. “It’s no doubt that Bitcoin has arrived, accepted by Wall Street, and its sustained period above $100,000 confirms that," said Bitcoin OG Nicholas Gregory recently. "Its transition from peer-to-peer cash to a store of value is evident," he continued. "It remains to be seen where it goes long-term. I, for one, think the narrative of it as a medium of exchange is key to its enduring place, along with solutions to the quantum threat."

Goooooooood Mooooooorning Fiatnam! It was painfully obvious what the extraterrestrials on board 3I/Atlas were thinking, they’d heard from across the universe about Bitcoin and were eager to invest, the blue light emanating from the spacecraft an attempt to fill a buy order, alas out of range yet. Could be. I heard they were arriving just in time for the Chiefs/Bills game. The plan was to land on the 50 yard line just before game time and auction off Gort to the highest bidder. Maybe to raise funds to buy that Crypto? …what sort of forty time does Gort got? When your reach extends from one sideline to another, and no one can block or tackle you, speed doesn’t matter much. And he can play both sides of the ball and never break a stretch. Try him at RB, TE, LT or DT. The Wunderwaffe of all time. Gamechanger! Wukchumni and Henry Moon Pie: klaatu barada nikto The interesting thing about the interpretations of 3I / Atlas is that the asteroid is beyond the Sun. So it is cutting through the solar system at a time when no one on Earth can see it — blocked by the Sun and too far away. And, yes, it has many weird qualities. “There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Milton Friedman, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” Nevertheless, it has also arrived at an astrologically volatile time. All of the majors — Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, and Jupiter have gone into (and sometimes out of) retrograde in the second half of 2025. Mercury is due to go into retrograde again on 10 November in Sagittarius, the sign that 3I / Atlas emerged from. This fashion mag gives a highly detailed horoscope: https://www.russh.com/every-retrograde-in-2025/ When the biggies — Jupiter, his brother Neptune, their dads Saturn and Uranus, gods of time — all move together, even the skeptics among us (and I’m fairly skeptical) should take notice. Some “deep astrologers” think that we are receiving a signal of moving collectively into a new epoch. So there is life after Trump Derangement Syndrome. Maybe Jupiter can detach the claws of Bill and Hillary from the Democratic Party. Is Zohran Mamdani a sign of a new age of Saturn, peace, prosperity, and low-cost groceries? The golden toilet in the White House remains unexplained. [I will consult my patron, Mercury, who is more or less in charge of grocery stores.] After 3I/Atlas touched down on the White House lawn and Atalasians emerged, an excited President Trump almost immediately slapped tariffs on them, claiming ‘they’ve been cheating earthlings for far too long…’ Well, there are serious matters afoot. My page shows the Galactic Council (a bunch of commies, for sure) as arriving and sorting this earthly human cesspool out. They will instruct us as to having empathy for all life. Obviously they haven’t heard of the “Dark forest” theory… “‘Sobbing daughter captures ICE ‘detain her mom for not having social security number memorized” I got an idea. All those emigrants could easily have their Social Security number tattooed on their lower arms and as it is only 9 digits, would not have to be big. That way if ICE pulls them up, they can proudly pull up their sleeves and show those agents their Social Security number as that seems to be the only number they are interested in. Any resemblance to this idea and a practise that was undertaken in Eastern Europe in WW2 is just a coincidence. Don’t give anyone in DC ideas. What! no bar code tattoo to expedite ICE processing? That will go on your neck and be your Permanent Record Identifier. According to the Department of Public Information, there is no truth to the rumour that the first three numbers of everyone’s PRI number will be 666. Stay safe, and grey. You people need to get along with the zeigeist. Nowdays, everyone gets a chip under the skin. I’ve Got You Under My Skin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1AHec7sfZ8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9MYizva-7o Really interesting article on lead exposure in early humans. Loved the points made regarding Neanderthal extinction and the potential linkages to Speech Sound Disorder and Autism. Radiation hormesis now comes to lead, just in time for the Trump Administration to loosen pollution restrictions. Convenient! I was very much surprised to read how many of those caves were contaminated by lead. How did that work out? It seems to have been widespread but I would have assumed that having places with lead deposits as well as developed caves would have only been a very small percentage and not over 70% like is suggested here. Did the Ancients use Lead Oxide as a pigment to produce white in their cave paintings? Did the Ancients use Lead Oxide as the pigment for face and body decoration goop? The Left Wins the Irish Presidential Election in a Landslide Counterpunch To give some background – Catherine Connolly is an ex Labour activist who left due (apparently) to internal fights within her local party. She was little known outside her constituency, although she seems to have been very well liked by other politicians including centrists – her two political jobs – Galway Mayor and Deputy Speaker for the parliament are both decided on open votes, which means a lot of the centre and right will have supported her. She was considered an outsider for the post, but as none of the left parties could agree on their own candidate, she became the de facto left candidate. She was also aided by the two centre right parties making an appalling mess of their campaign. She is a barrister and very good with both the public and on TV and won very easily. She has a long, consistent history of being on the general left of politics and in particular anti-war and anti-imperialism and pro-palestine (before it was fashionable, as they say). More recently, she seems to have become more nationalist on Irish unity (she keeps quiet on this as it’s the primary ideological issue dividing the left). The Presidential post is largely ceremonial and she will have little real power. It does have two significant political outcomes: 1. It will make it almost impossible for the current government to weaken Irish neutrality. She cannot block any attempt to join Nato or take part in military action, but she has the capacity to create a constitutional crisis over it, so no government would consider it worth the effort to try. It was never likely, but its pretty much an impossibility now for the next 7 years. 2. It greatly strengthens Sinn Fein (centre left/nationalist/republican). They initially couldn’t find a candidate that had any chance, so reluctantly backed her. But as they have by far the best electoral ground game, they became the de facto main partner in a loose alliance of left parties and the Greens. While that alliance lasts, it shows its possibilities in another election. But more crucially it has seriously weakened the current Prime Minister who despises Sinn Fein – it seems very likely he will not make it to the election. His likely successor belongs to the republican radical wing of his party, one much more likely to join forces with Sinn Fein. So this could give SF two potential coalition partners after the next election – a left wing/green alliance, or a centrist and left Republican one. They probably prefer the second option. She sounds very much like an Irish traditionalist in having Ireland be neutral and also pro-Palestinian out of principle. If she is there for the next seven years, then it may stabilize Irish politics and stop the idea I have heard of Ireland going into NATO so it can give all its military equipment to the Ukrainians and give Zelensky a coupla billion Euros. Forgive me as I have not been following Irish politics as closely as I used to, but is there really a movement among the Irish center-right to abandon neutrality and join NATO? The very idea seems so shockingly bad to me I could scarcely believe my eyes when I read your comment! No politician in Ireland who wants to get elected openly calls for it, but there is a lobby within the establishment who does want it (as this widely mocked article indicates). Michael Martin, the current PM, would try to move Ireland towards Nato if he could, but his party would never allow it. It would be a massive vote loser. The complication for Ireland is that even though it is not part of Nato, because of the lack of investment in defence over the years, the country has had little choice but to rely on UK/US and other European military help with various issues, from intercepting aircraft in Irelands aerospace to maritime rescue and heavy lift capacity for pulling citizens out of trouble around the world or in shoring up Irelands UN contingent (there has been an Irish Battalion in the Lebanon for nearly 3 decades now). For pragmatic reasons, Irelands small military accepts Nato standards for its equipment. So while neutrality is extremely popular with the electorate and the foreign establishment is split over this, no government aren’t actually willing to put in place a meaningful defence force. Interestingly, Sinn Fein has started calling for much more military spending. It is quite possible to envisage a situation where Ireland accepts membership of Nato as part of a deal for unification. I would prefer Sinn Féin to find a UK political party that would agree to leave NATO to enable unification, I.e. a common Ireland-Britain defence area as well as a common travel area. Although NATO may leave us first! :-) “US begins troop drawdown in Romania” Not just Romania but apparently Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia as well in December. I would imagine some panic in NATO over this as there might be the suspicion that Trump will eventually reduce US troop numbers until there is only a tripwire force left in Europe- https://www.kyivpost.com/post/63332 Not much profit to be had from only a tripwire force. They only need a skeleton force required for ISR the rest will be done with proxies. that is the European and West Asian plan. That is the impression that I got. That Trump & Co want Europe to field a strong military so that it can be its proxy force for that continent. The US would provide military equipment – at marked up prices – Europe would receive satellite data from the US but more to the point would have the US calling the shots for that European military like it does in places like South Korea. Maybe too like in South Korea, that there would be a US general put in charge of these European forces. maybe too the US would order deployment of that European force to places like Asia, maybe even Taiwan. A US general is, and has always been, the military head of NATO. This is no different, in practice, from US SK command structure. Would that include in combat as well? I know that is so for South Korea. Of course. SACEUR (who also has the US “hat” of COMEUCOM) has operational command from SHAPE in Mons, BE. Dubai: the dark truth — what lies beneath the wealth and glamour? – The Standard Read to me like an indictment of many parts of the world including Dubai. It takes global partners of privilege to create that kind of system. Some multipolar exploitation going on there. Read to me like a model for this: ‘Startup City’ Groups Say They’re Meeting Trump Officials to Push for Deregulated ‘Freedom Cities’ Wired (Paul R) The author of the Dubai piece seems to agree. Her concluding paragraph: “My fear is that we, in our rotting democracies, will become like Dubai, because to value this is to value tyranny, whatever name you give it, and there’s a word for that. Decadence: always the final age of empire.” I think our would-be techno-feudal overlords have a vision. It’s Dubai, but ruled by billionaire genius philosopher-kings rather than Sultans. Guys like Trey Goff will build it for them, and useful political lackeys like those in Congress and the Trump administration will make it possible. It takes a globe full of accomplices to create such a system. The world doesn’t have a “Trump” problem. Way beyond that. That’s the overarching point. Multipolar exploitation. I can only imagine the “Freedom City’s Mengele Institute For Anti-Aging” Re: “Read to me like a model for this: ‘Startup City’ Groups Say They’re Meeting Trump Officials to Push for Deregulated ‘Freedom Cities’ Wired (Paul R)” Yeah, me too. But ‘Startup Cities’ then led me to this gem: Inside the ‘Whites Only’ Community in Arkansas https://archive.ph/PvvVD But nothing new about building on the backs of indentured servants or slaves. That’s what “freedom cities” ultimately mean by “regulations”. Don’t even get me started on what they think is “science”. I just remembered…what happened to all those private islands? Why couldn’t they start this shit on those? Oh…that’s right…a parasite needs a host An ode to the soon to be “rare” 2025 penny, see lower. Good riddance to the meddlesome $0.01, which I grant still find useful in smaller exchanges of hard cash and currency…Maybe the retailers should be permitted to either round up or either round down, or just round it off period (!) Compliments of an 1980s song from Madonna… “Only boys who save their pennies, make my rainy day” The Chain Cent was the first effort by the US Mint in 1793, and they were about the size of a half Dollar. Fitting that we’re seeing off Mr. Lincoln~ A nice example is worth the big bickies, $126k https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1793-1c-chain-america-bn/1341 As a young teenager I would often gather coins in “vast numbers” twice per week on a small town paper route. For a measly $0.25 one could read all the news fit to print, and at the end of the afternoon I could saunter into the Wachovia branch to exchange those coins for “dollar dollar bills y’all….” So if I sold say 100 on a good day I was doing well even if it’s small time consumer paper media so to speak… Might have found a few wheat pennies on my route too! All this in a pre-internet world. What a seemingly more simple time. Those rainy fall and winter afternoons were awful though on a two wheel delivery machine. When I was a kid “Indian Head” pennies were a thing for collecting. Same for war cents and nickles. In some local auction decades ago, I bought this big lot of soup to nuts coins that had a couple of rolls of 1943 steel Cents which had been copper-plated to look like the real thing worth around $250k each instead of a Dime, and I spent them all over LA, one at a time over about a decade. I feel certain more than a few people got really excited about their ‘find’. https://www.pcgs.com/coinfacts/coin/1944-1c-steel/82722 “Good riddance to the meddlesome $0.01…” As you probably know, Canada ditched the penny already. It’s predictable! “Oh, it costs more to make it than it’s actually worth…” Two comments: 1. I remember as a kid in the US that I really liked the Eisenhower Dollar. Kind of like what my elders said, you knew you were holding something when you had one of those in your hand. All in for universal sufferage and thought the Susan B. Anthony was a good coin, but it just wasn’t a “real” dollar to me. Paper? Pfui. 2. Experience here in Canada seems to be mostly people don’t miss the penny. The bulk of people pay with a debit or credit card, and the rounding doesn’t apply to those. Cash transactions can be amusing to sort out. Always a gamble: am I going to pay more than the actual bill, or less? Fortunately Canadians don’t seem to be disposed to yank a handgun out and start blazing away because they got “cheated” by the system. We’re told it balances out in the long run. I wonder how much longer we have to run. I also remember when I first came to Canada there was some debate over the idea of minting a $5 coin to go with our $1 (“Loonie”) and $2 (“Toonie”) coins. The biggest debate was over what to call it. “Foonie” just rang like a lead bell. Ultimately the mint deployed the cost argument, though now I guess they’d just say everybody uses a card so it’s not a thing. I talked to a presenter at the British Museum after she gave a talk in their coin gallery. Their pound coins were relatively new at the time. Having seen some pretty wretched examples in commerce during our visit, as well as the simple design, I asked her what percentage of circulating pound coins she estimated to be “homemade”. She lowered her voice and said in a “don’t tell” voice it was around 60% (!!!) I never understood why they didn’t just get rid of the nickel also. Then instead of $1.23, for the price tag would be $1.2. Just like in Hong Kong. I have a vague memory of reading someplace that having prices like (say) $2.99 instead of $3.00 makes it more difficult to pilfer (this would apply to cash transactions, not credit or debit). Can’t remember the logic behind it though. China? I cannot find official Chinese confirmation that China will pause its rare earths export permits, per an X post by Arnaud B: https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1983910248416211116 – I checked and was unable to find a notice on the official Chinese govt website regarding rare earths – but did find notices on tariff rates and soy beans. Although we have Trump The Fantabulists’ words (echoed by the media), however, he has form. If so, the economic implications to high tech (and the MICC) remain. I also recall that in the prior restriction, I read a report where after several months, China was only able to process a handful of permits. I also saw nothing about Nexperia. Side note, for a 90-minute meeting, 20-30 minutes are for opening statements, 10 minutes for closing statements, so 50-70 minutes of translation-slowed discussions means equivalent to ~20 minutes of normal discussion for issues with complex details. So did they run out of time before discussing rare earths, or was it just a case of: Trump: “About those rare earths?” Xi, “不是 (Bushi) – No.” Trump: “So No Lunch or press briefing.” Xi “Yes.” Trump: “Fine, I was going to order a round of fast food burgers.” Xi “Fine: We will buy some soybeans, if you drop tarriffs.” Trump: “Ok. Ummm. Hmmmm. How’s the weather in Beijing these days?” I wouldn’t put it past Trump to lie. He has made shit up before. “24 hours to end the Ukraine war.” Part of the issue is that nothing is in writing. Both parties are free to exaggerate, charitably. Trump has changed his mind so many times and flip-flopped that these may be Schrödinger’s tariffs. “24 hours to end the war in Ukraine” is not a lie. That was, and still is, quite possible. Can you end the war in a way that keeps the Russophobes and neocon crazies happy in 24 hours? No, you cannot. But you can’t do that in the next 24 years either. So I’d argue ending it in 24 hours where everyone is unhappy is actually a great idea. Fellow Chris: I think the lie was that he would actually do it, not that it was possible. A total cutoff of aid, along with making Zelensky persona non grata the minute he started whining about ceding territory, would have likely done the trick. Too bad he lied to his base. It really is a pity he lied. I wish he had followed through with the promise. It looked like he was going to. Witkoff put Bibi in his place for a minute before Trump was even sworn in. And now… we have even more war and chaos. Once I tried to talk a snake out of shedding its skin. Never again. Or the US has more nuclear weapons, I guess he doesn’t think his base understands how to use Google; or maybe that the sycophantic media will not question if the emperor’s new clothes leave him naked. ‘Heather Johnston @HeatherJ_Israel My name is Heather Johnston, and I am the Founder and President of @USIEducation I am deeply concerned about the hate that Tucker Carlson is spreading in our country.

I actually thought that he came off as reasonable. He’s a very good and talented speaker, maintains a good flow and poise. He’s overcome a lot which is impressive, was kicked off YouTube, was on the no fly list, was being threatened, had hundreds of people come to his home, etc After he did a debate in college, a daily wire employee asked him if he’d like to visit Israel, he said no. But the main reason that he has a bright future is that the establishment is not providing an alternative. Nobody under 40 is ever going to be passionate about Lindsey Graham or Ted Cruz or Ben Shapiro. Hey, Afro, don’t blame old people for Graham, Cruz or Shapiro! Age has nothing to do with it. Take it from an ‘over 80!’ Tucker’s Christian theology is spot on, though I wish he’d named the heresy he was talking about. Darbyism is a 19th century invention by a British Calvinist. Spread through the Scofield Bible, it’s contrary to 1.900 years of amillennial eschatology shared by Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Reformed churches. Those Catholic church leaders that at best turned a blind eye to the kiddie fiddling surely can’t have believed in the dogma of heaven or hell as a soul’s permanent location in the afterlife. Because they would had had a firm idea about which location they’d end up in. My, what pretty evangs you’ve got… I love it when they go to the good book in order to defend Israel at all costs, where history majors in a narrow vein of events in an isolated area of the orb a few thousand years ago still resonate today. Reading the Gospels, quoting Jesus, Carlson is correct! There is no ‘love thy neighbor” in the militarism of the US and its zionist spawn! That said Augustine’s “just war doctrine” is excuse for heresy! Not one bullet fired by or for US/Israel in the last 80 years is “just” murder. So says me a repenting US airman! JD Vance and Augustine: https://martycenter.org/sightings/the-problem-with-jd-vances-augustine Thank you for the linked article! I was indoctrinated in the Just War by a USAF chaplain in the run up to Desert Storm! I took him as wrong at the time. I did not find out the rite of the chaplain. At that time I did serve in the states. Augustine excused Christians to get involved in Constantine’s state sanction murder. My best feel for Augustine is the quote: “Lord, give me chastity and continence, but not yet.” That aided my re-conversion and return to the Roman Church. Repentance is key That said in my seeking who is “thy neighbor” I go to the Good Samaritan and no further. Your neighbor is Jesus you see in every one you encounter. See especially the two mainstream men who passed by the sufferer. Samaritans were outcast to observant Jews in the setting of the parable. Augustine, doctor of the church, was not a pope and thus evidently fallible. He also gave us the curious concept of Original Sin. According to Hudson Augustine changed Debt to Sin or Economics to Sexual Mores I think. Popes are fallible too. At least, that’s what Dante said, and he encountered one. Papal infallibility is a 19th century construction (and only applies to church doctrine) so all of the popes have been more fallible than not. What’s going on with Bill Krystal? Somebody may need to check on him bc earlier in the week, I think he endorsed Mamdani for mayor! Rat departing a sinking ship. If you live in NYC, there is increasing desperation from the Cuomo campaign and wealth funded surrogates. Not to mention even more anger directed at Curtis Sliwa. God forbid the actual Republican candidate stay in the race, rather than prop up the sore loser who couldn’t accept that voters didn’t agree with his delusional belief that he got to be mayor just because he wanted to restart his political career so he ran again as an independent. Look this is NY, and we now have unaccountable electronic voting machines. Cuomo could still win. But all indications are that he is losing by a significant margin. Not enough of one in my opinion, but still significant. Banks and retailers run short on pennies as the US Mint stops making them Associated Press (Kevin W). More incompetence. Australia got rid of the penny before 2002, and required retailers to round up or down to the nearest five cents. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As you say, every other country got rid of small change pretty effortlessly… I’d guess the last time you could buy something with a lowly Lincoln would’ve been around 1980 from a gumball machine near you. The last time we ditched a denomination was in 1889 when we 86’d the Three Cent Piece, been a spell. it’s called ‘Swedish Rounding’ by the way. Time to buy boxes of nickels at face value from your local bank – the copper and nickel contained therein is worth double or more face value – to sell to refiners when it’s discontinued? I read several years ago that Kevin Bass I think, did so to the annoyance of the local Federal Reserve bank. It’s a bit tricky separating copper from nickel, is what I’ve been told. Wanna buy my 75% copper & 25% nickel Nickel ingot? As a fetish object, perhaps, more than an investment… :-) “EU parliament could block Russian media – Politico RT” Here in the UK, RT is already blocked. I can only access it through a VPN. Imagine how afraid they are that people may read the other side of the story. I will never really grasp how this insane level of censorship went through in Germany without a peep by MSM or parliament. If you know the status quo before this whole shitshow started it by large parts remains inexplicable. http://Www.swentr.site is your friend. I love the Russian trolling. It’s a true mirror URL… re: Germany – Israel – critical interview This is as much of a critical perspective on Israel that you will get by an established German reporter, Michael Lüders (German category of Chris Hedges, although he was no real war correspondent and much more benign in his views.) Which on the other hand by way of looking at those attacking him tells you the level of incompetence on the region by many German establishment morons. Lüders was Middle East correspondent for Germany´s biggest weekly DIE ZEIT. ((the) time) In case you can stand YT´s automatic dubbing in English, you can listen to it (it´s less obtrusive than German dubbings). Otherwise translate the transcript that comes with it. Interview with Michael Lüders: How the West supports Israel’s attacks on seven countries “Michael Lüders studied political science and Islamic studies in Berlin and Damascus, was a Middle East correspondent for Die Zeit for many years , and is currently a member of the extended board of the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW). In this interview, he discusses his new book, “Dirty Work: Israel, America, and Imperial Megalomania,” and Israel’s wars of aggression against Iran, Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen, and Qatar. Lüders explains how Israel and the USA secure their power in the region through wars, sanctions, and regime change, why Germany supports this policy, and what the consequences of a new war against Iran would be—for the entire region and far beyond.” The interview was conducted by Michael Holmes 60 min. https://www.nachdenkseiten.de/?p=141335 German Wiki on Lüders https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_L%C3%BCders re: Poland – Michael Jabara Carley – This piece was published originally on the Strategic Culture site which is banned from NC. However Michael Jabara Carley is one of the major authorities and he has not published there since 2020 (for whatever reason.) So I hope this is no violation of any sorts! If so, my apology. – This is pre-WWII but it fits the subject, I by coincidence just reread the piece a few days ago Michael Jabara Carley, downloadable pdf “What Poland Has to Hide About the Origins of World War II” Michael Jabara Carley Université de Montréal January 2020 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338543470_What_Poland_Has_to_Hide_About_the_Origins_of_World_War_II The outlook wasn’t brilliant for an unfortunate nine that day: The score stood three to three, with but one stanza more to play, And then when all hope died at first, and the other team did the same, A pall-like silence fell upon the patrons of the game. A straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest Clung to the hope which springs eternal in the human breast; They thought, “If only Shohei could but get a whack at that— We’d put up even money now, with Shohei at the bat.” ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ One of the best World Series i’ve seen in a world of Sundays, final game tonight, can’t wait. It’s had everything, almost. Great defensive plays, great pitching, weird plays, firsts of all kinds, including Freddie’s second walk-off homer in the 18 inning game (“Let’s play two!”) a record for any player in any combination of World Series games in history, and Shohei’s mind-blowing performance in one of the early games. But in my opinion, it’s not really baseball anymore, with all the rule changes they’ve made in the past 10-15 years to make the games go faster. No thinking between pitches, just throw another in a hurry, all DH now, bigger bases, etc. The last big rule change before this latest flurry was to lower the mound because of Bob Gibson’s unhittable pitching and it actually seemed to make the game better, but these latest ones are making it worse. Say what you will about his otherwise lackluster hitting in this Series, Freddie is “The glue in our clubhouse” according to the last two great manager’s he’s played for. Steady Freddie, indeed — Hall of Famer first ballot no doubt. Interesting that Atlanta fell apart after their World Series win when they let him go to the Dodgers, and the Dodger’s have now won one and may win two with him on the everyday roster. I never thought I’d be a Dodger’s fan, but Freddie’s the last link to Chipper, who was the last link to Maddux, Smoltz and Glavine who were the last links to Otis Nixon’s wall-climbing “The Catch” and Sid Bream’s slide into home. When Freddie’s career is done, my days of watching baseball will likewise be over. But this has been a historic Series, no matter, and I’m on the same page with you, waiting anxiously. pre-game starts in 10 minutes, game 7 of this incredible Series starts at 7 central time. Spoiler alert but don’t check the internet or on your phone. Waking up but my brain thought it was 7:45 AM Eastern but it really is 6:45AM….roll back the clock but repeat that October victory sensation for your Los Angeles Dodgers. So… happy for Freddie Freeman but that’s about all I can muster. I do think Roberts is a good manager, particularly when I consider the near misses from Bobby Cox whilst managing the Braves some 30 years ago in their heyday. “Report: Iran rebuilding its ballistic missile program” Israel would be very keen on attacking Iran once more – with America’s help of course. Trouble is that Iran is rebuilding their stock of missiles again as they have the industrial capacity to do it. And it seems that the Russians are helping them with their aerial defenses as Iran has finally realized that it needs help here. In addition, most of the groups that Israel set up in Iran are now gone and Iran will be carefully watching countries like Azerbaijan which aided the Israelis in their attacks. They will be a much tougher nut to crack next time. For their part, resupply of Israeli aerial defense missiles are probably proceeding slowly as those missiles take some time to build each. And now they know that Iran can hit any damn place that they want to and it does not matter if they have help from countries like the US, the UK, Jordan, etc. they do not know what to do next. So unless something tips the balance radically in favour of Israel, we may have a status quo developing where Iran won’t attack Israel and Israel can’t attack Iran. Sounds good to me. IDF does not have the wherewithal to do a Curtis E LeMay (bomber Harris with B-29’s and two A bombs) on Iran, too much geography, too much hardening, some level of air defenses. US help is limited by local infrastructure and depth of magazine which is already devoted to IDF. Do we really believe air shafts in Iran are straight and B-2’s can follow them …… Or that USAF flew 14 B-2’s in the same year. Your arguments are very logical and rational, and thus, sadly, irrelevant to the Israeli religious fanatics led by an indicted criminal who goes to prison if the war ends (and incidentally hell bent on genocide – making the IDF the true marvel comic book evil that used to be reserved for WW2 Germans with black uniforms). Israel is not being resupplied by building new missiles – that is too slow, and that was before the rare earth embargo of the US MICC. – They are being resupplied from the existing stocks underlying US-China war dreams. Let them be sent, and the US is rapidly losing its fevered war dreams (in a Thucydides trap). I trust European intel sources were totally honest with CNN, and not propagandizing regarding Iran Rebuilding its missile capabilities. Actually, an honest assessment would state that Iran is building out its capacity, particularly of the newest missiles, which were not used – they used such a minimal fraction of their stocks. Definitely not the same people who have been saying Russia is running out of missiles since day one are saying the same about Iran, despite its prepping for a US-Israeli war for decades.

Honestly seems very bizarre Interesting about Dubai. I am a fan of movie composer Hans Zimmer’s concerts including one in Dubai where he talks about how much he likes it there. Each week there is another fawning article about Dubai. Beyoncé sang there; Rio Ferdinand moved there. Westerners think it is “safe”, which is laughable. The talk is in English so doubtless his appreciative audience includes those wealthy British expats. But the article suggests his just folks vox populai patter may be cloaking an ugly reality. Still he is a very good musician Various right wing media ‘personalities’ or ‘influencers’ in England have very loudly moved to Dubai, because ‘there is too much immigration in England’ and ‘England is no longer safe because of immigrants [read Muslims]. But, of course, they will be ‘expats’ there rather than immigrants and only mix with their own kind in any case. My fascination with YouTube crochet and 90s rock channels has led to some interesting commercials. There were a whole series of commercials touting Dubai as a tourist destination for families, girls trip, honeymoon… It was yet another instance of cognitive dissonance for me. I could only wonder if tourists were limited to certain areas, almost like a Disneyland version of it. IA long time ago I read this article about Dubai; your comment caused me to dig it up again because it left an impression with me. It described a cruel, empty place that is all façade and inhabited by vapid rich people without empathy. A fake Disneyland for the wealthy and a hot hell for everybody else, run by a dictator. https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/the-dark-side-of-dubai-1664368.html >Banks and retailers run short on pennies as the US Mint stops making them Instead of abruptly discontinuing the production of one-cent coins, the U.S. government should have continued producing them using less expensive metals. After all, the government once profited greatly from producing steel pennies. A more honest idea would be to do what all countries eventually do when debasing their currency via inflation, just chop a zero or two off so the dime or the dollar would be the new penny. Would ditch those pricey nickels too. Even better, be proactive and make it three. What really is the point of units which are so worthless that one will not purchase anything? It’s because without it, you couldn’t skim off the top with a sales tax. Or more pertinently these days, a ‘merchant fee’. At least with a sales tax, we get fire trucks and clean water. – ‘Kathy Hochul admits socialist Zohran Mamdani’s ‘tax the rich’ plan would hurt NY’s middle class: ‘I cannot do that’ – New York Post This Post article is our political system in a nutshell. Our Establishment Democrat Governor, forced to support the nominally Democratic candidate for NY Mayor (in as unenthusiastic a manner as possible), regretfully explains why she just can’t tax the rich because it would hurt the “middle class.” The right-wing Post pretends to champion the “middle class” while accusing Hochul of pandering to the “radical left.” All those people chanting at Mamdani rallies or potentially voting for him in an election apparently don’t exist; at least they don’t count in the Post’s political world. I guess it is good, though, that at least everyone is so concerned about the welfare of the “middle class.” I’d better read that Daily Mail article next so I can really know what’s going on. They put the White House on a piece of land Where Foggy Bottom used to stand Before they put up a bowling alley In the basement where Tricky Dick would dally That’s where the big names used to come and play My sources tell me Kissinger hurled there on a Saturday Don’t come dancing The East Wing ballroom has come undone Why not come dancing?

Just look in the Dutch crystal ball” Got myself completely sidetracked with this article – it’s been one of those days. Near the top is an image of Geert Wilders and for a long time I thought that he looked kinda familiar though you wouldn’t think so. Then the other day I realized where from. Has anybody seen that old 1955 scifi film “This Island Earth”? https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047577/characters/nm0607504/ China’s rare earth export delay offers US a chance to weaken Beijing’s grip on the market – Associated Press The USA also has to watch out for creating deficiencies in other critical areas. I was reading the story in links the other day about huge areas of farm land going to data centers. But this thinking assumes people making decisions or lobbying those that do are actually concerned. Only been to Chipotle twice and both times got a mild case of food poisoning. Plus it’s kind of expensive for what it is – a slightly fancier Taco Bell but still fast food. I don’t think more “digital experiences” and dollar sauce options are going to fix what’s wrong there. The kids don’t have money for garbage food. The third time I went to Chipotle I got food poisoning so severe I was hospitalized for 7 days followed by 7 days of recovery at home where I was incredibly weak. I will not step a foot into a Chipotle again. A good many stand alone ‘Meskin eateries here, especially so in the towns that are almost all Hispanic (read Mexican) in population, and I’m looking at you Farmersville, Ivanhoe and Woodlake. All the field workers are Mexican, so the food is authentic and tasty. The true test of a restaurant is their chile relleno… Why go to Chipotle? Absolutely the test is how good are their chile rellenos. I always order that. When it’s good it’s wonderful. My restaurant test for first time eating is red chili. If they ace that, we will return. Also, Yuma AZ has some great authentic Mexican restaurants. Why go? For the ugly, dystopian decor that looks like the set from a sequel to “Aliens”? For the seating so hard and uncomfortable that you are left with sciatic nerve pain for the rest of the day if you sit for more than five minutes? For the beef and chicken rendered so inedibly tough that it should have a warning label and come with a side of dental floss? Yes, I always try the relleno but for me the true test is fresh home made tortillas. They are really hard to find but nothing better. since only really fancy places like Mi Tierra in san antone make Mole, anymores, Tam’s Test Dish was always carne guisada. my test in all eateries is to first observe the back door and the dumpster area(if theres cats, thats good), then upon entering thru the front, take a deep whif of the air(sour smelling oil=bad), then immediately wander to the loo, and endeavor to get a peek into the kitchen(clean-ish(i understand the demands) but more importantly, happy people in there who are having a good time) save for chinese food, i prefer mom and pops. for chinese, i prefer corporate….esp panda express. due to a lack of cats and stray dogs in the neighborhood of this place we went to in san angelo. (amfortas winks) (there are exceptions to this moratorium on mom and pop chinese joints, of course…Mencius, there on medical drive, there in san antonio is excellent…they even let me into the kitchen, under the “this chef wants to see how the pros do a certain thing”. any place that shows such professional courtesy is a good place, generally, in my experience.) Before I quit the Twitter, I’d see occasionally retweets of people complaining about the prices at Chipotle, so their struggles isn’t really news. I was taken once as part of a corporate informal lunch 10 years ago. Not sure what the fuss is about. I never went back, and it was overpriced in 2014. Here are the owners of Chipolte: https://brandsownedby.com/who-owns-chipotle/ Never was a big fan. I would only do take out the times that I used to go. I needed to take it home and add some seasoning and to make it hot. Adding that extra heat could have been what saved me from these scary food poisoning incidents. Only been to Chipotle twice and both times got a mild case of food poisoning. …Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice… Well, you can’t fool me twice… W. BlackRock loses $500m on shadow banking blow-up So, apparently Black Rock could only be bothered to do due diligence on a $500M loan after the cash went down a rabbit hole. We’re doomed. Ha. I’m free if they have another 500m ready to burn. I’m sure I can manage it better than they can, and I’ll only charge them 2 and 19 instead of 2 and 20. So what are we looking at, super volatile interstellar comet, a fragment of engineered material reacting to solar flux? Or something designed to reveal itself only under extreme energy exposure? Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a solid icy nougat nucleus wrapped in a coma of cloud of gas and lemony icy dust escaping from the nucleus. Bluer than the Sun. Zestier than any Earth lemon. Watch the skies! Keep looking! Kathy Hochul admits socialist Zohran Mamdani’s ‘tax the rich’ plan would hurt NY’s middle class: ‘I cannot do that’ – New York Post “I’m concerned about outmigration of people who are the ones who are supporting our budget,” Hochul said on the “Raging Moderates” podcast Tuesday about the top 1.5% of earners fleeing if she raised their taxes like Mamdani wants.” She claims NY has a middle class, but says the top 1.5% of New Yorker’s are supporting the budget. The Vampire State is incredibly agressive about income tax. Anybody without dependent kids, or unable to access one of the enormously long list of exemptions for special interests and cronies, has to pay on even the most limited income. They must also have a huge staff at the tax department since they recently audited my middle class income returns going back at least TEN years, and came up with demands for taxes, interest and penalties. I would have to see some real figures on that, both raw data amount and the percentage of income paid in taxes compared to those who aren’t in the top 1.5% . Not that our political leaders would misrepresent data for the benefit of their bigger donors. No, never. Obama is calling Obama Calls Mamdani to Praise His Campaign and Offers to Be Sounding Board (NY Times) Good luck with that. re: Venezuela vs. CIA fwiw Tom Griffin´s Substack The CIA and the Cartel de los Soles How a flawed counter-narcotics operation christened the enemy du jour Tom Griffin Nov 01, 2025 https://intelligencehistory.substack.com/p/the-cia-and-the-cartel-de-los-soles Interesting that we see this: Trump Says US Not Considering Venezuela Strikes https://www.youtube.com/shorts/w_gN7BeAgj4 And this is one of the many stories that get reported: Military strikes on Venezuela appear increasingly likely https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5584228-us-strikes-venezuela-maduro/ And if this is what the Western MSM thinks of him, imagine being a country trying to negotiate with Trump. re: Federal Reserve “The regulatory changes the Fed is considering could enable banks to lower their capital ratios enough to offer borrowers an additional $2.6tn in lending capacity, according to consultancy Alvarez & Marsal.” That’s a good way to get a lot of small community banks and regional banks into trouble again, as happened during the subprime crisis. Many many of those banks were consolidated with buyouts into larger banking entities at the direction of the FDIC. If one wanted to further consolidate the banking sector and reduce the number of community and small regional banks, this is one way to do that, imo. It’s never the smaller banks that get bailed out. The smaller banks get eaten. And an aside about the private credit crisis that’s looming: The big banks beginning after the GFC essentially stopped loaning to small businesses, that created the environment for the expansion of existing and creation of new private credit outfits. Small businesses still needed operating capital loans, and when their longtime big bank stopped lending even though the small business owner had never missed a payment or been a problem, they naturally turned to local private credit outfits. If there’s a problem now in the private credit market, it’s a crisis the big banks created, imo. Ellen Brown writing at Sheerpost: Ellen Brown: How a Fed Overhaul Could Eliminate the Federal Debt Crisis, Part II: Curbing Fed Independence https://scheerpost.com/2025/10/30/ellen-brown-how-a-fed-overhaul-could-eliminate-the-federal-debt-crisis-part-ii-curbing-fed-independence/ I’m surprised Trump didn’t offer to solve Xi’s problem with a housing slump and overbuilding by shipping our homeless population to China. A score or more container ships per month loaded up with homeless Americans in exchange for some rare earths would be a win-win deal, no? /s re: Ukraine War MOON OF ALABAMA Ukraine – Hail Mary Operation To Unblock Pokrovsk Has Failed https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/11/ukraine-hail-mary-operation-to-unblock-pokrovsk-has-failed.html “Nvidia’s market cap is now greater than the GDP of every country in the world except US and China” While I really dislike Nvidia and think it’s way overvalued, comparisons between market caps and GDPs always seem a bit misleading. Market caps are more of an estimated lifetime value while GDPs are yearly stats … at least to this non-finance guy. Sure, it’s apples and oranges; but it’s a convenient way to put these absurd numbers into context. What else are you going to use? Count the sand on the beach? I would like to see a simple, easily understood metric used. Let us consider a mature P/E ratio as Nvidia ages to a mature company, free of hype. Assuming Nvidia achieves a P/E ratio of 10:1 as it (or the sum of pieces it may split into) ages, then Nvidia (or sum of pieces) would need to earn $512 billion per year. Someone buying Nvida would then see earnings of about 10% of original share purchase price. Alphabet (Google) reported earnings of $100.12 billion in the year ending Dec 31, 2024. Nvidia at 5x Google’s yearly earnings seems like a very tall order as this level of annual earnings would be bound to attract competition from other semiconductor firms. And Google’s earnings report might be more solid from an accounting standpoint. >Euro-homeless, time to hit the trash heaps? Alex 1970 +7 Today, 08: 34 Do you remember what the price of gas in Europe was after the outbreak of the Nord Stream 2 disaster, and what it is now? Prices have returned to 2013-2014 levels. Banning rare earth exports is also disadvantageous for China. Yes, there’s a crisis now, but they’ll resolve the situation the same way they did with gas. Back then, they also wrote that there was nothing to replace Russian gas and that Europe was doomed, industry would grind to a halt, and the population would freeze. Propaganda, that’s just propaganda. It has nothing to do with analysis. Monster_Fat +4 Today, 08: 52 Yes, yes, all the “Euro-homeless” will soon run for the dumps, just as they have been freezing for several years now, without Russian gas, undernourished without Russian wheat, sitting in the dark without Russian electricity, without paper due to the lack of Russian timber supplies, without metal products, having switched to stone tools since they no longer buy metals from Russia, and without plastic products, oils and other chemicals since they no longer have Russian oil…. The end of the EU is coming… true, this is not certain and only in the Russian media, but oh well… It’s surprising that Russians are skeptical rather than welcoming the decline of the EU. It’s not the end just a lot more money going to middle men. And of course trickling up to more ‘important people’. Chipotle stock craters as company says young people without jobs can’t afford their food anymore. I suggest the company hire Luigi Mangione as the company spokesperson, in the manner of Colonel Sanders or Ricardo Montalbán. The guy has tremendous star power in his own right, and could help position Chipotle as a defender of the poor and downtrodden instead of a ruthless up-charging corporate monster. There will be no charge for this idea. re: bird flu The zoo in Swiss Bern developed a vaccine against bird flu and presented it early this year. However the vaccine although working well was rejected in the EU for alleged safety concerns. I suspect lobbying – both by Pharma and food industry – have achieved here a twisted, genuinely Pyrrhic victory. European poultry industry is huge ($56B), followed by pork ($43B), then beef ($26B) annually. Imagine someone introduces a simple and easy to do solution for this bird flu problem that people could apply without a huge pharma company behind it. DIY-basis.

Title: Texas And New York Set To Send Contrasting Signals To Investors
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickgleason/2025/10/31/texas-and-new-york-set-to-send-contrasting-signals-to-investors/

ByPatrick Gleason, Contributor. Next Tuesday, November 5, New York City voters are likely to elect a new mayor who has campaigned on income tax hikes for upper-income households and businesses. Meanwhile, that same day, Texas voters are expected to approve ballot measures banning state taxation of capital gains and the imposition of a financial transactions tax. The heightened contrast is sure to help the Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), the new Dallas-based stock market set to launch in 2026. An October 31 Wall Street Journal report about a new $90 million commitment to the TXSE from J.P. Morgan, the investment bank of JPMorgan Chase, noted that the TXSE “has billed itself as more CEO-friendly” than the New York Stock Exchange, adding that “previous investors include Citadel Securities, BlackRock and Charles Schwab.” The new infusion from JP Morgan, the WSJ added, “brings TXSE’s total fundraising to date above $250 million.” Ballot propositions banning a state death tax, a financial transactions tax, and a capital gains tax aren’t the only 2025 ballot measures that are set to make Texas an even more attractive destination to live, work, and invest. Texas voters will have the opportunity to enact reforms that provide further tax cuts, particularly property tax relief. Polling shows Texas voters are likely to approve Proposition 13, which will provide property tax relief to Lone Star State residents through a 40% increase in the homestead exemption. The state’s $100,000 homestead exemption would rise to $140,000 if voters enact Proposition 13 next Tuesday. “While not a permanent fix to property taxes, the amendment should help slow the growth of property taxes for all homeowners,” says Texans for Fiscal Responsibility (TFR), who has endorsed Proposition 13. While Proposition 13 seeks to provide relief for all property taxpayers in Texas, Proposition 9 would provide relief from the business personal property tax, commonly referred to as the inventory tax, to small businesses across the state. If approved, Proposition 9 would significantly increase the existing $2,500 inventory tax exemption, raising it to $125,000. “Texas is one of just nine states where small business owners pay taxes on the value of their inventory for sale, their personal property, and everything else used to generate income,” noted the National Federation of Independent Business’s Texas chapter in its statement of support for Proposition 9. NFIB adds that passage of Proposition 9 “would save Texas small businesses over $500 million annually,” and “make Texas even more competitive amongst its neighboring states.” “This constitutional amendment simplifies compliance, reduces bureaucratic costs, and incentivizes productivity,” notes TFR’s analysis of Proposition 9. “It cuts down on burdensome taxation that can stifle economic growth, especially for small operations. This is a pro-growth, pro-business reform that respects taxpayers and limits government overreach.” The ballot measures that Texas voters will likely approve on November 5 underscore why governors and legislative leaders in so many states are pursuing a phaseout of their income tax that would have them join Texas in the club of no-income-tax states. The eight existing no-income-tax states have already demonstrated the economic benefits of avoiding an income tax, and many are now seeking to expand that advantage by making their tax codes even more competitive. Texas isn’t the only no-income-tax state where legislators are pursuing property tax relief. In fact, in no-income-tax Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis is now pushing for a full phaseout of property taxes in Florida. In particular, Governor DeSantis is championing a single measure for the 2026 ballot that would begin phasing out all property taxes in Florida. Republicans in the Florida House of Representatives introduced eight property tax relief proposals on October 17, with seven of them being constitutional amendments requiring voter approval in November of 2026. Constitutional amendments must receive approval from at least 60% of voters in order to be enacted. The James Madison Institute, a Florida-based think tank, recently conducted a poll that found 65% of those surveyed said they would support a ballot measure to provide property tax relief. Lawmakers in other states are also pursuing property tax relief or limitation in the coming year. In no-income-tax Tennessee, for example, legislators will seek to pass a bill in 2026 that limits the growth of property tax bills. Tennessee is currently one of only four states without some form of property tax limit on the books. “To provide relief for taxpayers, we must set firm limits on how fast local governments can grow their budgets,” Justin Owen, president of the Beacon Center of Tennessee, and John Hendrickson, policy director at Iowans for Tax Relief, wrote in an October 17 article in Governing Magazine. “This will ensure that taxes do not outpace the ability of families and businesses to pay. Taxpayers must be protected from unchecked growth in local government spending.” “Eliminating property taxes may be a noble solution, but tax policy should always be approached with prudence,” Owen and Hendrickson added. “Replacing property taxes with a new tax or raising an existing tax to a higher rate, or even shifting more responsibilities to the state budget, are not necessarily sound tax policies. The best approach to lower taxes is to limit local government spending.” There were already plenty of reasons for lawmakers in no-income-tax states to pursue property tax cuts, property tax limits, and other forms of tax relief. But the case for doing so is strengthened by the fact that, at present, governors and legislators in nearly a dozen states across the country are seeking to phase out their income taxes. As more states eliminate their income tax, the lack of a state income tax will become less of an advantage. Leaders of no-income-tax states — such as Governors Abbott in Texas, DeSantis in Florida, and Lee in Tennessee — have made clear they are not resting on their laurels and that they welcome the competition.

Title: Does Bitcoin Power Law model still work in 2025 after S2F failed?

Time Published: 2025-10-31T23:00:37Z

The range that matters: $48k floor to $492k top, with the top increasing over time. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. With S2F in the rearview, the live power-law channel indicates that BTC is roughly 20% below fair value, but ETF flows could push it to either extreme. Bitbo’s implementation of Giovanni Santostasi’s model places the price near $109,700, the fair value near $136,100, the support near $48,300, and the resistance near $491,800, which frames the current cycle within a rising corridor derived from a power-law fit to price over time. The channel is constructed by running a linear regression of log(price) versus log(time since genesis), then duplicating that line in parallel to form upper and lower bounds that have historically contained cyclical extremes. The result is a time-based compounding curve with rails that move upward as time passes, making the model more of a location map than a point forecast. The core claim is simple to evaluate in live markets. Bitcoin trades about 20 percent below the fair-value regression and more than twice above the model’s floor, a mid-zone placement that contrasts with prior cycle tops and bottoms when the price tagged the channel’s resistance or support. Parameterization used by BGeometrics expresses the fair-value curve as P ≈ 1.0117×10^-17 × (days since genesis)^5.82, with a commonly referenced floor at about 0.42 times the curve, which is consistent with the present gap between spot price and Bitbo’s lower rail. The specification includes historical drawdowns while allowing for late-cycle overextensions toward the upper band. The logic behind this approach treats adoption as a power function of time and expects volatility to decay as the network matures, a property that appears as tightening oscillations around the regression line over successive cycles. Recent flows help explain why the price is in the channel’s middle rather than at an extreme. Crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) drew a record $5.95 billion in net inflows during the week ending October 4, 2025, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of approximately $126,000, alongside strong demand for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. The following two weeks showed that flows are not a one-way input. CoinShares recorded a swing to $3.17 billion of net inflows, followed by a reversal to $513 million of net outflows, including a single-week Bitcoin outflow of $946 million. Over the last two days alone, $958 million has exited US Bitcoin ETFs, with $290 million leaving BlackRock on October 30. That cadence is consistent with the power-law framing, where transitory demand surges or air pockets push price toward the upper or lower rails over weeks, while the long-run trajectory is anchored to the time-based power curve. October highs were tied to the breakout wave of ETF subscriptions, which are now a visible macro lever for crypto demand. The forward question, therefore, is not whether the power-law structure still applies, but where within the channel Bitcoin will trade over the next leg. A base-case path keeps the price oscillating around the regression, currently near $136,100, with a dampened amplitude if the volatility decay property holds. A bull-case path would see continued ETF inflows and benign macro conditions pull the price toward the upper resistance, near $491,800 today, which prior cycles reached during late-stage runs. A bear-case scenario would arise from macro tightening, a regulatory shock, or persistent ETF outflows that drive a retest of the lower rail near $48,300. This level has historically seen capitulation wicks before reentry into the channel. These levels rise with time as the exponent on days since genesis compounds. The rails are directional guardrails, not fixed targets. For readers tracking levels at a glance, the live model ranges are: PlanB’s S2F path called for $98,000 by November 2021 and $135,000 by December 2021, targets that were not met. The price then spent years below the S2F trajectory, an out-of-sample failure that weakened confidence in using a univariate stock-to-flow ratio to set deterministic targets. Vitalik Buterin has criticized S2F for providing false precision, and many analysts have identified methodological issues, including overfitting, the omission of demand and liquidity variables, and the treatment of halvings as step-wise valuation shifts that do not account for market microstructure. Institutional researchers continue to caution that S2F is not a reliable tool for long-term pricing. That leaves S2F as a scarcity narrative rather than a forecasting model. Power-law adherents, by contrast, argue that the cycle length and amplitude can be bounded without hard-dating outcomes. CryptoSlate has previously outlined broad windows in which Bitcoin would not sustain prices below roughly six figures after 2028 and could, at some point between 2028 and 2037, touch the seven-figure mark. Those are ranges, not calendar calls, and they inherit the same caveats as any model that ignores policy shocks or structural changes in market access. The new structural change is ETF flow, which functions as a demand valve that can overpower the marginal issuance cuts that halvings encode. Sustained weekly spot inflows above $2 billion to $3 billion would raise the odds of an upper-band test, while persistent outflows would increase the probability of a regression or floor retest. Macro liquidity, including the path of rates, the dollar, and central bank balance sheets, still takes center stage in determining whether the price holds above the regression or drifts toward the lower rail. That macro overlay is absent in S2F and is only indirectly present in the power-law fit, which is why practitioners track flows and policy alongside the channel. The power-law channel is constructed by taking daily BTCUSD closes, transforming them to log(price) versus log(time since genesis), fitting a simple linear regression as the fair-value curve, and then copying that line up and down in parallel to form resistance and support that historically enclose the price. The elegance lies in its production of a monotonically rising, time-based framework with a visible margin of error, which, so far, has captured cycle extremes without claiming to know the date or magnitude of future blow-offs. The cost is that it does not mechanistically incorporate known drivers, such as ETF demand or liquidity cycles, which must be monitored to understand where within the channel price is likely to reside in the near term. For now, the live read is straightforward. Price sits about one-fifth below the regression, well above the floor, with ETF flows and macroeconomic conditions determining whether Bitcoin tags the upper band or fades toward support before reverting to the mean. The channel continues to rise with time, and the rails define the tradable map. Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is a reporter, podcast producer, and Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate.

Tortoise Capital’s Rob Thummel and Payne Capital Management’s Ryan Payne join Mornings with Maria to discuss record market highs, the AI infrastructure boom and how Big Tech earnings and U.S.–China trade talks could drive investor sentiment. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the U.S. remains the primary destination for investors to put their assets and will continue to be for at least the next year and a half amid economic trends. Fink was part of a panel moderated by Bloomberg Television at the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia and noted that earlier this year there was "modest transformation and movement out of the dollar" as investors moved assets to Europe and other regions. However, he noted that movement came from a "huge overweight in dollar-based assets" and that the trend appears to be reversing with investors moving back into U.S. assets. "I would say in the last two months we're seeing that money coming back into the U.S., so I don't see there's that much movement. There's still a deep belief in the opportunity in the U.S.," Fink said, noting the surge in investment related to AI and other capital projects. BLACKROCK'S BRAGGING RIGHTS TO FASTEST-GROWING ETFS BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that the U.S. will continue to be a destination for investors to be "overweight" for at least the next 18 months. (Kirk Sides/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) "Over 40% of the economic growth in the second quarter was capex for technology, and you don't see that in other places in the world," the BlackRock chief said. "And it's that capex, whether it's data centers or finding more power, gas, building gas turbines – you're seeing all that happening more in the U.S. than in most places in the world today." "You're not seeing that as much in Europe, and this is one of the big reasons for the huge gap between U.S. GDP and European GDP," he added. BLACKROCK CEO LARRY FINK'S ANNUAL LETTER TO INVESTORS Fink said that while money will continue to move around to different countries and regions of the world, he thinks most global investors will continue to focus on being overweight on their U.S. investments for the next year and a half. "Money's going to move around all the time, but I would say most global investors have a very large overweight in the U.S. and I think that's going to be the best place to have your overweighting for at least the next 18 months," Fink added. U.S. markets tumbled earlier this year amid concerns over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the economy, as well as longstanding fiscal issues. TRUMP AND XI STRIKE TRADE TRUCE: 5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE SOUTH KOREA SUMMIT U.S. markets have rebounded on strong AI investment after sliding earlier this year in the wake of tariff announcements. (Michael Nagle/Bloomberg via Getty Images) President Donald Trump's announcement of his "reciprocal" tariff policy in early April prompted a significant sell-off in the stock market – though the administration later delayed and pared back some of those tariff policies, which reduced investors' concerns. Longstanding concerns over the long-term fiscal health of the U.S. have also continued to accumulate as the deficit has surpassed the $37 trillion and $38 trillion thresholds over the course of 2025. Concerns about the inability of lawmakers to curtail persistent and growing budget deficits prompted Moody's to become the third major ratings agency to downgrade the U.S. credit rating from its top tier.

A flurry of new crypto spot ETFs launched on Tuesday and Wednesday, meaning that mom-and-pop investors can now invest more easily in lesser-known cryptocurrencies. Until this week, these investors could only buy Bitcoin and Ethereum in ETF form, and based on initial demand, at least one of the new offerings is off to a roaring start. The new ETF provides exposure to Solana, the sixth most popular cryptocurrency. According to Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) had the best ETF launch of 2025 in any asset class. Demand for other new ETFs, providing exposure to Litecoin and Hedera, was more muted. Although crypto exchanges like Coinbase have long sold these cryptocurrencies, the ETF wrappers mean investors can get exposure to these assets in the form of shares purchased through any brokerage. “For investors, this is about as McDonald’s easy as you can get,” said Balchunas in an interview with Fortune. “It’s low-cost, easy, and safe.” The launch of this latest crop of ETFs comes nearly two years after the Securities and Exchange Commission first opened the door to crypto funds in January 2024. That’s when the agency finally approved a bid by BlackRock and others to sell Bitcoin ETFs, following a nearly decade-long legal battle with the crypto industry. The first Ethereum ETFs launched later that year. Now, with the launch of ETFs for more obscure cryptocurrencies, traders will have access to an even deeper array of digital assets. On Thursday, BSOL, the Solana ETF issued by crypto asset management firm Bitwise, saw $46 million of trading volume in its third day. By contrast, the Canary Hedera and Litecoin ETFs saw roughly $2.3 million and $500,000, respectively, in their third day. “BSOL did phenomenally well,” said Hunter Horsley, the CEO of Bitwise, in an interview with Fortune. “And I think it connected with a lot of investor demand.” Other issuers to launch Solana and Hedera ETFs are Grayscale and Canary, respectively. The race to launch new cryptocurrency ETFs is competitive, as first movers are better able to cultivate investor loyalty and gain a leg up on competitors who are slower to come to market. “It’s like the Ricky Bobby quote, ‘If you’re not first, you’re last,’” said Balchunas. “There’s a little of that in the ETF world. That’s why there’s such a rush to market.” The quest for a crypto ETF dates back to as early as 2013, when the Winklevoss twins —whose legal battle with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg was popularized in the movie The Social Network—sought approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which track the current price of the popular cryptocurrency, became a white whale for those in the sector. But, under multiple administrations, the SEC rejected applications for them, citing the immaturity of the market and the potential for manipulation. In 2021, the agency approved a Bitcoin futures ETF, but not a spot fund. In 2022, Grayscale, a prominent crypto asset manager, sued the agency for allowing futures-based but not spot funds. Grayscale won the case in August 2023. In 2024, a select few spot ETFs launched to record success. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracted $70 billion in total assets more quickly than any other ETF. Its Ethereum fund (ETHA) also set record inflows. Under the Trump administration, the floodgates for spot crypto ETFs flew open after the SEC updated its guidance in July. But the recently launched ETFs for Solana, Hedera, and Litecoin appear to make use of new guidance that the SEC issued at the start of the ongoing federal government shutdown. While the exact technicalities of how these issuers were justifying the listing of their new funds were unclear to Balchunas, he said that they were being opportunistic. “These issuers are very crafty. They found phrasing in guidance put out by the SEC about what to do in the shutdown,” he added. Balchunas also predicted that XRP, the fifth biggest cryptocurrency, would be the next crypto ETF to launch. “If I had to bet $1,000, I would say it would launch a couple of weeks after the government comes back,” he said. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: October 2025 in Review

The Site Happy Halloween and all that… and on a Friday no less. Stay safe out there. As for the site, both long time readers might recall me complaining endlessly about how changing the time setting of the blog from UTC to US Pacific time changed my posting streak, which began on March 29, 2020, which would be 2,042 days ago, to starting in May 2023 because the time zone change put one post or another into a different day. I used to post at all hours of the day and night. I mostly used to post at 17:15 UTC, or 10:15 local time, which somehow got converted oddly. Anyway, after bitching about it for well over a year, I finally did something about it. I went back and correct some times… because it turns out that WP.com did some odd things to times when I did that change… to see if, you know, that might actually work. And it did. Granted, it didn’t work in one fell swoop. I basically had to go to the next date that got screwed up and fix the times there, so my streak count went from 857 to 987 to 1252, to whatever, as I worked my way back, day by day, to each screw up. And it was strange, because there were, in fact, no day gaps so far as I could tell. It just freaked out about some times that were past 18:00 around the DST changes. So, basically, bad WP.com code. But I got there. The TAGN Streak – Battlefield 2042 Does this really matter? Am I a better person because WP.com now correctly displays my post streak? Or does this really say more about my own mental defects? Yeah, you probably know the answer better than I. Meanwhile, in comment comedy this month, I have had a repeat commenter from Portland, Oregon (judging from his IP address… remember kids, I can see that) who keeps complaining about my blog appearing on their Kindle and asking that I remove my content from their device. Please.remove this web sight from my kindle At first I thought this was a joke, but it has come up a few times. And I can’t really help them. I recall that there is some minimal browser available on the Kindle, but how things get bookmarked or whatever, no idea. I use the Kindle app on the iPad. One Year Ago LOTRO, EverQuest, and EverQuest II all announced their coming expansions so close together that I just put them all in a single post. Blizzard kicked off the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary festivities. I was asking, not for the first time, when WoW Classic should end. Is there a point when it just isn’t “classic” anymore, or are we on the ride to catch up to retail? Actually in the game, the instance group was still working through Cataclysm Classic, taking on The Lost City of Tol’vir, with a bit of Coren Direbrew on the side. We were also out there with many others farming Wintergrasp for honor. Tol Barad was just bad. Wintergrasp was generally an Alliance walk over, unless we pulled the Horde pre-made group. Then we got worked. We also cheesed the Vault of Archavon in Wintergrasp, because why not? Then we started testing the waters for heroic Deadmines. That was getting us to the end of the expansion so far as we were concerned, so I was wondering how much longer the whole thing would drag on. (Until July 2025, which was too damn long for me.) In EVE Online, the Crimson Harvest event, one of only two regular annual events at this point, kicked off once more. The candidate list for the CSM19 elections was announced, so the campaigning could begin in earnest. Shortly thereafter Alcoholic Satan was removed from CSM18 and dropped from the CSM19 ballot. It isn’t a realm CSM if there isn’t some drama. Then the election started. (And the Alliance Tournament kicked off as well.) When the polls closed we got the results and saw who would be on CSM19. We also got a date for the upcoming Revenant expansion. There was also the MER, which seemed to indicate we were coming out of the “summer slump,” if you believe in that. I did a Friday bullet points post with more about the AT, more Revenant details, the announcement of the Empires of EVE: Vol III project, the current PLEX price crisis (not helped by Torvald Uruz destroying 38,400 PLEX as part of his dramatic rage quit), EVE Galaxy Conquest, and finally getting my 20th Anniversary Collectors Edition delivered (18 months after the 20th anniversary). Then, as the month closed out, CCP finally forced everybody into mandatory participation with the Equinox sov changes. Yay, rejuvenation or something. Actually in New Eden, there was a State of the Goonion meeting that announced our Migration from Delve to Tenerifis. Let the big move begin! This seemed to dismay and confuse PanFam leadership, who had barely fought back claiming that Goons would get tired and go home. The Reavers SIG also celebrated a decade of not existing. The actual move was being handled by stages, with everybody getting to the regional gate between Querious and Catch. (And when I write “everybody” I mean maybe 40% of the alliance. People were still panic moving months later.) Then there was a massive op for crossing the regional gate. And then more move ops. More ops all the time. I also went on my own side adventure, avoiding the regional gate as I moved a black ops battleship and a blockade runner through an alternate route. This all led to Brave finally taking 1DQ1-A and being declared the winner of World War Bee. The Stars Reach pre-alpha carried on with a test of some new tools, then there was a test for combat and new ranger skills, I tried out Galaxicus, the spiritual successor to Stellar Emperor / MegaWars 3. Also, our binge watching habits continued, with another post summarizing what we had been watching. Five Years Ago I started using that 34″ ultra-wide monitor. Coincidentally, I also started complaining about the UI in games being too small and hard to read if they lacked a reasonable scaling option. Somebody at Google Stadia was ranting about making streamers pay. Is there something in the water that makes people this dumb? Blizzard delayed the Shadowlands expansion. But they were building up for the AQ war supply event in WoW Classic. And we got a late November launch date before the month was out. WoW seemed to be hanging on according to the Q3 2020 results. I was also wondering if we were going to get a level squish with every WoW expansion going forward. And then the big level squish patch hit and all our level 120 characters were suddenly level 60. The only thing was to try it out, though it was a bit strange. The new Exile’s Reach starter area was… new. We put together a little group to try the level squished Northrend. Ula made us an instance group video about our time in Sunken Temple. Then there was the running of the Gnomes. And then we started some prep for a little instance called Blackrock Depths. Meanwhile, StarCraft II fell off of Blizzard’s active development list. The EverQuest team announced the Claws of Veeshan expansion, the EverQuest II team announced the Reign of Shadows expansion, and the Lord of the Rings Online launched their War of Three Peaks expansionette. And in EVE Online World War Bee was in full swing, with PAPI finally trying to gain a foothold in Mother Delve. That led to Guinness World Record setting battles, which CCP got us ready for by introducing a UI Only mode to the game. That was some timing. I’ll sum up the war as a list: And outside of the war I did a bit of quiet mining in the new ore distribution plan. The Reavers SIG turned six years old. We got a Crimson Harvest event for Halloween. The Howling Interdictors update gave us stasis bubbles. And then there were the Triglavians. They captured 27 empire systems and, with another update, they were yanked into a new Triglavian region named Pochven. Farewell Niarja. Sean Connery, the favorite James Bond of many, passed away. Finally, there was the tale of the Canadian visitor. Ten Years Ago I opened up the month with a post about the Mineserver Kickstarter campaign, a little box that promised to make hosting easy! A pity is never came to anything… and that I basically threw money into nothing. Then there was the now perennial complaint about customers being too cheap to by any and every 99 cent game. It is because your 99 cent game sucks. In EverQuest II, the Desert of Flames expansion unlock votes passed on Stormhold and Deathtoll, which made me ponder the pacing of nostalgia. Daybreak seemed to want to go faster. Daybreak also have expansion announcements for EverQuest and EverQuest II that included pricey special editions. Milk ’em while you got ’em I guess. But PlanetSide 2 was having problems attracting subscribers. EverQuest II was consolidating servers, so it was farewell to Crushbone. In Lord of the Rings Online, server consolidation was just getting under way as well. Crowfall was still in development, but had announced some costly RMT castles. Guild Wars 2 launched the Heart of Thorns expansion. I picked up the Reaper of Souls expansion for Diablo III and made it through Act V. My wife and I went to EVE Vegas where we partied and heard about the planned Citadel expansion. I brought some give-aways for the trip, which I covered, along with Pirate’s Little Helper, in a Friday bullet points post. Meanwhile, in New Eden I was very impressed with the multi-buy feature that came in with the previous month’s Vanguard release. I was also wondering if space priests were a problem. I also went pipe bombing for the first time. The month’s Blog Banter wanted to know about my PC. And Reavers celebrated their first anniversary. Over in one corner New Eden SpaceMonkeys Alliance (SMA) stole ISK from EVE Online casino I Want ISK who, in turn, hired low sec mercenaries to camp SMA space, starting the embers of what would become the Casino War. And the sad tale of CCP and White Wolf came to an end as CCP sold off the subsidiary and its neglected IP, World of Darkness. Finally, in Minecraft, Aaron began his draining of an ocean monument, and I was interested in bases, several of which sprang up as I worked on the Great Northern Road. Fifteen Years Ago I had some hopes and expectations for BlizzCon. They were pretty much unmet. But Blizzard had already announced the Cataclysm ship date, so what else did I expect? I asked if people ever look at the items in the blog side-bar. People mostly do not. EverQuest launched the House of Thule expansion. I finished building my new computer. Windows 7 64-bit was the wave of the future… unless you wanted to take that LOTRO survey. The EVE Online screen shot contest wrapped up, winners were declared and prizes were sent out. I was playing Lords of Ultima innocently enough and then somebody attacked me! Oh noes! I was suddenly determined to “catch them all” and finish the National Pokedex in Pokemon SoulSilver. The instance group was playing in LOTRO, which had been live as a Free to Play game for one month. In-game, we were subjected to the disturbing habits of some of the residents of the Lone Lands, while I indulged in one of my own habits, the mid-game character swap. And then I made one post completely unreadable by making anagrams out of all the proper nouns. I had to repost a corrected version. I bought Civilization V, which like every Civilization launch, had issues with my current computer. The unwritten rule of Civilization is that you need to upgrade your machine in order for the game to play well. LEGO Universe launched. My daughter and I were drinking new and interesting sodas and I was really hoping that the SF Giants could make it to a World Series victory. Twenty Years Ago Club Penguin, the browser based, kid friendly MMO, launched. Pity about Disney screwing the whole thing up. Civilization IV launched and, as with all Civ launches, the game really needed the next generation of hardware to run in its full glory. I recall submitting a bug and getting a response telling me to stop trying to play with so many civilizations in a single game. Age of Empires III also launched. While it was well reviewed, and we all bought a copy, it never really eclipsed Age of Empires II in my heart. The second game remains the pinnacle of the series for me. Twenty-Five Years Ago The PlayStation 2 launches in North America. Pokemon Gold & Silver arrive in North America. Regional launches were a thing back then. Forty-Five Years Ago Berzerk arrives in arcades. I remember this game showing up and dropping a lot of quarters to play it. It said things.

I managed to get through purple stakes with the checkered deck, the one I find the easiest to run with in that you can go all in on flushes pretty easily. Now I am working on orange stakes, the next to last level… and it is a thing. But it is a rogue-like, which means you just keep starting over until the RNG favors you. EVE Online What did I do in New Eden? Nothing very eventful I guess. I went on a couple of ops, did a bit of the Crimson Harvest event, tended my planets, ratted again a little bit, voted for CSM20, and started accumulating skill points for the Catalyst expansion coming in November. Nothing really exciting, just playing the game in kind of a low key way. No Man’s Sky We might have hit the end of Corvette Summer or whatever. I had already gone back to mostly exploring and the basic game play loop of discovery and moving on. We did try our hand at base building… and it was not very satisfying. I still have more to say about that. Then there was Expedition 20, which Potshot and I both got through, though there were some hurdles as noted. Palia The new game for some of us in the group. Despite it being mostly the housing and crafting portion of an MMO, with scant adventure available, it does press enough of the “progress quest” character advancement buttons without giving you too early on, so you always feel like you are working towards something. We’ll see how long it lasts, but for now it is a pretty chill game. Palworld We’ve been moving slowly here. This has become the Sunday afternoon game, but only if we have the full group. And, being adults with responsibilities and obligations and all that, it doesn’t always come together. But we persist. Pokemon Go The big October update still seems strange to me. Adding new levels to engage you level capped players… and then changing the level curve so that same players just skip past 20 of the 30 levels added… well, it is a bold strategy. So I have xp to get me to level 74 already, we’re just caught up in the tasks required for each of the last ten levels. Coming Up It is the start of the run up to the holidays. It will also be the prime season for high quality ads, so we’ll see if ad revenue for the site goes up. (Please use an ad blocker plugin with your browser. If you’re somebody who reads this far in, I don’t want to tax/annoy you. I want to tax comment spam bots.) In EVE Online we will have the Catalyst expansion coming mid month. That will shake things up a bit; new ships, new login rewards, new Twitch drops and all of that. Enshrouded is also supposed to get its next big update. It was supposed to be this month, but it got pushed out to “October 42nd” according to the community team. Best not to ship too early. It is quite possible we might get one of the three planned Daybreak expansions before the end of the month. I’d bet on LOTRO being the first, but we’ll see. Took your first Blaugust very seriously, did you? LikeLike Actually that lines up with Blapril, which was the sixth run, when during early Covid we decided to do Blaugust early because we were all stuck at home and had plenty of time to write. It just so happens I have worked from home since then, which has meant more time for writing since I no longer have a commute. LikeLiked by 1 person Δ Email Address: Email Posts to Me!

AI announcements from Orion, SS&C and Boosted.ai and alts tech news from Envestnet and SignatureFD with CAIS. October 31, 2025 Wealthtech provider Orion announced Denali AI this week, the company’s new enterprise intelligence platform that will power what the company is referring to as its AI-first ecosystem, when it is fully available. For now, the technology remains in beta with select Orion advisory firm clients. Broad availability is expected sometime in 2026 at which time details on pricing and other aspects of Denali will be provided, according to the firm. The AI has been built to connect every system and workflow across the Orion technology ecosystem. On the Orion website, the company calls the technology “Your Firm’s AI Command Center,” stating it was designed to provide a firm’s administrators with full control and visibility into their AI environment, including usage data, activity logs and other connected sources and will be where firms define their AI-related configurations, set and align policies, and ensure that the AI matches a firm’s compliance and governance standards. “Orion Denali AI is the cornerstone of Orion’s future … by combining automation that expands capacity, insights that anticipate client needs, and intelligence that supports better decisions,” said Reed Colley, president of Orion Advisor Technology, in a statement. Orion demonstrated artificial intelligence assistants and other AI-driven features at the Future Proof conference in September. Related:Financial Monitoring Application Carefull Announces AI This week, Envestnet announced the launch of two managed model portfolios that include interval funds on its platform. The new funds are available through Envestnet’s Strategist UMA. The new models integrate semi-liquid and liquid strategies, enabling seamless allocation to alternatives with point-and-click simplicity, according to Dana D'Auria, co-CIO and Group President of Envestnet Solutions, in a statement. The first two models are from Franklin Templeton and BlackRock, with others slated for 2026 from Fidelity Investments and State Street. The Franklin Templeton fund has five risk-based options ranging from Conservative to Aggressive. The portfolio will incorporate a 10% allocation to alternatives. The BlackRock fund is a multi-asset income fund with private market models and incorporates public and private credit, covered call strategies and dividend-focused equities. Neither fund will require subscription documents, and both provide simplified tax reporting. Last week, Envestnet announced the appointment of Bhaskar Peddhapati as chief technology officer. He will be responsible for all aspects of technology, engineering and information security across the company. He most recently ran the mortgage technology team at Cotality (formerly CoreLogic). Related:WealthStack Roundup: bQuest Joins The Founders Arena SS&C this week announced the launch of its AI agent catalogue. The available agents, which were developed, tested and used within SS&C prior to their external availability, range in their use cases from trade reconciliation and validation to contract analysis. The agents are delivered as a managed service, designed to help organizations overcome talent shortages and operational bottlenecks. Annuity carrier American Life, an SS&C customer, for example, is currently evaluating SS&C’s Credit Agreement Document Agent for possible use in streamlining the processing of its private credit operations by having the AI agent review and update lengthy loan documents. The agents in its catalogue have been built using SS&C’s AI Gateway, which provides secure, auditable access to large language models and employs real-time guardrails for advanced security and data loss protection, real-time risk monitoring, and explainability of actions. And SS&C offers a range of deployment options, including hosting the AI Agents and AI Gateway on its own privately owned GPU infrastructure in ISO-compliant data centers, ensuring full custody of client data. Boosted.ai has launched voice-powered AI research agents, making it the first investment research platform that enables analysts and advisors to converse with a research agent in real-time. Boosted.ai has integrated the natural language voice technology from ElevenLabs, meaning that those employing Boosted.ai’s Alfa agent can speak to it naturally, in real time, when making queries. In a prepared statement, Boosted.ai provided the following hypothetical to illustrate how a verbal conversation might proceed: Portfolio Manager: “Hey Alfa, look at companies in the S&P 500 with a dividend yield over 2% and a price-to-earnings ratio greater than 15. Then read earnings transcripts, SEC filings, and news for those stocks over the last 3 months and summarize their exposure to China.” Boosted.ai Alfa response: “I’ve identified 27 names, concentrated in industrials, consumer staples, and energy. A significant number have meaningful exposure to China, both as a revenue source and a supply chain dependency. Would you like me to group them by sector or by level of exposure?” While not a household name for most financial advisors, Boosted.ai launched in 2017 and is perhaps better known to asset and investment managers; it raised $15 million in funding last November. SignatureFD Partners with CAIS, DFA, Axcelus on Tax-Advantaged PPLI Vehicle SignatureFD, an RIA with $10 billion in assets, launched AutographFD, an operating division that will allow investors to allocate money to both public and private investment strategies within the tax-advantaged private placement life insurance wrapper. The RIA is partnering with alternative investment platform CAIS on private strategies, Dimensional Fund Advisors on public strategies and Innovator on defined outcome strategies. Autograph has incorporated AI into its platform to educate investors on alternative strategies and streamline the process of getting PPLI for clients. Axcelus Financial, with which SignatureFD has a long-term relationship, will be providing the insurance. According to Doug Liptak, chief strategy officer at SigntureFD and founder of AutographFD, PPLI has traditionally been available on the very high end of the private investor market, to family offices with over $100 million in assets. AutographFD makes PPLI available to qualified purchasers with $3-million-plus in investable assets, although the average users will likely be investors with $10 million in assets. Liptak noted that both end-investors and outside financial advisors have responded to news of AutographFD development with enthusiasm since it allows for tax-free growth of PPLI investments and simplified administration, with no K-1 forms, capital calls or subscription documents that need to be signed. “It’s a better way to access alternatives from a tax-free standpoint,” he said. “Autograph allows you to do it all inside an institutionally priced policy and then get the tax benefits.” Davis Janowski Senior Technology Editor, WealthManagement.com Davis Janowski is a New York-based technology journalist whose work spans consumer, business and the FinTech sectors.

Title: Meta’s $27 billion bet turns AI compute into Wall Street’s hottest new investment
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/31/metas-27-billion-bet-turns-ai-compute-into-wall-streets-hottest-new-investment/

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Are data centers the new REIT? Not quite — but Meta’s new mega–data center in northeast Louisiana marks what one expert calls a “decisive shift” in how hyperscalers finance the AI era: by turning data centers into a new investable asset class. “This is where capital markets meet compute,” said Sean McDevitt, a partner at management consulting firm Arthur D. Little, which provided commercial due diligence advice to Meta. Traditionally, tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft have funded their data center buildouts directly. This time, Meta is partnering with Blue Owl Capital, a private-credit investment firm, on the $27 billion data center known as Hyperion. As reported by The Wall Street Journal, Blue Owl owns 80% of the project, while Meta holds 20%, operating and leasing the facility long-term. BlackRock bought more than $3 billion of bonds that the joint venture (dubbed Beignet) issued last week to finance the project, in a sale arranged by Morgan Stanley. The deal stands out for its scale—the largest private-debt offering ever—and for its A+ rating from S&P, which reflects Meta’s backing of the project (albeit with just a single agency rating). Yet the debt had a yield of 6.58% at issue, a level closer to high-yield, or “junk,” bond territory. That structure allows Meta to build its data center without putting the full $27 billion of debt on its own balance sheet. The approach—known as a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) or off–balance-sheet financing—is largely new territory for hyperscale infrastructure. “By being able to access outside capital, you’re not limited to your own free cash flow generation,” McDevitt said. “You’re bringing on investors with return profiles on an infrastructure-type investment that allows companies to build bigger, larger, quicker, and faster.” He compared it to taking out a mortgage: you can buy a bigger house—or, in this case, build more data centers—by borrowing instead of paying cash up front. McDevitt believes the Hyperion deal could become a template for the industry. He estimates that roughly $150 billion in AI-driven data center construction is coming in the next few years. If other hyperscalers—Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and OpenAI among them—adopt similar models, capital markets rather than tech companies themselves will effectively fund the infrastructure of the AI era. “This is replicable,” he said, though he cautioned that it remains to be seen how the project performs in practice. “Now what has to happen? Meta has to build this thing, then put workloads in it and operate under the presumption that they’ll monetize those computing loads driven by AI in the future,” McDevitt added. That is precisely where criticism of the deal lies: According to Global Data Center Hub analysis, “If AI workloads or margins stumble, these SPVs could echo the dark-fiber overbuild of the 1990s vast capacity sitting idle while debt remains outstanding.” Still, for now, there’s no reason to think other major banks won’t try the same thing, said McDevitt. “Why wouldn’t others look to mimic [this deal]?” Sharon GoldmanX: @sharongoldmanEmail: sharon.goldman@fortune.com Submit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter here.

Title: Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt? Indian-origin CEO under BlackRock's radar for ‘breathtaking’ $500 million scam in US?

Time Published: 2025-10-31T11:29:58Z

An Indian-origin CEO is at the heart of a $500 million scam that targeted the world’s biggest investment group BlackRock’s private-credit investing arm and other lenders, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. According to the WSJ report, BlackRock’s private credit investment arm, HPS Investment Partners, are now trying to recover the money after falling victim to what it calls a ‘breathtaking’ fraud. Bankim Brahmbhatt, the owner of US-based Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, has been accused of fabricating accounts receivable that were supposed to be used as loan collateral. The lawsuit, filed in August, alleges that HPS had provided loans to Brahmbhatt's companies on the condition that they pledged millions of dollars owed by customers as collateral for the money. The lenders have now accused that Brahmbhatt’s companies owe them more than $500 million. BlackRock has also claimed that when the verification process of the account receivables started, it was found that the funds from the loan was diverted offshore accounts in India and Mauritius. According to the WSJ report quoting people familiar with the matter, BNP Paribas helped BlackRock’s HPS Investment Partners finance the loans to Brahmbhatt's companies. HPS, which was bought earlier this year by BlackRock, started lending to at least one financing arm affiliated with Brahmbhatt’s telecom companies in September 2020. Since the case was filed in August, several companies linked to Brahmbhatt including New York-based invoice financing firm Carriox Capital, have since filed for Chapter 11 protection in the US. Meanwhile, the lenders in their lawsuit said that Brahmbhatt had used fake invoices, contracts and emails over the past two years to make it appear as if the money was owed to established telecom companies. “Brahmbhatt created an elaborate balance sheet of assets that existed only on paper,” lawyers for the lenders wrote. Following its initial 2020 credit, HPS hiked the amount of its debt investment to about $385 million in early 2021, and then to around $430 million in August 2024. Nearly half of the loan to Brahmbhatt’s Carriox and affiliated entities were financed by BNP Paribas, the people quoted by WSJ said. According to the report, an HPS employee in July had noticed the irregularities with certain email addresses that purportedly came from Carriox customers. That led to suspicions, with HPS officials enquiring Bankim Brahmbhatt about the alleged irregularities. At the time, the businessman had assured them nothing was wrong, but later stopped picking up their calls. When an HPS employee visited the offices of Brahmbhatt in New York's Garden City in July, they were found to be closed. On Wednesday, office suite was locked and appeared vacant, and nobody answered the bell at his listed residence in Garden City. Two BMWs, a Porsche, a Tesla and an Audi were seen parked in the driveway, and a package next to the front door lay unattended. HPS has told some clients they believed Brahmbhatt is in India, according to the report. Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder of Bankai Group, and has been in the telecom industry for over three decades. His companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice sell services and infrastructure to other telecom companies. The LinkedIn account of Bankim Brahmbhatt seemed to be deleted when Mint tried to access it. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: We broke down the eye-popping AI spending for 4 Big Tech firms — and their plans to go even harder next year

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Big Tech's AI gold rush isn't slowing down— it's getting more expensive. Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft all opened their wallets wider than ever this quarter, logging record-breaking capital expenditures on AI chips, servers, and data centers. Microsoft was the top spender at nearly $35 billion, narrowly beating Amazon. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company could increase its long-term asset spending, or capital expenditure (capex), by as much as 24% next year. Each company said it planned to spend even more on capex going forward. A few recent deals exemplify this trend. Amazon this week opened an $11 billion data center in Indiana, part of its massive AI supercluster called Project Rainier, and said it would spend $5 billion on data centers in South Korea. Microsoft recently joined a consortium of investors to buy 50 data centers in the US and Latin America for $40 billion. Even Apple, a notoriously restrained spender compared to the other hyperscalers, told investors that it expects capex spending to increase in the next fiscal year. Investors are watching closely: companies showing early AI payoffs, like Google, are being rewarded, while others — like Meta — are running out of time to prove the spending spree is worth it. "After all the expensive hires and the capex ramp, Meta's grace period for showing investors something on the non-core AI side is nearly up," Bernstein senior analyst Mark Shmulik said Wednesday in a research note. The question for investors: which of these giants can turn that spending into actual AI returns — and which are just building costlier foundations for the future? Capital expenditures in the company's most recent fiscal quarter were driven by growing demand for cloud and AI offerings, Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said Wednesday. The nearly $35 billion in spending represents a 74% increase from the same time period last year. Roughly half of that spend went primarily to GPUs and CPUs, which Hood referred to as "short-lived assets." Microsoft spent $11.1 billion on data center leasing alone for the quarter. The company previously forecasted $30 billion in capex for the quarter. Amazon spent $34.2 billion in capex in the third quarter. The world's largest cloud provider said it expects to spend $125 billion this year in capex, up significantly from $83 billion in 2024. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said the company plans to spend even more on capex in 2026 as it looks to double its data center capacity in the next two years. Meta spent $19.4 billion on capex in the third quarter, and is projecting 'notably higher growth' next year. Meta also adjusted its capex guidance range for 2025 from $70 billion to $72 billion, up from its previous estimate of $66 billion to $72 billion last quarter. That's almost double the amount — $39.2 billion total — Meta spent on capex in 2024. "We're seeing very high demand for additional compute," CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. The company expects to spend $116 billion to $118 billion on infrastructure costs next year, representing a 22% to 24% increase from 2025. Meta is building its own data centers and contracting space through third parties. It recently raised $29 billion for its massive data center project in Louisiana from firms including Pacific Investment Management Company and Blue Owl Capital. CFO Anat Ashkenazi told investors on the company's earnings call Wednesday that the "vast majority" of capex was spent on AI infrastructure. Approximately 60% of the spend went to chips and servers, while 40% went to networking equipment and data centers. Google raised its capex guidance for the year, projecting a range of $91 billion to $93 billion, up from its previous estimate of $85 billion. "We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're seeing from cloud customers, as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company," Ashkenazi said. Google parent Alphabet's stock jumped yesterday after it reported a boost in revenue growth from its cloud division in the third quarter. Wall Street seemed less concerned about its parent company's capex raise compared to those of its Big Tech peers. The third quarter was a "pretty solid flex" for Google, "around the AI bull case," Barclays analysts said in a research note on Wednesday. Jump to

Title: DeFi set for $2tn tokenisation boom: Standard Chartered picks the winners

About us Copy link DeFi is set for a $2 trillion boom. That’s according to Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets research at UK bank Standard Chartered, who expects Wall Street’s surging adoption of blockchain technology will drive the tokenised real-world asset market to increase by over 5,600% by 2028. That number is excluding the stablecoin market, which has ballooned to be worth just under $308 billion in 2025, fuelled by a friendlier US government. “Stablecoins are creating a platform for DeFi to continue its expansion in the coming years,” Kendrick wrote. “Their success in 2025 has raised awareness in developed markets and created the necessary liquidity onchain to enable other DeFi solutions.” He predicted that tokenised money-market funds powered by stablecoins will make up $750 billion of the $2 trillion market. The rest of the market will be made up of $750 billion in tokenised equities, and $250 billion in tokenised funds, Kendrick said. “The less liquid segments of private equity, commodities, corporate debt and real estate for the other $250 billion,” he added. The comments highlight the bullishness around tokenised assets from traditional finance. BlackRock, State Street and Deutsche Bank are just some of the financial giants muscling into this space. Kendrick said the DeFi boom is driven by three factors: surging awareness in developed markets, onchain liquidity, and the expansion of onchain lending. Ethereum has and “key DeFi protocols like Aave are going to be the winners,” Kendrick said. Indeed, Aave, DeFi’s largest lending platform, recently relaunched its institutional platform to capitalise on Wall Street’s growing interest. Earlier this week, the Ethereum Foundation rolled out a new institutional platform titled Ethereum for Institutions, a site designed to guide traditional financial institutions in integrating Ethereum’s blockchain infrastructure. “Clear pathways are essential as institutions build on Ethereum,” the foundation said in its announcement. The US government’s drive to regulate the crypto market and to police the industry less strictly than during the Biden years has fuelled the rally. It has seen pro-crypto people be appointed to key government roles, seen a landmark stablecoin bill be signed into law, and Congress seems to be on the cusp of finalising a broad markets bill. To be sure, Kendrick warns that next year presents a massive danger that risks puncturing the growth. “The main risk to this would be if regulatory clarity in the US does not materialise — a possibility if the US administration is unable to push through regulatory changes before the November 2026 midterm elections, but not our base case,” he said.

Title: Meet the ex-McKinsey exec helping NYC's CEOs get comfortable with Zohran Mamdani

Every time Alex publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Yasser Salem is not the sort of guy you'd expect to drop everything to get a socialist elected. When we met, he wore a white button-down, a tweed sport coat, and a baseball cap with a camouflage American flag on it that said "Husband, Daddy, Protector, Hero." There's no irony in his choice of hat. A McKinsey and Saudi Public Investment Fund alum who ran his own investment firm, the 43-year-old father of five is a fan of Ayn Rand and her brand of free-market individualism. Salem is now selling Zohran Mamdani's democratic socialist vision in New York City's boardrooms. In September, he launched OneNYC, a pro-Mamdani PAC that's raised nearly $400,000 from donors like Andrew Milgram, CEO of Marblegate Asset Management. While the PAC has spent money on ads — including $53,000 on a TV spot — Salem said its true goal is to act as a connective tissue between New York's business world and a populist candidate whose ascension is one of the year's top political stories. Salem's outreach follows months of condemnations of the candidate by Wall Street's elites like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Pershing Square head Bill Ackman, and Third Point hedge fund boss Dan Loeb. Billionaire corporate leaders have been spending big in a last-ditch effort to elect Andrew Cuomo. Since Mamdai's surprise 12-point primary win, Salem said, the business community has been more willing to engage with the candidate. Salem has chatted with more than 70 CEOs, roughly 30 of whom head large corporations, he said. Most conversations have been with the finance, insurance, and real estate industries, but about a third have been with tech CEOs, he said. Ralph Schlosstein, the Democrat chairman emeritus of Evercore and a cofounder of BlackRock, described OneNYC to Business Insider as "a noble effort to bridge the gap" between Mamdani, who is not well known to business leaders, and "those in the business community who are passionate about the success of the city." For his part, it has been reported that Mamdani has been on a charm offensive, meeting with tech executives and New York power brokers, including Dimon and Brooklyn developer Jed Walentas. Mamdani is listening to his critics, Salem said. He announced last week that he would keep on NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch if elected, to the chagrin of his most progressive supporters. This came after a "resounding, resounding recommendation" from business leaders, Salem said. Under rules governing PACs, Salem and OneNYC are not allowed to directly coordinate with the candidate, but he believes that there are more opportunities for partnership ahead. OneNYC is organizing a New York business advisory council that would be willing to advise a potential Mamdani administration, including Milgram and Kevin Ryan, a prolific venture investor of AlleyCorp who helped found Business Insider. Kathy Wylde, CEO of the Partnership for New York City, told Business Insider in an email that Salem is "building the infrastructure" to give business leaders "seats at the table" if Mamdani wins. She said that her nonprofit group, which represents the interests of some of the city's biggest corporations, has connected Salem with "individual leaders to hear their ideas and concerns." If the polls are correct, Salem says CEOs they've invited have "indicated that they're ready to join immediately after the election." Salem, a son of Egyptian immigrants who was raised in Manhattan, said the idea for the PAC came the night of Mamdani's primary landslide, while he was celebrating at the campaign's official watch party. He thought that if an NYU Stern and Harvard Business School graduate could join a bunch of progressive activists, maybe he could find some common ground between New York's business leaders and a Mamdani mayoralty. It was an unlikely revelation for someone whose résumé is packed with corporate strategy experience, not political organization. After a few banking internships, Salem's career took off with consulting powerhouse McKinsey, where he said he helped build infrastructure for the Saudi kingdom's response to the MERS virus in 2014. He also spent a year with Saudi Arabia's nearly $1 trillion Public Investment Fund, one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds. When Mamdani announced his run in late 2024, Salem was running Hira Ventures, his own small private advisory and investment firm, which built a Brooklyn-based urgent care clinic and a COVID-testing business during the pandemic. As he grew his businesses, he also expanded his network of New York's business and political power players. When Salem first got a call late last year to meet Mamdani through a politically connected friend, he turned it down, he said. He was "in the middle of a deal, very busy." He also saw Mamdani polling at 1% and thought Mamdani "either doesn't know what he's saying isn't achievable, which is a problem, or he knows what he's saying isn't achievable, and that's even a bigger problem." As Mamdani's poll numbers and Instagram followers continued to rise, Salem decided he was judging the campaign like a consultant — expecting a five-year plan with milestones and metrics. But Mamdani wasn't offering a step-by-step blueprint; he was setting a vision. By laying out big goals, such as "an affordable New York for all," Salem said, Mamdani could be creating the energy and momentum to make change possible. When Salem set up OneNYC, he saw a way to get business leaders to "disregard distracting noise," and set out to use his experience. "When you're a seven-year vet at McKinsey, your day-to-day is to talk to CEOs, right?" Salem said. Mamdani's platform — free city buses, a rent freeze, and higher taxes on millionaires — has rattled New York's business elite. Executives warn his tax plan could drive wealth and jobs out of the city, while real-estate leaders say a rent freeze would squeeze landlords and stall repairs. At an event on Wednesday, Home Depot cofounder Ken Langone said: "New York is on the verge of making a monumental mistake." Andrew Milgram, the Marblegate founder who donated $50,000 to a pro-Cuomo PAC before the primary and $50,000 to OneNYC when it launched, was convinced to support Mamdani because of the way his affordability message resonated with New Yorkers, calling him the "messenger of the moment." Milgram said it's obvious Salem "starts with a pretty tall order," but agreed that the idea "that we can generate real change in this city for the benefit of all" has some business leaders willing to think outside the box. Mamdani's loudest critics have threatened that if he wins, the city's tax base will flee. A poll from Victory Insights, a right-leaning polling firm, reported that more than a quarter of New York City residents would consider leaving if Mamdani won. Salem doesn't think that will be the case. "Early on, I heard almost zero about taxes, which I found fascinating," Salem said about his conversations with CEOs. Schlosstein said that many of his peers would be willing to pay more if they felt the difference in quality of life. "A good number of those who are higher income are prepared to pay somewhat higher taxes in order to have a more successful city," Schlosstein said. Salem said that CEOs have highlighted three major concerns: Mamdani's lack of experience, public safety plans, and fears that his housing affordability program would backfire. Salem explained that a potential Tisch appointment showcases that Mamdani will put "capability" over "ideology," helping allay concerns around his lack of experience or his plans for public safety. Some proposals, like free childcare, were easy for business leaders to understand. Others, like free buses, have required his background in advising to help people grasp the idea. Buses were selected because eliminating fares could also speed them up by cutting boarding time. Salem often cites a study by Charles Komanoff, the policy architect of New York's congestion pricing laws, which found that free buses would run 12% faster, cost just $600 million in lost fares, and bring nearly $1.5 billion in economic benefits. Salem says he hasn't embraced socialism but has shed a "purist approach" to capitalism over the last five years, partially driven by price-gouging among his competitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. He tries to get CEOs to see beyond labels and focus on practical differences. "It's like, guys, I am a big fan of Ayn Rand, I've read all of her work," he said. "We have a problem with labels. My position is that as business leaders, you have the added responsibility of distinguishing between labels and the actual meaning of the words." Correction: October 31, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated that Saudi Arabia's PIF was the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. Jump to

Lenskart Solutions Ltd. has raised Rs 3,268 crore from anchor investors on Thursday, ahead of its initial public offering. The company allotted 8.13 crore shares at Rs 402 apiece to 147 anchor investors. However, while 22 participated in the anchor allocation, seven refrained from doing it. The IPO which has become a buzzword in the markets, has allotted shares to 21 mutual fund houses and asset management companies. They applied through 59 schemes and collectively netted 35.34% of the anchor portion. New World Fund got the highest allocation of 3.82%. While T. Rowe Price International Discovery Fund got the second highest allotment of 3.11%, SBI Focused Fund got 3.06% stake in the company. SBI, Kotak, ICICI Prudential, HDFC and Axis were among the major fund houses in this category. While 22 mutual fund houses have acquired stake in Lenskart through anchor allocation, there are seven that did not participate. The mutual fund houses include Parag Parikh, Nippon India and Tata Mutual fud. The IPO anchor book had received bids worth Rs 68,000 crore on Wednesday, which was one day ahead of the public issue's opening for subscription, according to sources. This was nearly 10 times the issue size of about Rs 7,300 crore, and 20 times the anchor book size of nearly Rs 3,200 crore. The anchor book reflects a strong interest from foreign institutional investors, who account for 52% of the bids received. BlackRock, GIC, Fidelity, Nomura and Capital International were the leading FIIs participating in the nearly Rs 3,200 crore anchor book. Investors have taken to X their concerns about mutual funds subscribing to the IPO with its soaring valuations.

Tokenization is surging as analysts predict significant capital inflows, offering enticing prospects for retail and institutional investors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Disclosure: This is a paid article. Readers should conduct further research prior to taking any actions. Learn more › It’s no secret that one of the hottest tickets in crypto right now is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). The market grew from $15.7 billion in January to over $35.5 billion today, making gains during the current bull run and consolidating even when other areas of the market looked weak. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that savvy traders are eyeing the market with a view to profit-making opportunities, seeking the best investments as the year closes out. Whether in finance, commodities, or real estate, there are a number of potential RWAs which merit closer scrutiny. Here we take a look at which real-world assets could lead the pack through 2025 and beyond. Tokenization is on a growing adoption curve as analysts predict capital inflows from retail and institutional investors alike. For anyone seeking to ride the crest of this liquidity wave, there are a number of options worthy of further scrutiny. ConstructKoin (CTK) – ConstructKoin is a newcomer to the field already garnering significant coverage in the trades. Currently in pre-sale on Ethereum, ConstructKoin focuses on property development empowering investors to “become the bank” and earn a yield of between 7-15% through ownership of $CTK tokens. ConstructKoin is currently generating buzz thanks to its loan book funding model which is powered by next-level AI and building information management software. Lending decisions are made in hours rather than weeks, promising accelerated property development with rapid growth potential. Gold (XAUt, PAXG, etc.) – It’s been a great year for gold, soaring against fiat currencies such as the US dollar, British pound and Euro. Gold began the year at just $2,600 per ounce and now rests just shy of $4,000, offering significant upside for anyone with exposure. Thanks to gold’s popularity as an investment commodity, a number of players including Tether (XAUt) and Paxos (PAXG) offer tokenized gold among their portfolio of stablecoins. On October 17, gold prices peaked at an all-time high of over $4,300 before buy momentum eased and charts retraced. The question investors will ask now is whether 2025’s gold rush has finally run out of speed. Ondo Finance (ONDO) – Ondo is one of RWA’s frontrunners, offering tokenized US treasuries and bank demand deposits. From its launch in 2024 to today ONDO has made significant progress, rising from a price of just $0.16 to $0.69. CoinCodex shows the ONDO token is up 330% from inception and now boasts a market capitalization of over $2B. In March of this year ONDO moved $95 million into BlackRock’s tokenized asset fund BUIDL signaling greater institutional involvement in the tokenization sphere, and further bolstering proponents’ claims Ondo is ‘the Blackrock of crypto.’ From the start of 2025 the total volume locked (TVL) in Ondo Finance rose from $612 million to $1.78 billion, suggesting strong fundamentals and sustained interest. While market predictions are a tricky business, global consultancy firm Boston Consulting Group predicts the RWA market will touch $16 trillion by 2030. Expectations vary however. More conservative projections by McKinsey and Citi Group predict the market will reach $4 trillion, while Standard Chartered projects the market will soar to $30 trillion over the same period. Though analysts may quibble on the exact numbers, all agree the upward momentum of the sector is parabolic. The forecasts for tokenization look strong but for investors speculating on which asset class will perform best through the remainder of 2025, a number of key factors will come into play. Gold has performed extremely well this year, boosted by the ongoing US-China trade war, but may already have peaked. Although gold is often viewed as a hedge against inflation, this only applies in periods of highest uncertainty. Unless there are major surprises in store for global trade relations, the best days for goldbugs may already have passed. In the medium term, Ondo Finance looks strong. Key partnerships with TradFi’s heavy hitters such as BlackRock place Ondo on a strong footing, and its growing TVL suggest ONDO token may be underpriced. ConstructKoin ($CTK) stands out as a project offering double-digit yields and exposure to the real estate sector. Its design connects digital assets with a traditionally stable market, making it one to watch closely as the project develops through 2025 and beyond. Disclaimer: This was a sponsored (paid) post.
