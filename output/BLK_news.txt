On 19 November 2024, Nasdaq began listing options on BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF (ticker: IBIT). According to a report by Bloomberg, this launch follows over 10 months of collaboration between Nasdaq, BlackRock, and regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Options Clearing Corporation. Alison Hennessy, Nasdaq’s Head of ETP Listings, confirmed the launch, highlighting strong demand from investors seeking greater flexibility in managing Bitcoin exposure. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed over $30 billion in assets since its debut, making it the largest spot Bitcoin ETF in the market. Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, noted that while spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT have succeeded on their own merits, the addition of options provides a significant tailwind. Options offer investors a way to express precise views on Bitcoin’s price movement, ultimately driving greater volumes and assets into the product. In a recent blog post, Singapore-based crypto-focused proprietary trading firm and market maker QCP Capital emphasized the broader significance of this launch in their blog post, pointing out how institutional investors could benefit from regulated derivatives tied to IBIT. They noted that spot Bitcoin ETF options could attract a wave of institutions that face barriers to native crypto options platforms like Deribit. QCP Capital said that derivatives in traditional markets often grow to 10-20 times the size of the underlying asset’s market capitalization, and a similar trend could unfold in Bitcoin. Institutions may use these options to generate yield on long-term holdings, potentially compressing implied volatility in Bitcoin markets. Drawing parallels to the growing use of MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy, QCP Capital cited Q3 2024 filings showing a surge in institutional holders of MicroStrategy from 667 to 738. Vanguard alone increased its holdings by nearly 16 million shares—a 1,000% jump. QCP Capital noted that Bitcoin was stabilizing above $90,000, with the December 100k strike holding the highest open interest among IBIT options. Narrowing implied volatility spreads reflect growing confidence in Bitcoin’s trajectory, potentially setting the stage for upward momentum. The firm also pointed to broader trends in institutional adoption, such as Goldman Sachs’ plans to spin off its digital asset platform, as further evidence of the integration of digital assets into traditional finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Climate Change Stocks To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sunnova Energy International Inc. (NYSE:NOVA) stands against other best climate change stocks. According to a report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the state of the climate in 2023 was marked by record-breaking levels of greenhouse gas emissions, ocean heat, sea level rise, and extreme weather events. The observed concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide reached record levels in 2022 and continued to increase in 2023. CO2 levels are now 50% higher than in the pre-industrial era, trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributing to the long-term increase in global temperature. The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 was 1.45°C above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average, making it the warmest year on record. Sea level rise also continued to accelerate, with global mean sea level reaching a record high in the satellite record (since 1993). This reflects continued ocean warming and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. The rate of global mean sea level rise in the past ten years (2014-2023) is more than twice the rate of sea level rise in the first decade of the satellite record (1993-2002). Extreme weather and climate events had major socio-economic impacts on all inhabited continents, including major floods, tropical cyclones, extreme heat, and drought. The number of people who are acutely food insecure worldwide has more than doubled, from 149 million people before the COVID-19 pandemic to 333 million people in 2023. Weather and climate hazards continued to trigger displacement, with 1.8 million people displaced across Ethiopia, Burundi, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Somalia, and Kenya in addition to the 3 million people displaced internally or across borders by the five consecutive seasons of drought in Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, and Somalia.

According to a report published by Bloomberg on October 21, hedge funds are increasingly betting against the green economy despite significant global investments in clean energy and green technologies. Analysis of data from Hazeltree, which tracks disclosures from roughly 500 hedge funds, reveals that more funds are net short on green sectors such as solar, electric vehicles (EVs), batteries, and hydrogen than are net long. Conversely, fossil fuel sectors such as oil, gas, and coal have attracted more long bets. This shift reflects skepticism about the profitability and short-term viability of green investments, even as governments and scientists emphasize their necessity for addressing climate change. Higher interest rates have made capital-intensive projects such as offshore wind farms less viable, while geopolitical tensions, particularly around China's dominance in green technology supply chains, have deterred investments in areas like solar energy and EVs. Solar energy has seen a sharp decline, with hedge funds shorting 77% of companies in the Invesco Solar ETF as of the third quarter of 2024, compared to 33% in early 2021, when momentum for the green transition hit a peak. However, US-based companies that avoid reliance on China-dominated technologies, are exceptions. Similarly, the EV and battery sectors have seen a slowdown, with net short positions exceeding longs on 55% of companies in relevant ETFs. Fossil fuels, by contrast, have gained favor. Hedge funds are long on 53% of companies in the S&P Global Oil Index and 73% of major thermal coal companies. Rising global energy consumption and geopolitical instability have bolstered the case for these investments, even as green energy struggles to meet demand reliably. Hedge fund managers argue that fossil fuels remain essential for stable energy supplies. Hedge funds have shown optimism about wind energy, with long bets on nearly 60% of companies in the First Trust Global Wind Energy ETF, supported by growing government orders. Power infrastructure, including transmission grids, has also attracted interest, with long bets outnumbering shorts on 65% of companies in the sector. This sub-sector is considered crucial for meeting increasing electricity demands, including those driven by AI data centers. As the energy landscape continues to evolve, investors are closely watching the impact of the new administration on the renewable energy sector. With the global demand for clean energy on the rise and innovation in renewable technologies driving growth, the sector's long-term outlook remains compelling.

Title: Bitcoin Soars To New Highs Near $95,000: Analyst Reveals Bullish Price Targets Ahead

Bitcoin (BTC) achieved a new record high of $94,730, continuing a significant uptrend that began on November 5. Analysts are dubbing this rally the “Trump trade,” as the recent political developments surrounding Donald Trump’s victory have instilled renewed confidence among investors in BTC and the broader crypto market. Despite the impressive surge, analysts believe Bitcoin’s price discovery is far from complete, indicating substantial potential for further growth. Among those sharing this bullish sentiment is analyst Ali Martinez, who draws parallels between Bitcoin’s current price movements and those seen in December 2020, before the notable uptrend that ultimately led to an all-time high of $69,000 in 2021. Martinez notes that the relative strength index (RSI), a key technical indicator used to gauge momentum, is currently mirroring the patterns observed in late 2020. This similarity suggests that the BTC price may be poised for significant upward movements in the coming months. According to Martinez, if this trend continues, Bitcoin could target the $108,000 mark, followed by a potential correction to around $99,000, before bouncing back to a predicted milestone of $135,000. This forecast represents an increase of over 42% from current levels, although Martinez did not specify a timeline for these movements, indicating they might occur anywhere between now and the first quarter of 2025. In even more optimistic projections, market expert Timothy Peterson, who identifies as a network economist, suggests that Bitcoin’s current bullish trend could persist until November 2025, with ambitious targets set for the future. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peterson predicted that Bitcoin could reach $275,000 per coin by Thanksgiving Day 2025. He bases this projection on Metcalfe’s Law, which posits that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its number of users. This indicates that as more individuals adopt Bitcoin, its value is likely to increase significantly. Looking further ahead, the economist also asserts that the Bitcoin price could achieve the coveted valuation of $1,000,000 per coin by 2029, representing a staggering 954% increase from current levels. Trading at $94,730 as of this writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has seen massive gains in recent weeks, with a 26% and 39% increase in the fourteen and thirty day time frames, respectively. Furthermore, BTC has reached a market cap valuation of $1.8 trillion, making it one of the most valuable assets in the world, currently ranked 7th, just behind companies such as Nvidia, Microsoft, Google and Amazon. But quite far from the leading asset in this matter which is gold with a market cap of $17 trillion.

Title: Energy Transfer (ET): Fueling America’s Future Under $25

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks Under $25 To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) stands against other best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. As reported by NPR, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high, and so did the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. Wall Street investors consider this victory beneficial for business interests. While businesses have been victims of excessive regulations under the Biden administration, Trump is expected to ease restrictions and lower taxes. Investors were also glad to see the timely results of the election. Commenting on the scenario, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, stated: “The market’s not only welcoming a Trump victory, but [also] the decisiveness of the victory. The clouds of uncertainty have really parted” With shareholders expecting lighter government oversight of the financial sector, the sector climbed 6.16% and emerged as the best-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors. The S&P 500 bank index was up 10.68%, posting its largest daily jump in two years. Companies issuing credit cards performed especially well. A particular sector that appeared bright after Trump’s win was crypto. The price of Bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever after the win. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan told CNBC that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025 considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Simultaneously, the conventional energy sector surged keeping in mind the new President’s goal to boost fossil fuel production. However, the clean energy sector suffered with at least half a dozen developers putting projects on hold as many projects await more clarity from the new administration. The new President had stated that he would pull back the unspent funds from Biden’s climate law, calling it a ‘green new scam’. While Trump’s win has been deemed as a setback for climate protection, analysts and activists believe that the transition to cleaner sources of energy will continue regardless, considering the fact that customers and investors want companies to deal with climate change. The economic benefits from new factories and power plants that have received government support can be seen in both states led by Democrats and Republicans. Since Trump has plans to increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US, the retail stocks that have their products produced outside the country posted declines after the election. However, other retail sector stocks especially department stores and others that derive revenue from issuing branded credit cards joined in on the post-election rally, as reported by Barron’s. To compile a list of the 12 best stocks under $25 to invest in right now, we used the Yahoo stock screener to acquire a list of stocks with the highest market caps and share prices below $25. We then examined analysts’ average upside potential of the shortlisted stocks. Our list is in ascending order of average upside potentials, as of November 18. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An oil rig in the middle of the ocean, its towering structure standing stout in the horizon. Average Upside Potential: 15.67% Share Price: $17.29 Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in North America. The firm is a publicly traded limited partnership with core operations encompassing transportation, storage, and terminalling for natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, refined products, and liquid natural gas. 80 countries and territories receive the firm’s exports. Energy Transfer was formed in 1996. Energy Transfer has one of America’s largest energy portfolios, with nearly 130,000 miles of pipelines and associated energy infrastructure in 44 states transporting the oil and gas products that make lives possible. The firm has been supplying America energy for more than two decades, representing a journey from a small intrastate natural gas pipeline operator to one of the largest investment-grade master limited partnerships in the US. The firm has a leading natural gas pipeline footprint well positioned to cater to the growing electricity demand as it pursues opportunities to serve growing power loads from new demand centers across its pipeline network. Additionally, the well-balanced asset mix tends to offer strong earnings support. In this regard, the firm’s segments include Crude Oil, NGL & Refined Products, Midstream (Gathering & Processing), Natural Gas Interstate Transport & Storage, and Natural Gas Intrastate Transport & Storage. For Q3 2024, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) reported a net income of $1.18 billion, up 103% compared to Q3 2024. Volumes on the firm’s assets continued to increase in the quarter with the addition of new organic growth projects and acquisitions. Crude oil transportation volumes were up 25%, NGL fractionation volumes were up 12%, NGL transportation volumes were up 4%, and Midstream gathered volumes and produced volumes were up 6% and 26%, respectively. With a unique nationwide footprint, a portfolio of assets with exceptional product and geographic diversity, and export capabilities, Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET) ranks as one of the best stocks currently trading below $25. Overall, ET ranks 12th on our list of best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ET as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than ET but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks Under $25 To Invest In Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where América Móvil, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE:AMX) stands against other best stocks under $25 to invest in right now. As reported by NPR, the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared to a record high, and so did the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election. Wall Street investors consider this victory beneficial for business interests. While businesses have been victims of excessive regulations under the Biden administration, Trump is expected to ease restrictions and lower taxes. Investors were also glad to see the timely results of the election. Commenting on the scenario, Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, stated: “The market’s not only welcoming a Trump victory, but [also] the decisiveness of the victory. The clouds of uncertainty have really parted” With shareholders expecting lighter government oversight of the financial sector, the sector climbed 6.16% and emerged as the best-performing of the eleven major S&P 500 sectors. The S&P 500 bank index was up 10.68%, posting its largest daily jump in two years. Companies issuing credit cards performed especially well. A particular sector that appeared bright after Trump’s win was crypto. The price of Bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever after the win. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan told CNBC that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025 considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Simultaneously, the conventional energy sector surged keeping in mind the new President’s goal to boost fossil fuel production. However, the clean energy sector suffered with at least half a dozen developers putting projects on hold as many projects await more clarity from the new administration. The new President had stated that he would pull back the unspent funds from Biden’s climate law, calling it a ‘green new scam’. While Trump’s win has been deemed as a setback for climate protection, analysts and activists believe that the transition to cleaner sources of energy will continue regardless, considering the fact that customers and investors want companies to deal with climate change. The economic benefits from new factories and power plants that have received government support can be seen in both states led by Democrats and Republicans. Since Trump has plans to increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US, the retail stocks that have their products produced outside the country posted declines after the election. However, other retail sector stocks especially department stores and others that derive revenue from issuing branded credit cards joined in on the post-election rally, as reported by Barron’s. To compile a list of the 12 best stocks under $25 to invest in right now, we used the Yahoo stock screener to acquire a list of stocks with the highest market caps and share prices below $25. We then examined analysts’ average upside potential of the shortlisted stocks. Our list is in ascending order of average upside potentials, as of November 18.

For the third quarter of 2024, Cenovus Energy Inc. (NYSE:CVE) recorded total revenues of approximately $14.2 billion which declined year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity prices affecting both upstream and downstream results. Total upstream production was 771,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a decrease over the year due to turnarounds at Christina Lake, Rainbow Lake, and other Conventional facilities. In the downstream, total throughput rose by about 20,000 barrels per day from the second quarter to almost 643,000 barrels per day, and a major turnaround was completed at the Lima Refinery. Additionally, Cenovus is progressing well on many projects that are expected to improve shareholder returns for the long term.

Title: Ripple Labs Future Under Trump: CEO Brad Garlinghouse Outlines Vision For 2025
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/ripple-2/ripple-labs-future-under-trump-ceo-brad-garlinghouse-outlines-vision-for-2025/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T06:30:03Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with FOX Business, Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, shared insights on the so-called “Trump trade” impacting crypto prices, as evidenced by Bitcoin’s recent streak of consecutive all-time highs over the past 48 hours. Garlinghouse also discussed how Ripple, and the broader digital asset industry, fit into the upcoming regulatory landscape expected under President-elect Donald Trump in the coming year. Garlinghouse emphasized that since its inception, Ripple has focused on addressing the inefficiencies of traditional cross-border payments, which he described as “slow and expensive.” By utilizing XRP, the company aims to streamline these transactions, making them faster and more cost-effective. However, the CEO criticized the Biden administration’s stance on digital assets, referring to it as an “unlawful war” against the industry. He expressed optimism that with Trump’s pro-crypto approach, the landscape may be transforming. When asked about the potential for increased revenue opportunities in the US under the upcoming regulatory changes, Garlinghouse explained that the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against XRP had effectively “frozen” Ripple’s market potential in the country. Currently, 95% of Ripple’s customer base is located outside the US, with Garlinghouse pointing out that the company cannot fully realize growth in a market where regulatory clarity is lacking. Garlinghouse observed that while the cryptocurrency industry is flourishing in countries like China, Japan, the UK, and Switzerland, the US has lagged behind in embracing digital assets. Ripple’s CEO expressed hope that the anticipated deregulation under Trump would lead to clearer guidelines, allowing agencies like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to play a constructive role in shaping the industry. Garlinghosue criticized the existing regulatory framework, particularly the application of the Howey Test, which he believes fails to adequately address the unique characteristics of the crypto sector. He also underscored the need for updated regulations that reflect the realities of an industry that has developed significantly over the past decade. During the interview, FOX Business highlighted comments from Coinbase’s Chief Policy Officer, Faryar Shirzad, regarding the private meeting between Trump and Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. Shirzad noted that Trump has expressed a willingness to engage with the crypto industry, fostering a vision for the US to become the global leader in digital assets. Garlinghouse echoed these sentiments, recognizing Coinbase’s influential role in advocating for the cryptocurrency agenda during the election campaign. As speculation mounts regarding potential candidates for the SEC chair position under Trump—names like Dan Gallagher, Teresa Goody, and Commissioner Mark Uyeda have surfaced—Garlinghouse emphasized the importance of the new chair working collaboratively with Congress to address regulatory gaps that contribute to confusion in the market. Garlinghouse concluded with an optimistic outlook, stating that he believes a new era for cryptocurrency is on the horizon in the US. He envisions the country becoming a central hub for digital assets and blockchain technology over the next five to ten years. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $1.10, marking a massive 104% surge in just two weeks since Trump’s election victory. However, the token is still trading 67% below its all-time high of $3,040, which it reached nearly seven years ago.

Now, as traders bet on a Trump bitcoin "game-changer," a leak has revealed Trump could appoint the first ever White House "crypto czar." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has helped the bitcoin price boom this year. Trump's top team is meeting with bitcoin and crypto experts and industry executives to discuss creating a White House role dedicated to cryptocurrency policy, overseeing policy and regulation across the federal government, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. The appointment of a White House crypto czar would likely boost already sky-high expectations that Trump could create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve that would see him follow through on promises made during a July bitcoin conference to make the U.S. the "crypto capital of the planet." Speculators on the crypto-powered Polymarket prediction platform now see a more than 40% chance that Trump will create a bitcoin strategic reserve, with the odds climbing sharply following the leak of Trump's crypto czar discussions. Earlier this year, U.S. senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) introduced The Bitcoin Act to Congress, calling for the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve to reduce the U.S.'s spiraling, near-$36 trillion national debt by buying 1 million bitcoin over five years. Trump has surrounded himself with heavily pro-bitcoin and crypto advisors through 2024, with some of his high-profile cabinet appointments known to be supporters of bitcoin and crypto. This week, Trump named Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick, who claims to "have hundreds of millions of dollars of exposure to bitcoin," to be his Commerce secretary. "Bitcoin, which is rare and is special, will become ever more rare, ever more valuable, over time it'll be financed just like gold [and] oil. Bitcoin will be way, way, way higher—sometimes lower—you just have to have faith," Lutnick, who is the U.S. custodian for Tether's $130 billion stablecoin USDT via Cantor Fitzgerald, said earlier this month.

Title: Forêt restaurant review: A masterclass in French classic cooking in Dublin 4

I’ve been banging on about the lack of proper French restaurants in Dublin for years. Loudly. And, until recently, to absolutely no avail. If dining trends are cyclical, the 2015 closure of Racine in London – where I once dined on Henry Harris’s famed tête de veau with sauce ravigote, minus the calf’s brain (something to do with supply, I was told, though it didn’t stop the obvious jokes) – marked the end of bourgeois cooking and the dominance of new Nordic cuisine and its small plates. Now, London has gone full bouchon (Lyonnaise style restaurant). Harris is back, rattling pans at Bouchon Racine (good luck getting a booking), and bouchon-inspired spots are springing up faster than champignons after a downpour: Josephine Bouchon, Henri, Café Francois, Marceline – proof, if it were needed, that the Gallic revival is in full swing. And Dublin? Rien du tout. Until now. John and Sandy Wyer got wind that the space above O’Brien’s pub, conveniently next door to their fine dining spot, Forest Avenue, on Sussex Terrace, had become available. Formerly The Sussex, the room came pre-loaded with bistro charm: Victorian flourishes, casual wooden tables, and banquettes you can sink into. A few tweaks later, et voilà – a proper bistro, at last. They’ve named it Forêt, staying true to their woodland theme (see also: Little Forest in Blackrock). The menu is a celebration of French cooking at its most confident. Petites Assiettes (snacks) include house-made saucisson, leek vinaigrette, Bayonne ham and oysters mignonette (€3 each), a bright and briny opener. From the tempting Les Entrées, comes the terrine de campagne (€16). This rustic staple, straight from the bouchon playbook, is robust, slightly coarse, and made with Oxford Sandy and Black suckling pig from Dermot Allen’s Winetavern Farm in Wicklow. It’s crowned with an amber gelée, lightly laced with sherry (if I’m not mistaken), delivering a rich, savoury depth when spread onto the toasted sourdough. The violet mustard on the side is sharp enough to jolt you awake, while the cornichons add just the right tangy crunch to balance the richness. For our other starter, a salad of green beans (€12) mingles with rocket, lettuce, hazelnuts and potato in a velvety dressing that pools on the plate, topped with grated mimolette, the nutty Edam-style cheese from Lille. It’s simple but beautifully executed. [ Ballyfin restaurant review: ‘Downright dazzling, one of the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year’Opens in new window ] The French wine list is a salute to tradition, carefully chosen without falling into populist clichés and favouring low volume producers. There are eight wines by the glass (which are also available as half bottles), and the Forest Avenue house wine, a very good Burgundian Chardonnay (€48), carries us happily through the meal. The fish, halibut Grenobloise with artichoke purée (€28), is stunning. The skin is gloriously crisp, and the pearlescent flakes of fish are so perfectly cooked they practically glow. Capers and chives bring a bright, salty punch, while pickled celery adds crunch and a vinegary bite. A creamy, lemon-spiked sauce ties everything together, while the artichoke purée sits quietly on the side, offering an earthy counterpoint to the fish, fondant potato and sauce. It’s the dish of the evening, without question. Across the table, my daughter Belle has the chicken au vin jaune (€26) which is also very tasty. The bronzed, crackling skin hides succulent free-range breast meat, while the sauce – enriched with Jura’s famed Savagnin wine, aged under flor for six years – delivers nutty, rounded depth. It’s paired with kale, finely chopped morel mushrooms, and riz à la paysanne: buttery rice laced with tarragon and dotted with tender nuggets of chicken. Desserts walk the line between indulgence and restraint. The crème brûlée is tempting, but there’s only room to share, so croissant pudding (€8) it is. Croissants from the Wyers’ Una Bakery are transformed into a luxurious bread-and-butter pudding: crispy on top, custardy in the middle, and swimming in Cointreau caramel and custard. The vanilla ice-cream, with an intriguing touch of buckwheat, is bold yet balanced. [ Parrilla restaurant review: With happy diners and cocktail shaker at full throttle, Tuesday is the new Friday at this new Mexican spotOpens in new window ] Forêt is a masterclass in why the classics endure. Why butter, cream and meticulously sourced produce remain the holy trinity of good taste – and why a perfect croissant is never just a croissant. It’s a love letter to the French bistro, where every dish is cooked with precision, seasoned with authority, and served with an unwavering respect for tradition. The attention to detail goes beyond the plate, from the well-considered wine list to the understated ambiance, making it more than just a meal. It’s an experience. And with prices so thoughtfully pitched, it’s poised to become a firm favourite. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine and water was €148. The Verdict: It’s Lyonnaise bouchon in spirit and pure joy on the plate. Food provenance: Glenmar, Kingsbury Wagyu, Winetavern Farm, McNally Farm, and Castleruddery Farm. Vegetarian options: Leek vinaigrette, egg mayonnaise with celeriac rémoulade, onion velouté, green bean salad and vegetarian pithivier for main course. Wheelchair access: No accessible room or toilet. Music: French classics, from Georges Brassen to Gillian Hills.

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach $95,000 For The First Time In History

Bitcoin broke through $95,000 this evening. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin prices attained their latest all-time high this evening when they climbed to $95,000 for the first time ever. The world’s most prominent digital currency, which has been enjoying some very compelling upside in recent weeks, rose to $95,000.20, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. The cryptocurrency has notched a series of fresh records recently as it benefits from very strong momentum and a wide range of bullish factors. Several analysts commented on the digital asset’s strength as of late, as well as developments that have helped fuel its aggressive gains. “It seems that almost every day Bitcoin makes a new all time high!” the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O said via emailed comments. “There are rumors circulating that Bitcoins latest push could be due to 1) Bitcoin ETFs recording over $1 billion inflows in 48 hours with ARKS ARKB leading the way with $267.3 million in inflows and 2)BlackRock Bitcoin ETF options launching with $1.9 Billion dollars traded on it’s first day!” she stated in reference to today’s upward movement. The market observer emphasized the strong inflows enjoyed by bitcoin exchange-traded funds and the significant interest in options contracts based on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, which trades under the ticker symbol IBIT. Interestingly enough, the total bitcoin held by U.S. bitcoin ETFs recently surpassed 1 million units, according to figures that CryptoQuant analyst Julio Moreno supplied via Telegram chat. The chart below illustrates this milestone: U.S. bitcoin ETFs' total bitcoin holdings recently passed 1 million units. One analyst emphasized how intense demand for bitcoin is right now as the digital currency benefits from a very compelling combination of bullish factors. “Bitcoin’s climb to $95,000 feels like humanity finally boarding a lifeboat while the legacy financial system’s Titanic takes on water,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Persistent inflation, fiat instability, and a lack of trust in central banks are driving both individuals and institutions toward Bitcoin as the ultimate store of value,” he added. “Today’s surge likely stems from a perfect storm: rising demand, a supply crunch, and unwavering conviction from long-term holders.” One market observer spoke to just how bright bitcoin’s future seems to be. George Kailas, CEO of Prospero.ai, spoke to the digital currency’s current situation, emphasizing that “Typically you have at least some reasonable Bull and Bear case on anything.” “For example we have followed COIN through BTC to profit heavily off the ‘Trump trade’ the other stock we targeted before the election was Tesla,” he noted. “We said it would move around full self driving and sure enough it did around positive news this week. But you see things like this questioning the viability of FSD.” “There is some Bear case that is being made,” stressed Kailas. “I don't see a Bear case over the next 4 years right now for BTC so that is invariably going to create an environment where more and more major players jump on that bandwagon because it is glaring them in the face.” Disclosure: I own some bitcoin, bitcoin cash, litecoin, ether, EOS and SOL.

Title: Bitcoin breaks $95,000 for first time on optimism over Trump crypto plans

By Tom Westbrook, Samuel Indyk and Suzanne McGee SINGAPORE/LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Bitcoin came within a whisker of closing above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as U.S. president spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's largest cryptocurrency was trading between $98,000 and $99,000 in late afternoon trading in the U.S. on Thursday, after briefly touching $99,073. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 40% in the two weeks since Trump was voted in as the next U.S. president and a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers were elected to Congress. Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump has said he will replace. Trump also unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Over 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance. "Everyone who’s bought bitcoin at any point in history is currently in profit," Alicia Kao, managing director of crypto exchange KuCoin, said. "But those who bought it early, when there were significant obstacles to doing so and there was the might of the world’s financial and governmental forces intent on crushing it, are the real winners. Not because they’re rich, but because they’re right.” Bitcoin's rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January this year. The Securities and Exchange Commission had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. CRYPTO RUSH More than $4 billion has streamed into U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds since the election. This week, there was a strong debut for options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s ETF, with call options - bets on the price going up - more popular than puts. "There is a persistent bid in the market," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a digital assets hedge fund in Miami. "$100,000 is a foregone conclusion." Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price and shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings were up nearly 2.3% on Thursday. “Once you break out to new highs, you attract a lot of new capital," John LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute, said. "It's like gold in the 1970s, where this new high is in a price discovery mode. You don't know how high it's going to go," he said. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticized for its energy usage, with miners under scrutiny over their potential impact on power grids and greenhouse gas emissions due to their energy-intensive operations. Crypto crime also remains a concern, with an analysis by crypto researchers Chainalysis finding that at least $24.2 billion worth of crypto was sent to illicit wallet addresses last year, including addresses identified as sanctioned or linked to terrorist financing and scams.

Title: Bitcoin Gains VanEck’s Official Support As Strategic Reserve

Time Published: 2024-11-21T01:00:13Z

The firstborn cryptocurrency has found another ally in the traditional financial sector after a respected global investment company affirmed its support for making Bitcoin a strategic reserve. The backing of VanEck, a respected name in the investment sector, in Bitcoin shows the coin’s growing appeal even to traditional financial players, a remarkable milestone that could benefit the whole crypto space. Well-known asset manager VanEck announced that it is throwing its support to Bitcoin, saying that it will advocate for the plan of US President-elect Donald Trump to turn the crypto into a national strategic reserve. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, made the official announcement of the investment firm’s stance on the idea, committing himself to champion Trump’s proposal. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: VanEck Endorses Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. No need for ‘sources’—we’ll just tell you ourselves. https://t.co/ZO28dqiBqC — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) November 19, 2024 VanEck will join fellow international asset manager BlackRock in the growing supporters of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, another positive development on the intensifying discussion of the role of digital assets in American economic policy. It can be recalled that in 2017, the global asset management company was the pioneer in pushing for a future-based BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the country. As of writing, VanEck holds over 13,000 BTC with an estimated value of over $1.2 billion. In a campaign last July, Trump unveiled his vision of making the US the most successful nation in the cryptocurrency sector, announcing his plan to establish a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile” in the country. Trump said that he plans to make it a policy to keep all of the Bitcoin the US government “currently holds or acquires into the future”, adding that this BTC stockpile will become the core of the strategic national crypto reserve. During his campaign, Trump promised cryptocurrency players and investors that he would champion the sector and advocate for its deregulation. The entire crypto space is now counting on the incoming President to deliver on this commitment during his administration. Earlier this week, Satoshi Action Fund (SAF) co-founder and CEO Dennis Porter confirmed that premier asset manager BlackRock will back the strategic Bitcoin reserve concept. Porter believes that Trump’s government would push for the crafting of an executive order that would establish the BTC reserve, providing an optimistic outlook on the future of the alpha crypto. He added that the first step to making this reserve a reality is appointing a “pro-Bitcoin Treasury Secretary” who can initiate the creation of the strategic reserve. Moreover, Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced proposed legislation that would be key to the strategic Bitcoin reserve concept. Lummis urged the US Congress to pass the Boost Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act. If Lummis’ bill is enacted, all the Bitcoin owned by the American government is to be preserved and not sold. Current estimates showed that the US government holds 69,370 BTC with a value of $6.4 billion. Featured image from Reddit, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Emerging AI Stocks You Should Keep on Your Radar.

As reported by CNBC on November 13, OpenAI’s "blueprint for U.S. AI infrastructure" outlines plans for AI economic zones, utilizing the U.S. Navy's nuclear expertise, and attracting private investment in government projects. The proposal includes a North American AI alliance to compete with China and a National Transmission Highway Act to modernize the grid. OpenAI views AI as a transformative technology, driving job creation, economic growth, and advancements in energy and chip manufacturing. The blueprint recommends speeding up permitting processes and creating research hubs at public universities. It also calls for expanding energy and fiber connectivity with government-backed funding.

CNBC recently discussed the future of AI with Kunle Olukotun, co-founder and chief technologist at SambaNova Systems. The discussion centered on the growing demand for AI in 2025, with major tech companies continuing to invest heavily in infrastructure. While these companies are shifting from AI experimentation to deployment, there’s a significant focus on the transition from training models to using them in real-world applications. This change is leading to more complex AI systems, which integrate multiple models for business automation. Kunle Olukotun expects that in 2025, businesses will move beyond pilot phases, widely adopting AI systems that involve more complex reasoning and interactions, rather than simple chatbots. The key to this shift will be rapid inference capabilities.

Title: Is Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (SQM) the Best Fertilizer Stock to Buy?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sociedad-qu-mica-y-minera-233331270.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Fertilizer Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) stands against the other fertilizer stocks. The fertilizer industry is a crucial sector in agriculture that focuses on the production and distribution of substances that enhance plant growth. By supplying necessary nutrients, fertilizers help improve crop yields and quality, which are essential for feeding the growing global population. The industry has evolved significantly over time, with modern practices relying heavily on chemically manufactured fertilizers to support large-scale farming and meet the global demand for food. According to Mordor Intelligence, the global fertilizer market is estimated to have reached a value of $381.7 billion in 2024. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.99% during 2024-2030 to reach $541.2 billion by ​the end of the forecast period. READ ALSO: 10 Undervalued Chemical Stocks to Invest In and 7 Best Agriculture Stocks to Buy Right Now. There is a strong sense of optimism within the industry. The Fertilizer Institute’s 2023 Industry Trends Survey highlighted a positive outlook within the fertilizer sector, with many respondents expressing confidence in future growth. About 40% of those surveyed believe that market conditions have improved over the past five years, despite challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions. Companies attribute their resilience to strategic practices such as precommitment purchases and careful planning. Nearly 80% of participants are optimistic about their businesses being equally or more profitable in the next five years. The fertilizer industry is currently experiencing several key trends that are shaping its future. Advances in technology are transforming how fertilizers are produced and applied. Innovations such as precision agriculture, which uses data analytics and sensors, help farmers optimize fertilizer usage based on specific soil conditions and crop needs. Additionally, there is a growing demand for fertilizers that offer more nutrients while reducing their environmental impact. The emphasis on maximizing the efficiency of fertilizer application to promote sustainable farming practices is increasing, which is driving the development of new and innovative solutions. On August 13, CNBC reported that Windfall Bio, a California-based startup, is addressing methane emissions using "mems," or methane-eating microbes. These microbes naturally consume methane and convert it into fertilizer. This innovative approach helps reduce harmful methane from sources like agriculture, landfills, and oil production. Farmers can use the fertilizer produced, while companies generating waste methane can sell it back to Windfall, creating a new revenue stream. These trends indicate a dynamic shift in the fertilizer industry, balancing the need for increased food production with environmental sustainability and innovation. Methodology To compile our list of the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest fertilizer companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources to compile a list of the best fertilizer stocks. We carefully verified our list to remove any companies that can not be classified as fertilizer stocks. From an initial pool of over 15 fertilizer stocks, we focused on the stocks that analysts believe possess the greatest potential for growth. Finally, we ranked the 8 best fertilizer stocks to buy now based on their average price target upside potential according to analysts, as of November 18, 2024. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:SQM) is a Chilean company that offers a variety of products for different industries, including agriculture, health, nutrition, and renewable energy. The company is well-known for its fertilizers, particularly potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate, which are essential for enhancing crop yields. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) also produces lithium and iodine. In the first half of 2024, SQM reported revenues of $2.37 billion, a decrease from $4.31 billion in the same quarter last year. Despite this drop, the company experienced strong sales growth in its lithium, iodine, and fertilizer segments, with fertilizer demand increasing by over 20% compared to last year. Although Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A.’s (NYSE:SQM) performance in its recent quarter was less than ideal, it has demonstrated resilience with a compound annual growth rate of 10% in revenue over the past decade. Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) is one of the best fertilizer stocks to buy now. Analysts are optimistic about SQM’s future. The 12-month median price target for the stock set by analysts indicates a potential upside of 34% from the current stock price.

Abstract graphics processing unit (GPU) - a part of the AI value chain. Artificial Intelligence has been reshaping our world at breakneck speed, with ChatGPT hitting 100 million users in just two months and Nvidia hitting revenue of $32.8 billion solely in the third quarter of 2024. AI is no longer a sci-fi concept but a business necessity and an integral part of our economy. Yet despite this explosive growth, participating in the economic layer of AI remains challenging for many. Here's where AI Finance stands a chance to change the rules of the game. AiFi is a new financial framework bridging the AI economy with decentralized finance, that democratizes access to AI-related assets such as GPUs or data, creating new value streams. At the same time, it’s powering DeFi with agents and AI-enhanced applications. Over the years, the decentralized finance community has built the foundations that made it possible for AiFi to emerge. The way DeFi and its primitives - like onchain lending - evolved enabled the industry to have an adaptable infrastructure for all kinds of assets, both crypto-native and not. Tokenization, as a process of bringing off-chain assets onto the blockchain, paved a way for non-crypto assets to boom back in 2023. Tokenized real-world assets, especially money market funds, exemplify how the integration of non-crypto assets has found a product market fit in an onchain economy. The biggest asset manager in the world, BlackRock, has dominated the crypto market at a 22% market share with its tokenized money market fund, BUIDL token, marking yet another milestone for RWA adoption within TradFi. Using DeFi infrastructure for tokenized assets has already made waves, passing over 10 billion TVL. But it’s only the beginning. The numbers tell a compelling story. With the global artificial intelligence industry revenue expected to be around $1.8 trillion by 2030, the AI economy stands as a strategic sector for tokenization. However, staggering projections often mask significant barriers to entry. Substantial capital investment and technical expertise are required to participate in the AI market, leaving smaller organizations on the sidelines with a lack of resources for funding further expansion. In addition, the nascent stage of this technology and the lack of global AI markets lead to limited access for various user segments, particularly retail, and hinder the potential revenue growth of AI companies. This is where blockchain technology and tokenization enter the picture. By bringing AI-related assets onchain, AiFi creates liquid markets for previously illiquid or inaccessible resources: Blockchain-based tokenization is the key to making assets tradeable, programmable, or composable - features impossible within traditional finance. The blockchain itself should be viewed as financial rails for these new markets, enabling: Numbers don't lie. The growth of AI has created an unprecedented opportunity for many to participate in. Estimations show a bullish perspective for various elements of the AI value chain, with the example of data centers where their demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% to 15% between now and 2030. These metrics paint a picture of a sector that will display competitive revenue streams. With that, AiFi, as a new framework aims to financialize the AI economy by bringing it onchain for individuals to get exposure to it. And on the other hand, for SMEs and organizations to monetize their datasets and models, or have an alternative way to fundraise capital for expansion. Creating new AiFi-oriented markets makes both AI developers and investors participate in the tokenized AI economy. And now that the vision of Agentic Web has already taken root in Web3, the AiFi narrative gains even more credibility. Where Is AiFi Heading AI-Fi is a blend of two powerful technologies, with AI posing as an overpowering industry and blockchain serving as its financial layer. Tokenization makes it possible for real-world yield via high-quality cash flows into the DeFi ecosystem. It also makes monetizing AI services, such as machine learning models transparent and programmable. Even though the AiFi paradigm of making the AI economy more accessible is at an early stage, it leverages already established DeFi infrastructure and best RWA tokenization practices, all while addressing the AI sector's barriers.

Title: Jim Cramer Says He’s A ‘Kaching Kaching’ When It Comes To Cameco Corporation (CCJ)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 8 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) stands against Jim Cramer's other stocks. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his insights on several key topics. He discussed the recent turmoil in the pharmaceutical sector, which followed the news that President-elect Trump is considering Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the position of Secretary of Health and Human Services. Cramer pointed out that the pharmaceutical industry took a significant hit after the announcement, but he believes this may present solid buying opportunities. Cramer acknowledged that RFK Jr., whom he humorously referred to as "Bobby Jr. for some Sopranos flavor," has a strong anti-big pharma stance, which could be a concern for the sector. However, Cramer emphasized: “... There's a whole federal bureaucracy at HHS and frankly, I don't think Trump will let him wreck a pretty important sector of the stock market.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Is Focused on These 15 Stocks This Week and Jim Cramer Talked About These 11 Stocks Recently Cramer further addressed the potential confirmation of RFK Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. He suggested that while there is a debate about whether the Senate will provide confirmation for him, he believes RFK Jr. will likely be approved. However, Cramer remained less concerned about RFK Jr. causing significant damage to the pharmaceutical industry, noting that he doesn't expect him to have much success in pushing his anti-vaccine or anti-pharma agenda. Moving on to broader market trends, Cramer commented: “After the initial Trump rally euphoria in the wake of the election, we quickly transitioned to a Trump rally hangover last week with the averages getting clobbered.” He highlighted that semiconductor stocks were among the hardest hit, partially due to the typical tech sector sell-off when bond yields rise, as they did last week. Cramer also expressed concern, saying: “With the election results from earlier this month and the second Trump administration coming in about two months, I am very worried about companies that are hostage to the Chinese economy.” Finally, Cramer turned his attention to autonomous vehicles, suggesting that while the Trump administration’s plans for self-driving cars may sound ambitious, they could be more difficult to execute in practice. He pointed out that a variety of state and local governments would need to align on new regulations, and the notion that the federal government could allow self-driving cars nationwide with a simple executive order seemed "just plain fanciful." Despite this, Cramer advocated for owning TSLA, not because of any regulatory changes under Trump, but because he believes in the vision and leadership of the company’s CEO, Elon Musk. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 8 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 18 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up of the reactor core, highlighting the complexity of the uranium power process. Cramer mentioned that Cameco Corporation (NYSE:CCJ) is expensive and said: “Look, all the uranium players are up. I think that they're going to amount to very little in the end. This is not an expensive stock. I understand why you want to be in it, not versus the others, but it is an incredibly expensive stock versus the rest of the market. That's what I care about. I am a kaching kaching when it comes to Cameco.” Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) supplies uranium for electricity generation and offers nuclear fuel processing, reactor technology, and related services to commercial utilities and government agencies worldwide. As per CNBC, on November 20, according to Goldman Sachs, the company is well-positioned for growth, particularly in light of the increasing demand for nuclear power in the United States. The company is expected to benefit from uranium prices, which are projected to rise due to a widening gap between supply and demand. Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month price target for the stock to $64 per share, highlighting the company's potential as uranium prices climb. The stock has risen by approximately 33% so far this year. Analyst Neil Mehta highlighted the company’s integrated business model across the nuclear fuel cycle, emphasizing its strengths in uranium mining, conversion, fabrication, and nuclear services through its stake in Westinghouse. Mehta also noted that Cameco is an appealing partner for Western utilities due to its limited geopolitical risks, with operations primarily based in Canada and the U.S., alongside a single site in Kazakhstan. According to the firm, Cameco’s (NYSE:CCJ) contracts are supported by favorable uranium pricing, with current contracts seeing prices ranging from $70 to $130 per pound, with the midpoint around $100, which is higher than the current spot price of approximately $80 per pound. Additionally, Cameco’s 49% stake in Westinghouse, which is poised to play a key role in the construction of new power plants with its AP1000 reactor, presents further growth potential, as noted by Goldman Sachs. Overall CCJ ranks 6th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of CCJ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CCJ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Cramer reiterated his “own it, don’t trade it” philosophy for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) but also pointed out that the bears are out to get it these days. “Apple, own it don't trade it. If I had no stock, would I buy it right here? I would wait for a dip because the bears are all over it, every minute of the day. Keep that in mind and then pull the trigger.” Although Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a dominant force in the smartphone market, recent years have presented challenges for the company. On November 15, according to TipRanks, Jefferies pointed out that the company was granted an exemption from import tariffs during the final years of the Trump administration, and since then, the company has actively worked to diversify its production outside of China. However, currently, only around 10% of iPhone production occurs outside China. While it is possible that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could receive another exemption, Jefferies' analysis suggests that without it, gross margins could face a potential decline of 3% to 6.7%, and the company's value could drop by roughly 5% to 10%, assuming no changes in average selling price or volume. Jefferies has maintained a Hold rating on the company stock. It ought to be noted that the company is always at the forefront of innovation. Its incorporation of advanced AI tools into its flagship devices (and others) comes at a time when there is growing enthusiasm around the potential of this technology. The company is only beginning its journey in this area as CEO Tim Cook remarked that it is “just the start of what we believe generative AI can achieve” during the fourth-quarter earnings call. Overall AAPL ranks 8th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NYSE: BLK), today announced the estimated 2024 annual reinvested capital gains distributions for the iShares ETFs listed on the TSX or Cboe Canada.Please note that these are estimated capital gains amounts only, as of October 31, 2024. As these are estimated amounts, the final capital gains distributions may change by the Funds' December 15, 2024 or December 31, 2024, in the case of iShares Premium Money Market ETF (“CMR”), tax year-ends. These estimates are for the annual non-cash capital gains distributions, which are typically reinvested in additional units of the respective funds at the year-end, and do not include estimates of ongoing periodic (e.g., monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual) cash distribution amounts. The additional units will be immediately consolidated with the previously outstanding units such that the number of outstanding units following the distribution will equal the number of units outstanding prior to the distribution. We expect to announce the final annual reinvested distribution amounts, as well as the ongoing cash distribution amounts, as applicable, for 2024, on or about December 27, 2024. The record date for the 2024 annual distributions will be December 30, 2024, payable on January 3, 2025. The actual taxable amounts of reinvested and cash distributions for 2024, including the tax characteristics of the distributions, will be reported to brokers (through CDS Clearing and Depository Services Inc. or “CDS”) in early 2025.

By their nature, these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual distributions to differ materially from the estimated distributions set forth in this notice. Factors that could cause the actual distributions to differ from the estimated distributions between now and December 15, 2024 (the iShares ETFs’ tax year end) or December 31, 2024 in the case of CMR, include, but are not limited to: the actual amounts of distributions received by the iShares ETFs; the actual amounts of capital gains generated from sales of securities; trading activity within the iShares ETFs, including buying and selling of securities; index changes which cause rebalancing within the iShares ETFs; and subscription and redemption activity.

Title: ‘Bud Light 2.0:’ Jaguar Blasted for Ad Featuring Crossdressers but Not Cars

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/20/2024 12:23:51 PM PST by Morgana Jaguar is being blasted on social media for its ultra-woke commercial featuring androgynous models and not even a single car, with conservatives dubbing the ad “Bud Light 2.0.” The Jaguar commercial, which was posted to the car company’s social media on Tuesday, showed only androgynous individuals clad in bizarre attire that would hardly fit in at a fashion show. The advertisement also failed to showcase even one single vehicle from the luxury car company. The Jaguar ad also featured what appears to be a man wearing a dress, and included messaging that read, “create exuberant,” “live vivid,” “delete ordinary,” and “break moulds.” One social media user reacted to the commercial, declaring, “10 [years] ago: Jags are badass muscle cars for villains. Today: Yass queen gay race communism.” “This is so the wrong timing for this. I can understand the C-suite being conned into this in 2022, but they have completely misread the moment. Bud Light 2.0,” columnist Jon Gabriel wrote. Gabriel was likely referring to President-elect Donald Trump’s landslide victory — that included winning the popular vote — in the 2024 election, which many took as a message from the American people that the era of “wokeness” needs to end. “This is the new head of brand strategy at Jaguar. Not looking good for them at all,” another X user remarked. (Excerpt) Read more at breitbart.com ...

The advertisement also failed to showcase even one single vehicle from the luxury car company.

Title: Will Microsoft Buy Bitcoin After Michael Saylor’s 3-Minute BTC Strategy Pitch To Board?
URL: https://zycrypto.com/will-microsoft-buy-bitcoin-after-michael-saylors-3-minute-btc-strategy-pitch-to-board/
Time Published: 2024-11-20T17:32:22Z
Full Content:
Bitcoin uber-bull and MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor revealed that he agreed to present a Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors, advocating for the premier crypto as a treasury asset. Saylor sees a potential Microsoft Bitcoin investment as a game-changer for the tech giant, especially as Bitcoin inches closer to the highly coveted $100,000 zone. Speaking during a Tuesday X space discussion hosted by crypto ETF provider VanEck, Michael Saylor said he will be delivering a brief, three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board. Saylor’s pitch comes amid a shareholder proposal calling for Microsoft to evaluate the potential impact of a Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation— that’s all you’re allowed — and I’m going to present it to the board of directors,” Saylor said. The MicroStrategy founder, who is a devout Bitcoin evangelist, slammed companies with huge cash reserves for “burning shareholder value”, during yesterday’s discussion. Saylor, who has led MicroStrategy to become the world’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder with 331,200 BTC (worth $31 billion based on today’s price), believes Bitcoin is a vital asset for corporations with huge hordes of cash. According to him, the benchmark crypto can add significant stability to enterprise value. “It would be a lot more stable stock and a much less risky if half of the enterprise value of the stock was based upon tangible assets or property like Bitcoin,” he explained. Saylor has publicly urged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He thinks it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Meanwhile, Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on Dec. 10 on whether the company should conduct a formal assessment of Bitcoin as an investment. Some prominent shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Despite the push from shareholders and Saylor’s advocacy, Microsoft’s board has recommended voting against the proposal, stating that they already assessed a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. As of publication time, Bitcoin had traded for $94,218, reflecting a 1.8 percent gain on the day. Its market cap stood at $1.86 trillion.

Title: DeFi’s Renaissance

Election 2024 coverage presented by The repercussions of historically stringent cryptocurrency oversight are well-documented, but the ensuing sea change is perhaps not fully appreciated. With pro-crypto legislators likely to replace the current regulatory regime, we anticipate a more favorable environment for crypto applications. Decentralized finance (DeFi), in particular, is well-positioned to reap these benefits. From opening the door for traditional finance (TradFi) to partake in DeFi, to enabling fee switches and U.S. user access to protocols, it’s hard to overstate the impacts for DeFi and stablecoins that can come with regulatory clarity. With DeFi TVL up 31% and the stablecoin market cap up 4% since the election, it’s clear that users share this sentiment. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Historically, institutions have hesitated to move on-chain due to regulatory risks. However, with bitcoin ETF AUM inflows on track to surpass the gold ETFs’ AUM within a year, finance and tech companies exploring the technology and offering crypto products, and corporates adding digital assets to their balance sheets, institutional interest in crypto has never been higher. That said, the coexistence of off-chain and on-chain capital thus far has mainly involved using on-chain capital to capture off-chain yield (e.g., Tether purchasing billions of dollars in U.S. treasuries). With regulatory clarity, we are now in the early stages of off-chain capital moving on-chain. Post-election developments, like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton expanding their tokenized money funds to new chains, exemplify the substantial capital ready to enter DeFi and are likely just the tip of the iceberg. And beyond tokenization, Stripe recently acquired stablecoin startup Bridge, McDonald’s partnered with NFT project Doodles, and PayPal is using Ethereum and Solana to settle contracts. This streamlines asset management, enhances market efficiency and liquidity, improves financial inclusion, and ultimately accelerates economic growth. Regulatory clarity will add an accelerant to this already-burgeoning activity. Similarly, DeFi projects like Ethena and Blur are starting to adapt to the evolving environment as they anticipate improvements in regulatory clarity. A frequent criticism of altcoins is their lack of inherent utility. Addressing this, Ethena approved a proposal to allocate a portion of protocol revenue ($132 million annualized) to sENA holders, bridging the gap between revenue generation and token holders. Once executed, the proposal could increase participation and investment in Ethena by directly rewarding token holders, thus setting a potential precedent for revenue sharing in DeFi. This move might also encourage other protocols to consider similar mechanisms, enhancing the appeal of holding DeFi tokens. In addition, protocols may also enable US users to access front-ends and partake in airdrops, compared to the current default of restricting US users. At the same time, development and innovation should flourish, with founders more confident about the reduced risks of building in the U.S. By expanding token utility to benefit from protocol success, enabling access to fair and free on-chain services often without rent-seeking intermediaries, and removing barriers to innovation that have made this country so great, we may be on the brink of a new era for DeFi development and usage. Collectively, these factors indicate that DeFi may be on the brink of a new growth phase, potentially expanding beyond its crypto-native user base to interact more directly with broader financial systems. The DeFi renaissance is here. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin reserve draws mixed reactions: ‘The market is skeptical on…’

BTC hasn’t priced in the potential U.S. BTC reserve, according to Blockstream’s Adam Back. The crypto market is watching two key updates from Trump’s transition team: the treasury secretary pick and the creation of a national Bitcoin [BTC] reserve. The latter has been deemed a significant price driver for BTC, yet it has elicited mixed views from top asset managers in the sector. According to VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Mathew Siggel, the firm fully supports the proposal. Siggel stated, “VanEck endorses Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” There have been mixed reports from BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. Earlier in the week, reports suggested that the firm supported the Bitcoin reserve proposal. However, Fox Business’s Eleanor Terret discredited the earlier reports, citing people close sources close to BlackRock. She said, “Sources close to BlackRock tell FoxBusiness the big money manager is not endorsing a strategic $BTC reserve despite recent reports that it is.” That said, long-time BTC critic Peter Schiff recently claimed that the proposal could affect the U.S. dollar and BTC itself if approved. Part of Schiff’s reaction read, “Ultimately, so many dollars would be printed to buy Bitcoin that the U.S. would experience hyperinflation, rendering the dollar completely worthless. Once the dollar is worthless, the U.S. could no longer keep buying Bitcoin.” However, Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the BTC reserve proponents, championed selling U.S. gold reserves for Bitcoin. The mixed views have made it difficult to gauge whether Trump will eventually create the BTC reserve. In fact, as of press time, Polymarket’s odds of President-elect Trump forming the reserve were below 40%. Source: Polymarket This could mean that a potential reserve wasn’t priced in, according to Blockstream’s Adam Back. Back projected that BTC could hit seven figures (+$1M) if players begin front-running the U.S. reserve. He said, “If the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve happens prepare for 7-figure bitcoin this cycle. The market is skeptical on meaningful follow-through for now, so that is not at all priced in.” That said, the next few days/weeks could offer more insight into whether President Trump will proceed with the proposal.
