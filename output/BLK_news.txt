Bitcoin is up more than 9% over the past week and ether is up about 7%. Other popular coins have also rallied, with solana up close to 10% in the past seven days and dogecoin up 15%. The gains have made their way to crypto-pegged stocks. Digital asset exchange Coinbase climbed 7% on Wednesday, bringing its three-day rally to 19%. The stock is at its highest since August. Bitcoin miners Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms also moved higher on Wednesday. One reason for bitcoin's 53% gain so far this year is a host of new spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds that hit the market in January, welcoming in a host of new investors. Ether ETFs followed in July. Investors have bought $1.2 billion in ETF shares in the past three days, bringing total holdings to more than $63 billion. BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has accounted for more than 30% of the new purchases. Samara Cohen, chief investment officer of ETF and index investments at BlackRock, told CNBC recently that 80% of buyers of IBIT are direct investors. Of those, 75% have never owned a BlackRock ETF, she said. "We went into this journey with the expectation that we needed to educate ETF investors on crypto and on bitcoin specifically," Cohen said. "As it turns out, we have done a lot of education of crypto investors on the benefits of the ETP wrapper." WATCH: Trump's coin sale misses targets Got a confidential news tip?

ERIC KIM Microstrategy > Blackrock You understand thedifference between having $16bn forever that you can leverage versus having $22bn that people can withdraw tomorrow. Massive, large digital capital base . Invest what you are personally excited enthusiastic about! You want to be desirable, play hard to get which means … you don’t want anybody to take you. When the covenants become restrictive, pay it off. Maybe my new strategy is to try to finance, get capital or start up capital for friends and family, at a marginal interest rate like one percent, sell micro strategy stock or whatever, to pay off the debt obligations, or to just pay off the debt in about 3 to 5 years? For example, if you could secure $1 million of funding, at one percent, But the due date isn’t five years from now, this is a good idea. The playbook is out there, just follow it! Growth machine, growth beast! *** Own 1.3% of the worlds bitcoin ￼￼￼￼￼￼ Imagine if you could own 1.3% of all the money in the world, forever. Big deal. . This is the most valuable asset in the world. ￼￼ The Bitcoin finance company *** Present a very very big vision, and people will follow. . Big risks, big rewards. . With $1 million of bitcoin, trillion dollar company We are not here to diversify *** Diversification is for suckers 150% bitcoin company . 3M to 30BDigital capital is better than analog capital. Everyone’s going to think you’re crazy, until you’re right, 10 or 15 years from now. For example, 10 to 15 years ago, everyone thought that Apple Google Facebook and Amazon was a bad idea, but now it is supposed to obvious . If you want superior yield, it cannot be obvious. . . Massive yield, just one week the arbitrage is $500mn made in five days. . Six days not six years Superfast cycle which is 100% transparent . Everyone knows what day and you are going to do! Super homogenous credit; we are giving people 100% what they want! Maybe what branding is is simply giving people what they want? What you promised them? ￼￼￼ When people expect something out of you, and you follow through 100% the time, and you never deviate… This is what branding is all about? ￼ . Give Them What They Need and Want! ￼ . Sustainable, Not Sustainable Business? ￼ It seems that the only truly sustainable potential businesses on the planet don’t have to deal with some sort of analog, physical world. It must be digital. So thinking about the future and investing in and towards the future; invest in digital. ￼ .

Title: 3 Ways Bitcoin Is Like Digital Real Estate

MIAMI, FLORIDA - APRIL 7: Michael Saylor, Chairman & CEO, MicroStrategy, gestures as he speaks ... [+] during the Bitcoin 2022 Conference at Miami Beach Convention Center on April 7, 2022 in Miami, Florida. The worlds largest bitcoin conference runs from April 6-9, expecting over 30,000 people in attendance and over 7 million live stream viewers worldwide.(Photo by Marco Bello/Getty Images) For past generations, owning real estate was the average person’s golden opportunity to accrue generational wealth. But for Generation Z, there’s an entirely new touchstone that will separate the “haves and have-nots” in their retirement years: bitcoin. Here are 3 ways that bitcoin functions like digital real estate, and why it will likely eat away at its analog counterpart over time. Bitcoin is a global, uncensorable, neutral reserve asset with no counterparty risk. As long as there is demand in the world for safe value storage, there will be demand for bitcoin. Likewise, real estate will be in demand for as long as human beings need space to live and do business. Both bitcoin and real estate will always be in style with almost anyone in the world, making them ideal assets to accumulate with a low risk of long-term value collapse. “A Bitcoin is a city block in cyberspace,” said MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor during an interview on the Funky Crypto podcast in 2020. “If I told you a billion people are coming to that city, and you own the right property, why don’t you keep it in the family for a hundred years?” Currencies can be printed, and stocks can be diluted through issuance. Consumer products like phones and cars can be reproduced to meet consumer demand. Real estate is a different story, however. While more buildings can technically be constructed, it is a difficult and slow process to build more homes, especially in high-demand city centers that are already densely populated like New York, London, and Tokyo. Due to factors like geography, climate, economic activity, and zoning laws, it grows more difficult to find locations to build homes and businesses that are actually desirable. Meanwhile, as the local population and currency supply rise in tandem, demand for land in these areas increases, driving up costs over time. Bitcoin is likely to experience similar price appreciation to real estate over time since the asset is also reliably scarce. With a hard-coded supply cap of just 21 million units, bitcoin has repeatedly proven to appreciate faster when US interest rates are low. Both real estate and Bitcoin make for excellent long-term stores of value, and powerful hedges against inflation. Bitcoin’s loudest critics have long contested that it lacks real value because it is a non-productive asset with no intrinsic yield. “Apartments are going to produce rental, and farms are going to produce food,” said Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffet at the Woodstock for Capitalists annual meeting in 2022. [Bitcoin] isn’t going to do anything.“ But this difference is changing fast. Earlier this year, the launch of bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds in the United States gave bitcoin access to the financial rails and tooling of other investment products. What’s more, BlackRock has now received approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to list options for its bitcoin ETF. This will let bitcoin owners begin earning interest by selling call options to traders, turning bitcoin into an asset with cash flows. New technology is also boosting bitcoin’s productivity. Projects like Babylon are now working on bringing “staking” to bitcoin – a feature that lets you earn a yield on your BTC by locking it away to secure other blockchain networks. This feature is already available for cryptocurrencies like ethereum, where stakers currently earn 3.2% APR. Not only does bitcoin share the core properties of real estate that make it a superb store of value, but its digital nature radically improves those aspects. Real estate is landlocked by definition. Any particular piece of land is therefore at the total mercy of local regulations and tax laws, which can radically affect the value of a particular land investment over time. By contrast, bitcoin is a fully fungible and global asset. Efforts to heavily tax bitcoin ownership will likely drive wealthy bitcoin owners overseas to regions that will treat them and their digital possessions most kindly. Unlike real estate, bitcoin is also hyper-divisible – down to a fraction of a cent. This lets small buyers acquire bitcoin in small amounts and lets existing owners cash out of it in small pieces at their own discretion. Real estate, however, has a barrier to entry. Young people in metropolitan areas must burden themselves with a hefty down payment and tremendous debt to own a home and enter the market. Given bitcoin’s greater accessibility and superior returns to land over the past decade, it is no wonder why the asset is especially popular among young people. A survey from PolicyGenius in early April showed that 20% of Gen Z respondents in the U.S. owned crypto, versus just 5% of baby boomers. Compared to other investments, only 18% of Gen Z owned stocks, and 13% owned real estate. With digital currency now a mainstay financial instrument, the life formula for financial success is being rewritten. For boomers, it was to go to college. For Gen X and early millennials, it was to buy a home. For youth today, it might just be to HODL their bitcoin. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Akebia Therapeutics extends supply agreement with STA Pharmaceutical
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/akebia-therapeutics-extends-supply-agreement-with-sta-pharmaceutical-93CH-3666553
Time Published: 2024-10-16T15:35:20Z
Full Content:
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKBA) has announced an extension of its supply agreement with STA Pharmaceutical Hong Kong Limited, as per the recent 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amendment, signed on Tuesday, prolongs the duration of the original contract until January 1, 2032. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biopharmaceutical company initially entered into the agreement with STA on February 10, 2021, for the manufacturing of vadadustat, a drug product developed by Akebia. Vadadustat is an investigational treatment for anemia due to chronic kidney disease. Under the terms of the newly amended agreement, the companies have revised the volume-based pricing structure along with certain other provisions related to the product. These changes are expected to be detailed in the company's forthcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. The extension of this agreement signifies Akebia's ongoing commitment to the development and potential commercialization of vadadustat. The financial terms and specifics of the revised pricing structure have not been disclosed in the filing. However, the company plans to file a copy of the amendment as an exhibit to its upcoming quarterly report. This strategic move comes as part of Akebia's efforts to secure the long-term supply of vadadustat, which is currently under clinical investigation. The information disclosed is based on a press release statement. In other recent news, Akebia Therapeutics has made significant strides in the commercialization of its anemia drug, Vafseo. The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services approved additional reimbursement for Vafseo to dialysis organizations, a move that is expected to support the adoption of the drug within these practices. Furthermore, Akebia has signed a substantial commercial supply agreement with U.S. Renal Care for Vafseo, which is set to be available in January 2025. Akebia has also initiated a clinical trial, known as the VOICE trial, in collaboration with U.S. Renal Care to evaluate Vafseo's effects on dialysis patients. In a strategic shift, Akebia ended its collaboration with CSL (OTC:CSLLY) Vifor and amended loan terms with Kreos Capital VII, managed by BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), thus regaining full sales rights to Vafseo in the United States. H.C. Wainwright has reiterated a Buy rating for Akebia, reflecting confidence in the company's commercial strategy and the potential market penetration of Vafseo. Financially, Akebia reported an improvement in Q1 2024 revenues, totaling $32.6 million, despite a net loss of $18 million. The company remains well-capitalized with $42 million in cash and equivalents. As part of the executive team changes, Akebia appointed Erik Ostrowski as Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Business Officer, Treasurer, and Principal Financial (NASDAQ:PFG) Officer. To provide additional context to Akebia Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:AKBA) recent supply agreement extension, let's examine some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. As of the latest data, Akebia's market capitalization stands at $275.48 million. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024 was $174.5 million, with a revenue growth of -13.13% over the same period. This decline in revenue aligns with the company's focus on securing long-term partnerships, such as the extended agreement with STA Pharmaceutical Hong Kong Limited, which may help stabilize future revenue streams. InvestingPro Tips highlight that Akebia is not currently profitable, with a negative P/E ratio of -7.17 for the last twelve months as of Q2 2024. This underscores the importance of the company's efforts to optimize its supply chain and potentially reduce costs through volume-based pricing adjustments mentioned in the article. Despite the challenges, there are positive signals. An InvestingPro Tip notes that two analysts have revised their earnings upwards for the upcoming period, suggesting some optimism about Akebia's future performance. This could be related to the company's strategic moves, including the extended supply agreement for vadadustat. It's worth noting that InvestingPro offers 13 additional tips for Akebia Therapeutics, providing a more comprehensive analysis for investors interested in delving deeper into the company's prospects.

BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, is in talks with Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Group firm Jio Financial Services to set up a private credit venture, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The two companies will form a 50-50 joint venture to lend to businesses ranging from large companies to startups, if talks materialise, the report said, adding that a final decision on the venture was yet to be made. BlackRock declined to comment, while Jio Financial did not immediately respond a Reuters request for comment. India is seeing strong demand for private credit with a growing number of Indian alternative investment funds expanding their businesses in the category, mirroring a pick-up in activity across Asia. This would be the third JV between the U.S.-based asset management firm and the Indian financial services company, after they announced ventures to start asset management and broking businesses in India. Earlier this month, the companies got approval of the country's markets regulator to act as co-sponsors and set up a mutual fund business in the country.

The Blanchardstown to Dublin city centre route is the latest proposed BusConnects corridor to be the target of a High Court challenge. Two companies that own and operate an unmanned Go petrol station on the Old Cabra Road in Dublin 7 claim 94 per cent of their customers would be wiped out if the road changes proceed as proposed. Lissan Coal Company (Ireland) Limited and LCC Properties and Investments (Ireland) Limited say the plan includes installation of bus gates that will prevent through traffic (other than buses, taxis and cyclists) from proceeding along the Old Cabra Road. The companies, which have registered offices in Co Monaghan, say the removal of regular traffic will have a “catastrophic” effect on the commercial viability of their site. They are asking the court to cancel An Bord Pleanála’s decision of last June to approve the Blanchardstown bus corridor and a compulsory purchase order affecting its site and right of access. Their High Court challenge is the fourth concerning bus corridors approved as part of the capital’s flagship bus project. An Artane resident is pursuing a case over permission for the Clongriffin to city centre route, while two court actions have been brought by businesses over the Blackrock to city centre corridor. The National Transport Authority (NTA), which is charged with delivering BusConnects, has received planning permission for six of the 12 bus corridors. Lissan and LCC secured High Court permission this week to pursue their claims over the Blanchardstown proposal. Their senior counsel, Eamon Galligan, instructed by William Fry solicitors, told Mr Justice Richard Humphreys his clients’ business “is going to be completely wiped out”. He said Lissan and LCC are the only owner/occupiers to be affected to such an extent by the removal of a right of way for the route and their case raises “serious constitutional issues”. He said the proposal would lead to there being no access across the bus corridor to the Go filling station, yet there is no provision for compensating his clients. He said he will be seeking a pause to the effects of the approval of the scheme. Aoife Carroll, senior barrister for the NTA, said the challenge concerns an “important” public infrastructure project. She said no works are currently being carried out and the challengers’ lawyers should write to the NTA before seeking a pause of the permission. The case is brought against An Bord Pleanála, the NTA, Ireland and the Attorney General. Among the companies’ grounds of challenge is that the board allegedly acted beyond its powers in approving the project when there was no proposal to provide alternative access to the filling station. They allege it was “unreasonable and irrational” for the planning authority to conclude their business would be able to continue.

Fink’s view that the utilization of assets will become increasingly significant worldwide. Bitcoin [BTC] has rebounded strongly, breaking back into bullish territory after dipping to the $60,000 mark. Trading at $65,796.33 at press time, the leading cryptocurrency has gained 1.40% in the last 24 hours and climbed 5.26% over the past week as per CoinMarketCap. Seeing this surge, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink highlighted Bitcoin’s increasing legitimacy as an investment asset, suggesting it’s becoming a viable alternative to traditional commodities like gold. Remarking on the same, during BlackRock’s Q3 2024 earnings call, Fink said, “We believe bitcoin is an asset class in itself.” Fink in his call also stressed less on concerns surrounding regulatory changes, asserting that increased acceptance and liquidity will be the primary catalysts for market expansion. He added, “I truly don’t believe it’s a function of regulation — of more regulation, less regulation. I think it’s a function of liquidity, transparency … no different than years ago when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high-yield market occurred.” This success can be attributed to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, which, after a decade of persistent efforts, has finally received approval and has since attracted impressive inflows. He further highlighted how the successful launch of the iShares Ethereum Trust, which garnered over $1 billion in net inflows within its first two months of trading. Alongside the iShares Bitcoin Trust, BlackRock has reached $23 billion in inflows in just nine months. Echoing similar sentiments, analyst Ben Budish raised the question of how a more crypto-friendly administration in Washington might influence the market, suggesting potential regulatory changes could unlock further opportunities. However, Fink downplayed the impact of political changes, arguing that broader acceptance and legitimacy of digital assets will be the primary drivers of market growth, rather than regulatory adjustments. He said, “I do believe the utilization of assets are going to become more and more of a reality worldwide,” This perspective underscores BlackRock’s bullish outlook on cryptocurrencies and its strategic role in facilitating investment in this evolving landscape. That being said, Fink emphasized that these products reflect BlackRock’s overarching mission to simplify and reduce the costs of investing for a global audience. “We will continue to pioneer new products to be making investing easier and more affordable.” He proposed that similar to traditional markets, the digital asset landscape would grow with the advancement of enhanced analytics and data insights. “And I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets.” However, Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff voiced an alternative viewpoint when he said, Source: Peter Schiff/X Schiff argues that gold—particularly in its tokenized form—remains a superior alternative to Bitcoin. This perspective highlights the ongoing debate between the two assets, as investors weigh the merits of Bitcoin’s growth against gold’s enduring value.

Share this article US spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen a major surge in net purchases, totaling over $1 billion in the last three trading days, according to Farside Investors. Fidelity and BlackRock have been the standout performers, attracting approximately $760 million combined during the stretch. Flows returned in the green last Friday as the Bitcoin ETFs collectively drew in $253 million, ending their brief outflow streak that lasted three consecutive days. On Monday, these funds logged almost $556 million in net inflows, the highest level since early June. Yesterday alone, ETF net buying topped $371 million with no redemptions reported. BlackRock’s IBIT captured the largest share inflows, accumulating over $288 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC took in around $35 million. Other competing funds managed by Bitwise, Ark Invest/21Shares, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Grayscale, also experienced gains. Grayscale’s GBTC and BTC have extended their winning streak to two days. Inflows surged amid a rally in Bitcoin, with the price crossing $65,000 on Monday and moving closer to $68,000 yesterday, CoinGecko data shows. Bitcoin is now only 9% away from its all-time high. Standard Chartered analysts predict that Bitcoin could approach its previous high of approximately $73,800 ahead of the US presidential election. The analysts also note that the improving odds for Donald Trump’s re-election could create a favorable environment for Bitcoin, as historically, his presidency has been viewed positively by many in the crypto community.

Title: Establishment Journos Tout Migrants over Machine-Powered Americans
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/10/15/establishment-journos-tout-migrants-over-machine-powered-americans/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T00:42:26Z
Full Content:
Pro-migration journalists insist Americans need more migrants because of the declining U.S. birth rates — but they also deliberately ignore the alternative economy-growing strategy of combining automation, Americans, and exports. The growing claim that migrants are needed to replace Americans comes as polls show declining public support for the labor migration that has reduced wages, spiked housing, and imposed more chaotic diversity on Americans’ society. President Donald Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, spotlighted the flaw behind the claim that more migrants are needed for basic work in the United States, by telling a surprised New York Times journalist: One of the really deranged things that I think illegal immigration does to our society is it gets us in a mind-set of saying we can only build houses with illegal immigrants when we have [sidelined] seven million — just men, not even women, just men — who have completely dropped out of the labor force. People say, “Well, Americans won’t do those jobs.” [But] Americans won’t do those jobs for below-the-table wages. They won’t do those jobs for non-living wages … they will just do those jobs at certain wages. Think about the perspective of an American company. I want them to go searching in their own country for their own [sidelined] citizens, sometimes people who may be struggling with addiction or trauma, get them re-engaged in American society. We cannot have an entire American business community that is giving up on American workers and then importing millions of illegal laborers. The New York Times journalist — London-born, Cuban-origin Lulu Garcia-Navarro — was shocked and tried to refute Vance’s call for the federal government to help sidelined Americans get construction jobs that would otherwise go to migrants. I don’t think that many people who look into this agree with you. But about a third of the construction work force in this country is Hispanic. Of those, a large proportion are undocumented. So how do you propose to build all the housing necessary that we need in this country by removing all the people who are working in construction? But this journalist’s surprise at Vance’s preference for Americans reflects the conventional wisdom in elite D.C. circles, which insists that the economy can only be grown with more migrants — not by productive Americans and their high-tech machines. “People in the media announcing their complete detachment from society is not new,” responded Jon Feere at the Center for Immigration Studies. He continued: There’s no such thing as a job Americans won’t do, and when businesses can’t find a lawful resident to take a job, they have to consider raising wages, offering better benefits. That’s a good thing, [Reporters] don’t understand the ways the labor force can adjust. They don’t understand that mechanization can fill a lot of these jobs that they think requires stoop labor. When I hear people celebrating the ability to exploit cheap labor while attempting to project a pro-immigrant image, it’s one of the most gross, almost disgusting things I hear. They like the idea of creating a permanent underclass, they like the ability to exploit desperation. “Of course, most of these newsrooms are owned by corporations that have an interest in an endless amount of exploitable foreign labor, and most journalists don’t have the freedom to write something that goes against corporate demands,” he added. The Democrat Party’s leaders put migration before Americans. “We got the lowest birth rate we’ve had in well over 100 years,” Bill Clinton told a media audience on October 14. “We’re not at replacement level, which means we got to have somebody come here if we want to keep growing the economy.” “We have a population that is not reproducing on its own with the same level that it used to,” Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) told a D.C. audience in November 2022. “The only way we’re going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers and all of them.” “We look to the north, with Canada,” Cuban-born border chief Alejandro Mayorkas said in September. “Canada takes a look at its market needs, and it says, “You know what? We need 700,000 foreign workers to address our labor needs domestically.” And so they build a visa system for that year to address the current market condition.” Mayorkas’s Canada-style, cheap labor policy is endorsed by Kamala Harris’s 2024 economic platform. These pro-migration economic claims are driven by the Democratic Party’s self-serving desire for a greater population of poor migrants and by their consumer-economy donors’ rational desire for government-provided extra workers, customers, and renters. However, the alternative strategy would ensure greater employment of sidelined Americans, greater workplace productivity via automation, and greater exports to foreign markets via mutual trade with countries that are now used as a source of cheap migrant labor. The productivity-before-population strategy was pushed in April by Larry Fink, the founder of the $10 trillion Blackrock investment company: “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” Fink said at a pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. In contrast, countries with expanding populations need to focus on basic issues of education and the “rule of law,” said Fink, adding: So for those countries that have rising populations, the answer will be education … [and] for those countries that do not have a foundation of rule of law, or education, that’s where the [economic] divide is going to get more and more extreme Vance focused his argument on helping sidelined Americans get back to work when Garcia-Navarro insisted that there were no additional Americans who can join the construction industry. “Most people who don’t work can’t work in the regular economy — they’re in the military, they’re parents, they’re sick, they’re old, they might not want to work in construction,” said Garcia-Navarro. “The unemployment rate does not count labor-force participation dropouts,” Vance schooled her. Since Congress doubled the immigration numbers in 1990, the share of “prime age” men in jobs has fallen from roughly 93 percent to 88 percent in 2023. The share of men without four-year college degrees who are working jobs has dropped from 91 percent to roughly 84 percent. Nationwide, the drop adds up to five million non-working men. The decline in the labor force participation rate among _prime-age_ (25-54) U.S.-born men is also most pronounced among the less-educated. Sources: Figures for 1960, 1970, 1980, and 1990 are from the public-use decennial census, which is collected in April. Figures for 2000, 2006, 2019, and 2023 are from the April public-use CPS. That pool of men is not being recruited by employers for a variety of reasons, chiefly, they are too troublesome and risky for employers to find, motivate, train, and keep. But employers do not have to train those men when Mayorkas is bringing in roughly 3 million legal, quasi-legal, illegal, or tempory foreign people per year. That Mayorkas migration adds roughly 3 migrants for every four Americans born each year. Since the pushback by Vance, pro-migration activists and journalists have kept up their demands pushing for more migration Without migrants, “I don’t think there would be milk,” Pete Wiersma, the president of the Idaho Dairymen’s Association, told a credulous columnist for the New York Times. But, writer Marcela Valdes admitted, “In the long run, more dairies might invest in robotic milkers if the price of milk rose high enough to justify the capital-intensive systems.” Breitbart News has extensively covered the spreading use of labor-saving cow-milking robots and other labor-saving machines in the agriculture and meatpacking sectors. So far, Democrats in Congress have not pushed for government loans to help farmers purchase more robots, but have instead tried to expand illegal farmwork into a pathway to citizenship. Illegals comprise perhaps 50 percent of the construction labor force in Texas, so “cutting off the supply of undocumented workers, then, would be like cutting off the supply of concrete and lumber,” claimed left-wing Jack Herrera at Texas Monthly. “Far fewer homes and businesses would be built in the next few decades,” he said as he quoted construction industry leaders who are lobbying for more cheap workers. However, the vast inflow of disposable migrant workers has pushed millions of American professionals and their young replacements out of the sector. “It’s not easy to find a good worker, a loyal worker, for [the] long term,” Val Fomin, general contractor at Katz Design & Builders Inc., told Capitalandmain.com in October 204. “It is challenging. It’s almost like full-time work.” So the construction industry has “stunningly bad productivity performance,” Barack Obama’s economic advisor Austan Goolsbee wrote in February 2023. He added: Throughout the 1950s and well into the 1960s, both measures of construction sector productivity grew steadily. Indeed, they outpaced their whole-economy counterparts during that period. By 1970, however, the construction sector’s labor productivity and TFP had both begun to fall. This downturn was not temporary; the decline has continued for the past half century …. [But by 2020] measures of construction productivity had fallen below their 1950 values. In Springfield, Ohio, employers welcome unskilled Haitian migrants into jobs that would otherwise go to fewer but better-paid Americans and their computer-controlled machines. “We were having a real hard time with [American] people that would apply for a job and then they wouldn’t show up on the floor,” Pentaflex CEO Ross McGregor told two CNN.com pro-migration reporters.“Or they’d come in and they’d work for half a day and they’d just leave … You need to have a reliable workforce that you can count on to be at work every day.” But hiring Haitians means fewer robots and their American operators. “Fewer robots get adopted in municipalities with a large share of migrant workers,” said a Danish study posted in December 2022. The study added: We find that a one percentage point increase in the share of non-Western migrants decreases the probability of robot adoption by 7% … Higher wages are positively associated with the value of robot imports.” In the white-collar sector, C-suite executives prefer hiring disposable, compliant, and cheap visa workers — such as H-1B workers — instead of sharing profits and power with free-speaking American professionals. Even when pro-migration journalists try to argue that migrants are good for American workers, they miss the importance of productivity and the Americans who have been pushed out of work. “The co-incidence of stagnating wages and rising immigration really does look like just that: a coincidence,” wrote author Rogé Karma in The Atlantic — without mentioning automation, productivity, or sidelined Americans. Yet the unpopular demotion of Americans and productivity by the establishment media is now helping President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. NBC News reported: about a young American construction worker who is slow to quit his parent’s house because of high rents: For David Tasker, an 18-year-old construction worker in Pennsylvania, his top financial priorities are having enough money for gas, dining out and spending on his girlfriend while living at home with his parents. But he worries about the rising prices he’s seen during his teen years as he’s emerged into an economy experiencing decades-high inflation. For his first election, he said he will be voting for former President Donald Trump with those higher costs and concerns about the wider economy in mind.

DTX Exchange (DTX) hit $4.7 million in its presale weeks earlier than expected. The presale’s resounding success proves the project’s wide interest. It offers a unified, multi-asset trading platform with access to cryptocurrencies, equities, and real-world assets (RWA). Despite the DeFi space getting the attention of giants like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, the DTX exchange has made a mark in the space because of its unique offering. The platform bridges the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets by allowing users to trade over 100,000 assets on a single platform. These financial giants have not been able to provide this unified system, which gives DTX Exchange an edge. Traders also enjoy low fees on the platform despite providing a variety of assets and making it easier to manage their portfolios. The diversity also allows traders access to deeper liquidity in the broader equities market with over $90 trillion worth of assets. The outstanding presale performance attests to the potential of DTX exchange, with considerable early participation in its three presale rounds. The first round raised approximately $300,000. Even better, the second phase exceeded $1 million in total funds raised, while the third presale round concluded ahead of schedule, raising over $4.75 million across all rounds. DTX exchange comes with some excellent features, which it owes to the early adoption it has witnessed. VulcanX Blockchain – This is a privacy blockchain that powers the DTX ecosystem, and is the first unified blockchain to support conventional financial assets. With a throughput of over 100,000, this blockchain is expected to power the next decentralized applications of the future. DTX Unified Wallet – The DTX Unified Wallet is the first crypto wallet to support forex, equities, and crypto assets under a single secure application. More features like P2P asset trading and portfolio management tools are expected in the near future. Enterprise RWA Platform – DTX is onboarding conventional assets on the blockchain, thanks to the Real World Assets (RWA) builder platform. DTX exchange plans to bring more amazing features and offerings to its ecosystem in the near future. The team intends to make the platform available for public trading after the launch of the VulcanX blockchain. With a community of 70,000 across platforms, the exchange hopes to gain wider accessibility, which will significantly increase its reach base upon public launch. New products are also under development to add more features and capabilities to the platform.

Title: BlackRock CEO Touts Bitcoin as an Alternative to Gold as BTC ETF Inflows Hit 4-Month High

BlackRock, a $10 trillion asset manager that is also one of the largest Bitcoin holders through its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), is still betting big on BTC, as the firm’s CEO, Larry Fink, recently stated. While releasing the company’s third-quarter earnings results last week, Fink noted that Bitcoin (BTC) was in its own asset class. He also likened Bitcoin to other financial commodities, adding that it was an alternative to gold. “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself. It is an alternative to other commodities like gold. And so, I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded to the role of Ethereum as a blockchain,” he stated. Fink also believes that the digital asset industry could achieve the same growth as the mortgage market. According to him, the mortgage industry started very slow during its early years before becoming an $11 trillion industry. The same growth could also happen in the cryptocurrency industry. Fink’s recent statements coincided with a bullish sentiment around Bitcoin as the price shot up to a one-month high above $66,000. BTC traded at $65,700 at the time of writing after a 1.8% gain in 24 hours. Bitcoin’s recent price gains coincided with a surge in spot ETF inflows. Data from SoSoValue shows that on 14th October, inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $555M, the highest level since early June. Fidelity saw the highest inflows, at $239M. It was followed by the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, which saw $100M in inflows. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust saw $79M inflows, while the Ark & 21Shares ETF recorded $69M. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust also saw positive flows of $37M. These spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold $61 billion worth of Bitcoin, nearly 5% of the total Bitcoin market capitalization. On-chain analytics platform Santiment has attributed the recent gains in Bitcoin prices to an influx in short liquidations. In its recent report, Santiment noted that earlier this week, total short liquidations for Bitcoin reached $100M. Data from Coinglass shows that in the last 24 hours, more than $53M worth of Bitcoin positions were liquidated, with over 85% of these being short liquidations. Additionally, the start of the week saw a slight increase in USDT deposits to exchanges. A spike in stablecoin inflows to exchanges also tends to spur gains by creating additional buying pressure.

NEXT | Celebrate the launch of Diablo 4 Vessel of Hatred with week two of ... With the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Event right around the corner (starting October 22) we’ve now learned how to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens during the event so that we can earn the currency to purchase all of the new shiny things that are up for offer. So the question today is: how exactly do we purchase these new revamped Tier 2 sets? What are the costs? Thankfully, Blizzard made a post to address many of these things so today we’ll break down the “what you need to know” if you’re just after the Tier 2 sets.Outside of the Caverns of Time you will find a Tauren vendor named Traeya who will be your Tier 2 armor vendor.

Title: Crypto Comeback: Bitcoin ETFs Attract $556 Million In Fresh Inflows

Spot Bitcoin US exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are roaring today, recording the highest inflow in four months as a total sum of $556 million streamed into 12 funds. Coincidentally, by the time the inflow was received, Bitcoin was rebounding as it touched a two-week high at $66,500. The highest single-day flow, at $239 million, came in through Farside (FBTC), the highest since June. Others performing well include Bitwise (BITB) at $100 million and BlackRock (IBIT) which managed to attract new investors to the rake in $79.51 million. Several funds posted inflows as the market continued to rally. The shares of ARK Invest and 21Shares (ARKB) stood at nearly $70 million, while Grayscale (GBTC), the bitcoin trust, recorded its first inflow since September at a little over $37 million even if the trust struggled with massive cumulative outflows of $20 billion since its inception. Other small funds that posted inflows included: HODL, EZBC, BTCO, Grayscale BTC Mini Trust, and Valkyrie whose inflows totaled over $29 million. Their growing action also pushed the trading volumes of these 12 Bitcoin ETFs up to $2.61 billion. Analysts project that this new rise will push such funds further by using the net inflows achieved in the past 10 months which is currently at $19.36 billion. This could also be due to Bitcoin ETFs also taking more than gold-based products, reaping $1.5 billion in net inflows this year. Bitcoin ETFs rose to the highest degree as compared to Ethereum ETFs, which responded relatively better. Net inflows into Ethereum ETFs stood at $17 million led by BlackRock (ETHA) with $14 million. Other funds in Fidelity (FETH), Invesco (QETH), and 21Shares (CETH) received flows ranging from $393,690 to $1.30 million. Trading volumes for Ethereum ETFs also rose to $210 million from $143.54 million the previous day. In fact, since their launch in July, Ethereum ETFs have seen net outflows of $542 million. The total cryptocurrency market also started to recover from its losses with Bitcoin trading at $65,268. Meanwhile, Ethereum increased by almost 3% to hit the $2,594 level by the end of the day. As Nate Geraci, President of ETF Store, said, this day was a “monster day” for spot Bitcoin ETFs, as the crypto investment product continues to gain mass appeal ahead of traditional and safer assets, such as gold.

Title: DTX Exchange’s Revolutionary Multi-Asset Platform Drives $4.75M Presale

New York, New York, October 15th, 2024, Chainwire With the cryptocurrency market entering the final quarter of the year with major bullish momentum, the emerging altcoin platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has made a strong impact. The DeFi platform has raised over $4.75 Million weeks earlier than expected. This early success reflects the growing interest in platforms that offer access to a diverse range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, equities, and real-world assets (RWA), under a unified trading system. Despite the entry of financial giants like Blackrock and Morgan Stanley into the decentralized world, there is still a lack of a unified platform that integrates conventional assets like equities, stocks, and bonds with decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies. DTX Exchange has aimed to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets by allowing users to trade over 100,000 assets on a single platform. This innovative solution makes it possible for traders to access a wide variety of assets under a single platform with minimal trading fees. The global cryptocurrency industry is worth $2 trillion alone, with the broader equities market having over $90 trillion worth of assets. By enabling the trading of these assets, DTX provides traders with the chance to enhance liquidity. The DTX team aims to attract the attention of millions of retail and enterprise traders through this unique feature. DTX Exchange’s presale has seen considerable early participation across its initial rounds. The first round raised approximately $300,000 in a short period, while the second phase exceeded $1 million in total funds raised. The third presale round concluded ahead of schedule, with the platform raising over $4.75 million across all rounds to date. During this time, the token price increased from $0.01 to $0.08, reflecting initial interest in the platform’s offerings. DTX Exchange credits its early adoption to its unique product offerings, including: VulcanX Blockchain – This privacy blockchain powers the DTX ecosystem and is the first unified blockchain to support conventional financial assets. With a throughput of over 100,000, this blockchain is expected to power the next decentralized applications of the future. DTX Unified Wallet – The DTX Unified Wallet is the first crypto wallet to support forex, equities, and crypto assets under a single secure application. The product is expected to add features like P2P asset trading and portfolio management tools. Enterprise RWA Platform – DTX is onboarding conventional assets on the blockchain through the Real World Assets (RWA) builder platform. In the most recent development, the ongoing presale has sold over 50 million tokens and raised $3 million to sell out the 3rd round weeks ahead of schedule. The DTX team is now raising the token price, giving investors another opportunity to join the presale and secure DTX tokens before they launch on public exchanges. DTX Exchange has outlined its plans to make DTX tokens available for open public trading following the launch of the VulcanX blockchain. With a growing community of over 70,000 members, the platform is preparing for broader accessibility, which may help increase its reach and user base significantly upon public launch. Additionally, DTX also has an active developer community that is actively developing new products. Aside from offering a suite of trading features, DTX Exchange is expected to offer a wide range of products to developers and enterprise players in the finance world. Some notable products include the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization tool that allows stakeholders in the Real Estate industry to tokenize assets and introduce new models of investment in illiquid assets. Additionally, DTX is expected to launch the DTX Unified Wallet, which allows holding stocks, cryptos, and forex assets. Additionally, future plans include holding the Digi-Hackathon to improve platform security and integrity. With the unique approach DTX Exchange has taken to unifying digital assets, its presale performance comes as no surprise. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, the platform is designed to improve transaction capacity compared to many layer-1 blockchains. Given the rapid pace of the presale sold, the altcoin could mirror the past trajectory of other cryptos that had exponential rallies. In the past, projects like Solana, Cardano, Polygon, and Dogecoin have all surged from small-scale altcoins into multi-billion dollar projects that have become household names. DTX Exchange aims to fulfill its potential and turn into a major powerhouse in the coming months. Investors can still become an early part of the DTX Exchange community. With a current price of $0.08 and a listing price of $0.20, investors are poised to enjoy growth in value in the coming months. With broad applications for the financial sector, DTX aims to become the cornerstone of the DeFi industry and carve out a sizeable portion of the $2 Trillion trading industry.

October 15, 2024 11:00 ET | Source: RWA Global Inc RWA Global Inc ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands, Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RWA Inc. is thrilled to announce the official launch of the RWA Launchpad — This all-in-one platform is set to redefine how entrepreneurs, investors, and businesses engage with tokenized markets, offering opportunities to raise funds, launch tokens, and participate in the rapidly growing world of real-world asset (RWA) markets. Tokenizing real-world assets creates a wide range of investment opportunities, democratizing access to traditionally illiquid markets like real estate, commodities, and private equity.

Title: Why Hyundai picked India for record $3.3 billion IPO
URL: https://www.dw.com/en/why-hyundai-picked-india-for-record-33-billion-ipo/a-70499104
Time Published: 2024-10-15T14:42:00Z
Full Content:
India is the world's third-largest auto market, set for further huge growth before the end of the decade. Hyundai is banking on the $3.3 billion IPO to solidify its market position. The South Korean auto giant Hyundai launched its initial public offering (IPO) on Tuesday, billed as India's biggest stock market debut, worth about $3.3 billion (€3.05 billion). The first carmaker to go public in India since Maruti Suzuki in 2003, Hyundai is offering 142 million shares for sale, which represents about 17.5% of the total shares of its Indian arm. Retail bidding, priced at 1,865 rupees ($22.20/€20.35) to 1,960 rupees per share, is expected to continue until Thursday. The stock market listing is expected to begin on October 22. Already India's second-largest carmaker by sales, Hyundai is keen to build on the advantage gained by its early entry into the national market in 1996. Last year, Hyundai sold over 605,000 vehicles in India, a 9% increase from the previous year. It hopes the additional funds will help close the market share gap with leader Maruti Suzuki. India already has the third-largest auto sector in the world — and it is growing fast. Last year, more than 4.1 million vehicles were sold. The auto sector is a major pillar of the economy and the country's large, growing consumer base and urbanization rate, along with relatively low production costs, make it an ideal location for Hyundai to manufacture and sell its vehicles. India's government is keen to boost domestic electric vehicle production, which aligns with the Korean carmaker's strategy. Hyundai also sees India as a critical alternative to China and Russia, where sales have dropped because of geopolitical issues. The South Asian country offers a more stable environment to its peers.

Hyundai's listing will eclipse the 2022 IPO of the state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India, in which the government sold a 3.5% stake and raised $2.7 billion. Other top domestic listings in recent years include fintech giant Paytm, whose IPO was worth $2.2 billion in November 2021, and Coal India, which went public in 2010 at a value of $1.8 billion. India's stock market has been booming over the past four years, growing by 210% between April 2020 — during the first pandemic lockdown — and last month. On Tuesday, the SENSEX, the index of the Top 30 stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange, was trading at 81,820. India recently pipped Hong Kong to become the fourth-largest stock market in the world. In a sign of the popularity of Hyundai's listing, nearly $1 billion in shares were snapped up by institutional investors on Monday. The government of Singapore and BlackRock, the giant US investment firm, picked up stakes worth a total of $77.3 million, while Fidelity bought shares worth $76.5 million and domestic mutual funds were allocated shares worth a total of $340 million. Retail investors snapped up 18% of the available shares by the end of Tuesday, the first day of the public offer, media reported. India's auto market has rapidly become ultracompetitive, and smaller domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have eaten into Hyundai's market share. "India is one of the most exciting auto markets in the world," Unsoo Kim, managing director of Hyundai's Indian unit, told a news briefing in Mumbai last week. "[The] IPO will ensure that Hyundai Motor India is even more dedicated to succeed in India." Hyundai plans to use proceeds from the IPO to enhance its research efforts and develop new cars, seeking to transform the country into a production hub for other countries in the Global South. Hyundai already delivers its India-made vehicles to more than 90 countries. "We intend to become a global manufacturing hub for Hyundai for the emerging markets," Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai India, told the Reuters news agency. "In [the] next 3-4 years, [a] 30% increase in production will improve our domestic and export volumes." The Korean automaker has already invested $5 billion in the country and plans to pump in another $4 billion over the next decade to help make its Indian operations a key plank of its electric vehicle (EV) production, as well as building EV infrastructure such as charging stations and a battery assembly plant. Hyundai currently has one manufacturing plant in India for local sales and exports. Production at a second plant is expected to begin operations in 2025, which will help take the firm's total capacity in India to beyond 1 million units a year. Edited by: Rob Mudge

Title: Bitcoin inches toward $68,000 following BlackRock’s CEO crypto endorsement
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/bitcoin-election-surge-analysis/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T14:41:42Z
Full Content:
Share this article Bitcoin hit a high of $67,800 in the last few minutes, moving closer to $68,000 and just 8% away from its March record high. The surge came after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink endorsed Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Fink recently reaffirmed his support for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class during the company’s third-quarter earnings call. According to him, Bitcoin is not only a viable investment but also a rival to traditional commodities like gold. “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself,” said BlackRock CEO, adding that the company was discussing potential Bitcoin allocations with institutions worldwide. As of now, Bitcoin’s market cap has reached $1.3 trillion, a figure that proves its growing prominence and acceptance in financial circles, per CoinGecko. BTC is currently trading at around $67,400, reflecting a 3% increase over the past 24 hours. The upward trend follows a notable 5% gain yesterday, which came amid the strong performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs. On Monday, these funds collectively drew in around $550 million in net inflows, Farside Investors data shows. Market sentiment remains bullish with expectations of further increases if Trump secures a victory in the upcoming election. Concurrently, the recent rally comes amid the WLFI token presale of Trump-backed World Liberty Finance. The project raised $5 million in the first hour despite website issues. Analysts suggest Trump’s involvement could boost the crypto sector, contrasting with Kamala Harris’s more conservative stance on digital assets. The extended rally occurred around the time World Liberty Finance, the DeFi project backed by Trump, launched its WLFI token presale. The project raised $5 million in the first hour despite website issues. Market sentiment remains bullish with expectations of further increases if Donald Trump secures a victory in the upcoming election. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: These Bank Stocks Hit Highs As Goldman Sachs, Charles Schwab Post Hot Earnings

Bank stocks surged Tuesday as several major financial institutions reported earnings, as the group gets a boost from lower interest rates. Charles Schwab led a financials rally Tuesday. Five of the eight largest U.S. banks by market capitalization reported third-quarter results Tuesday – Bank of America, Charles Schwab, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs – with the most notable metrics including 18% or better annual revenue jumps from Bank of America, Citi and Goldman’s equities trading divisions and shrinking debt from Schwab. The investor response was overwhelmingly positive to the batch of earnings, with Bank of America shares gaining 3% at open, Citi rising 1.7%, Schwab shares soaring 7% (on pace for its best day since July 2023), Goldman 3% and PNC 1%, though Citi and Goldman turned negative as trading continued. National banks Goldman and Morgan Stanley tallied all-time high intraday share prices Tuesday and a host of regional stocks like Bank of New York Mellon, PNC, U.S. Bancorp stocks registered 52-week highs, while other financial services firms like American Express and BlackRock also touched records. The S&P 500’s financials sector rose 0.8%, the third-largest gain of any of the index’s 13 sectors, while the BlackRock-managed iShares U.S. Financials exchange-traded fund also gained 0.8%, notching an all-time high. The iShares financials ETF is up 4% since last Thursday, as the U.S.’ largest and third-largest banks JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo reported bumper earnings Friday. It’s not just strong Q3 results driving the bank stock rally, but rather a “macro rotation,” noted Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor in a Friday note to clients. O’Connor added the market’s increased confidence that the U.S. avoided a recession is the “best outcome for banks.” That’s because investment banks get major boosts from better economic sentiment and declining rates as companies pursue mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings, and other financing routes that require financial advisory services. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates last month for the first time in more than four years, and is widely expected to continue lowering rates. Last year was the weakest for M&A globally since 2013, according to McKinsey & Company. Though it’s been a strong stretch for national banks, many regional bank stocks have struggled to return to glory after 2023 marked the worst year for bank failures in U.S. history as regional powerhouses First Republic, Signature and Silicon Valley Banks went under in a seven-week stretch. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF is down more than 20% since the end of 2021. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: DTX Exchange’s Revolutionary Multi-Asset Platform Drives $4.75M Presale

New York, New York, October 15th, 2024, Chainwire With the cryptocurrency market entering the final quarter of the year with major bullish momentum, the emerging altcoin platform DTX Exchange (DTX) has made a strong impact. The DeFi platform has raised over $4.75 Million weeks earlier than expected. This early success reflects growing interest in platforms that offer access to a diverse range of assets, including cryptocurrencies, equities, and real-world assets (RWA), under a unified trading system. Despite the entry of financial giants like Blackrock and Morgan Stanley into the decentralized world, there is still a lack of a unified platform that integrates conventional assets like equities, stocks, and bonds with decentralized assets like cryptocurrencies. DTX Exchange has aimed to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized financial markets by allowing users to trade over 100,000 assets on a single platform. This innovative solution makes it possible for traders to access a wide variety of assets under a single platform with minimal trading fees. The global cryptocurrency industry is worth $2 trillion alone, with the broader equities market having over $90 trillion worth of assets. By enabling the trading of these assets, DTX provides traders with the chance to enhance liquidity. The DTX team aims to attract the attention of millions of retail and enterprise traders through this unique feature. DTX Exchange’s presale has seen considerable early participation across its initial rounds. The first round raised approximately $300,000 in a short period, while the second phase exceeded $1 million in total funds raised. The third presale round concluded ahead of schedule, with the platform raising over $4.75 million across all rounds to date. During this time, the token price increased from $0.01 to $0.08, reflecting initial interest in the platform’s offerings. DTX Exchange credits its early adoption to its unique product offerings, including: VulcanX Blockchain – This privacy blockchain powers the DTX ecosystem and is the first unified blockchain to support conventional financial assets. With a throughput of over 100,000, this blockchain is expected to power the next decentralized applications of the future. DTX Unified Wallet – The DTX Unified Wallet is the first crypto wallet to support forex, equities, and crypto assets under a single secure application. The product is expected to add features like P2P asset trading and portfolio management tools. Enterprise RWA Platform – DTX is onboarding conventional assets on the blockchain through the Real World Assets (RWA) builder platform. In the most recent development, the ongoing presale has sold over 50 million tokens and raised $3 million to sell out the 3rd round weeks ahead of schedule. The DTX team is now raising the token price, giving investors another opportunity to join the presale and secure DTX tokens before they launch on public exchanges. DTX Exchange has outlined its plans to make DTX tokens available for open public trading following the launch of the VulcanX blockchain. With a growing community of over 70,000 members, the platform is preparing for broader accessibility, which may help increase its reach and user base significantly upon public launch. Additionally, DTX also has an active developer community that is actively developing new products. Aside from offering a suite of trading features, DTX Exchange is expected to offer a wide range of products to developers and enterprise players in the finance world. Some notable products include the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization tool that allows stakeholders in the Real Estate industry to tokenize assets and introduce new models of investment in illiquid assets. Additionally, DTX is expected to launch the DTX Unified Wallet, which allows holding stocks, cryptos, and forex assets. Additionally, future plans include holding the Digi-Hackathon to improve platform security and integrity. With the unique approach DTX Exchange has taken to unifying digital assets, its presale performance comes as no surprise. Built on the VulcanX blockchain, the platform is designed to improve transaction capacity compared to many layer-1 blockchains. Given the rapid pace of the presale sold, the altcoin could mirror the past trajectory of other cryptos that had exponential rallies. In the past, projects like Solana, Cardano, Polygon, and Dogecoin have all surged from small-scale altcoins into multi-billion dollar projects that have become household names. DTX Exchange aims to fulfill its potential and turn into a major powerhouse in the coming months. Investors can still become an early part of the DTX Exchange community. With a current price of $0.08 and a listing price of $0.20, investors are poised to enjoy growth in value in the coming months. With broad applications for the financial sector, DTX aims to become the cornerstone of the DeFi industry and carve out a sizeable portion of the $2 Trillion trading industry.

Title: Bitcoin Market Cap to Reach $50 Trillion: Blackrock CEO

U.Today - Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), has once again stoked interest in Bitcoin, predicting that its market capitalization may eventually match that of the United States' the housing market, which is now worth more than $50 trillion. Fink, who highlighted Bitcoin as a unique asset class in and of itself, made these audacious predictions during BlackRock's Q3 earnings call. He has a clear vision: Bitcoin will continue to grow much like gold as a result of more international discussions about its place in institutional portfolios and liquidity. Fink says the emergence of digital assets like Bitcoin makes him think of the early days of the mortgage market, which is currently worth about $11 trillion. He emphasized that although Bitcoin's growth may begin slowly, similar to the mortgage market, it may eventually see widespread adoption with improved data analytics and transparency. The largest asset manager in the world, BlackRock has already made waves in the cryptocurrency space by demonstrating its dedication to the digital gold by applying for a spot Bitcoin ETF. This support indicates Fink's faith in Bitcoin's long-term prospects. It is interesting to note that Fink does not believe that regulation or even the White House plays a significant role in determining the success of Bitcoin. Rather, he thinks transparency and liquidity hold the key. According to his theory, the global acceptance of Bitcoin will grow as long as data-driven transparency rises. Fink's remarks also allude to Ethereum's future by highlighting the blockchain's expanding function and room for growth. The entire cryptocurrency market may experience previously unheard-of growth if greater acceptance is fostered and improved analytics are used. Despite Fink's optimistic assessment, it is crucial to keep in mind that BlackRock has a stake in the expansion of Bitcoin. Due to BlackRock's substantial Bitcoin holdings, demand may be further stimulated by its ETF. In any event, the CEO's remarks have fueled the flames, leading many to question whether Bitcoin can actually match the $50 trillion of the U.S. housing market going forward.

Business A family unveils a new Hyundai car at one of the motor group's showrooms in New Delhi, India, September 6, 2024. REUTERS/Ainnie Arif/File Photo Hyundai Motor India's $3.3 billion IPO was 18 per cent subscribed on the first day of bidding on Tuesday, led by employees who placed orders for four-fifths of the shares reserved for them in the country's largest share sale yet. The three-day share sale, the first by an automaker in India in two decades, ends on Thursday. Prior to the open bidding process, institutional investors including BlackRock and Fidelity on Monday snapped up shares worth $989.4 million as part of the offering. The initial public offering (IPO) marks Hyundai Motor's first such listing outside South Korea and comes at a time when companies are rushing to go public in an Indian equities market that has risen to record highs. Over 260 companies in India have raised more than $9 billion through IPOs so far this year, according to LSEG data. That's already higher than the $7.42 billion raised during the same period last year. The share sale is the world's second-largest IPO this year following Lineage Inc's $5.1 billion U.S. flotation in July. Employees of Hyundai India bid for 80 per cent of the 778,400 shares reserved for them, exchange data showed. The company had offered a discount of 186 rupees per share to eligible employees in the IPO, which was priced at 1,865-1,960 rupees per share, months after hundreds of workers at the company's main Indian plant at Sriperumbudur near Chennai protested to demand a share allocation. Qualified institutional buyers including foreign investors, banks and mutual funds subscribed to 5 per cent of the shares allotted for them, while retail investors bid for 26 per cent of their allocated shares. Hyundai India is targeting a $19 billion market valuation at the upper-end of the IPO price band. That values the company at about 40 per cent of its Korean parent. Its shares are expected to start trading on Oct. 22. Hyundai is India's No. 2 carmaker by sales with about a 15 per cent share of the country's passenger vehicle market and trails only Maruti Suzuki. However, a rapidly changing competitive landscape has seen domestic rivals Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra eat into the South Korean company's market share with new SUVs that are gaining popularity. Higher production capacity would help Hyundai bridge the gap with Maruti Suzuki and extend its narrow lead over Tata and Mahindra.

The integration aims to reduce investment costs and ease the subscription process for traditional finance players investing in BUIDL, Securitize said in a statement. The firm issues BUIDL tokens on the Ethereum blockchain in collaboration with BlackRock. Zero Hash, a blockchain infrastructure company, will facilitate the conversion between dollars and digital assets for the service, per the statement. “This integration allows digital asset companies to remain on-chain throughout the entire investment lifecycle, enabling near-instantaneous and transparent settlement and transfers across platforms,” Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize, told Decrypt. The offering, available to qualified investors, is designed to accelerate investments into BUIDL, Domingo added. The fund, valued at around $550 million, is among the largest of its kind, according to data from Etherscan. The move comes as tokenized real-world asset funds grow in popularity, particularly following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. In April, BUIDL surpassed $375 million in assets under management, overtaking Franklin Templeton's OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund as the largest tokenized treasury fund. BUIDL, whose assets are estimated to have ballooned by roughly 46% in the following months, allows institutional investors to earn yields on U.S. dollars by purchasing tokenized shares, which represent investments in secure assets such as U.S. Treasury bills. According to the firms, the key advantages include immediate settlement, enhanced liquidity, and transparent on-chain transactions. In a bid to capture interest in the rising sector, several new blockchain-based RWA funds have emerged in recent months. In September, Guggenheim Treasury Services partnered with blockchain firm Zeconomy to launch a digital commercial paper fund, while Midas introduced two real-world tokenized products across Europe. Additionally, Ondo Finance and Mountain Protocol have begun using BUIDL as a backing asset for their yield-generating products.

Fidelity dominates Bitcoin ETF inflows with $239 million as Grayscale bucks outflow trend. Bitcoin ETF saw $809.5 million in net inflows across the last two trading days. Fidelity alone received $356 million worth of Bitcoin, according to Farside data. On Oct. 11, Bitcoin ETF net inflows totaled $253.6 million. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF led the way with $117.1 million in inflows, while Ark’s ARKB ETF added $97.6 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF posted $38.8 million in inflows, and Invesco’s BTCO said $7.9 million. VanEck’s HODL ETF contributed $14.3 million. Grayscale’s GBTC ETF, however, saw outflows of $22.1 million. Other funds, including those from BlackRock, Franklin, Valkyrie, and WisdomTree, remained flat. By Monday, Oct. 14, Bitcoin ETFs saw additional substantial inflows of $555.9 million, indicating strong institutional demand. Fidelity’s FBTC ETF once again led with $239.3 million, followed by BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, which added $79.5 million. Bitwise’s BITB ETF contributed $100.2 million, while Ark’s ARKB ETF saw inflows of $69.8 million. Invesco’s BTCO and Franklin’s EZBC added smaller amounts, $4.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC ETF reversed its trend, gaining $37.8 million in inflows. Grayscale’s smaller BTC ETF also added $4.7 million. Ethereum ETFs On Oct. 11, 2024, Ethereum ETFs had a relatively quiet day, posting net outflows of $0.1 million. Fidelity’s FETH ETF saw $8.6 million in inflows, offset by $8.7 million in outflows from Grayscale’s ETHE fund. Other Ethereum ETFs remained flat, including those from BlackRock, Bitwise, 21Shares, VanEck, Invesco, and Franklin. By Oct. 14, Ethereum ETFs rebounded with $17.0 million in total inflows.

The strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs over the last two trading days, particularly in Fidelity, BlackRock, and Ark funds, suggest increasing confidence from institutional investors. Ethereum ETFs, while quieter, also saw renewed interest on Oct. 14, with BlackRock leading the way. Also known as "Akiba," Liam is a reporter, editor and podcast producer at CryptoSlate.

NEXT | The scarily good Overwatch 2 season 13, called Spellbinder, starts ... With the World of Warcraft 20th Anniversary Event and patch 11.0.5 arriving in just a week, the big question on everyone’s mind is “just how am I supposed to earn the Bronze Celebration Tokens so I can buy all of these cool rewards?” Thankfully, Blizzard has explained a few things and the rest we’ve gleaned from the PTR, so we have a good idea of what we need to do when the patch goes live. So strap on your work boots, because you’ve got some dailies to do. Some of the events for the anniversary have not been available for testing, so the numbers may change before the event goes live, but here’s what we know now. The anniversary includes two one-time events to get you started: From here, the event seems to be all repeatable quests. Once you’ve earned 100 Bronze Celebration Tokens, your entire Warband will be able to get ungated tokens from the following: You’ll want to be doing these too, as the rewards this year are really good. Not only has Blizzard given us high quality revamped versions of the iconic Tier 2 armor sets (adding in armor for new classes as well), but you can grab mounts and pets from previous WoW anniversary events in case you are a newer player or just happened to miss it (like I did with the Obsidian Worldbreaker). Got your fill of everything you wanted but still have a surplus of Bronze Celebration Tokens? That’s okay! You can trade 1 Bronze Celebration Token for 20 Timewarped Badges, which you may want to do because there’s going to be a bunch of new Timewarped Badge loot as well in the Anniversary event — including the Claymore of the Knight’s Pledge, a Tier 2 Judgement set inspired two-handed sword for 2500 badges. There will also be 15 20th Anniversary Event titles available for 100 badges each, which will no longer be available after the event ends… so make sure you grab your Karazhan Graduate title before it’s gone! If anything changes or we find new ways to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens, we’ll update this post to let you know. Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Title: Why Bitcoin Price Blasted Past $66,500: Key Reasons Revealed
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-bitcoin-price-blasted-past-66500-key-reasons/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T12:30:02Z

Bitcoin experienced a significant surge, climbing from a low of $62,050 on Sunday to a peak of $66,500 late Monday. As of Tuesday, the BTC price is slightly correcting below this key resistance level, but hovering above $65,000. Several critical factors have contributed to the rally, including a short squeeze coinciding with the upcoming US elections, strong demand in the spot Bitcoin market, and substantial inflows into US spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Yesterday’s price surge can be partly attributed to the liquidation of leveraged short positions. Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital writes in their latest investor note that nearly $80 million worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum leveraged shorts were liquidated, applying upward pressure on the market. While some speculate that the postponement of Mt. Gox’s repayment deadline to October 2025 played a role, this news was already published on Friday, suggesting other factors were at play during Monday’s rally. “Although there could be many factors that could explain today’s move, it is quite an interesting time if we look at historical price action. We are in the middle of October and just three weeks away from the US elections,” QCP Capital notes. In both 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin remained in a tight trading range for months before initiating a significant rally approximately three weeks before the US Election Day. In 2016, Bitcoin doubled in price from $600 by the first week of January following the election. Similarly, in 2020, it surged from $11,000 to a high of $42,000 by January. This year, October—often referred to as “Uptober” due to its historically strong performance—has been underwhelming, with Bitcoin up just 1.2% compared to an average of 21%. The current rally, occurring three weeks before the US elections, suggests that history might be repeating itself, potentially leading to further price appreciation as investor optimism builds. For the first time since mid-2023, Bitcoin’s buy orders are matching sell orders in spot market order books across exchanges. Ki Young Ju, Founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, highlighted this development via X: “Bitcoin buy walls on all exchanges are now strong enough to neutralize sell walls.” This shift marks a significant change from the trend observed since May 2021. “Data from the last cycle (2020-2022). It’s the accumulated difference between quoted buy and sell volumes. Since May 2021, sell walls had been consistently thicker than buy walls until the end of the cycle,” Young Ju shared. Monday witnessed one of the highest Bitcoin ETF inflows on record, totaling $555.9 million—the largest net inflow day since June 3. This substantial capital influx was spread among several major asset managers. BlackRock received $79.5 million, Fidelity attracted $239.3 million, Bitwise accumulated $100.2 million, Ark Invest saw inflows of $69.8 million and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) experienced inflows of $37.8 million. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store and host of the ETF Prime podcast, commented on these inflows via X: “Monster day for spot btc ETFs… $550mil inflows. Now approaching *$20bil* net inflows in 10mos. Simply ridiculous & blows away every pre-launch demand estimate. This is NOT “degen retail” $$$ IMO. It’s advisors & institutional investors continuing to slowly adopt.” At press time, BTC traded at $65,750.

Title: BlackRock CEO Fink Unleashes Bitcoin Bombshell In Q3 Earnings Call
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-fink-bitcoin-bombshell-q3-earnings-call/
Time Published: 2024-10-15T12:30:00Z

During BlackRock’s third-quarter earnings call, CEO Larry Fink articulated a strong endorsement of Bitcoin and digital assets. Fink’s commentary not only underscored Bitcoin as a standalone asset class but also paralleled its burgeoning significance with historical financial markets like mortgages which are now worth $11 trillion and high-yield bonds. “We believe Bitcoin is an asset class in itself,” Fink stated unequivocally. “It is an alternative to other commodities like gold.” He also revealed that BlackRock is actively engaging with institutions worldwide regarding digital asset allocation. “Conversations we’re having with institutions worldwide [are] about how they should think about digital assets, what type of asset allocation there should be,” he explained. Fink emphasized the inevitability of digital assets becoming a global reality: “I do believe the utilization of digital assets is going to become more and more of a reality worldwide.” Drawing parallels to the early days of the mortgage and high-yield markets, Fink suggested that digital assets are on a similar trajectory of growth and acceptance. “Years ago, when we started the mortgage market, years ago when the high-yield market occurred, [they] started off very slow but built as we built better analytics and data,” he recalled. “Through better analytics and data, more acceptance and a broadening of the market [occurred]. I truly believe we will see a broadening of the market of these digital assets.” Contrary to the common narrative that regulation is the primary hurdle for digital asset adoption, Fink argued that other factors are more critical. “I truly don’t believe it’s a function of regulation, of more regulation, less regulation,” he asserted. “I think it’s a function of liquidity, transparency, and then through that process, no different than when you […] built better analytics and data.” Fink also highlighted the transformative potential of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence in expanding digital asset markets. “We believe the technology of these blockchains is going to become very additive,” he said. “Then you will overlay AI, and having better data analytics, the applicability and the broadening of these markets will occur.” Besides Bitcoin, Fink specifically mentioned Ethereum, noting its capacity for significant growth: “I think the application of this form of investment will be expanded to the role of Ethereum as a blockchain can grow dramatically.” Addressing the digitization of national currencies, Fink distinguished between digital assets like Bitcoin and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). “How does each and every country look at their own digital currency? That’s a very different asset than a Bitcoin in itself,” he clarified. “We’re seeing big success in India, in Brazil in the digitization of their own currency for various different reasons.” When talking about the potential impact of the US presidential election on Bitcoin and the entire crypto market, Fink was dismissive of any significant effect. “I’m not sure if either President or other candidate would make a difference,” he commented, suggesting that other market forces are the primary drivers of adoption. At press time, BTC traded at $65,600. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Bitcoin’s ‘Uptober’ momentum fueled by pro-crypto US candidates and fading global tensions

Bitcoin Uptober narrative gains momentum with BTC reaching $66,000. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin surged to a high of $66,000 in the past 24 hours, breaking out of weeks of stagnation as the broader crypto market showed signs of recovery. October has historically been a strong month for investors, with gains as high as 60% and an average return of 22%. Despite this, the market has remained stable over the past weeks, leading to a more cautious outlook among investors. Yesterday’s upward movement, however, has rekindled optimism around the “Uptober” narrative as market analysts highlight why the top asset’s run could continue. According to CryptoSlate’s data, Bitcoin’s price has slightly retracted to $65,632 as of this writing. A major factor driving this renewed momentum is the growing perception that both leading US presidential candidates—Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump—are pro-crypto. This belief suggests that the crypto market could benefit regardless of the election outcome. Vice President Harris recently announced plans to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets, aiming to protect retail investors while promoting economic inclusion, particularly in minority communities. On the other hand, Trump has positioned himself as a strong advocate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, making pro-crypto statements during his campaign. Blockchain-based prediction platform Polymarket shows Trump with a 56.2% chance of winning the impending election, while Harris stands at 43.4%. Despite the election uncertainty, leading institutions like Galaxy Digital believe Bitcoin will remain unaffected regardless of who wins. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed this sentiment, stating that Bitcoin is poised to soar regardless of the election result. He emphasized that Bitcoin’s growth is driven more by liquidity and transparency than by regulation or political leadership. Other potential drivers behind Bitcoin’s recent performance include shifting market sentiment and global economic factors. In an Oct. 15 note, trading firm QCP Capital noted that disappointment with China’s latest economic stimulus may have prompted some investors to redirect funds from Chinese equities into Bitcoin. China’s attempts to revive its economy have been underwhelming, leaving many to question the effectiveness of its policies to combat deflation. This uncertainty has drawn further attention to Bitcoin as an alternative. Additionally, the delay in repayments to creditors of the Mt. Gox exchange by another year has eased concerns about a sudden influx of Bitcoin supply flooding the market. Geopolitical risks also appear to be diminishing, with reports suggesting that Israel may hold off on targeting Iran’s crude oil and nuclear infrastructure. This reduction in tensions could provide further stability to global markets.

Despite growth, Bitcoin ETFs have captured only 3% of overall market volume. On the 14th of October, Bitcoin [BTC] ETFs saw record-breaking inflows, with a total value of $555.9 million—their largest daily net inflow since June, according to Farside Investors. This surge in ETF interest coincided with BTC reaching a two-week peak. The coin was trading at $66,500, at press time. Fidelity’s FBTC led the charge and logged an impressive $239.3 million, marking its highest inflow since the 4th of June. Other notable ETFs included Bitwise’s BITB with inflows of $100.2 million, BlackRock’s IBIT at $79.5 million, and Ark 21Shares’ ARKB with just under $69.8 million. Grayscale’s GBTC had its first influx in October, at $37.8 million, the largest since May. Remarking on the same, ETF Store President Nate Geraci noted, Source: Nate Geraci/X Since their debut in January, BTC ETFs have amassed a notable $18.9 billion net inflows. Excluding GBTC, the nine new Bitcoin ETFs owned around 646,000 BTC, with GBTC adding 223,000 BTC to the total. These funds control 869,000 BTC, roughly 4% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply. This year has seen remarkable growth in the ETF sector, with around 2,000 launches. This includes top funds like BlackRock and Fidelity. Remarking on the matter, Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas said, Source: Eric Balchunas/X However, despite recent growth, BTC ETFs represent only a small slice of the total Bitcoin trading landscape. According to Checkonchain data from the 11th of October, the Bitcoin Futures market recorded $53.4 billion in trades, with the spot market reaching $4.5 billion. In contrast, ETF trades totaled just $2 billion, capturing approximately 3% of the day’s overall BTC market volume. This little fraction demonstrates ETFs’ infancy in the larger Bitcoin market ecosystem. Well, this is also because determining the exact share of ETF inflows driven by the “basis trade,” or cash and carry trade, remains challenging. Major institutions like Goldman Sachs and Jane Street Capital are engaged in creating and redeeming ETF shares, which stabilizes the ETF’s price and liquidity. Hedge funds, such as Millennium Management and Capula Management, employ “basis trading” strategies to profit from discrepancies between Bitcoin’s spot and futures prices. However, not all large holders engage in basis trading. For example, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board holds the ETF for purposes like portfolio diversification. Yet, Bernstein, a private wealth management firm, suggests that basis trades could act as a “Trojan horse” for broader adoption, as increased liquidity and trading volume may encourage investors to adopt long-term positions in Bitcoin. Therefore, if options tied to IBIT are approved and physically settled, it would attract more sophisticated investors. And, for that, strategies like covered calls (selling call options while holding the underlying asset) would allow investors to generate passive income, while miners could use these options to hedge their holdings. Together, these elements could bring more maturity and volume to the Bitcoin ETF market.

Impact investment, whereby a fund creates beneficial social or environmental impact, has now grown to £76.8 billion in the UK in assets under management. Tens of thousands of new homes are set to be built across Britain funded by over half a billion pounds worth of impact investments announced today (Tuesday 15 October). Coming the day after the Prime Minister announced £63bn of investment into Britain at the International Investment Summit, the commitment from three major financial institutions to invest for impact will directly tackle the most acute housing crisis in living memory, which includes at least 5,000 new homes to address social inequality. This supports the Government’s priority to get the country building again, creating more jobs and boosting the economy. The announcement comes as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones this morning hosts a roundtable with some of the biggest impact investors in the world, including Schroders, M&G, International Bank of America, Blackrock and Barclays, as the Government looks to create the right environment for impact investment across the country. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: Investors tell us they want to help in delivering a better Britain. Working in partnership with government, social impact investing can change people’s lives and improve communities across the country. We are dedicated to creating the right environment for impact investment across the country, and the announcement of over half a billion pounds worth of impact investment building tens of thousands of new homes is a great example of the change that we are delivering on. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: These new funds provide a much-needed, fresh opportunity to work in partnership with impact investors, tackling some of the most pressing social and environmental challenges while driving economic growth. We want to make the UK a world leading centre of excellence on the impact economy and look forward to working with the sector to unleash its full potential for our country. These three investments funds by Schroders, Man Group and Resonance are exemplars of private capital responding to major social and environmental challenges, delivering returns while also helping to grow the economy, the government’s central mission. Today’s £550 million impact investment underpins the government’s drive to foster public-private partnerships to drive meaningful impact across the country. Schroders, one of the UK’s largest investment managers, has today confirmed a new £50 million allocation from Homes England, into its recently launched real estate impact fund. The fund, which has an initial target of raising £200m with the aim of ultimately delivering 5,000 homes to address social inequality and deliver an appropriate financial return to investors, expects to make its first investments before the end of 2024. It is focused on helping to deliver more social and affordable housing, regenerate town centres and invest in social infrastructure, in places where housing benefits from public transport, green spaces, schools and GP surgeries. Man Group, a London-headquartered global alternative investment management firm managing $178.2 billion, has also announced a further £100mn investment to deliver affordable and environmentally sustainable housing for communities across England, with 90% of homes to be designated as affordable housing. The investment will have a particular focus on delivering homes with a low carbon footprint and addressing the housing needs of key and essential workers. This investment programme builds on the £385mn that has already been committed to affordable housing since 2021. Leading social impact property fund manager Resonance have today announced an expected 300% increase in investment – from £79m to £250m - into its initiative to tackle homelessness. This directly channels investment into residential property to help create pathways out of Temporary Accommodation for individuals and families. Resonance has set a target of reaching £1bn investment in this area in the next five years, so it can work directly with local authorities and housing partners across the country to help provide people at risk of homelessness with a stable home.

Title: $BTC ETFs Record $555M Inflows, Demand ‘Blows Away Every Pre-Launch Estimate’

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Yesterday, $BTC ETFs recorded $555.86M in net inflows, the largest since early June. ETF Store President Nate Geraci noted cumulative 10-month $BTC ETF inflows will soon reach $20B and called October 14 a ‘monster day.’ $BTC hitting $66K for the first time since September 27 could be one reason for such demand. But Geraci believes inflows come from institutions, not ‘degen retail’ investors. Let’s zoom in on crypto ETF performance in the US and beyond. Fidelity led the pack with nearly $240M inflows, twice that of Bitwise. BlackRock recorded nearly $80M inflows, while Ark & 21Shares a little less than $70M. Franklin, Invesco, and Valkyrie all had under $10M net inflows. The two smallest funds, Wisdom Tree and Hashdex saw zero investment. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF tops the list with the largest cumulative net inflows of $21.78B, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC ETF with $10.22B net inflows. Grayscale’s GBTC stands out as the only $BTC ETF with a negative cumulative net flow (–$20.15B). It may be that high sponsor fees coupled with an above-average price deter investors, forcing Grayscale to sell off its $BTC holdings. In March, Grayscale held nearly $25M in net assets. The fund had to reduce its holdings to $14.51B to meet redemption requests. Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink rightfully called IBIT the fastest-growing ETF to ever exist. He added that he’s bullish on $BTC in the long term. In BlackRock’s Q3 earnings call, Fink recognizes that $BTC is an asset class in itself and argues its adoption isn’t a matter of regulation. Instead, policymakers and industry players should focus on liquidity and transparency. Fink further compares crypto to the mortgage market, noting that better analytics and data accelerated its expansion. He believes digital assets will become as big as the entire US housing sector, now estimated at $50T. Fink and Geraci both highlight that no one expected such explosive demand, both from retail and institutional investors. $BTC ETFs have been doing well since launch. However, the same can’t be said for $ETH ETFs. The cumulative net outflow of $541.82M suggests institutional investors lack confidence in $ETH despite its mature ecosystem and bullish trend. The reason is simple: launched in 2017 as a trust, ETHE was initially a locked-in investment. In July, Grayscale gained regulatory approval for investors to redeem their assets. At the time, Grayscale held approximately $10B in $ETH. Within a week, investors withdrew over $2B from the trust, and it hasn’t recovered since. Another reason for poor $ETH ETF performance is the lack of staking yield available with direct $ETH exposure. Why miss out on 3.5% APY and pay a sponsor fee at the same time? On the other hand, BlackRock’s ETHA product saw solid interest from institutional investors. Yesterday’s $14.31M inflows brought the cumulative flows to $1.22B, nearly three times that of Fidelity’s FETH. The lackluster demand for $ETH ETFs in the US doesn’t discourage other countries from launching their crypto exchange-traded products. Crypto security firm BitGo and exchange Gemini act as custodians and are responsible for the assets’ safety. In August, Monochrome launched Australia’s first $BTC ETF (IBTC), which now holds over $15.9M in assets. One-month flows into IBTC topped $1.7M. While $BTC ETFs are thriving, US $ETH ETFs are having a rough time. Yet, their fate might be different in Australia if Monochrome manages to demonstrate crypto ETF appeal to institutional investors. As for Grayscale, Fink has hinted at the way to recovery. Increasing liquidity and lowering fees are the only salvation for GBTC and ETHE. Your email address will not be published.
