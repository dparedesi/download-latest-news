ByTonya M. Evans, Contributor. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink calls something “the domain of money launderers and thieves,” markets pay attention. So, on Sunday, October 12th, when he told CBS’s 60 Minutes host, Lesley Stahl, that “markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,” the reversal was notable, although, given Blackrock’s Bitcoin exchange-traded fund performance data, not surprising. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) became the fastest fund ever to reach $10 billion in assets after launching in January 2024. Now it holds nearly $100 billion, more than any other ETF in BlackRock's 1,000-plus fund lineup. But Fink's “democratization” language isn't coincidental; it actually mirrors that of President Trump's August 7, 2025 executive order that explicitly opened 401(k) plans to “holdings in actively managed investment vehicles that are investing in digital assets.” The order's logic is straightforward: wealthy Americans and government workers access alternative investments through pension plans, but 90 million Americans in employer-sponsored retirement plans don't. “My Administration will relieve the regulatory burdens and litigation risk that impede American workers' retirement accounts from achieving the competitive returns and asset diversification necessary to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement,” the order states. For the 55 million Americans already using crypto, the question isn’t whether digital assets belong in portfolios it is how to access them safely. The 2025 State of the Crypto Holders Report from the National Cryptocurrency Association found that 76% of users say crypto has had a positive impact on their lives, underscoring its move from niche experiment to mainstream asset class. Yet this rise in adoption comes amid a systematic weakening of fiduciary-duty standards and oversight mechanisms that once protected retirement savers from high-risk products, leaving investors to navigate a rapidly expanding market with fewer regulatory guardrails. Ironically, financial innovations like Bitcoin and blockchain may now offer—through technology—some of the transparency and accountability that lawmakers and regulators have struggled to provide by law. CNBC anchor and New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin is deeply concerned about the too-big-to-continue climate the stock market is in. Sorkin told 60 Minutes he sees disturbing parallels of today’s market to America's worst crash. “I'm anxious we are at prices that may not feel sustainable,” Sorkin said. “What I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom...or we're reliving 1929.” As Sorkin explains in his book 1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History – and How It Shattered a Nation, before 1929, Wall Street “democratized” stock investing by letting buyers purchase with 10% down, borrowing the rest from brokers. “It was all wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,” Sorkin explained. “In good times it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook in a very bad way.” The parallel is stark: “We put up barriers after 1929—protections. Those are coming down...There's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guard rails coming off.” For most Americans, those guardrails are not abstract—they protect the only wealth they have. According to 2022 data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finance and analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, approximately two-thirds of U.S. household wealth is concentrated in two asset categories: primary residences and employer-sponsored retirement accounts. The E.O. acknowledges this tension, promising to “curb ERISA litigation that constrains fiduciaries' ability to apply their best judgment.” Critics hear 1920s deregulation. Supporters hear removal of paternalistic barriers preventing working Americans from accessing investments available to the wealthy. And Americans approaching retirement are caught in the middle—and skeptical. In fact, a recent Boldin survey of over 1,000 Americans found that nearly half oppose adding alternative assets like crypto to their 401(k)s, only about one-third support the idea, and roughly 80 percent say they’re unlikely to invest any portion of their retirement savings in such assets. Commentators seem to approach the alternative assets topics with a myopic view. However, there is a critical difference between 1929's bubble and Bitcoin's 2025 emergence: Bitcoin was born out of the 2008 crisis and designed to (among other things) address the systemic vulnerabilities Sorkin fears. On January 3, 2009, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto embedded a message in the Genesis Block: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” It wasn't random, it was a timestamp and philosophical statement about why Bitcoin needed to exist. While governments rescued failing banks with taxpayer money, Nakamoto proposed an alternative: a monetary system with no central authority to bail out, no fractional reserve banking to collapse, no “too big to fail” institutions. Bitcoin wasn't created to ride boom cycles. It was created to survive—and provide an alternative during—the exact breakdowns Sorkin describes. Fixed supply vs. credit expansion. The 1929 crash stemmed partly from unconstrained credit creation. Bitcoin's protocol enforces a hard cap of 21 million coins—no authority can “print” more to bail out failing entities. Transparent settlement vs. opacity. 1929 exposed massive hidden leverage and counterparty failures. Bitcoin settles transparently every ten minutes with no trading halts or ability for authorities to freeze markets during panics. Equal access vs. gatekeeping. Sorkin rightly warns about retail investors accessing opaque private equity deals. Bitcoin offers radically equal access—the same blockchain data available to BlackRock is available to every investor. No insider information. Self-custody option vs. mandatory intermediation. Unlike 1929's stock certificates held by brokers who could face insolvency, Bitcoin enables self-custody—eliminating counterparty risk entirely. The executive order's inclusion of digital assets isn't comparable to credit-fueled stock speculation. As head of global market insights at Hashdex Asset Management, Gerry O'Shea, notes: “Bitcoin has moved beyond its early days as a merely speculative asset and is slowly entering into many investors' long-term investment strategy. This EO will help accelerate this trend.” The industry response has been bullish. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz called the executive order's potential impact “a monster pool of capital,” telling CNBC it represents a widening of avenues “for bringing more people into the tent” of crypto adoption. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was equally emphatic following his company's May 2025 inclusion in the S&P 500: “Crypto is here to stay. It's going to be a part of everyone's 401(k).” Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse advocates for diversified crypto exposure in institutional portfolios. “I own XRP, BTC, and ETH, among a handful of others—we live in a multichain world, and I've advocated for a level-playing field instead of one token versus another,” Garlinghouse said. “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress.” His multichain philosophy aligns with emerging retirement product development. As Grayscale’s diversified crypto ETF filing demonstrates, institutional investors increasingly recognize that different digital assets serve different purposes, Bitcoin as digital gold, Ethereum for decentralized applications and smart contracts, and XRP for cross-border payments infrastructure. A sophisticated ecosystem is emerging that balances access with safeguards: Building Resilience, Not Chasing Trends Whether this represents breakthrough or breakdown depends on execution not Bitcoin's software protocol, which has proven resilient for seventeen years and counting, but whether fiduciaries implement prudent limits and regulators deliver promised clarity by early 2026. Sorkin's 1929 warning carries weight. But the opacity and leverage that fueled that collapse are precisely what Bitcoin's architecture eliminates: transparent settlement, no fractional reserves, no hidden counterparty risk. The real danger isn't Bitcoin—it's whether fiduciaries treat it as speculation rather than strategic hedge, and whether promised regulatory safeguards materialize or stall. Trump's executive order opened the door. How fiduciaries and investors walk through it will determine whether we are witnessing democratization or simply repeating 1929’s grave errors with more sophisticated technology.

NEW DELHI: Morgan Stanley and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) have begun the sale process for Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP)-owned Vena Global Group Pte Ltd’s Indian renewable energy platform, Vena Energy India, in a deal having an enterprise value of around $1 billion, according to two people familiar with the development. The deal comes amid a steady flow of global capital into India’s clean energy market. The sale, code-named Project Indigo, marks Global Infrastructure Partners’ full exit from its bet on Vena Energy. The sale process was formally launched this month. GIP itself was acquired by BlackRock Inc. in October last year. Vena Energy India operates 957 megawatts (MW) of renewable power assets, with another 59 MW under construction. GIP, along with CIC Capital Corp. (CIC Capital) and Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments), had acquired Singapore-based renewable energy developer Equis Energy for $5 billion in October 2017. The acquisition included $1.3 billion in liabilities and Equis’s Indian portfolio, which comprised green energy platforms Energon and Energon Soleq. The assets were later rebranded as Vena Energy and structured as a corporate platform in Singapore. “Vena Energy projects have a weighted average residual power purchase agreement (PPA) of 17 years, with a ₹4.5 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) or per unit weighted average tariff," said one of the two people cited above requesting anonymity. Vena Energy has been active in India for over a decade through its earlier avatar Equis Energy. Its portfolio includes an advanced pipeline of 1.25 gigawatts (GW) of solar and wind projects and 752 megawatt-hours (MWh) of battery energy storage systems (BESS). It also has 1.46 GW of early- to mid-stage solar and wind projects under development and 100 MWh of additional BESS capacity. Spokespersons for GIP and MUFG declined to comment. A PSP Investments spokesperson said in an emailed response, “Our policy is to not comment on market rumours or speculation. We will therefore not participate in the story." Queries emailed to representatives of Vena Global Group, Morgan Stanley, and CIC Capital on Sunday night went unanswered at press time. Green energy dealmaking surgesIndia’s renewable energy sector has been driving merger and acquisition activity, accounting for about $8.5 billion worth of deals, roughly 80% of all power sector transactions, in the first half of the current fiscal year, according to EY. The report noted that India now counts over 60 marquee global investors in its green energy space. “In Asia Pacific, India stands out as a dynamic market, with energy security and ambitious clean-energy targets (backed by government initiatives in renewables, battery storage and green hydrogen) creating a favourable environment for M&A activity," wrote PwC in its 2025 mid-year outlook report. “Asia Pacific continues to focus on investments to meet ambitious clean-energy targets, as well as investments in electrification and critical mineral supply chains. For example, in India, goals to hit 500 GW non-fossil fuel-based energy generation and 61 GW/336 GWh of energy storage targets by 2030 are driving M&A activity in renewables, green energy and electric vehicles," the PwC report said. The momentum is underpinned by India’s rapid capacity expansion. The country’s installed renewable energy capacity stands at 245 GW, with solar and wind contributing 116 GW and 52 GW, respectively. India aims to add 50 GW of new capacity annually to reach 500 GW by 2030, 1,800 GW by 2047, and 5,000 GW by 2070 as part of its net-zero roadmap. India accounted for 5.6% of the record 306 terawatt-hours (TWh) of global solar generation growth in the first half of 2025, which rose 31% year-on-year, according to think tank Ember. “Examples of recent notable transactions in this space include JSW Neo Energy’s acquisition of the 4.6 GW O2 portfolio and ONGC NTPC Green’s 4.1 GW Ayana platform deal," the PwC report said. Investor appetite for operational and under-construction assets is strong, with hybrid models gaining traction. Government support is expected to drive further M&A energy and infrastructure activity across the region. Two examples of this supportive policy environment include the Indian government’s initiative to integrate biogas into the national gas grid and its recent revision of the Domestic Content Requirement policy to boost domestic solar cell manufacturing, it added. Recent deal activity underscores the growing investor interest. European alternative asset manager EQT, for instance, dropped plans to sell renewable developer Zelestra’s India business, transferring it instead to its Asia-Pacific infrastructure arm led by Hong Kong-based partner Ken Wong. EQT will invest around $600 million to expand the portfolio and has appointed Parag Sharma—former CEO and founder of EQT- and Temasek-backed O2 Power—as Zelestra’s new chief executive, replacing Sajay K.V. In another deal, Nasdaq-listed ReNew Energy Global Plc agreed to sell 300 MW of solar assets to Singapore’s Sembcorp Industries Ltd, valuing the equity and enterprise at around $100 million and $190 million, respectively. Sembcorp, along with Torrent Power Ltd, Inox Green Energy Services Ltd (of the INOXGFL Group), and General Atlantic-owned Actis LLP, is also among the shortlisted bidders for Macquarie Asset Management’s Green Investment Group (GIG) platform, Vibrant Energy.

Share this article BlackRock clients purchased around $60 million worth of Bitcoin on Monday, continuing the asset management firm’s accumulation during market volatility. BlackRock, a major asset management firm, has been facilitating client investments in Bitcoin through its spot ETF products. The purchase reflects institutional resilience amid recent market dips. BlackRock has been the sole issuer adding Bitcoin to its holdings during recent periods of price volatility, positioning itself as a key player in long-term crypto adoption. The investment pattern represents a broader trend of wealth transfer from retail sellers to Wall Street accumulators. BlackRock clients, including institutional and retail investors, continue stacking Bitcoin through the firm’s products even in non-surging markets. This sustained accumulation by BlackRock clients could intensify future rallies as selling pressure from retail investors eases, according to market observers tracking institutional Bitcoin adoption patterns.

Title: World's Largest Asset Manager Believes Bitcoin "Serves Same Purpose As Gold" - Here's Why
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/worlds-largest-asset-manager-blackrock-larry-fink-believes-bitcoin-serves-same-purpose-as-gold-heres-why
Time Published: 2025-10-14T02:40:08Z
Full Content:
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has recently walked back on his previous claims about Bitcoin being an 'index of money laundering' and admitted that the cryptocurrency serves the same purpose as gold in one's portfolio. “I did say Bitcoin, because we were talking about Bitcoin then, was the domain of money launderers and thieves," Fink told CBS on Sunday. “But you know, the markets teach you, you have to always re-look your assumptions. There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it’s an alternative," he added. Fink's comments on Bitcoin come at a time when cryptocurrencies worldwide witnessed large liquidations, motivated by Donald Trump's warning to China on Friday. Most cryptocurrencies suffered a beating, with Bitcoin dropping down from $125,000 levels to $104,000. Ethereum, too, saw a massive drawdown, falling to $3,700 levels. Bitcoins has since recovered and is trading around $114,000 levels, with the entire crypto market adding $550 billion in value since Friday's close. Fink, though, asserted caution, adding that Bitcoin is not a bad asset, but it should not form a major part of your portfolio. “For those looking to diversify, it is not a bad asset, but I don’t believe that it should be a large component of your portfolio,” he said. Earlier this month, similar words were echoed by Ben Powell, Chief Investment Strategist for the Middle East and Asia-Pacific at BlackRock. In an exclusive conversation with NDTV Profit, Powell said, “Having a 2% exposure to Bitcoin could make sense. The same goes for Gold." BlackRock is the world’s largest money manager that oversees roughly $12.5 trillion in assets. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest crypto ETF with more than $93.9 billion in assets under management.

Title: Critics Fear Financial Titans Have Found Trojan Horse For ‘Climate Mandates’

Time Published: 2025-10-13T22:35:32Z

Major global asset managers including BlackRock and Blackstone have been looking to buy power utilities across America in a move that some industry insiders warn could harm consumers, raise electricity costs and advance a climate-driven energy agenda. In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.” “BlackRock isn’t just influencing utilities anymore, they’re buying them. After years of ESG-driven coercion that pushed utilities to abandon reliable energy in favor of China-dependent renewables, BlackRock is now taking direct control. The result will be more of the same: higher costs, weaker grids, and millions in unpaid bills, all driven by the very climate mandates they lobbied for,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, told the DCNF. “Minnesotans should brace for more unreliable power, rising rates, and a media narrative that blames Trump for ending taxpayer-funded handouts instead of holding the woke politicians and Wall Street elites responsible for the crisis.” (RELATED: A Major Backer Of Green Energy Admits Again That Solar And Wind Power Alone ‘Can’t Reliably Keep The Lights On’) In an aerial view, the IAD71 Amazon Web Services data center is shown on July 17, 2024 in Ashburn, Virginia. (Photo by Nathan Howard via Getty Images) Electricity demand is on the rise after years of stagnancy as the artificial intelligence (AI) race ushers in the build out of power-hungry data centers. Utility costs are also spiking as demand takes off in a trend that dates back to the Biden administration. Against this backdrop, private investment titans like BlackRock and Blackstone are reportedly moving to buy power utility companies and invest in data center expansions and startups. Minnesota recently granted the BlackRock-led group known as Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) approval to buy one of the state’s major power utilities, Allete. GIP is also reportedly on the cusp of acquiring the major energy company, AES, according to sources familiar with the matter that spoke with Reuters. The Financial Times reported that the deal may be for $38 billion. BlackRock referred the DCNF to Allete’s statement on regulators approving its partnership with GIP and declined to comment further for this story. Allete’s statement notes that the impending partnership with the BlackRock-led group includes “guaranteed access to capital to fund ALLETE’s five-year plan for advancing transmission and renewable energy goals [and a] $50 million Clean Firm Technology Fund to support regional clean-energy projects and partnerships.” The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) renewed BlackRock’s ability to own up to 20% of utility voting shares in April, with former FERC Commissioner Mark Christie stating that BlackRock “pledged not to use its holdings to influence utility management” and that utilities need the access to capital. Christie also warned in September 2024 that “this is an issue that deserves much greater scrutiny” and that “the influence that large shareholders, BlackRock or otherwise, can potentially exert across the consumer-serving utility industry should not be underestimated.” Blackstone has reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co. recently, according to The Associated Press. The asset management giant also secured a 19.9% stake in a Northern Indiana public utility for over $2 billion in January 2024. “Blackstone’s sustainability strategy prioritizes accelerating decarbonization by investing in the energy transition and driving value accretive emissions reduction in our portfolio,” Blackstone’s 2024 sustainability report states. “We believe the transition to cleaner energy creates meaningful investment opportunities for private capital. For over a decade, we have pursued attractive investments in companies and assets that are part of the global energy transition as part of our broader energy investing strategy.” Blackstone also announced on Sept. 15 that private equity funds affiliated with Blackstone Energy Transition Partners will acquire the Pennsylvania-based Hill Top Energy Center natural gas plant for almost $1 billion. The company also announced in July that funds managed by Blackstone Infrastructure and Blackstone Real Estate would invest over $25 billion to help build out Pennsylvania’s energy infrastructure to support the AI “revolution.” “Renewable” energy goals and ESG investment tend to align with emissions-reduction targets, with some power companies, utilities and states that set goals to cut emissions striving to retire conventional energy sources like coal plants. Isaac added that companies like American Electric Power, in which BlackRock owns a significant stake, have been decommissioning coal plants and replacing them with intermittent sources like solar. “What happens is when the wind stops blowing and the sun stops shining, then you have to ramp those generational assets back up, and that’s when price spikes happen,” Isaac said.

Because there’s a lot of money to be made.” Other experts devoted to consumer protection like Executive Director of Consumers’ Research Will Hild told the DCNF that investment companies like BlackRock stand to gain more than just a profit from these purchases. “There is no world in which BlackRock’s ownership of American energy benefits ordinary American consumers,” Hild told the DCNF. “This is the same firm that proudly brought us the radical ESG rules and Net-Zero nonsense that forced all our energy bills to skyrocket. We wouldn’t have the scourge of woke capitalism without Larry Fink, who already controls nearly $13 trillion in assets and has been sued for violating anti-trust laws.” ESG investors weigh a company by its social and environmental choices as well as its finances in a move that critics say bogs down businesses with new costs while doing little to combat climate change. One August 2023 InfluenceMap report showed that as Republicans at the state level and in Congress ramped up their opposition to ESG-focused practices, BlackRock and other major U.S. asset managers decreased their support for climate-related resolutions. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink also said in June 2023 that he no will no longer use the term ESG because it has been “politicized,” less than a year after he noted that climbing energy prices are “accelerating” the green energy transition. “BlackRock has backpedaled on its ESG messaging and its aggressive, unapologetic imposition of ESG on everything they touch. But the leopard hasn’t changed its spots,” President of the Heartland Institute James Taylor told the DCNF. “It still has the same management group with the same values, and it’s still doing whatever it can to impose ESG on everything it touches, in actuality, if not in name.” Taylor argued that whether BlackRock buys or acquires a large stake of a utility, it “can now assert itself over legislatures in dictating energy policy.” Notably, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) threw their weight behind an antitrust lawsuit against major asset managers that alleges the firms colluded to tank coal production with their embrace of zero-emissions goals in May. The lawsuit, backed by 11 state attorneys general, alleges that BlackRock and multiple other asset managers used their market power to suppress coal production, thereby hurting consumers by causing the price of coal to climb. The DOJ and FTC’s “support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” a BlackRock spokesperson previously told the DCNF. “As we made clear in our earlier motion to dismiss, this case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.” Blackstone did not respond to the DCNF’s multiple requests for comment.

In addition, alts firm New Mountain hired a wealth head, Ascensus named a new CEO and $4 billion RIA Trilogy brought on a head of wealth planning. October 13, 2025 Mercer Global Advisors, the acquisitive $86 billion registered investment advisor based in Denver, has hired Katelyn (Kate) Shackleton from LPL Financial to lead its partner integration team. Shackleton joins Mercer as executive managing director, new partner success, to lead the integration of new firms. Mercer makes the move during what it bills as a “record year” for its inorganic growth strategies, having acquired more than a dozen firms in 2025, with more in the pipeline. Rick Weyers, who has been leading the firm’s partner integration team for over seven years, will now report to Shackleton. “Mercer Advisors, at its core, is a partnership of 100+ firms that have recognized that by working together as a team we can deliver more for our clients than any of us could on our own,” Mercer President Daniel Gourvitch said in a statement. “We are incredibly excited to have a leader of Kate’s caliber and track record who will collaborate closely with each new firm to fully deliver on that promise.” Shackleton had held various leadership roles at LPL, including as executive vice president, corporate strategy and new ventures, and head of the broker/dealers trust and insurance division. She had also had leadership roles at Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Private Bank. Related:Creative Planning Names SageView President As Retirement Solutions Head She joins Mercer as a shareholder, along with two vice presidents on the M&A partner development team: Carrie Ohm, formerly with the corporate development team of mega-RIA OneDigital, and Alex Moore, formerly of Marshberry, where he was a sell-side M&A specialist. Mercer is owned by Oak Hill Capital, Genstar Capital and Altas Partners, and has over 1,370 employees in 100 locations. MAI Capital, the Cleveland-based RIA that is working to close a deal for $27 billion Evoke Advisors, has hired a new chief marketing officer to help elevate its brand and drive client growth. Kathleen Alcorn takes the role of CMO from the same position at mega-RIA Focus Financial Partners, and earlier in her career, as CMO for Nasdaq Corporate Solutions. In the newly created role, Alcorn will be asked to “heighten” MAI Capital’s visibility and “align business and marketing strategies as it continues to scale through organic growth and strategic acquisitions,” according to the announcement. Her mandate includes the 15 acquisitions that MAI has completed since the start of 2024 and new integrations to scale the firm’s work with clients in investment management, financial planning, family office, tax and institutional consulting.

After the Evoke deal, Galway Holdings-owned MAI Capital will have over $60 billion in assets under management. New Mountain Capital, a New York-based alternative investment firm, has hired William “Bill” Dunigan as head of wealth solutions. Dunigan, who will serve as a director, joins from asset management giant BlackRock, where he held leadership roles in the U.S. Wealth Advisory division for 18 years. Most recently, he was a leader in strategic accounts, managing BlackRock’s relationships with several large RIAs. At New Mountain, Dunigan will head distribution and business development in the United States. His team includes nine wealth solutions employees focused on the RIA and fiduciary advisor channel across the firm’s credit, net lease and private equity investment offerings. According to the announcement, there will be new hires to come for Dunigan. Related:Bessent Taps Bisignano as IRS CEO in Latest Agency Shakeup “We are pleased to welcome Bill to the firm and look forward to his leadership helping further build out our relationships in the highly attractive RIA market,” Adam Weinstein, managing director, chief operating officer and CFO, said in a statement. “In recent years we have built many successful partnerships with high-quality RIA organizations, and we are confident that New Mountain’s focus on ‘defensive growth’ industries will continue to resonate with clients in the RIA marketplace.” New Mountain has about $55 billion in AUM and has a presence in North and Latin America. Ascensus, the Dresher, Penn.-based savings provider, announced that current CEO and Chair David Musto will step into the role of executive chairman in January 2026, to be replaced by current President Nick Good. Musto’s departure from the top job is part of a planned succession that Ascensus enacted when it hired Good in 2023 and restructured the business into four units that report to him the following year. Ascensus credited Good with pushing for innovation across the firm, which included changing the client and product experience and the firm’s strategy for going to market for its institutional clients. Musto will continue providing “strategic and operating counsel” to the board. He will also continue to be accountable for corporate and business development projects and work on the firm’s industry and government relationships. Ascensus has more than $892 billion in assets under administration and almost 16 million people in its savings products, which include retirement plans, 529 education and ABLE savings programs, and corporate- and bank-owned life insurance. Trilogy Financial Services, an Irvine, Calif.-based hybrid RIA with more than $4 billion in client assets, has hired for a new role of head of wealth planning. Amy Kane will take on the new role and report to Mike Broker, the firm’s executive vice president and chief strategy officer.

CNBC reported Monday that the bank has been developing a custody service for digital assets over the past two to three years, citing an interview with global head of partnerships and innovation Biswarup Chatterjee. Citi did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment, but Chatterjee was quoted saying that the upcoming custody service would involve Citi holding the digital coins and tokens for clients. "We're hoping that in the next few quarters, we can come to market with a credible custody solution that we can offer to our asset managers and other clients," Chatterjee told CNBC. The move would signal traditional banks pushing further into the world of digital assets. Since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds managed by Wall Street titans like BlackRock and Fidelity, a number of top American banks have expressed interest in moving deeper into the digital asset space. JP Morgan is advancing stablecoin development, while Morgan Stanley is working to enable customers to trade digital coins Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana via its E*Trade platform. Just last week, major banks Banco Santander, Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, MUFG Bank Ltd, TD Bank Group, and UBS announced that they were collectively exploring a "1:1 reserve-backed form of digital money"—or stablecoin. President Donald Trump campaigned on a ticket to help the crypto industry, and this year has pushed a number of crypto-friendly laws as regulatory industries have pulled back on crypto-related enforcement. Regulators under previous U.S. administrations have been more cautious and sometimes hostile towards the crypto space.

There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is, it’s an alternative,” he said. In his latest comments, however, Fink also urged caution. “For those looking to diversify, it is not a bad asset, but I don’t believe that it should be a large component of your portfolio,” he added. BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, oversees roughly $12.5 trillion in assets. It launched one of the first U.S. crypto spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 following regulatory approval from the SEC. Its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest crypto ETF with more than $93.9 billion assets under management. Fink’s shift in tone over the years is in line with a broader softening of Wall Street’s stance on cryptocurrencies. He was part of a cohort of CEOs who once dismissed Bitcoin outright. In 2017, he called it an “index of money laundering,” while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon described it as “a fraud” and said people who owned it were “stupid,” likening the asset to the Dutch tulip mania in the 1630s. Since then, the mood has changed, with Fink taking a more conciliatory tone from 2023 onwards. Major financial firms, from asset managers to investment banks, are gradually moving into the crypto sector, drawn by investor demand even as they warn of volatility and regulatory risk. In a letter to investors earlier this year, Fink himself noted that half of the demand for BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF has been "from retail investors, and three-quarters of those investors had never owned an iShares product before." Chief Investment Officer at Sygnum Fabian Dori told Decrypt that particularly since the re-election of U.S. President Donald Trump, the embrace of crypto assets has moved from institutional involvement to institutional adoption. “If there was any need for further confirmation of the increasing institutional adoption, it has probably been provided by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink flagging Bitcoin as a potential replacement of the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency in case the U.S. debt situation would spiral out of control," he said. "These developments have driven Bitcoin dominance, the share of Bitcoin’s market cap relative to the total crypto asset market cap, to a level not seen for years." Leading global traditional asset managers such as BlackRock or Fidelity have already added Bitcoin to the strategic asset allocation of some of their investment products, while corporations such as Tesla, Strategy, and Metaplanet have integrated Bitcoin into their corporate strategy as a hedge against inflation. Dori added institutions are interested in three key use cases: Specific crypto assets as an alternative store of value, specific crypto assets as an alternative means of payment and specific crypto assets as a next-generation infrastructure that enables decentralized application economies. “Increased macro uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and the growing risk of currency debasement are factors that promote Bitcoin’s safe haven or store of value attributes,” he said. Still, not everyone is convinced. Last week, British investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown warned users to steer clear of Bitcoin, calling it an asset with “no intrinsic value.” In a notice to clients, the firm said crypto “shouldn’t be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals.” But firms are still feeling pressure to meet customer demand for these sorts of products. Hargreaves Lansdown itself, which manages $226.8 billion (£170 billion) in assets, nevertheless said it would still allow qualified investors to access new British crypto exchange-traded notes despite their warning. Bitcoin was trading above $115,000 on Monday, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. The price recovery follows a sharp dip on Friday, when it slid from $121,000 to $109,000 within hours, triggering nearly $20 billion in liquidations, including roughly $16.7 billion in long positions.

Title: Women CFOs Outperform. Here’s How Humana And Merck Prove It.

ByChristine Michel Carter, Senior Contributor. When companies put women in charge of the balance sheet, the numbers get better. A OneStream study titled The Glass Chair: Unlocking the value of women in finance finds that appointing a woman as CFO correlates with a 10% boost in performance for previously underperforming firms. The report also shows that companies led by women CFOs deliver stronger returns and lead in digital innovation. Proof that when women take the helm of corporate finance, results follow. Few executives illustrate that better than Celeste Mellet, CFO of Humana, and Caroline Litchfield, CFO of Merck. Both women have built careers at the intersection of finance, operations, and transformation. They’re navigating complex, regulated industries where the stakes are high and the margin for error is slim. The study reveals that women take three or more years longer than men to reach the CFO seat, often through cross-functional and global roles rather than a straight accounting track. Across Global 500 and FTSE 100 companies, women average 18 years to reach the position; in healthcare and life sciences, it can take about 21 years. Both Mellet and Litchfield exemplify that trajectory. Each built decades-long careers across multiple business functions before assuming the top finance role. This is proof that while women may take a longer route, the path often results in broader, more adaptive leadership. Humana appointed Mellet as CFO in December 2024, following her tenure as CFO at Global Infrastructure Partners (acquired by BlackRock). Before that, she held senior finance positions at Evercore, Fannie Mae, and Morgan Stanley, where she spent nearly two decades leading treasury, investor relations, and equity research. Mellet brings more than 25 years of experience across global finance and infrastructure, including nearly two decades at Global 500 companies such as Morgan Stanley and Fannie Mae. Though early in her tenure at Humana, the company’s first-quarter 2025 results exceeded analyst expectations, with adjusted EPS of $11.58, roughly 16% above consensus, according to Nasdaq. Humana reaffirmed its full-year guidance, signaling investor confidence amid industry headwinds in Medicare and healthcare services. Her disciplined approach to capital allocation and risk management positions Humana to sustain long-term performance, and aligns with the study finding that women CFOs tend to outperform in both returns and innovation. At Merck, Litchfield has led finance since April 2021, overseeing the company’s finance, procurement, and real estate functions. Over a 35-year career entirely within Merck, she has served as head of finance for global markets across Europe, Canada, and emerging economies, as well as senior vice president of treasury and global human health. Litchfield’s steady ascent reflects the “longer road” women often take, gaining operational expertise across continents before reaching the top. Under her leadership, Merck has maintained consistent revenue growth, with 2024 sales exceeding $60 billion, driven by oncology and vaccine strength, according to the company’s financial report. Her disciplined investment and focus on sustainable innovation have helped Merck balance growth with shareholder stability. Research from McKinsey and LeanIn.org shows that women make up just 29% of the entire C-suite, and even fewer are mothers. They experience heightened “onlyness,” being one of the few women in senior leadership. While Litchfield has publicly acknowledged motherhood and Mellet has not commented on family life, both represent a generation of leaders who navigate professional excellence alongside personal complexity. Women CFOs in the study also report leading on digital adoption: 83% cite AI and automation as central to efficiency and transformation. It’s a reminder that the modern CFO’s influence extends far beyond accounting. To explore what’s behind these findings, I spoke with Pam McIntyre, Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller at OneStream. She explained that the results aren’t just statistical noise. “We controlled for sector and market movement so the signal we saw was real,” McIntyre said. “When a woman steps into the CFO seat, you tend to see stronger returns and faster innovation because her path there often spans strategy, operations, and transformation—not just accounting.” Boards seeking consistent returns and strategic innovation might not need to look outside the organization for their next growth driver. They may simply need to promote her. Mellet and Litchfield are part of a growing cohort of women transforming how global corporations measure performance and value creation. Their paths demonstrate that inclusion in finance leadership is a sound strategy.

According to Deloitte report there are currently 8,030 family offices worldwide, collectively managing approximately $3.1 trillion in assets. This total is projected to increase by 73 percent, reaching $5.4 trillion by 2030, which would exceed the present global hedge fund industry's assets under management ($5 trillion). The number of family offices is anticipated to rise to 10,720 by 2030. North America is the largest, wealthiest hub for family offices, Europe the oldest, and Asia Pacific the fastest growing. Family offices have traditionally been slower to adopt emerging technologies; however, the expectations of younger family members are driving demand for AI-enabled solutions that provide real-time insights and hyper personalised content. Additionally, with the growing allocation to alternative investments and the voluminous data associated with this asset class, family offices are witnessing increasing dependence on advanced technology and integration of AI powered tools. Family offices that integrate AI into their operations will achieve enhanced efficiency and deliver superior client service, whereas those that do not may face competitive disadvantages. According to Citibank’ 2025 Global Family Office Report, the top priorities for technology adoption includes investment management and data analytics platforms (50%), consolidated reporting (39%), and cybersecurity & data protection (37%). Additionally, AI & machine learning (28%) was cited ahead of the remaining priorities including accounting and document management. Apart from these Family member education tools (18%), Alternative investment management (10%) are among the other stated priorities. They key barriers to technology adoption in the family office includes lack of internal expertise (57%) as well as a lack of awareness of available options (34%). Furthermore, cybersecurity or privacy concerns (28%) and uncertainty over return on investment (25%) are also obstacles for technology adoption. Early adopters of AI are using its core capabilities to provide comprehensive portfolio insights, highly personalised market research on emerging themes and investment recommendations, as well as streamlined process automation. Select industry leading examples The following industry-leading examples illustrate approaches to serving high-net-worth individuals, and family offices will find these use cases valuable when developing their own AI strategies. AI has potential to transform the family offices by streamlining processes and automating routine tasks, AI will allow family office advisors to dedicate greater attention to strategic and value-added activities. Key considerations for AI powered solutions include, Conclusion AI is significantly advancing family office technology; nevertheless, achieving optimal results depends on strategic implementation that integrates AI's capabilities with human oversight and expert domain knowledge. AI led transformation will benefit for both single-family offices (SFOs) and multi-family offices (MFOs) including intelligent data management, automated reporting, enhanced governance, and the ability to identify new investment opportunities, leading to increased efficiency and potential returns. The AI powered solutions will allow family offices to unlock efficiencies, deepen insights, and deliver better outcomes for UHNW clients.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has rebounded from a weekend “flash crash” that caused a $500 billion crypto market meltdown and a serious BlackRock warning. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price, which briefly plunged to almost $100,000 per bitcoin from a peak of $126,000 earlier in the week, has climbed back to around $114,000 ahead of a “perfect storm” some see on the horizon. Now, amid a “cascade” bitcoin price warning, the price of gold has surged to a fresh all-time high—something that could mean further volatility for the bitcoin price and crypto market. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “Stock markets, cryptocurrencies and the oil price are all regaining some ground after Friday’s rout, but gold and silver continue to power higher, even as president Trump offers soothing words about the hoped-for summit between China and the U.S., to suggest that someone, somewhere is still feeling nervous,” AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said in emailed comments. After U.S. president Donald Trump reignited the U.S.-China trade war with threats of 100% tariffs on China’s goods coming into the U.S. on Friday, he has tried to defuse the situation, posting that Truth Social that “it will all be fine.” Trade tensions remain a focus for markets, with UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo telling Reuters that "while they have eased again between the U.S. and China, the 100% additional tariff threat remains." While bitcoin is sometimes called "digital gold" due to its limited supply, it continues to trade more like a high-growth technology stock, with traders abandoning it in favour of gold in times of uncertainty. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “Gold and silver surged to new all-time highs as investors added to their exposure,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. "The rally in both metals currently seems relentless, as recent gains have now extended over multiple sessions and show little sign of fatigue despite being considered extremely overbought. It appears that every event only increases the appeal of both gold and silver. Certainly, president Trump’s fresh tariff threat increased demand, while prices rose again after he toned down his attack over the weekend. Could this be evidence of a blow-off top? Maybe. So far there has been no significant pullback, which forces traders who feel underweight in the two metals to pay up, even as they trade at record levels." After gold hit a fresh all-time high of almost $4,100 per ounce, Bank of America raised its 2026 outlook for gold to $5,000.

Title: BlackRock’s IBIT Is Nearing $100B in AUM. Everyone Else Might Be Chasing ‘Crumbs’

As the iShares Bitcoin Trust nears the milestone, dozens of spot-price crypto ETFs are being prepped to come to market. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com The world’s fastest-growing ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), is nearing $100 billion in assets, less than two years after its launch. That puts it among the 20 biggest ETFs, only 18 of which are in the $100 billion-plus club. It clearly shows demand for digital assets, or at least for one product. BlackRock dominates the crypto ETF category, with the next-biggest competitor, Fidelity’s Wise Origin (FBTC), being roughly a quarter of the size. Of course, BlackRock is also the world’s biggest asset manager, at about $12.5 trillion, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. The firm, which also manages the fourth-biggest crypto ETF, the $18 billion iShares Ethereum Trust, hasn’t shown any plans to expand into other digital assets. BlackRock declined to comment, but it has not been among the issuers filing for spot-price ETFs in XRP, Solana or other categories. “The ETF game belonged to BlackRock long before crypto ETFs,” said Tyrone Ross, CEO of 401 Financial and Turnqey Labs. “Everyone else gets the crumbs, and because the market opportunity is so big, other providers can accumulate meaningful AUM with those crumbs.” The iShares ETF, which charges 0.25%, brings in revenue of about $240 million for BlackRock, Bloomberg analysts noted, making it the most profitable fund for the company. There’s a big incentive for companies to add spot-price crypto ETFs, though the Securities and Exchange Commission until recently was slow to approve many. That changed last month, when the regulator gave exemptions to the three big exchanges to use generic listing standards. The effect will be numerous new digital asset ETFs coming to market without a la carte approval by the SEC. Whether there’s investor appetite for numerous versions of Dogecoin is another matter. “Other crypto tokens don’t have the same global adoption or characteristics that make Bitcoin such a strong store of value,” said Mike Casey, president of AE Advisors, who has been recommending Bitcoin allocations since 2019. “The spot ETFs are a frictionless way to add Bitcoin exposure for clients.” While IBIT has the most liquidity and largest market cap, he said the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) are also worth a look. Some of the recent developments in crypto ETFs: Let them eat crumb cake: There are billions of dollars in investments at stake, so expect a deluge of ETFs soon, even if only a small slice gain enough assets to survive. “The door is wide open now for other types of crypto ETFs,” Ross said. “It will be interesting to see how Solana is received and whatever comes after, like a Chainlink, Ripple or Litecoin.” As regulators have warmed up to crypto and assets have poured into ETFs, advisors who ignore the trend risk losing clients, proponents said. Analysts from JPMorgan on Monday wrote that levered ETFs might worsen macro swings by increasing intraday volatility. The firm has waited until now to expand its US product line as sales trends are favoring ETFs over many mutual funds. Low-fee products tracking indexes have outperformed their higher-fee ETF counterparts and have raked in assets. The meme stock category isn’t about stonks and tendies anymore, and the new iteration focuses on broader retail sentiment. Investors have been piling into gold ETFs amid uncertainty exacerbated by the government shutdown and the dollar’s declining status. A slew of 3x leveraged single-stock ETF filings highlights issuer appetite for increasingly risky strategies. Categories outside of the US are seeing double the returns of the S&P 500, despite high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The SEC halted operations last week amid the federal government shutdown, pausing dozens of ETF applications. It may not be an ideal time for high-yield corporate bonds, but State Street is filling out its target-maturity suite with several new ETFs. Active managers like to tout their defy-the-odds abilities, but chances to get in on tomorrow’s large cap stocks slimmer, Morningstar says. ETF share classes of mutual funds (and the other way around) are so close, yet so very far away, as fund boards have a lot of work ahead. © 2025 The Daily Upside

The path to Wall Street has always been competitive — but these days it can be brutal. Aspiring finance pros are preparing as early as their first year in college to secure the internships that open the right doors. Business Insider asked its 2025 Rising Stars of Wall Street, all at the top of their game at 35 or younger, what advice they'd give students who want to follow in their footsteps. They told us that for those who dream of M&A or making big investment bets, curiosity, persistence, and mentorship can make all the difference. We broke their advice into five key themes — plus tips on how to stand out once you land the job. Networking is important to any career, but in finance, it can pay to begin early. Mohini Chakravorty, a principal at private equity behemoth Blackstone, suggested starting in college, taking advantage of free time and a built-in network of alums, clubs, and career connectors. It's "the little things you learn from those conversations and research that really do clue you in as to what you like and what you don't like," the infrastructure investor told Business Insider. "To the extent that you can, narrow down the field. It just gets you closer to where you ultimately want to be." When looking for a connection, JPMorgan's Jack Levendoski said a little creativity and hustle can go a long way. He had a college sophomore send him a handwritten note with a reference to an "overlapping experience" they had in life. "It's hard sometimes to get the attention of people in my role, given how busy things are day to day," he said. Christian Woo, a managing director at Bank of America, said students should look inward, too. "Think about what you're genuinely interested in and passionate about," Woo, a quant strategist, said. Instead of taking the same classes as peers, finance hopefuls should instead pursue the "skills you want to build and what kind of function you want to be performing on a day-to-day basis," he said. When selecting a place to cut your teeth, Sarah Naylor, who works in investment-grade bond sales at Citadel Securities, suggests progress and growth over prestige. "Make sure that you are always somewhere where you are being challenged," she said. "Especially early in your career. Things like job title and pay can seem shiny and exciting at the time, but your knowledge is your biggest asset." Finance "is really a team sport," JPMorgan's Florian Plath said, so it's important to be around colleagues you like working with. "Meet as many people as possible because that's the only way where you can double-click and find that out," the M&A banker told Business Insider. "Everyone needs to find whatever fits best to their unique personality, their interests, and their strengths." Jake Woodson, Goldman Sachs' US head of distressed trading, agrees. "To get to the next level and perform at a high level for a decade or decades is hard to fake," the managing director said. "You need to be intellectually curious and passionate about it and the people." Finding the right crowd doesn't just help you land the job — it can shape your entire trajectory. An upperclassman on Alex Park's Columbia University squash team — who was heading into investment banking — became a major influence on his career journey. "He was instrumental in my ending up being able to get a banking job my senior year," said Park, a principal at Miami-based private equity firm Thoma Bravo. That experience, he added, shaped his belief that the easiest way to grow is to find someone you admire and emulate them. "When you see somebody who is doing what you want to do, who you really respect and look up to, and you can form a real relationship with them and they're able to pour things into you," he said. Nikunj Jain believes that his persistence, tenacity, and determination are what have differentiated him on his way to becoming head of Asia research at the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. "The biggest thing that's paid off for me personally has been just picking a thing and giving it your all," he said. "That mindset served me really well," Jain said, even when things don't work out as planned. "It's underrated, the ability to just show up every single day and take another swing in life and do it with consistency." Visualizing the big picture is also key to finding focus. Blue Owl's Lamar Cardinez suggests imagining the most exciting thing you could do at the peak of your career, and "then work backwards and really ask yourself if you currently have the skillset." It's that "critical" self-assessment that helped Cardinez — who started his career in business development at the National Football League — realize he wanted to move into sports investing. He's now doing that on Blue Owl's HomeCourt Partners Fund, which invests in National Basketball Association's franchises. Once you're in the door is when the real work begins. One of the most repeated pieces of advice given by the rising stars we interviewed was to "be a sponge," as Natalie Lamberton, a director at Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR, said. For Patrick Kearney, a principal at private equity giant Apollo, said he's big on keeping a "learning mentality, being curious, and, at the right times, being skeptical. That means knowing how to ask the right questions." Aman Mittal, an investment banker at Moelis & Company, and Catherine Kress, chief of staff to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, suggested getting the basics down. Know "the actual content of whatever you're doing," Mittal, a managing director, said. "Make sure that you know that very in and out." "If you do the really, really little things well, people will continue to trust you with the big things," said Kress, who took her new post in September. Madelaine O'Connell, a managing director at private credit firm HPS, a part of BlackRock, encouraged fresh recruits to focus on the task at hand and try not to "look around too much." Post-college, many, especially in investment banking, are already looking for the next job. This is especially common for those trying to get into private equity. "There's a lot within the four walls of investment banking or an asset manager, and a lot of mobility opportunities that if you work hard, you excel, you can do everything."

Title: Call for clarity on Ireland's data centre policy
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1013/1538245-data-centre-policy/

Adam Maguire Business Journalist Tens of billions of euro of investment is being diverted to other countries due to uncertainty around Ireland's data centre policy, according to Digital Infrastructure Ireland. There has been an effective moratorium on new data centre connections since late 2021, while the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities is currently reviewing its policy on large energy users. DII has called for a firm timeline from the CRU on the publication of that policy - and says a fresh wave of investment is now at stake. "You cannot get a connection off the grid now from either ESB Networks, Eirgrid or Gas Networks Ireland," said Maurice Mortell, chairman of Digital Infrastructure Ireland. "We're still waiting for the CRU policy decision on large energy users to come out - we're four years now in a defacto moratorium on any new investments." As part of the National Development Plan, the Government committed €3.5 billion to upgrading and securing the energy network - key to addressing the current bottleneck in the system. Mr Mortell welcomed this, but said this did not resolve the uncertainty that persists. "I think it's welcome... I think the reality is, though, that's going to take time to deliver," he said. "If you look at the level of investment that we've lost over the past 12 months - billions of dollars of AI has gone into the UK, the Nordics, central Europe, the Mediteranian. "They're 10 year investments - we won't see that again for a while."

Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences Mr Mortell said that he accepted there were a number of factors that had to be considered - including the enviromental impact data centres have - but the lack of a clear policy was not benefitting anyone. "In order to look at a long-term strategy for Ireland, we need to have clarity around what is Ireland's renewable energy timeframe, what capacity are you going to bring onto the grid and how can our industry continue to develop and grow in Ireland," he said. A recent report by Blackrock said that data centre investment in Ireland had peaked, and was now growing at a faster pace in other countries. Ireland was an early leader in the area of data centres, but despite that Mr Mortell said it was not inevitable that it would eventually start to fall behind others. "Dublin wasn't the only big metro - there was Amsterdam, there was Paris, there was Frankfurt, there was London and they all went through similar growth to ours," he said. "It wasn't always that we were going to peak and then stop - we just didn't invest in the grid and the capacity at the right time. "All of the things that are coming through now was planned 10 years ago - it wasn't news to EirGrid or ESB Networks that there was going to be new capacity coming online."

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.”— Carl Sagan [H/t William Readdy] Number of the Week: 3 Watts per square meter v. 50 watts per square meter THIS WEEK:By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This TWTW begins with comments on what is meant when a greenhouse gas is said to be saturated. TWTW discusses a new edition of Climate at a Glance and discusess marine heat waves. TWTW presents an essay by Steven Koonin on political conformity in the reports by National Academies on climate and concludes with a report on the biases demonstrated by internet search engines. ********************* What Is Meant by Saturation?: For most purposes, the concept of saturation means that no more can be absorbed. For example, when a sponge of a given size cannot absorb any more water, it is said to be saturated with water. If the size of the sponge is doubled, it can absorb twice the amount of water. The limiting factor is the size, quantity, of the sponge. But the same concept does not apply to saturation when dealing with greenhouse gases absorbing and emitting infrared radiation (IR) from Earth. For example, TWTW has frequently stated that the capability of carbon dioxide (CO2) to absorb infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth is saturated. But here the meaning is different. It is that all the infrared radiation (IR) that carbon dioxide can readily absorb is already being absorbed. Additional carbon dioxide can absorb only a little more infrared energy from Earth. The limiting factor is not the quantity of carbon dioxide, but the quantity of infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth. Adding more carbon dioxide (CO2) has little effect on Earth’s surface temperatures, but what has significant effect on Earth’s surface temperatures is the solar radiation hitting Earth’s surface, either by increasing solar intensity or decreasing Earth’s albedo (decreasing cloudiness or other reflectivity). The greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide (and water vapor) delays rapid cooling of the Earth at night by reducing the emission of infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth to space. The extent of infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth is calculated by the Stefan-Boltzmann law which states that the infrared radiation is proportion to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. Here we see a stunning inconsistency that must be included when making calculations of the greenhouse effect. A large increase in the greenhouse effect (a reduction of infrared radiation from Earth to space) from carbon dioxide is necessary to cause a small increase in Earth’s temperatures because the increase in radiation from Earth is a function of the absolute temperature raised to the fourth power. In today’s atmosphere a slight increase in carbon dioxide (and water vapor) has little effect in increasing Earth’s temperatures because the infrared radiation (IR) in the frequencies (or wave lengths) in which these gases readily absorb infrared radiation (IR) is already being absorbed. Professor William van Wijngaarden and Professor Emeritus William Happer produced a paper that describes what they mean by saturation. Unfortunately, the paper is a bit mathematical. But the results of their calculations can be described verbally and displayed graphically. Their graphics and calculation are below, assuming the surface temperature of Earth is 60ºF (16ºC), it would be 16ºF (-9 ºC) without greenhouse gases. Max Planck refined the Stefan-Boltzmann law to develop the top (smooth) curve showing the radiation emitted by Earth’s surface. Karl Schwarzschild developed the method for calculating the lower (jagged) curve showing the Earth’s actual radiation to space, now calculated from satellite measurements. The difference between the two curves is Earth’s greenhouse effect due to atmospheric gases. The calculations of the greenhouse effect assume no clouds because there is no adequate theory of the formation and dissipation of clouds. The understanding of saturation is so important to understanding the real greenhouse effect that TWTW is presenting it the way that van Wijngaarden and Happer did, rather than trying to give a short, condensed summary. START QUOTE: Figure 1: Radiation flux to space, ˜ Z(ν,C), from the top of the atmosphere as a function of spatial frequency ν (waves per cm) of the thermal radiation. The calculated values are for a summertime, temperate latitude, and a surface temperature of 288.7 K. We have noted the spatial frequencies where the atmospheric opacity is dominated by the five major greenhouse gases, water vapor, H2O, carbon dioxide, CO2, ozone O3, methane, CH4, and nitrous oxide, N2O. The black curve is the solution to the Schwarzschild equation for radiative transfer for C = 400 parts per million (ppm) of CO2, close to the present concentration. The red curve is for double that amount, C = 800 ppm, but for the same profiles of atmospheric temperature and other greenhouse gases concentrations. The green curve is for no CO2 at all. The smooth blue curve is the Planck flux for the same temperature, that is, the radiation that would reach space if there were no greenhouse gases at all and the surface had maximum thermal emissivity, ϵ = 1. We can define the total radiative forcing, F(C), due to a concentration C of CO2 as From (2)–(5) we see that three explicit values of the forcing are: A simple empirical formula for the forcing, F = F(C), that fits detailed calculation of the forcing well for 1 ppm < C < 10,000 ppm is Figure 2: The blue curve is the radiative flux to space, Z(C), given by (12), versus the concentration C of carbon dioxide. The flux decreases rapidly with C for the first 100 ppm of CO2, but the rate of decrease slows down for higher concentrations. The vertical red lines show the flux decreases caused by 50 ppm increases of C for the sequence of values, [C0,C1,C2,C3, . . .] = [0, 50, 100, 150, . . .] ppm. Each additional 50 ppm increase has less effect than the previous one. For example, we see from the figure that the height of the first red bar, characterized by i = 2, is approximately 300 W m−2. So, increasing the CO2 concentration from C1 = 50 ppm to C2 = 100 ppm decreases the flux to space by 300 W m−2/100 = 3 W m−2, in agreement with (5), since CO2 concentrations have doubled. Using (8) to set F = 30 W m−2, C = 400 ppm and (5) to ΔF = 3 W m−2, we solve (10) for Co to find We use (6) and (10) to approximate the flux to outer space as In Fig. 2 we have plotted (12) as the blue line, and we have plotted increments Z(C−ΔC)− Z(C) = F(C) − Z(C − ΔC) for equal increments ΔC = 50 ppm of CO2 concentration as the vertical red lines. The literature is replete with plots similar to the red vertical lines, but the blue line, the flux to space with no suppressed zero, is little known, and may clarify how small the forcing change is when the CO2 concentration increases from 400 ppm to 800 ppm. [Boldface added] Note that we are plotting fluxes and flux changes in Fig. 2, not temperature changes. This has the advantage that our results are almost the same as the most carefully calculated results of the climate-alarm establishment [1]. So, it would be awkward for the establishment to deny that “instantaneous,” very large changes of CO2 concentration cause very small changes of flux to space. But people are interested in temperature changes, not flux changes. This is where all the mischief from positive feedback arises. Without huge positive feedbacks, ΔF = 3 W m−2 of clear-sky forcing only gives about 1 ºC of surface warming. Changes in water vapor and clouds are likely to significantly diminish the temperature changes due to changes in greenhouse gases, since most feedbacks in nature are negative. As shown in Fig. 2, adding CO2 to the atmosphere causes a very rapid decrease of flux to space, Z(C), for an atmosphere that starts with no CO2, C = 0. The decrease with increasing C then slows down dramatically so the blue curve of Fig. 2 is almost horizontal up to 1000 ppm. This is a familiar phenomenon to astronomers who work with radiation transfer from stars. It is called “saturation.” A good definition of saturation for the field of radiation transfer was given by Gussman [2] [Paragraph breaks added to above 2 paragraphs.] “Saturation in a Fraunhofer line means that with increasing absorption the depression in the line (line depth) is no longer proportional to the optical thickness of the absorbing layer, as in the case of weak absorption.” A perceptive astronomer looking at Fig. 1 would say that Earth’s thermal emission spectrum has a prominent Fraunhofer line from CO2, analogous to the yellow “D Fraunhofer line” of the Sun. The word “saturation” means different things in different scientific fields. For example, if you add 360 grams of table salt crystals to a kilogram of water at room temperature (about 1 liter), the salt will dissolve completely to give a “saturated” solution. If you add 1000 grams of salt to a kilogram of water, only 360 grams will dissolve and 640 grams will remain as solid crystals on the bottom of the container. Adding more salt to a saturated solution has no effect on the amount of salt in solution. Adding more CO2 to the atmosphere, when its effects on radiation transfer are saturated, continues to decrease flux to space. But the decrease gets smaller and smaller as more CO2 is added. [Boldface added] END QUOTE Physicist Tom Sheahen, Chairman of SEPP and an editor of TWTW, has frequently complained that most researchers use the “standard atmosphere” — an artificial gas that contains no H2O – leaving them without any explanation for the great majority of the greenhouse effect (i.e., H2O). They tried to add the effect of H2O as a “feedback” mechanism later on. That was a major error in Manabe’s initial work (in the 1960s, for which he received the Nobel Prize), and it’s been wrong ever since, driving billions of dollars’ worth of faulty models that give erroneous results.

Apparently, she was unaware that the deep ocean contains a great deal of carbon dioxide, which counterbalances the otherwise high alkalinity of the oceans. The primary production areas of the ocean are caused by ocean upwellings that bring up the carbon dioxide and other nutrients to feed phytoplankton, which form the base of the marine food web. Such regions are found on the California coast, the coast of Peru, and the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, Canada. Now the current fear for the oceans has shifted to Marine Heat waves. Ron Clutz gives an account of this new fear including a study published by the US Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The title of one paper is “Global warming drives a threefold increase in persistence and 1 °C rise in intensity of marine heatwaves” by Marta Marcos, et al. Abstract begins with: “Marine heatwaves are extreme climatic events consisting of persistent periods of warm ocean waters that have profound impacts on marine life. These episodes are becoming more intense, longer, and more frequent in response to anthropogenic global warming. Here, we provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment on the role of global warming on marine heatwaves. To do so, we construct a counterfactual version of observed global sea surface temperatures since 1940, corresponding to a stationary climate without the effect of long-term increasing global temperatures, and use it to calculate the contribution of global air temperature rise on the intensity and persistence of marine heatwaves.” [Boldface added] A counterfactual version is a fabricated version and is not a factual version of global sea surface temperatures. The global climate was not stable since the 1940s. Given that global climate models greatly overestimate the warming of the atmosphere, there is no reason to assume that such fabrications are of value. Further, Clutz brings up Ross McKitrick’s (a SEPP Seitz Award recipient) excellent critique of the procedures used in these studies. Such studies are speculation and are not statistically valid. Unfortunately, we will continue to see them.

Koonin demonstrated his concern for the integrity of science and scientific reports with an essay in the Wall Street Journal, “Another Tale of Climate Change Bias: The government should stop funding the National Academies’ climate studies until they shed the political conformity.” After discussing Climate Week in New York City, the senior fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution and a member of the National Academy of Sciences discusses the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine report. He states: “The academies’ study—which was put together in less than two months—was obviously meant to bolster the scientific basis for the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2009 finding that greenhouse-gas emissions threaten the nation’s well-being. The study therefore plays down or ignores evidence undermining that conclusion. This agenda is evident from the first sentence of the preface, which invokes the terrible flood of the Guadalupe River in Texas in July. The report doesn’t mention that similar events have been recorded since the late 19th century and show no detectable trend to the present, even as emissions have soared. Assessments of climate science often minimize, or even ignore, natural variability to make recent climate trends or weather events seem unusual and hence a consequence of greenhouse-gas emissions. The National Academies’ report is no exception. It describes a recent acceleration of global sea-level rise observed by satellites without mentioning a comparable acceleration during the 1930s. There are similar failures in the report’s coverage of U.S. heat waves (which aren’t more common in recent decades than they were in the decades around 1900) and of North Atlantic hurricanes (which show no long-term trends in frequency or intensity). The report deceptively shapes its discussion of the models used to project climate changes. The writers gush about how the models are improving. But they give no quantitative sense of how deficient even the improved models are. They also omit some important but inconvenient topics. A reader won’t learn of humans’ demonstrated ability to adapt and reduce vulnerability to a changing climate, or of the projected minimal net effect of warming on the U.S. economy. The academies’ study stands in stark contrast to the recent Department of Energy report, of which I am a co-author. The DOE report properly places extreme weather events and recent climate trends in the context of natural variability. It also doesn’t shy away from subjects that contradict a Grimm [alluding to folk tales by the Brothers Grimm] perspective. Our report was intended to bring attention to important topics in climate science that have been overlooked or played down in past assessments and so are absent from popular and political climate narratives. The National Academies’ study didn’t attempt to refute the DOE findings. It simply ignored them and the data on which they were based. It’s not surprising that the two reports have no authors in common and cite entirely different sets of peer-reviewed papers. The incomplete and biased picture of climate science in the National Academies’ study demonstrates the need for the DOE report. It does a disservice to the public by not explaining how and why its findings differ from the DOE’s. Flawed pronouncements that support advocacy by minimizing or ignoring scientific disagreements feed public distrust of science. Whatever the fate of the EPA’s 2009 finding on greenhouse-gas emissions, which the agency is reviewing, the Academies’ view of greenhouse-gas impacts must be reconciled with the DOE’s more sanguine perspective. Complete and transparent analyses of the risks of climate change are overdue. Sadly, the National Academies’ report isn’t that. I helped oversee National Academies studies in engineering and physical sciences for six years. Those reports lived up to the claim to provide “independent, objective analysis and advice.” But the academies have long had problems of bias and advocacy on climate matters. The government would do well to stop funding their climate studies until they get their house in order.” See Article # 1. ********************* Censorship by “Consensus”? In WUWT Tilak Doshi has an essay describing how big tech censors the news using their search engines by not including dissenting views, no matter how strongly based on physical evidence these views are. For example, Doshi writes: The Google AI response uses an old trick in the book of shyster arguments: it argues from authority. This is a form of argument in which the opinion of an authority figure or institution is used as evidence to support the thesis proposed. The argument from authority is a logical fallacy, and obtaining knowledge in this way is unsound. Richard Lindzen, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at MIT, has written about the long march through the institutions by progressive neo-Marxian ideology, subverting key agencies in the climate industrial complex to sing from the same climate alarmist hymn sheet. Google’s algorithms, as [Robert] Epstein’s data suggest, are designed to prioritize a singular perspective – the globalist climate agenda — while burying dissenting voices. Renowned scientists like William Happer, John Clauser, Judith Curry, and Richard Lindzen — whose credentials include professorships at Princeton, MIT, and Nobel Prize laureates — are effectively erased from search results. Their arguments – which show that climate change is within the bounds of natural variability, that increasing CO2 levels will not significantly increase global temperatures and that CO2 promotes global greening – are nowhere to be found in the Google search results. This is censorship is not the major issue; the major issue is that those who desire to obtain differing views on a controversial subject cannot hope to do so using most internet search engines. Doshi writes: “The pattern is clear: dissent from the approved narrative — whether on climate, Covid or politics — results in erasure, not engagement. A Glimmer of Hope? Grok is an AI-powered assistant developed by xAI, Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, designed to be “maximally truthful, useful and curious.” Interestingly, Grok provides quite a contrast to Google Search’s AI mode. When I asked Grok the same question (“Are we facing a climate crisis”?), its response in contrast to Google’s (reported above) concluded as follows: ‘No, we’re not facing a ‘climate crisis.’ Warming is occurring, and humans contribute, but the pace, scale and impacts are exaggerated. Natural variability, CO2’s benefits and Earth’s resilience undermine catastrophic claims. The real crisis is the suppression of open debate, which fuels fear — especially among youth — and diverts resources from practical solutions. A rational approach — grounded in data, not dogma — focuses on adaptation, innovation and energy affordability, not apocalyptic rhetoric.’ The idea of a ‘climate crisis’ is a polarizing claim, often framed as an urgent, existential threat driven by human activity, particularly fossil fuel emissions. Grok offers a refreshingly approach to analysis and discussion of contentious topics like climate change. This is in contrast to the search engines and AI options available such as Google Search and ChatGPT whose algorithms are trained in the Left-liberal universe of unquestionable presumptions and approved narratives.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Number of the Week: 3 Watts per square meter v. 50 watts per square meter. In their calculations, van Wijngaarden and Happer show that a doubling of CO2 from 400 parts per million in volume (ppmv) to 800 ppmv will result in increase in the greenhouse effect of about 3 watts per square meter (3 W/m2). It is doubtful that humans will feel this difference. At rest, the average human body emits over 50 watts per square meter of body surface, 17 times more heat.

Electricity generation and distribution were privatized in 1990, and the coal industry, which had been nationalized back in 1946, soon followed in the new light of the free market. But in the process, Margaret Thatcher jumped too quickly on the climate issue for short-run gain. The good news is that she quickly and completely corrected herself. She got “mugged by reality,” as they say. Changing Weather Is Washington State Really Getting Drier? By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, Oct 3, 2025 No real trend over the last century and a quarter. As the planet warms, more of our mountain precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow, but reservoir systems, such as the Yakima’s, can store the water no matter how it gets into the river. It might be wise to expand regional reservoirs to save more winter rain. Floods Data For 2024/25 in England By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 10, 2025 Link to report: Flood and coastal erosion risk management report: 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 By Staff, Environment Agency, Sep 19, 2025 From Homewood: The Environment Agency have now confirmed that an estimated 3200 properties were flooded in England in the 12 months to March 2025. (This figure only applies to major events, as they do not collate data for all incidents) Their previous annual reports clearly no show no worsening trend, despite their annual extreme weather propaganda. One interesting piece of information is that only 3500 properties are at risk of coastal erosion by 2055. I realize this is not a nice problem to face for those who live there, but the number really is tiny on the overall view of things, given some of the hysterical reporting in the media.

Loeb, et al., PNAS, Sep 29, 2025 From article: While the distance between these radiation budgets slowly grows (by about 0.34 watts per square meter per decade), the differences will be enough to significantly impact climate models and skew our view of the planet’s future. Hopefully, with time and ample innovation, we’ll find a way to get these radiation budgets back on track. [SEPP Comment: The climate models are incapable of forecasting climate, so what is skewing – continued errors? We simply don’t know clouds at all!] Communicating Better to the Public – Go Personal. CLIMATE CRITICS POUNCE! How the Media Turned “Questioning a UN Bureaucrat” Into a Hate Crime Against Science By Charles Rotter, WUWT, Oct 9, 2025 Apparently, Roger Pielke Jr. — a political scientist with the unfortunate habit of reading data instead of chanting slogans — wrote an op-ed questioning whether Dr. Friederike Otto, an activist who co-founded World Weather Attribution, might not be the most neutral person to help lead the next United Nations climate report. Otto’s research, you see, keeps showing up in lawsuits against the oil and gas industry. Big ones. The kind of lawsuits where the legal fees could buy an entire Tesla fleet and still leave room for a virtue-signaling dinner at Davos. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda Worst drought since… By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 8, 2025 And how exactly will building windmills make it rain? It is prudent to beware the experts who say, and the journalists who say they say, and the “studies” that show what the journalists say that the experts say, and above all it is vital to beware the passive voice, in journalism as in life generally. Expanding the Orthodoxy The Lancet’s New Push To Ban Meat By William M. Briggs, His Blog, Oct 8, 2025 [H/t John Dunn] Link to: The EAT–Lancet Commission on healthy, sustainable, and just food systems [Boldface added] By Prof Johan Rockström, et al., The Lancet, Oct 2, 205 From abstract: Actions on food systems strongly impact the lives and wellbeing of all and are necessary to progress towards goals highlighted in the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, and the Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. Although current food systems have largely kept pace with population growth, ensuring sufficient caloric intake for many, they are the single most influential driver of planetary boundary transgression. [Boldface added] From Briggs: Science is not the answer. It cannot be “because Science” that you ought to give up meat. Which Harvard scientists want you to do in the name of “justice”. And, of course, to save the planet. Which is in no danger and does not need saving. Justice is not a concept in Science. Science is forever mute on justice. Or fairness. Or equity or Equality. Questioning European Green In The UK The Net Zero Consensus Has Crumbled By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Oct 3, 2025 [SEPP Comment: Menton may be too optimistic.] Net Zero ‘Lies’ Exposed | Keir Starmer’s Promises Undermined By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 8, 2025 Eight-minute video interview of Kathryn Porter: Green Energy’s High Price: Wind Farms Are Ravaging Nature, Biodiversity By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Oct 5, 2025 Questioning Green Elsewhere Japan’s Green Energy Failures Serve as a Warning to the US: Don’t Fall for the Climate Agenda By Yoshihiro Muronaka, CO2 Coalition, Oct 6, 2025 https://co2coalition.org/2025/10/06/https-www-westernjournal-com-japans-green-energy-failures-serve-warning-us-dont-fall-climate-agenda/ Offshore wind’s LCOE is around 12–16 ¢/kWh, but when the full cost of electricity (FCOE) is considered, it rises to 20–30 ¢/kWh. Nuclear and gas remain much lower, at roughly 12–14 ¢/kWh and 10–12 ¢/kWh, respectively. Globally, however, floating wind remains at the developmental stage. Norway’s Hywind Scotland and France’s Provence Grand Large provide valuable data, but their costs remain far higher than fixed-bottom projects. Commercial viability has not yet been proven. Betting on floating wind as a “game-changer” risks repeating the same error: political enthusiasm without economic grounding. For policymakers worldwide, Japan’s case should not be seen as an embarrassment, but as a warning and an opportunity: Energy transitions must be guided by facts, not hopes, if they are to be sustainable. Aussie Green Wall Cracks: Queensland Commits to Reliable Coal until 2046 By Eric Worrall, WUWT, Oct 10, 2025 From article: “Queenslanders should not be penalized over unscientific decisions down south that favor ideology over economics and engineering,” he said. “We don’t have the pipeline capacity to keep bailing out Victoria’s bad decisions. The solution to the southern state gas crisis is for the southern states to develop their gas reserves. We’re not asking them to do anything we haven’t done ourselves.” From Worrall: There is no guarantee the new 2046 target will stick – the 2035 target could be restored by a future Queensland administration. And anyone seeking to invest in coal would also have to contend with our radical green federal government. Whee we’re climate competitive By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Oct 8, 2025 As for Carney’s end of the supposed bargain, Parliament just voted to retain the “oil and gas emissions cap” while subsidies pour into failed alternatives. Oh, and BTW the bureaucracy continues to insist that that oil and gas cap will have “very minimal impact” on the energy industry but a massive impact on emissions. But they would, wouldn’t they?” Green Jobs Utility-scale Solar: The Grim News Begins (Blue Ridge “wind-down’) By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, Oct 9, 2025 Solar as grid electricity is a government-created industry. It would not exist without the large tax credits that began with the 10 percent ITC in 1978, which was extended six times (1980, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991). Then came the 30 percent credit in the Energy Policy Act of 1992, itself extended seven times (2006, 2008, 2009, 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2022). That’s a total of thirteen extensions if you are counting. So much for an ‘infant’ industry, which was not infant to begin with. Non-Green Jobs All change at the Unite union By Anonymous, Net Zero Watch, Oct 3, 2025 However, just as I was about to despair of any change in their apparently dogmatic position, along came a Unite official, Cliff Bowen, who represents 35,000 oil and gas workers.

NCAR develops and runs advanced climate and weather models, including the well-regarded Community Earth System Model. These simulations often require supercomputers, like the one NCAR jointly operates with the University of Wyoming in Cheyenne. [SEPP Comment: NCAR does not bother testing its climate model against physical evidence of atmospheric warming. Further, its databases do not consider past cold periods.] The Political Games Continue Will The Green Tory Blob Allow Kemi To Cancel Net Zero? By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 4, 2025 [Leader of the Conservative Party] Kemi Badenoch has now confirmed that she will scrap the Climate Change Act, along with its Net Zero targets. But will her MPs allow her to do it? Will Kemi’s Promise Make Any Difference? By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 10, 2025 Is Kemi Badenoch’s pledge to abolish Net Zero all it seems? These costs have been deliberately kept hidden from voters for years. But they are essential if we are to have a rational debate about climate policy.

Of course, what Sky [news] forgot to tell you is that the grid is dependent on 36 GW of gas power capacity, without which we would have no electricity supply at all. Have Renewables Overtaken Coal? [UK] By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Oct 8, 2025 Kathryn Porter mentioned claims that renewables were now supplying more electricity than coal on a worldwide basis. As she pointed out, the claim originated with Ember, the renewable lobby outfit who claimed that Labour’s energy plans would reduce bills by £300! Hardly trustworthy then! Nevertheless, if you include hydro and burning trees in “renewables”, renewable and coal generation have been neck and neck for a while: Buy Electrons Before Bytes: A Practical Plan to Power the AI Boom By Theodor Engøy, Real Clear Energy, Oct 6, 2025 Start with a simple rule: buy electrons before bytes. Match each gigawatt of new data‑center load to contracted, firm low‑carbon generation (nuclear, hydro, geothermal, gas with CCS where credible) plus storage and specific transmission upgrades. [SEPP Comment: The writer is from Norway which is one of the few places that have excess hydro.

First of all, the system operator RE decided during the morning of the blackout that a gas power plant, Thermal 5-Centre/South West, which had been operating overnight was not needed that day: Again, this gives the lie to the claim about gas plants. RE left it far too late to order the CCGT up, as it takes 90 minutes to fire up. I cannot find anything in the report about what actually caused the oscillations. But it seems abundantly clear that RE deliberately ran gas power to dangerously low levels, presumably because the system was overloaded with solar power. RE then compounded matters by reacting far too late.

By Kate Selig, The Washington Post, Oct 8, 2025 {H/t Bernie Kepshire] The company, Terradot, is spreading tons of volcanic rock crushed into a fine dust over land where soybeans, sugar cane and other crops are grown. As rain percolates through the soil, chemical reactions pull carbon from the air and convert it into bicarbonate ions that eventually wash into the ocean, where the carbon remains stored. The claims made by enhanced rock weathering start-ups have drawn some skepticism from researchers who say they want to see data and peer-reviewed research supporting them. Terradot said it will publish its data as part of the carbon-crediting process after the credits are delivered.

Another Tale of Climate Change Bias The government should stop funding the National Academies’ climate studies until they shed the political conformity. By Steven E. Koonin, WSJ, Oct. 6, 2025 TWTW Summary: The main part is presented in the This Week section above. ***************** Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email. Type your email… Subscribe I’ve mentioned it quite a while ago, that Happer & Wijngaarden’s paper was the nail in the coffin for the effect of CO2 on climate. Even a doubling of CO2 will have practically no effect on global warming. For the other GHG’s (not including water) their concentrations and absorbtion frequencies mean that their effects are negligible. Even for water, one would have to stably add a huge quantity of it to the atmosphere to see an effect. This was the case after the Hunga Tonga eruption, and it’s effects were visible, but very moderate. Since 2022, this added water is mostly gone, and its effects as well. I would also like to thank the author for this very clear article explaining what “saturation” really means when talking about GHG’s. Physically, it’s to say: a molecule cannot absorb any light if it has a lot of other similar molecules around it that absorb the incoming light first. At saturation, a lot of molecules absorb very little or no light at all, so even more of them won’t change much. This same nation which once repelled the Luftwaffe, cracked the Enigma code, and supplied half the world with coal and steel, now stands imperiled by a mild change in the weather. On the face of it that is indeed the way it appears. However, you simply cannot compare the political elites of today with those of the 1930s and 1940s. For example, today’s bright young progressives believe… Churchill was a ‘racist’ and comparable to Hitler, says academic (Professor Kehinde Andrews). – ITVX But then, he (and others like Lenny Henry) thinks we should give every black person – that’s the only qualifier – in the UK an equal share of £18 trillion in reparations. So, there you go. That’s one source of progressive British self-loathing and guilt. Critical theories are the order of the day, especially with the current Labour government, and I don’t have to spell out what they are about. At a Labour Party conference Starmer gave a speech and regarding the war in Gaza he called for…. The release of the sausages. Express After the disaster at Dunkirk, Churchill gave a speech… Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender And Starmer’s latest gaffe? The US ambassador to Israel has called Cabinet minister Bridget Phillipson “delusional” for claiming the UK played a “key role” in securing the ceasefire in Gaza. Standard It’s no wonder we have a ideologically driven madman in charge of deindustrialising the nation… ‘I’m sorry, but that’s my policy. I’m not prepared to talk about it’. – Ed Miliband No comparison at all I see that particularly in Switzerland where the 7 executive branch leaders are elected by parliament and not by the people. If it was by the people, there would be information on the competence of the candidates, and hopefully, the best one would get elected. In the case of parliamentary election, the others parties vote for the weakest candidate of the proposing party, or the one who is the most in line with their own party line, or who goes along to get along. Competence in this case isn’t an issue, it’s even contrary to their interests to have a well qualified representative of a competing party in power. And it goes even further: It’s better for them not to have a well qualified person in charge of a certain department. He might change things for the better, which isn’t good for their own party’s image. This is unfortunately present in a host of governments in Europe right now, where a lot of emerging politicians don’t even have a diploma, or have interrupted their studies to go into politics. In the UK it’s hard to knock a country that is way more democratic and holds referenda – asking the people. After Brexit we’ll never get another. But even Switzerland is no utopia. It is heavily influenced by the neighbouring, nay surrounding EU, and has recently signed another agreement to strengthen and modernise bilateral relations. ﻿ “The greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide (and water vapor) delays rapid cooling of the Earth at night by reducing the emission of infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth to space.” It may have escaped the author’s notice that the surface cools at night, regardless of how much or how little “greenhouse gas” is present. As a matter of fact, the surface cools to around -90 C, in places. It is a matter of observation that using CO2 as an insulator (based on its supposed ability to prevent infrared leaving a body) is something that only the ignorant and gullible would pursue in any practical application. At least the “greenhouse effect” is now defined as something that “delays rapid cooling of the Earth at night”. No mention of “heating” or “warming”! Reality intruding into the GHE fantasy? One can but hope. In some deserts the temperature falls rapidly after sunset due to low RH. In summer with high RH in many areas, the night temperature falls very slowly and the air is muggy and uncomfortable. Professors van Wijngaarden and Happer also calculate, using radiant transfer models (RTM), that CO2 doesn’t emit to space below 80+ km. What they don’t address is the impact, if any, that non-radiative deactivation / activation of GHGs by collisions with much more abundant non-GHG species might have on the applicability of said RTMs to tropospheric heat transfer. It is apparent from carbonate and ice core data that large variations in atmospheric CO2 concentration have had no impact on the Earth’s temperature. One explanation for this is that RTMs are applicable within the troposphere and that the effect of CO2 is effectively saturated. Another is that RTMs are not applicable within the troposphere and that the so-called GHE simply reflects the lower speed at which heat is transferred aloft via mainly convective processes. As both mechanisms can ‘explain’ the Earth’s outgoing LWIR spectrum, it would be useful if SEPP would address the concerns of some CAGW skeptics that the application of RTMs within the troposphere is incorrect and leaves the door open to climate alarmism. The calculations of the greenhouse effect assume no clouds because there is no adequate theory of the formation and dissipation of clouds. there is no adequate theory of the formation and dissipation of clouds. ____________________________________________________________ I’m trying to come up with a good analogy for that. So far: A startup company presents a business plan to the bank in order secure a loan. All the engineering and marketing studies are top notch. However there is no adequate method to determine the cost of the materials so that cost is omitted. Hmmm, really doesn’t need an analogy, the stupidity is obvious as it stands. Under the first topic of the above article, this statement: “The limiting factor is not the quantity of carbon dioxide, but the quantity of infrared radiation (IR) emitted by Earth.” As regards looking at the effect of CO2, that is technically NOT true. There are two factors that allow a greater quantity of IR being emitted by Earth than just that than can be absorbed by CO2 in the atmosphere: 1) CO2 has very limited spectral bands for absorbing LWIR emitted by Earth, see attached graph, and 2) Some of CO2’s absorption bands are also included in water vapor’s absorption bands, with water vapor overwhelming absorption in those overlapping spectral frequencies due to its greater molecular concentration . . . water vapor at typical global average levels of about 2,500 ppmv (but ranging up to 50,000 ppmv) versus CO2 now at about 430 ppmv . . . PLUS the fact that the CO2 molecule do not have a permanent dipole moment whereas H2O does have a permanent dipole moment, making is a much stronger absorber of LWIR at any wavelength. Bottom line: it is not that “It is that all the infrared radiation (IR) that carbon dioxide can readily absorb is already being absorbed” as it is that a large amount of the infrared radiation (LWIR) that carbon dioxide might readily absorb is already being absorbed by water vapor (particularly in the radiation band centered around 15 microns . . .again, see attached chart). Nonetheless, most of Earth’s emitted LWIR is absorbed by GHGs in the atmosphere, then converted to energy of the predominant N2 and O2 constituents via molecular collisions before being radiated to deep space as broad spectrum thermal radiation. Ooops . . . here is the chart that I referenced above showing the spectral bands of absorption of Earth’s LWIR by various constituents in its atmosphere. I agree with what you’ve said here, only seeing the need to add what I’ve gleaned from Shula & Ott (S&O) that convection plays a major role in transporting energy from near the surface, where excited GHGs are predominantly deactivated by collisions, to the upper layers of the troposphere, where non-excited GHGs are predominantly activated by collisions and can then effectively radiate IR to space. My sense is that there are other ‘skeptics’ here who also think that the effects of collisions, conversion of thermal energy to / from sensible heat and convection have been minimized or ignored by mainstream climate science because it effectively means that radiative transfer theory (RTT), while descriptive, doesn’t physically portray how thermal energy is actually transported through the troposphere. Given what’s at stake, I’d certainly like to see some open discussion here at TWTW / WUWT between S&O and the folks at SEPP re. the merits, if any, of the formers’ ideas on the applicability of RTT to tropospheric heat transfer. Harold The Organic Chemist Says: RE: The Greenhouse Effect RE: Greenhouse Gases: H2O vs CO2 At the Mauna Loa Obs. in Hawaii, the concentration of CO2 in dry air is 425 ppmv. One cubic meter of this air has a mass of 1.29 kg and contains 0.83 g of CO2 at STP. In air at 70° and 70% RH, the concentration of H2O is 17,780 ppmv. one cubic meter of this air has a mass of 1.20 kg and contains 14.3g of H20 and 0.77 g of CO2. To the first approximation and all things being equal, the fraction of the greenhouse effect(GHE) due H2O is given by: GHE=moles H2O/(moles H2O+moles CO2)=0.79/(0.79+0.018)=0.98 This calculation assumes that a molecule of H2O and molecule CO2 each absorb about the same amount of out-going long wavelength IR light. Actually, H2O absorbs much more IR light than CO2. H2O is by far the only greenhouse gas of importance and CO2 minor greenhouse gas that can only cause a small amount of heating of the air if at all. This empirical data and calculations show that the claims by the IPCC and the unscrupulous collaborating scientists that CO2 causes global warming and is the control knob for climate change are fabrications and lies. The purpose of these lies is further the UN’s plan of distribution, via the UNFCCC and the UN COP, of the wealth of the rich countries to the poor countries to help the cope with alleged harmful effects of global warming and climate change. The poor countries came COP29 clamoring not billions but trillions of funds. They left the conference empty handed with no pledges of funds from the rich countries. After EPA Administer Lee Zeldin rescinds the 2009 Co2 Endangerment Finding, the greatest scientific fraud since the Piltdown Man will finally come to an end. Harold The Organic Chemist Says: ATTN: Ken RE: The Saturation of the Absorption of IR Light by CO2 in the Atmosphere. Shown in Fig. 7 (See below) is the infrared absorption of a sample of Philadelphia inner city air from 400 to 4000 wavenumbers (wns). There are additional peaks for H2O down to 200 wns but these are below the FT spectrometer cutoff of 400 wns In 1999 the concentration of CO2 at the MLO was 300 ppmv. The concentration of CO2 in the city air was not measured. The gas cell was a 7 cm Al cylinder with KBr windows. The active range of the greenhouse effect is from 400 to ca. 700 wns. The absorbance of the CO2 peak at 667 wns is 0.025. If the gas cell was 700 cm (23 ft), the absorbance would be 2.5 and 99+% of the IR light would be absorbed. This saturation distance for these conditions. Click on Fig. 7 and it will expanded and become clear. Then print it and the turn it upside down.

Kauffman (He was a chemist). The essay is 26 pages and can be down loaded for free. You should do some of your calculations for H2O for air 70° F and 70% RH. For this air the concentration of H2O is 17,780 ppmv. One cubic meter of this air has 14.3 g of H2O. In recent months, Blackstone reportedly sought regulatory approval to buy utilities in New Mexico and Texas all while a BlackRock-led group won approval Friday to purchase a major utility in Minnesota. While BlackRock and other huge asset managers have distanced themselves from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment practices in recent years, some energy experts and consumer advocates that spoke to the Daily Caller News Foundation are concerned that buying up utilities may represent a new frontier of financial giants orchestrating “climate mandates.” The Photovoltaic Heat Island Effect: Larger solar power plants increase local temperatures ﻿We found temperatures over a PV plant were regularly 3–4 °C warmer than wildlands at night https://www.nature.com/articles/srep35070 “…the world’s most viewed climate website” – Fred Pearce The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming “…invaluable” – Steven F.

Title: The Syntagma tent (finally…), Tsipras and the polls (a breath away from PASOK?), What was said at M.M. with Sklavenitis, the Alliance of Melina with Maria

Hello, today is a historic day for the Middle East with the ceasefire and the return of hostages to Gaza. Let us hope peace lasts forever in the region, even though the underlying problem remains unresolved. In any case, to be fair, the ceasefire is credited to Trump, and had it happened earlier, he might have been awarded the Nobel Prize. Now he may get it next year, if he manages to also end the war in Ukraine. It’s also good for the country that Greece will be represented—by the Prime Minister, of course—at today’s celebratory session for Gaza in Sharm El Sheikh, along with all the leaders of the broader neighborhood. Unknown Soldier Finally, after several months of delay and hesitancy, Mitsotakis himself announced yesterday that the government will put an end to the “tenting” of the Constitution by the “Indignants 2” group—a sad sight for the country and very bad for New Democracy voters, as well as for sensible people. I’m told that Dendias was not surprised when he read in K.M.’s Sunday note that the Ministry of National Defense is responsible for the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and therefore it must be kept clean, not turned into a chicken coop, as the “sprayed” protesters had done. He had been informed beforehand, and I think it goes without saying that maintaining order within the country is the police’s job. As for the cries of the Left (including, unfortunately, the mayor) that “fortunately the Army won’t take over the Monument,” I think no comment is needed. Soon they’ll claim that Mitsotakis is staging a coup to clean up the Constitution—which, by the way, is still full of tourists. Tsipras Since we’re talking about the Left, my source tells me that on Tsipras’s side, they are particularly optimistic about the communication outcome and the image of the first week after his departure from SYRIZA. They are counting, my source says, in focus groups and see that “people appreciated that Tsipras gave up the security of a parliamentary seat,” although a PASOK member maliciously observed that “he hasn’t given up the privileges of a former prime minister.” Bitterness? Maybe, but my source says that the trend in polls is that the great helmsman is heading for second place, “grabbing” 20–30% from PASOK, dismantling SYRIZA, and taking almost from all parties except New Democracy, which loses slightly—about one percentage point. I reiterate that this information comes from a Tsipras source, not a pollster. Sklavenitis Backstage Now, there’s an interesting backstage story about last week’s introductory meeting between Makis Sklavenitis and Mitsotakis at the Maximos Mansion, attended, among others, by Hatzidakis and Skertsos. The owner of the country’s largest supermarket chain was particularly upset about a fine imposed for profiteering and, until Friday, had been handing out flyers to customers explaining that his company considered the fine unfair; he stopped this a couple of days ago. I learned that very detailed explanations were given, and Sklavenitis apparently made a relatively positive impression on his interlocutors. It was made clear to him that fines are imposed by DIMEA (Market Control Authority), not the government, but they assured him that “they will review how and based on what criteria fines are imposed, within an institutional framework.” Needless to say, he was asked to help as much as possible with consumer prices. In any case, a misunderstanding was cleared up, and it was clarified officially that “no one in the government has commitments to other business interests.” Why this had to be stated is another story. Wedding with… Old Mitsotakis Loyalists You may have seen the news that K.M. was the best man at the wedding of his former close associate Elpidoforos Papanikolopoulos and Evina Giakoumatou last Friday at the Politeia Tennis Club. I’m told that the wedding was an opportunity to gather old Mitsotakis loyalists, since “Elpi” was a core member of K.M.’s team since 2004 and a staff member from the time he was in Chalkokondyli. Among others present from that era were Thanasis Nezis, Vasilis Spanakis, and Tasos Gaitanis, key figures for Mitsotakis, as well as former mayor of Chalandri Grigoris Zafeiropoulos. It’s worth noting that K.M. hadn’t been a best man for many years, since the wedding of his former associate Dimitris Fragkakis, who is now in the Attica Region. Office Blessings Begin With almost 18 months to go until the elections, many politicians are beginning to inaugurate offices. For example, Deputy Minister of Health Eirini Agapidaki is opening her political office in Peristeri today, as she will run in western Athens. She has already been active in the area. I’m told that by the end of November, the general secretaries of the government who wish to run for office will have resigned, leading to a minor reshuffle at their level. Do it like Greece Greece is vying to be the driving force in the field of the Union of Savings and Investments. Over the past six months, Pierrakakis has raised this issue very prominently, citing reports by Draghi and Leta, aiming to remove “hidden tariffs” within the EU that burden citizens and businesses. This was the subject of an article Pierrakakis published in the Economist last month, and at last week’s ECOFIN in Luxembourg, the Greek Finance Minister focused, among other things, on a specific aspect of this agenda: cross-border mergers and acquisitions. He spoke not philosophically, but with concrete examples from Greece in recent months: Euronext’s proposal to acquire the Athens Stock Exchange, Unicredit’s proposal to acquire more than 30% of Alpha Bank, and the Greece-Malta cooperation to acquire a stake in Malta’s HSBC Bank through Crediabank. The message Pierrakakis wants to convey is clear: Greece is open to partnerships that will strengthen each country’s “national champions.” PPC at a 16-year High and BlackRock Scenarios Turning to market news, PPC (Public Power Corporation) has soared to a 16-year high, with an Italian air of optimism, marking the first step toward climbing the “Olympus” of European utilities, as Mediobanca highlighted in its recent report, Climb to Olympus. The Italian investment bank initiated coverage of PPC with a target price of €19.2 and an “outperform” rating, placing it at the forefront of the energy transition in Southeast Europe, as it is the fastest-growing utility in the region. The report also emphasizes that “the current valuation of the company does not reflect the favorable business environment in which it operates.” Mediobanca’s vote of confidence did not go unnoticed by investors, with PPC rising from €14.2 when the report was published to €14.79, the highest closing price since November 2009. Some regular readers may recall that on September 18, 2025, a BlackRock delegation visited Athens, meeting various stakeholders and officially expressing interest in investing in PPC and Eleftherios Venizelos Airport. Recently, market rumors suggest that PPC plans a €1 billion capital increase, waiving old shareholders’ rights, to finance its business plans. In this capital increase—according to these scenarios—BlackRock could acquire a significant stake in PPC’s shareholding. ADMIE: Scenarios for Capital Increase ADMIE is searching for funding to implement its strategic projects for the modernization and development of the electricity system, totaling over €6 billion, with market sources reporting that multiple financing alternatives are being considered. While the noise around the cable with Cyprus shows no sign of dying down, it seems the Operator is methodically working on the next steps despite the… GSI thorn. The goal is to strengthen ADMIE’s capital to proceed with critical investments in the electricity network, such as new interconnections and infrastructure upgrades, which will define Greece’s role as a regional hub in Southeast Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean and enhance energy security and network stability. According to the same sources, discussions focus on the possibility of a share capital increase, either in ADMIE Holding—which is listed on the Athens Stock Exchange and holds 51% of ADMIE—or in ADMIE itself, which owns the regulated asset base. If the increase occurs in the listed Holding, the funds raised could be channeled to ADMIE to finance the investment projects. In such a scenario, a placement of shares to institutional investors is being considered, even potentially introducing a new investor into the shareholder structure, with specific names already circulating. Conversely, if the capital increase occurs in ADMIE itself, all shareholders—the Holding (51%), the Greek State via DES ADMIE (25%), and the Chinese State Grid (24%)—would need to participate proportionally to maintain their relative shares. Otherwise, ownership percentages could change, with the partial reduction of the Greek State’s stake still on the table. At the same time, the issuance of a corporate bond by ADMIE is another option being explored. This would provide additional liquidity without altering the shareholder structure but would increase the company’s debt. In any case, securing capital for ADMIE will determine the speed and scope of investments that will reshape the country’s energy map, making final decisions particularly important. The government envisions a “PPC model” for ADMIE: selling part of the shares to international investment portfolios to strengthen ADMIE’s equity. Since this requires strong Western investment portfolios, Kyriakos Pierrakakis’s meetings in the U.S. this week are highly significant. It’s worth noting that last Friday, 409,000 ADMIE shares were traded at prices ranging from €3.02 to €3.18, closing at €3.165 (+6.21%), marking the largest gain for 2025. Electricity Price At €158/MWh in today’s DAM, it’s clear that the government’s delay in regulating industrial electricity prices could turn into a disaster. Spikes in electricity prices highlight how exposed Greek industry is to these fluctuations; just a slight change in weather increased the price. While the Prime Minister promised in his recent speech at SEV to support Greek industry, it remains unclear where the regulatory solution is to resolve the sector’s biggest problem. EKPA Honors Governor Stournaras The University of Athens (EKPA) will host a particularly honorable event for Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras on October 21. University Rector G. Siasos will present the Governor with a commemorative volume titled “Studies in Honor of Professor Yannis Stournaras.” Besides the Rector, the Dean of the School of Economics and Political Science, Professor N. Hreiotis, will speak, while Professor E. Papapetrou will discuss the honoree’s broader work, and Professor G. Dotsis will present the volume. The event will conclude with remarks by Y. Stournaras titled “The International Economic Environment and the Challenges of the Greek Economy.” What’s Happening with EKTER The construction company has applied and is in the final stages of obtaining the highest contractor license, Class 7. This means it will gain access to a broader pool of projects, participating in tenders without restrictions on financial or technical capacity. With a backlog of €123 million and double-digit revenue growth, management aims to become the 5th major construction player in the market, focusing on infrastructure, PPPs, tourism, and real estate. These expectations are reflected in the stock, which surged over 6% on two consecutive days to €2.69, its highest level since September 2000. Costamare and the Greek Racing Driver Who Made History While dozens of professional Greek drivers have raced, none had achieved what Thomas Krasonas did. The 23-year-old became yesterday the first Greek to win a pan-European NASCAR championship, making history in Zolder, Belgium, and putting Greece on the professional racing podium for the first time. His path wasn’t easy: since 2009, he and his team had knocked on over 50 doors seeking sponsorship. That’s when the Costamare company, run by the Konstantakopoulos family, stepped in. “I told them that if they gave me the resources, I would win. It sounds crazy, but I believed it,” he recalls. They believed him—and thus Greece’s first NASCAR champion was born. From Athens garages to the European podium, Thomas proved that with the right ally, a dream can reach 260 km/h. The Collaboration of Melina Travlou and Maria Angelicoussis Despite recent rumors in the offices of Akti Miaouli and beyond about an “underlying rivalry” between Melina Travlou, President of the Union of Greek Shipowners (EEE), and Maria Angelicoussis, leader of a strong block of Greek and international shipping interests, events show the exact opposite. Angelicoussis co-signed, along with 15 other shipowners, a letter expressing serious reservations about the IMO’s new Net Zero Framework (NZF). The letter emphasizes that the plan ignores transitional fuels such as LNG, considered crucial for emission reduction and realistic green transition. Three days ago, Travlou confirmed in an interview with Lloyd’s List that “great minds think alike,” stating clearly that the IMO’s new framework unfairly treats transitional fuels like LNG, which are “safe, available, and directly reduce emissions.” She urged IMO member states to realistically revise the framework once implemented. The discussion at the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee Special Session will take place from October 14–17. The…Record It’s not every day that a company is incorporated and dissolved on the same day. But that happened last Friday, October 10, with MeliCordeli Monoprosopi S.A.. The company, based on Ermou Street, was founded for buying, selling, and managing real estate with an initial capital of €2,510,000, fully paid in cash by the sole shareholder, G.P., who was also appointed President and CEO of the three-member Board. The official incorporation was around noon. On the same day, at 15:20, the dissolution and liquidation were posted in GEMI, following the General Assembly of the sole shareholder. Why it was decided to close before even opening is a mystery—and certainly sets a record for the shortest-lived company. Perhaps the founder… changed his mind? Messages from the Jefferies Report (and GEK TERNA) The Jefferies report titled “Greed & Fear” contains several interesting observations. Analyst Christopher Wood argues that markets are very close to the end of the AI frenzy. He warns of an imminent correction in the AI mania, recommends shifting investments to real economies (Greece, China), and maintaining positions in gold as protection against dollar depreciation. An interesting point in the report is the recommendation to invest in infrastructure as a hedge against inflation spikes, which is why Jefferies has, for the first time, added GEK TERNA (as a construction leader in infrastructure) to its global portfolio. The “Air” Returns: The Silent Revolution in Commercial Leases Greece is the European market with the highest consumption taxes (VAT, excise, luxury taxes), yet consumption—helped by tourism flows that triple the number of potential consumers—seems invincible and indifferent to crises. Another proof is the return of the “air” in commercial leases. The practice of paying a significant sum to a previous tenant to vacate a desirable property is becoming common again on commercial streets in Athens and Thessaloniki. In central locations, the amounts of “air” exceed €50,000–100,000, while in premium locations they can reach €200,000. Property owners, brokers, and businesses form a transaction triangle operating outside official recording. Now that a large part of these transactions is being formalized and card/electronic payments dominate, one wonders whether this “investment” in the “air” will pay off. At the same time, “air” in leases creates entry barriers for new entrepreneurs without capital, while SMEs are pushed out of premium locations, and city centers are homogenized by chains and franchises. The Profitable Path from ENA to the Main Market of the ASE ONYX made its debut today on the Main Market of the Athens Stock Exchange. Its journey began in July 2023 when MED, the underwear company of Leonidas Zisiadis, started trading on the Alternative Market with a valuation of €10.2 million. Today, it is worth €172.3 million, with a spectacular shift from apparel to tourism. Similarly, Real Consulting started its stock market career on the Alternative Market in August 2021 at €1.02/share with a market capitalization of €22 million, and moved to the Main Market this September at €5.14/share and a capitalization of €112 million. Simple math shows that an investor who bought €10,000 of Real Consulting shares at IPO now has about €47,000 (before taxes and dividends). The Biggest Crash in Cryptocurrency History Last weekend could be considered historic and might mark the start of a new phase for the cryptocurrency market. In a few hours, 1.6 million crypto investors lost ground, while $19 billion in leveraged positions evaporated. It all started Friday morning (U.S. time) at 09:50. The nervous drop unfolded an hour before President Trump’s tweet at 10:57 warning China about new tariffs. Hours later, at 16:30, a very large portfolio opened massive short positions, anticipating a further crypto decline. Just 20 minutes later, Trump announced +100% tariffs on China. By 17:20—just 30 minutes after the announcement—liquidations of leveraged positions reached $19.5 billion. The large portfolio then closed its short positions, netting $192 million. Bitcoin’s market capitalization fluctuated by $380 billion, more than the combined value of the 25 largest business conglomerates in the world. Analysts online described this as a technical correction without long-term effects. High leverage, excessive optimism, and late Friday trading while Wall Street was closed were cited as possible causes of the “perfect storm.” However, questions remain about who knew of Trump’s announcement and how such massive short positions were opened shortly before the storm hit. After the Tariffs: No Cheap Stocks Many believe that the “big game” on Wall Street last Friday was deliberately aimed at steering retail investors away from tech frenzy toward more traditional sectors like finance. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo will report earnings tomorrow, followed by Bank of America and Morgan Stanley on Wednesday. On Friday, the Nasdaq fell -3.6%, its worst day since April 10, coinciding with the implementation of Trump’s new global tariffs. Friday’s sell-off erased a month’s gains. The S&P 500 fell -2.7%, and the Dow Jones lost 879 points (-1.9%). Suddenly, strategic analysts remind clients of October’s historically volatile stock performance. In Athens, the climate is different. The General Index has gained +43.58% year-to-date, FTSE 25 +49.56%, and Banks stand out with +91.62%. Even mid-to-small caps show gains of +23.11%. In simple terms, the Athens Stock Exchange today has no cheap stocks; there are companies with prospects and solid fundamentals claiming their share of the upgrade of the Greek market to developed market status and the expected upgrade of Greece’s credit rating by S&P, Scope, and Fitch within the next 45 days. All this is supported by increased trading activity—over €200 million—and a steady flow of mutual fund share purchases capable of absorbing the liquidations of short-term, fearful investors.

One thrives on history and stability; the other, on speculation and digital faith. The on-going rally in gold and Bitcoin—beside the 10 October sell-off—has been eye-popping. Yet, unlike equity and debt, which are staple portfolio assets with tangible fundamentals, gold and crypto are outliers. In equity stocks, investors back proven businesses with growth prospects. In bonds, the certainty lies in a committed coupon. Gold, on the other hand, acts as a ‘portfolio diversifier’. Historical data shows that even a 10% allocation to gold can improve a portfolio’s risk-adjusted (i.e., volatility-adjusted) returns. In short, gold helps optimize outcomes, not drive them. Gold vs. the digital tokenGold, as we know, doesn’t produce anything. Its industrial applications are limited, and demand largely stems from central banks and jewellery buyers. Cryptocurrencies, meanwhile, are still struggling for identity. Whether Bitcoin is truly an investment asset remains debatable. If it is a currency, well, it is accepted in some parts of the world, for goods and services, but on a private basis. It is not legal tender currency in any country, except a small country, El Salvador.

If I tell you that I will give you ₹100 and in exchange you have to give me ₹101, that may not sound like a lucrative deal. Yet investors continue to pay over $100,000 ( ₹1 crore) per Bitcoin, betting on future appreciation. In the US, big fund houses like BlackRock have launched Bitcoin ETFs (exchange traded funds), giving investors an easy entry point into the crypto market. Even though Bitcoin’s price is steep, fractional investing lets you own a small part of it. Remember, Bitcoin’s track record includes both stellar gains and steep falls—so invest only after gauging your risk tolerance. Both gold and Bitcoin today are benefiting from the same global undercurrent. The United States, long seen as the world’s safe haven, is witnessing waning confidence in its policies and currency. The trend of de-dollarization—accelerated by “Trump 2.0"—has led treasury desks worldwide to adopt the acronym ABUSA: Anything But USA. This sentiment is pushing investors towards alternatives such as gold and crypto. The key difference between the two lies in their fundamentals. Gold has stood the test of time, with a history that dates back to the BC era. Historical data shows that gold tends to deliver steady returns during equity market downturns. Its recent rally, however, is being driven largely by central banks diversifying away from US Treasuries. In earlier times, money printing by central banks in some countries was directly linked to gold. That link no longer exists, yet the fact that central banks continue to buy gold aggressively for their reserves underscores its enduring value and institutional support. Also Read | Is the fear of missing out driving your gold buying decisions? Crypto, by contrast, is a creation of the digital era—fuelled largely by private innovation and investor enthusiasm. Its rapid rise has been extraordinary, but that momentum also makes it highly volatile. It represents a cultural shift as much as a financial one, symbolizing the move from tangible to digital, from centralized to decentralized. Whether it can climb further is anyone’s guess. The risks are substantial—so much so that most Indian wealth managers still don’t consider crypto a legitimate investment asset. What should you do?It is prudent to maintain some exposure to gold in your portfolio for diversification. Since it is not a core asset, the allocation can be limited to around 10–15% of the total portfolio. While there are concerns about gold trading near all-time highs, it’s worth noting that most asset classes touch new peaks multiple times over their cycles. Crypto, on the other hand, remains a high-risk avenue despite the potential for outsized returns. For most investors, it’s best avoided. However, if you do wish to participate, restrict your exposure to a small portion—no more than 5–10% of your portfolio. Also Read | Can AI manage your stock portfolio?

Whether Bitcoin is truly an investment asset remains debatable. If it is a currency, well, it is accepted in some parts of the world, for goods and services, but on a private basis. It is not legal tender currency in any country, except a small country, El Salvador. While its adoption may grow, it remains a medium of exchange—one whose price movement depends purely on collective faith. If I tell you that I will give you ₹100 and in exchange you have to give me ₹101, that may not sound like a lucrative deal. Yet investors continue to pay over $100,000 ( ₹1 crore) per Bitcoin, betting on future appreciation. In the US, big fund houses like BlackRock have launched Bitcoin ETFs (exchange traded funds), giving investors an easy entry point into the crypto market. Even though Bitcoin’s price is steep, fractional investing lets you own a small part of it. Remember, Bitcoin’s track record includes both stellar gains and steep falls—so invest only after gauging your risk tolerance. Both gold and Bitcoin today are benefiting from the same global undercurrent. The United States, long seen as the world’s safe haven, is witnessing waning confidence in its policies and currency. The trend of de-dollarization—accelerated by “Trump 2.0"—has led treasury desks worldwide to adopt the acronym ABUSA: Anything But USA. This sentiment is pushing investors towards alternatives such as gold and crypto. The key difference between the two lies in their fundamentals. Gold has stood the test of time, with a history that dates back to the BC era. Historical data shows that gold tends to deliver steady returns during equity market downturns. Its recent rally, however, is being driven largely by central banks diversifying away from US Treasuries. In earlier times, money printing by central banks in some countries was directly linked to gold. That link no longer exists, yet the fact that central banks continue to buy gold aggressively for their reserves underscores its enduring value and institutional support. Crypto, by contrast, is a creation of the digital era—fuelled largely by private innovation and investor enthusiasm. Its rapid rise has been extraordinary, but that momentum also makes it highly volatile. It represents a cultural shift as much as a financial one, symbolizing the move from tangible to digital, from centralized to decentralized. Whether it can climb further is anyone’s guess. The risks are substantial—so much so that most Indian wealth managers still don’t consider crypto a legitimate investment asset. What should you do?It is prudent to maintain some exposure to gold in your portfolio for diversification. Since it is not a core asset, the allocation can be limited to around 10–15% of the total portfolio. While there are concerns about gold trading near all-time highs, it’s worth noting that most asset classes touch new peaks multiple times over their cycles. Crypto, on the other hand, remains a high-risk avenue despite the potential for outsized returns. For most investors, it’s best avoided. However, if you do wish to participate, restrict your exposure to a small portion—no more than 5–10% of your portfolio. Also Read | Can AI manage your stock portfolio?

Title: The similarities between today's market and Wall Street before 1929 crash

Watch CBS News Updated on: October 12, 2025 / 8:29 PM EDT / CBS News After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression. Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming. "I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep," he said. "But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash." Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of "1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History – and How It Shattered a Nation," out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s. Market highs today have him feeling anxious. "I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced," he said. The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker. Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped. "And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access," Sorkin said. "And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way." Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump threatened more China tariffs. "I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort," Sorkin said. "The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?" When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors. Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and "the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore." "That's what concerns me," Sorkin said. "It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off." Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public. In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier. "Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that," Sorkin said. "But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that." Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people. But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people. "They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich," Sorkin said. In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers. Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained. The new investment opportunity comes with risk. "But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight," Fink said. Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios. "The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions," he said. "There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold — that is, it's an alternative." He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio. But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink. "He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it," Sorkin said. The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day. "And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day," Sorkin said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Andrew Ross Sorkin sees worrying signs in market after months of ups

Watch CBS News October 12, 2025 / 7:30 PM EDT / CBS News Stocks took a nosedive on Friday after President Trump threatened a big tariff hike on China. Until then, Wall Street had been at record highs for months, which is why we decided to check in with Andrew Ross Sorkin, one of the country's most influential financial reporters. He's just written a book called "1929" about the market crash a century ago. We wondered if he'd run out of news to cover, or is he alerting us that what's been happening in the markets lately – is a replay of what led to the most devastating financial collapse in our history? Imagine the New York Stock Exchange back then: the crush of frightened traders dumping stocks, investors losing their shirts, businesses, their homes, sweeping away the Roaring '20s, walking that same but transformed floor today. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Everything's digital. Lesley Stahl: Well, yeah, OK. Andrew Ross Sorkin says we're in our own roaring '20s: the 2020s. with stocks climbing for months, just like then. Andrew Ross Sorkin: The crazy part about this is, from 1928 to September of 1929, the stock market was up 90%! Lesley Stahl: When you say the stock market was way up, immediately I think of now. Are you scared? Andrew Ross Sorkin: I'm anxious. I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology and all of that, or everything's overpriced. Lesley Stahl: Or we're reliving-- Andrew Ross Sorkin: 1929. Andrew Ross Sorkin: There was so much anxiety. Sorkin has covered the markets for two decades. He joined the New York Times after college, soon founding the DealBook newsletter covering finance. He also co-hosts "Squawk Box" on CNBC, runs the DealBook Summit, where he interviews the high and mighty, he co-created "Billions" the TV show, wrote a bestseller about the 2008 crash, and now, a book about 1929. Lesley Stahl: We're always being undone by bubbles. There was the internet bubble in 2000, the housing in 2008. Are we in another bubble? An AI bubble or something like that? Andrew Ross Sorkin: I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort. The question is always when is the bubble going to pop? Lesley Stahl: One symptom of a bubble is when the market goes up and up, but the underlying economy – the real economy - goes soft. And that appears to be happening right now. Andrew Ross Sorkin: I would argue to you that the economy is being propped up, almost artificially, by the artificial intelligence boom. There are hundreds of billions of dollars that are being invested today in artificial intelligence. This is either a gold rush or a sugar rush and we probably won't know for a couple of years which one it is. 1929 was a sugar rush caused by speculation and debt. People who didn't really have much money were lured by Wall Street bankers to invest using a newfangled concept to take on debt, called credit. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your broker. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Prior to 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt at all. It was a sin. It was a moral sin to use credit– Lesley Stahl: Oh, really? Andrew Ross Sorkin: --to buy anything. And it was really General Motors that basically came up with the idea that we're gonna lend you money so you can afford to buy our cars. Lesley Stahl: Brilliant. Andrew Ross Sorkin: And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access. And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way. Since then, laws, regulations, and agencies have been put in place to protect investors - especially the less affluent - from being exploited. Lesley Stahl: We put up barriers after 1929. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Protections. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. Lesley Stahl: So those are coming down. They're tumbling down one -- the SEC rules aren't as stringent anymore. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Yes. The Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore. Lesley Stahl: Correct. Andrew Ross Sorkin: That's what concerns me. It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off. Including guardrails that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public. Andrew Ross Sorkin: So over the last 20 or 30 years, folks who had access to, who could invest in private equity, in venture capital, clearly outperformed folks who didn't. And so– Lesley Stahl: That's how you really made money. But you have to remember that these kind of assets are gambles. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that. But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that. Lesley Stahl: Wow. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Isn't this something? Lesley Stahl: This is spectacular. Sorkin took us to the Fifth Avenue mansion of one of the big bankers back then, who pushed democratization. Lesley Stahl: If this idea of bringing a regular guy into buying stock, if that was a big problem back in 1929 why are we going there again? Doesn't it defy some kind of logic? Andrew Ross Sorkin: There is a view that it's been only the elites that have had access to these investments, Facebook before it ever went public, Uber before it went public. So there is this idea that it's unfair, actually, to the ordinary investor because we haven't allowed them to get access to some of these investment opportunities early. And there is a real push, partially by the Trump administration, partially by the industry itself, which wants to– Lesley Stahl: Get more money. Andrew Ross Sorkin: Get more money in-- to open up the market to more and more people. Lesley Stahl: So we have these guardrails for a reason. I mean, they're there to protect, and they have protected. Andrew Ross Sorkin: They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich. Larry Fink: Many people don't believe in capitalism anymore. And I think a lot of it is because they were not a part of the growth of the economy. We went to Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, the world's biggest money manager, handling $12.5 trillion in assets, like pension funds. His annual letter to investors is a kind of industry roadmap. This latest one he suggested opening our retirement 401(k)s – bastions of caution – to riskier private investments in the name of, wait for it: democratizing investing. Larry Fink: As I wrote, there are many great opportunities to be investing in the s- in startup companies, to invest in AI or data centers. Right now, we're precluded to put those type of assets in many retirement products. And the Trump administration has now said we're going to allow in our 401(k) products the opportunity to invest in these private markets. Lesley Stahl: But, they are risky. Aren't they? Larry Fink: Yes. But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight. Lesley Stahl: But we're talking about 401(k)s. Larry Fink: Yes. Lesley Stahl: Investing out of retirement accounts. Larry Fink: Yes. Lesley Stahl: You're risking the nest egg or part of the-- a little part of the nest egg. Larry Fink: But what the markets will teach you over the last 100 years, even at the worst moments, if you have the ability to persevere and you have a long-term horizon, you're going to do fine. And a diversified portfolio is essential. We're not suggesting, you know, one shoe fits all. We are suggesting the opportunity to have that ability to invest in these private market investments. He also believes we should be investing in crypto. Lesley Stahl: It wasn't that long ago that the big bankers, Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink, were saying that crypto was stupid and a fraud. Larry Fink: I did say Bitcoin, because we were talking about Bitcoin then, was the domain of money launderers and thieves. But you know, the markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions. There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold, that is it's an alternative. For those looking to diversify this is not a bad asset, but I don't believe that it should be a large component of your portfolio. But Sorkin says some crypto can be abused in ways similar to 1929. Take meme coins: cryptocurrencies that can be manipulated by speculators who pumped them up, then let them crash. Andrew Ross Sorkin: There are a number of examples where it felt like there was an inside group of people who were colluding to pump up some of these cryptocurrencies, and other things. I'll give you a bizarre story of my own. I was on television with Larry Fink, and he makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it. Lesley Stahl: Are you serious? Andrew Ross Sorkin: Go up, and up, and up, and up, and up. The sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day. Andrew Ross Sorkin: And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day, so… Lesley Stahl: [makes spiral noise] Sorkin is trusted by the world's top business leaders, who talk to him often exclusively. Lesley Stahl: What role do you think these business leaders should be playing now? Andrew Ross Sorkin: My own view is that most CEOs in America today are very scared to speak out publicly about anything. They are so worried that they are going to be potentially attacked by the administration, or regulated. They're gonna have a merger in front of some agency that's not gonna be allowed to go through. They are so nervous about criticizing anything that's going on with this administration. Lesley Stahl: There are some economists who suggest that because Mr. Trump ties his success to the success of the market, that he's not gonna let anything like what happened in 1929 happen. And that we should feel secure because of that. Andrew Ross Sorkin: I think it's hard to know how things get out of control. When confidence disappears, it happens like this. [SNAP] Lesley Stahl: So, you spent nearly 10 years on this book. The inevitable question is: do you think that we will have a crash or not? Andrew Ross Sorkin: The answer is we will have a crash; I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep. But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash. Produced by Shachar Bar-On. Associate producer, Jinsol Jung. Broadcast associate, Aria Een.

Title: The Digital Asset Treasury Playbook: How to Print, Buy and Compound to ‘Alchemise’ mNAV into a Market Engine
URL: https://www.dlnews.com/articles/llama-u/crypto-digital-asset-treasury-mnav-strategy/
Time Published: 2025-10-12T20:21:00Z

About us Copy link Just a couple months ago, digital asset treasuries were crypto’s hottest trade. Spurred by soaring valuations, hundreds of companies raced to accumulate Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. The mania has cooled in recent weeks. Companies that saw their stock soar after announcing multimillion-dollar crypto purchases are now trading at a discount relative to that crypto. Still, some are holding strong, with their mNAV — short for market-cap-to-net-asset-value multiple — comfortably in the black. How do the do it? In the LlamaU article below, pseudonymous DefiLlama analyst Meta explains the drivers of mNAV premiums, as well as examples where the logic behind those premiums “breaks.” (Read Meta’s previous article: What is mNAV? How to calculate and trade it? Your DefiLlama guide to the metric for digital asset treasuries) DATs are no longer just holding crypto — they’re leveraged to actively expand their own holdings and valuations. They aren’t just ‘hodl’ing tokens; it has become a competitive game of accumulation. DATs are trading their own market caps against themselves, turning investor sentiment into capital and capital into narrative fuel. This new species of equity, known as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), sits at the intersection of corporate finance and crypto reflexivity. Their fundamentals are blockchain-based, their premiums narrative-driven, and their strategies systematic: print, buy, compound, repeat. What began as an experiment with MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation model has evolved into a broader movement spanning Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. Today, SBET, BMNR, and others have creatively applied the same reflexive mechanics to staking yield, token diversification, and capital recycling; transforming what used to be static balance sheets into market engines. mNAV = Fully Diluted Market Cap ÷ Treasury Value (USD) 1.0x → equity equals treasury value (fair) > 1.0x → investors pay a premium for leverage, yield, or access < 1.0x → the stock trades at a discount to its underlying crypto If you’re new to mNAV or want a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s calculated, “HYPE DAT Ecosystem: A Clean Case Study for mNAV” is where you want to start. A premium can be narrative-driven, structural, engineered, or yield-supported. When these align, mNAV becomes less a ratio and more a reaction: a positive feedback loop between equity and treasury that refines sentiment into capital. MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model; they codified, refined, and evolved their procedure making them the gold standard. Below is the company’s official equity guidance slide from Exhibit 99.1 (August 2025): MSTR Equity Guidance screenshot MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model. Its strategy slide divides valuation into mNAV zones, each dictating a different capital playbook: - Active: issue equity aggressively to buy more Bitcoin - Opportunistic: issue selectively during favorable sentiment - Tactical: issue sparingly for debt or liquidity needs - Defensive: may use credit to repurchase stock Active issuance expands Bitcoin holdings through ATMs (At-the-Market equity offering, where companies sell newly issued shares directly on to the open market), convertibles, and secondary offerings. Opportunistic issuance occurs briefly, often above 3x mNAV, allowing controlled compounding with minimal dilution. Tactical issuance covers debt or dividends without selling BTC. Defensive stance slows issuance or uses credit to repurchase shares, supporting the stock’s floor and resetting the flywheel. This structure turns capital markets into a feedback engine. When mNAV rises, MicroStrategy issues to buy BTC. When it falls, issuance tightens or reverses through buybacks. Dilution becomes reflexive compounding. The simplest catalyst for premiums or discounts is positioning versus entry cost. When a DAT’s treasury sits above its average purchase price, the market usually assigns a premium (>1x mNAV). Below cost, the market discounts it. Across the DeFiLlama Digital Asset Treasuries dashboard, profitable treasuries consistently trade higher while underwater ones remain cheap. Examples include: - MSTR (MicroStrategy) — BTC Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV ~1.5x) - KIDZ (Classover) — SOL Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV 2.1x–3.5x) - UPXI (Upexi) — SOL Treasury, Max FD lens → mNAV ~1.5x - MARA (Marathon Digital) — BTC + Infrastructure Premium (1.2x–1.7x) - NAKA (Nakamoto Holdings) — High BTC Entry → Discount (0.5x–0.8x) - BTBT (Bit Digital) — ETH Treasury w/ Yield → Premium (>1x) Premiums also form along jurisdictional and regulatory lines — where access or taxation changes valuation dynamics. Metaplanet Inc. (OTC: MTPLF, TSE: 3350.T) is Japan’s flagship Bitcoin treasury and one of the clearest cases of jurisdictional alchemy. Under Japan’s tax code, corporations must mark crypto holdings to market annually and pay tax on unrealized gains. In contrast, capital gains on listed shares are taxed separately at an effective 20.315% (Japan National Tax Agency). This makes Metaplanet (MTPLF) a tax-deferred Bitcoin proxy, letting investors gain BTC exposure through equity. By holding Bitcoin through equity rather than directly, Metaplanet turns that asymmetry into a structural advantage, maintaining a 1.8x–2.0x mNAV with it at its peak having maintained >8x mNAV for weeks on end. A textbook case of tax alchemy: turning friction into premium. DATs in regulated markets can tap capital barred from direct token exposure. MicroStrategy succeeded because it epitomized this: a compliant, levered Bitcoin wrapper for institutions. Formerly CEA Industries, BNB Network Co. (BNC) is one of the few public DATs with direct BNB exposure. With no BNB ETF or trust in the U.S., it serves as a listed proxy for Binance’s ecosystem; similar to how MSTR fulfilled the role early on as the only institutional onramp for BTC exposure. It trades near 1.87x mNAV. Given that it is publicly endorsed and heavily invested into BNB DAT by the venture capital entity YZI Labs, formerly Binance Labs, which is officially funded and partnered with Binance itself. Until a formal BNB ETF exists, that scarcity alone supports the premium. Together, Metaplanet and BNB Network Co. show the geography of premium. Where Metaplanet turns Japan’s crypto tax disadvantage into equity advantage, BNC leverages America’s regulatory bottleneck on BNB exposure. Both convert policy friction into scarcity. Metaplanet provides the purest example of geopolitical arbitrage in the DAT playbook. SBET and BMNR pioneered ETH-based treasuries that generate yield natively. By staking directly on Ethereum, both earn validator-level returns (~3–5% APY) that continuously expand NAV. That yield compounds through feedback: staking generates rewards, NAV expands, the market reprices equity upward, and higher valuations reinforce the premium. The difference lies in the ingredients: mindshare, leadership, and visibility. SBET, with Joseph Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum, and Joseph Chalom, former Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, has top tier pedigree however BMNR’s Tom Lee has a very public presence with his appearances on CNBC. This ends up likening Tom Lee to MSTR’s legendary Saylor whose loud, consistent, charismatic bullishness were undeniable variables in the success of establishing MicroStrategy as a household name. BMNR paralleled this best for the Ethereum DATS by staying on top via a combination of buybacks, retail engagement, and visible leadership. BTCS also earns ETH staking yield but trades below parity lending proof that yield alone can’t ignite the flywheel without narrative and conviction. Ultimately, yield is the base metal, and narrative, leadership, and timing are the reagents that determine whether it compounds or burns off. Some DATs diversify through moonshot allocations: small, high-beta bets meant to amplify upside or hedge decay. GameSquare (mNAV = ~1.11x) holds ETH, a CryptoPunk, and ANIME token positions. It trades slightly above parity, a modest premium for narrative diversification. BMNR allocated $20M into ORBS (formerly OCTO), a Worldcoin (WLD) DAT, at $1.46/share. By October 2025, ORBS traded above $10, a 6x gain. Clearly, these moonshots can convert asymmetric exposure into subtle mNAV leverage through optionality. Not all DATs follow the “profit = premium” or “association = value” logic. TRON (Ticker: TRON) – Despite profitable reserves and close ties to the TRON blockchain, the stock trades at a steep discount. TRON, which is the only TRX DAT treasury, trades at a 0.53x max fully diluted mNAV, Despite TRX hosting ~$77.5B in stablecoins, composed of ~98% USDT (DeFiLlama), and dominating transfers across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in the West, it’s viewed as a transactional rail, not an investable asset, keeping its mNAV deeply discounted. Contrast this with BNB Network Co. (BNC). BNB’s exchange linkage and predictable revenue burns make it behave like equity. Binance uses a share of revenue to buy and burn BNB: a deliberate, showy, aggressive mechanism versus TRX’s passive gas burns. Traditional finance investors quickly recognize the pattern as an equity-like feedback loop, sustaining BNC’s 1.87x mNAV whereas TRX’s gas burning blockchain hasn’t attracted attention to TRON treasury keeping it below parity. Simply put: BNB’s burn program mirrors corporate buybacks, while TRX’s gas burns are passive and minor in comparison. BNC maintains premium; TRON does not. In numerical terms, the contrast between the two when examining max mNAV is astronomical: a difference of over 300%! BTCS, one of the first ETH staking firms, trades around 0.88x mNAV. SBET and BMNR captured attention with clear messaging and buybacks; BTCS remained quieter, focused on infrastructure over narrative. It delivers on-chain results but lacks social reflexivity; proof that legitimacy without visibility still prices like a discount. These cases show DAT premiums are behavioral, not mechanical. Narrative clarity, investor access, and perceived intentionality decide whether association becomes valuation. TRX dominates usage but not mindshare translating to a discount for TRON; BNB’s engineered burn loop mirrors equity translating to a premium for BNC as if accounting for revenue generation; and BTCS shows substance alone isn’t enough. In this market, numbers matter but narratives are the driver for positive multiples. In the DAT ecosystem, premiums aren’t random; they’re engineered. Every successful treasury blends fundamentals, narrative, and structure into a reflexive loop: fundamentals anchor value, narrative amplifies it, and capital strategy turns that feedback into growth. MicroStrategy utilizes financial wizardry to convert sentiment into Bitcoin. Metaplanet and BNC alchemize geography into premium through geopolitical arbitrage. BMNR, SBET, and GAME merge yield and narrative momentum. TRON and BTCS remind us that usage without story rarely sustains a premium. In this financial alchemy, fundamentals are the lead, narrative is the spark, and regulation is the catalyst that determines how brightly it burns.

Title: DATCOs Must Pivot To Active Diversified Strategies To Survive

ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DATCOs) have grown significantly, with total DATCO assets reaching $135 billion by the end of September 2025, according to VanEck. Most DATCOs follow a passive strategy of accumulating digital assets in their treasuries, with investors gaining from the underlying asset price appreciation. Such a unidirectional model of raising equity, buying crypto and repeating the process, is susceptible to market sentiment and volatile macroeconomic conditions. Last week’s crypto flash in reaction the U.S. President’s threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports is a painful indication of how sentiment can impact crypto markets. The crypto market sold off $19 billion, $7 billion in just one hour, bitcoin was 8% down on the day. It took eight years for bitcoin to hit $20,000 for the first time, which is the value it fell on Friday. Many “blue chip coins" are down 20% or greater, it is a crypto market rout. Blackrock issued a serious warning to its EFT clients noting it is constrained to market opening hours while BTC would be trading through the weekend. Bitcoin found support at $110,000 over the weekend and was climing to $115,000 on Sunday. When digital asset prices crash, equity premiums fall, and liquidity becomes constrained, DATCOs may face solvency issues, exposing the structural weaknesses of passive models. To survive market downturns and periods of choppy volatility, it is time for DATCOs to examine adopting more diversified active strategies. Adopting hybrid treasury models, combining cash-flowing and revenue-generating businesses, allocating to a diversified portfolio to generate yield through staking, and deploying further capital-efficient asset accumulation strategies are at the top of the list. Strategy (formerly Microstrategy) pioneered the DATCO model when it first added bitcoin to its balance sheet in 2020, currently holding 53% in digital assets. Over 200 companies now hold digital assets on their balance sheets. Over 90% of the public companies with BTC treasury holdings are in the U.S. New companies are emerging in Asia and Europe are also acquiring digital assets in their treasuries. WebX International Holdings Company Limited (HK. 8521), a diversified international holdings company listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, executed its first BTC acquisition in late September. Companies like WebX fund BTC purchases through their internal resources and other fundraising rounds with bitcoin veterans, Wall Street institutions, and strategic investors. Abraham Gomez, investor in WebX said, “As the world’s first Bitcoin Accumulation Company (BAC), WebX is strategically adding Bitcoin as its core reserve asset. Our mission is simple — to continually grow bitcoin per share for our investors by developing innovative, Bitcoin-backed financial products and services.” DATCOs that follow a simple accumulation-driven growth model have to depend on a consistent equity premium to NAV. If the premium collapses or flips to a discount, the model breaks. For example, BitMine Immersion (BNMR), the largest Ethereum DATCO, is selling a package worth $104.61 for $70, under pricing volatility by selling warrants at a steep discount. BitMine has already received board approval to repurchase up to $1 billion worth of its shares if the management deems fit. Companies can indeed buy back stock to arbitrage the discount, using their digital asset or cash reserves. But if DATCOs depend on redemptions and buybacks, it could lead to a collapse of their growth model and expose further weakness. Any slowdown in the DATCO trading model would exert downward pressure on digital asset prices. Just like inflows from DATCOs have driven up BTC prices, outflows due to redemptions could have the opposite effect or at least halt fresh accumulation. James O’Neill, an investment banker and senior advisor to DATCOs says, "We’ve seen this movie before in the 1920s during the investment trust boom. Initially, trusts traded at premiums to NAV, issued fresh shares, and used the capital to buy more assets. When the market sentiment dipped, it accelerated the downside as collapsing premiums cut off capital accessibility and magnified losses on depreciating assets. "Similarly, if DATCOs simply accumulate digital assets, any unwinding of their business would hurt the public equity markets’ exposure to digital assets. This will slow down inflows into crypto ETFs and consequently bring down crypto prices. “To avoid such heavy dependency on market conditions and investor sentiment, DATCOs must adopt an active strategy for sustainable growth.” DATCOs that simply accumulate digital assets and create a passive fund run the risk of exposing their investors to the “animal spririts” in the market. DATCOs that leverage their treasuries and actively deploy them in the crypto markets have a better safety net for investors. Active DATCOs don’t simply hold assets in their treasuries. Some of them run critical infrastructure for the decentralized economy and directly participate in revenue-generating business operations. BTCS S.A. (ticker: BTF) is one of the largest European DATCOs that depends on an “Active Treasury” model. BTCS CEO Marlena Lipinska said, “We’ve blended bitcoin acquisition with emerging ecosystems like ZIGChain and CoreDAO. But we’re different from other DATCOs since we follow an operational revenue stream by running validator nodes, securing networks, validating transactions, and receiving rewards in exchange for our work. At BTCS, we also stake our treasury to generate extra yield, thereby making our assets work for our shareholders.” Such an active, operations-driven approach offers financial leverage over simple digital asset acquisition and price tracking. When a company’s revenue stream is not entirely dependent on speculative trading, it helps the company survive periods of market volatility when ETF value may crash. Active Treasuries have the potential to become the new benchmark for DATCOs. Such an active model combines the familiarity of a known public investment vehicle with the productivity of yield-generating strategies. Rather than putting a “passive concentration” on digital assets price growth, structured and compliant instruments for compounding returns are a diversification. Diversification is also a critical part of active treasury management. Currently, DATCOs hold 5% of the total bitcoin supply with over 1 million BTC in their treasuries. While BTC is an important asset to anchor the treasury, provide liquidity, and offer institutional recognition, emerging and alternative assets are better equipped to earn yields. A balanced portfolio offers bitcoin’s stability without compromising on assets natively built for DeFi, positioning DATCOs as active growth vehicles. Passive DATCO shareholders earn solely from the price appreciation of underlying assets, whereas active DATCOs have the additional benefit of earning from yields. With strong compounding returns over time, Active Treasury models transform DATCOs into productivity engines, leading to higher market valuations, better ROIs, robust balance sheets, stronger durability during uncertainties, and more investor confidence. While Strategy has demonstrated how publicly traded companies can hold digital assets like bitcoin at scale, companies with Active Treasury models take it a step forward from holding to compounding. A diversified, multi-asset balance sheet, with a yield-generating treasury and ownership of or partnerships with digital infrastructure firms will help to better ensure DATCOs don’t remain a narrative fad for this bull cycle. DATCOs leveraging the Active Treasury model will show how crypto markets can sustain beyond speculative cycles to generate steady, compounding returns in the long run. Let’s see if last week’s crypto flash crash sees an acceleration of DATCO active diversification strategies.

Title: How Vercel Hit $9.3B and Replit Hit $3B… After a Decade. The Long Paths to AI “Overnight Success”

Full Content:
by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai How two of the top next-generation developer platforms spent years building the foundation for their AI breakout moments—and what that tells us about “sudden” success in the age of AI The headlines make it sound simple: Vercel raised $300M Series F at a $9.3B valuation in September 2025 (co-led by Accel and GIC, with participation from BlackRock, StepStone, and Khosla Ventures), with revenue doubling and users skyrocketing after launching v0, their AI-powered development agent. Replit went from $2.8M to $150M in annualized revenue in less than a year after releasing Replit Agent, securing a $250M Series D at $3B valuation (led by Prysm Capital, with Amex Ventures and Google’s AI Futures Fund joining as strategic investors). These are the kind of hockey-stick growth stories that make VCs salivate and founders feel inadequate. But here’s what the breathless press releases don’t tell you: both companies spent nearly a decade preparing for this “overnight” success. Guillermo Rauch founded Vercel (originally ZEIT) in 2015 with a vision to make web deployment as simple as typing “now” in the command line. But the path wasn’t smooth: Fast forward to 2025: Vercel hit approximately $200M ARR by mid-year. Their AI SDK gets 3 million downloads per week. v0 has reached 3.5 million users, with Teams and Enterprise accounts representing over 50% of v0 revenue. The company doubled its user base and increased revenue 82% year-over-year. The result: September 2025 Series F — $300M at $9.3B valuation (co-led by Accel and GIC), nearly tripling from their $3.25B valuation just 15 months earlier. Amjad Masad’s story is even more striking. He started building repl.it as an open-source side project in 2011 while working at Yahoo in Jordan, frustrated by the pain of setting up development environments in internet cafes. What happened next? Revenue exploded to $70M ARR by April 2025, then $100M by June 2025, and $150M by September 2025. The company grew from 22.5 million developers to 40 million users. They now have $350M in the bank despite barely touching their previous funding. The result: September 2025 Series D — $250M at $3B valuation (led by Prysm Capital), nearly tripling from their $1.16B valuation in 2023. Here’s what makes these stories instructive for SaaS founders: neither company built their AI products in a vacuum. They spent years building the infrastructure that made their AI products possible. Vercel’s Foundation: Replit’s Foundation: When the breakthrough AI models arrived in 2024 (particularly Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4), both companies were positioned to move fast because they already had: Both CEOs will tell you timing was everything—but it was preparedness meeting opportunity. Masad was explicit about this: “We started Replit officially in 2016 because this thing just wouldn’t die and kind of exploded itself into the world.” He had been thinking about democratizing programming since he was learning to code in internet cafes in Jordan as a teenager. Rauch had been obsessed with developer experience since creating Socket.IO and building JavaScript infrastructure at his previous companies. The vision for Vercel existed years before the technology to fully realize it. The AI breakthrough didn’t create their success—it unlocked the value of infrastructure they’d been building for a decade. Both companies face existential questions about moats: For Vercel: For Replit: 1. The “overnight success” narrative can be dangerous Both companies spent the better part of a decade building before their breakout year. Vercel grew from $1M to $200M over six years before AI accelerated growth. Replit stayed at $2.8M for 3-4 years before exploding to $150M. If you’re building infrastructure or developer tools, patience isn’t optional—it’s the price of admission. 2. Open source as distribution Next.js and repl.it (the open source project) were both free, open-source projects that built massive communities before commercialization. Vercel’s Next.js is downloaded 200 million times per week. Replit had millions of users before they figured out monetization. The open source community became their sales force when the AI moment arrived. 3. Capital efficiency matters—until it doesn’t Replit raised $100M in 2023 and hadn’t touched it by their 2025 raise. Masad jokes he needs to learn to be “less frugal” after growing up watching his refugee father struggle. But that frugality meant they had runway when they needed to cut staff and refocus. Once product-market fit hit, both companies raised massive rounds at eye-watering valuations. The market pays premiums for proven execution. 4. Platform plays take time Both companies are platforms, not point solutions. Vercel isn’t just a deployment tool—it’s infrastructure, framework, AI SDK, and developer experience. Replit isn’t just an IDE—it’s coding environment, deployment, database, and AI agent. Building platforms requires more upfront investment and takes longer to see returns, but the moats are deeper when you succeed. 5. The AI moment requires existing distribution Neither company could have achieved this growth starting from zero in 2024. The AI tools are table stakes—everyone has access to Claude, GPT-4, and other models. The difference is: Your AI feature is only as good as your ability to get it in front of users. Both companies now face the classic scale-up challenges: Leadership builds: Product expansion: Market positioning: The most important lesson from Vercel and Replit isn’t about AI—it’s about infrastructure. Rauch spent a decade making deployment simple. Masad spent 13 years making coding accessible. When the AI models got good enough, their infrastructure was ready to support a new paradigm of software creation. The “overnight” success happened because they built the rails before the train arrived. For SaaS founders watching the AI wave and wondering how to ride it: you probably can’t build the Vercel or Replit of your category in the next six months. But you can start building the infrastructure today that will let you capitalize when the next breakthrough moment arrives in your space. The companies that win the AI era won’t be the ones that slap ChatGPT onto their existing product. They’ll be the ones who spent years building the foundation that makes AI-powered experiences possible. Vercel and Replit are “overnight” successes the same way that Amazon was an “overnight” success after spending years building fulfillment centers, or Netflix was an “overnight” success after spending years building streaming infrastructure. The timing was perfect. But only because they’d been preparing for a decade. Vercel: 10 years from founding to $9.3B valuation. $200M ARR growing 80%+ annually. Built on the back of Next.js adoption and years of developer experience optimization. Replit: 13 years from first code to $3B valuation. $150M ARR after hovering at $2.8M for years. Built on the back of browser-based development environments and a massive user community. Both companies are now racing to build the future of software development. But they’re only in this race because they spent years building the track first. That’s not an overnight success story. That’s a masterclass in patience, persistence, and preparation meeting opportunity.

Title: Bitmine acquires 128,718 ETH after the crash as institutions buy the dip

Bitmine accumulated 128,718 ETH ($480 million) after the crypto market crash, leveraging their holdings for staking and liquidity yields. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. October’s historic crypto market crash forced a reckoning across leveraged trading, sent prices tumbling, and set the stage for audacious institutional dip-buying. Among the biggest actors was Tom Lee’s Bitmine Immersion Technologies. The behemoth Ethereum treasury company rapidly expanded its already massive ETH coffers by acquiring 128,718 more ETH (worth about $480 million) immediately after the sharp sell-off.​ According to real-time data shared by on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, Bitmine moved quickly in the wake of the plunge. It withdrew over 128,000 ETH from major exchanges FalconX and Kraken using six newly activated wallets likely tied to Bitmine. These transfers were corroborated by blockchain explorers and were part of a pattern of large withdrawals and positioning by institutional whale accounts through the crash window.​ Bitmine is led by Fundstrat Capital CIO Tom Lee and had previously accumulated over 2.83 million ETH. With the latest haul, their holdings jumped to roughly 2.96 million ETH, nearly 2.5% of the entire Ethereum supply; by far the largest ETH treasury of any public company, second only to MicroStrategy in crypto overall.​ The buying spree unfolded just after President Trump’s surprise 100% tariff announcement on Chinese software imports, alongside strict controls on U.S. rare earth mineral exports. The announcement triggered a cascade: Bitcoin dropped as much as 13%, Ethereum collapsed by 20% and the overall derivatives market wiped out more than $20 billion in open interest in hours. Altcoins suffered steep declines, making deep liquidity pockets and confident buyers rare, except for Bitmine, which reloaded during the chaos.​ Transaction logs show Bitmine’s purchases clustered around the crash, with ETH bought at levels as low as $3,728. The acquisition coincided with active positions from institutional whales and some OTC players, with Lookonchain reporting additional multimillion-dollar accumulations at market lows.​ There was also a flurry of speculation online about BlackRock timing the market crash and scooping up 45,000 BTC. However, these claims are not supported by public data. Bitmine’s continued accumulation despite posting floating unrealized losses of over $2 billion due to price declines shows institutional conviction in both Ethereum’s long-term value and network fundamentals. As KOL and investor Ted Pillows commented: “Institutions are not scared to buy Ethereum.” Their treasury strategy is built for scale. Bitmine remains committed to aggressive “buy-the-dip” maneuvers through moments of heightened volatility.​ Recent buys also facilitate staking, with Bitmine using validator nodes and liquidity protocols to earn annual yields on top of price exposure.​ As leveraged sellers were washed out, Bitmine and similar buyers repositioned for long-term gains, potentially supporting price stability as lower volatility returns post-crash.

Title: 5 High Yield CEFs With Steep Discounts Right Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/12/5-high-yield-cefs-with-steep-discounts-right-now/
Time Published: 2025-10-12T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Closed-end funds (CEFs) are the last bargains left on the board. CEFs are often confused with mutual funds and ETFs, but they are different because they often trade at discounts to their net asset values (NAVs). For contrarians like us looking for deals, this is key. CEF trading is relatively thin. This created inefficiencies, such as select CEFs trading for as cheap as 95 or even 90 cents on the dollar. Plus, some of them dish big dividends—like these five. Let’s start with the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (EVT)—a CEF that buys not just common stocks, but also preferred stocks, that distribute qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates; non-qualified dividends, like those paid by most real estate investment trusts (REITs), face less favorable short-term capital gains rates. EVT’s four managers currently hold an 80/20 blend of common and preferred stocks, with the traditional equity “sleeve” made up of about 80 predominantly large-cap stocks. Names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and NextEra Energy (NEE) would be right at home in a bog-standard dividend fund. But while that fund would likely pay 2% or so, EVT delivers 4x that number, at 8% currently. (And it’s a monthly dividend payer, no less.) Part of that high yield we can chalk up to leverage—management borrows additional funds to invest even more money in their picks, which amplifies yields and gains if we’re fortunate, and amplifies losses if we’re not. Leverage currently sits at about 20% of assets. But the other part of it is the nature of those distributions. When Eaton Vance’s fund sends out a monthly distribution, dividend income is only a (small) portion of that. The rest is capital gains, usually of the long-term variety. It’s a “managed” distribution, too—the typical dividend fund’s income will vary from one period to the next, but EVT’s monthly payout hasn’t changed since April 2024, when the CEF raised its distribution by about 11%. The strategy doesn’t give us much of an edge over basic dividend funds, however—at least not longer-term. Right now, valuation is on EVT’s side, as the fund trades at a roughly 8% discount to NAV that’s wider than its longer-term 5% average. Options strategies are popular in CEFLand. Sometimes they’re complementary to the primary strategy, but sometimes they’re the whole point. The latter is the case with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities (ETV). It holds a portfolio of 150, mostly large-cap stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), then sells covered calls on a few major market indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to generate income, which it distributes to its shareholders monthly. Funds that sell covered calls—especially those where the strategy revolves around it—are designed to limit downside and provide income. On that front, actively managed covered-call strategies like ETV are better than comparable plain-vanilla index ETFs. Better still? We can sometimes buy that protection on the cheap; while ETV tends to trade on par with its NAV, we can buy the fund and its monthly distributions at 94 cents on the dollar. BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust (BOE) is like a mix of ETV and EVT, with global exposure (read: U.S. and international stocks) mixed in. Management has built a roughly 50-stock portfolio that’s currently split 65/35 across U.S. and international stocks, but that blend can and will change over time. When I’ve looked at this fund in past years, I’ve seen it hold as much as half of assets in international stocks, which is higher than the typical global fund. But like ETV and EVT, everything revolves around blue chips. It holds U.S. mega-caps like Microsoft and Broadcom (AVGO), but also developed-market names like AstraZeneca (AZN) and even emerging-market giants like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Alibaba (BABA). International stocks might pay more than domestics, but BOE still yields roughly 3x more than most global ETFs. It’s not leverage, which is vanishingly thin, but a covered call strategy—one that helps fund a monthly distribution north of 8%. We’re not expecting to outperform a basic index over time, but we do expect less volatility and smaller drawdowns. An 8.7% discount to NAV would seem to give us an edge right now, but it’s a shallower markdown than its longer-term 11% average. Many sector ETFs and mutual funds are usually faithful to one slice of the market. We buy technology funds for technology stocks, and bank funds for bank stocks. But CEFs like the BlackRock Resources & Commodities Strategy Trust (BCX) aren’t afraid to “cross the streams.” BCX primarily invests in stocks “issued by commodity or natural resources companies,” meaning that the portfolio straddles the energy and materials sectors. The management team has assembled a tight portfolio of just 45 companies including integrated energy majors like Shell (SHEL) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), but also metals and minerals specialists like Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX). The fund also may invest in derivatives, and it also sells covered calls to enhance its dividend yield. The result? It’s not always that way. Longer-term, BCX has struggled to capture some of the biggest moves in metals, at least in part because of its covered-call strategy. Like with many CEFs, the best chance for success is buying while the fund is cheap. We can currently buy BlackRock’s fund for a 6% discount, but it’s not really a deal compared to its long-term average discount of 10%. We get a more targeted energy play (and the highest yield of the bunch, at nearly 10%) from the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO). Co-Managers Peter Vanderlee and Patrick McElroy own just 20 companies. But it’s a who’s who of midstream companies (firms that operate pipelines, storage, terminals and other energy assets), including regular stocks such as Targa Resources (TRGP) and ONEOK (OKE), as well as master limited partnerships (MLPs) such as Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). Unlike with the other CEFs mentioned above, EMO’s holdings do a lot of the talking as it pertains to the monthly distribution. MLPs are among some of the highest-yielding securities in the stock market. But the fund still pays more than most MLP ETFs thanks to high leverage of nearly 30%. EMO trails its benchmark, the Alerian MLP Index—represented in the chart below by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP)—by 30 percentage points since inception in 2011. But since 2023 EMO has nearly doubled the return of AMLP, thanks to its aggressive leverage. EMO has the deepest discount on this list—we currently can buy shares at 91 cents on the dollar. But thanks to its hot performance, it’s actually expensive in historical terms, trading well above its longer-term 15% average discount.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 10/12 update below. This post was originally published on October 10 Bitcoin has suddenly fallen sharply, with a “flash crash” wiping $12,000 from the bitcoin price in a matter of minutes after a “cascade” warning. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price dropped to under $107,000, down from a high of $123,000 yesterday and a bitcoin price all-time high of $126,000 earlier this week, with other top ten cryptocurrencies ethereum, XRP, BNB and solana suffering greater declines that saw $500 billion wiped from the combined crypto market. Now, as fears swirl over the future of the U.S. dollar, traders are bracing for further declines as the bitcoin price crash suddenly accelerates amid uncertainty over U.S. president Donald Trump’s fresh China tariffs. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “A flash crash of liquidations saw almost $7 billion wiped across all markets within one hour, with $5.5 billion coming from longs," Sean Dawson, head of research at leading onchain options platform Derive.xyz, wrote in emailed comments. “Bitcoin and ethereum accounted for $3.3 billion of those liquidations. In total, almost $9.6 billion in positions have been liquidated over the past 24 hours, marking the largest single-day wipeout in crypto history." 10/12 update: The sudden bitcoin price and crypto market “flash crash” has left traders reeling. “Rarely does the crypto market leave you speechless,” Lark Davis, a crypto market analyst and writer of the Wealth Mastery newsletter, wrote in an emailed note and pointing to the more than “$19 billion in liquidations in the past 24 hours … worse than Covid and worse than [the] FTX”-led market meltdown. “It’s a sad day for the market and a lot of people are hurting.” Bitcoin’s rapid collapse from just under its all-time high of $126,000 to under $110,000 in a matter of minutes sent shockwaves through the wider crypto market as some smaller coins were all but wiped out before bouncing back. The bitcoin price “flash crash," coming outside of the traditional market trading hours, has led to a warning over the wildly popular bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), led by BlackRock’s near-$100 billion IBIT, which are bound by stock market opening times, leaving holders unable to react to weekend bitcoin price swings. “The extreme volatility in the price of bitcoin overnight highlights why institutional investors increasingly view access to 24/7 liquidity as essential to prudent risk management," Tommy Doyle, global head of relationship management at Xapo Bank, said in emailed comments. “Whilst bitcoin ETFs remain bound by traditional market trading hours, institutional investors with direct bitcoin accounts can continue to access liquidity and risk manage their bitcoin exposure throughout the weekend, especially relevant amid recent seismic price moves.” The sudden sell-off was sparked by Trump announcing a 100% tariff on China imports, accusing the country of taking an "extraordinarily aggressive position" on trade. “Markets are reeling after Trump’s surprise China tariff deadline reignited volatility, driving bitcoin toward $100,000 and triggering one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history,” 10x Research analysts led by chief executive Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note, that sounded a note of optimism amongst the carnage. “With $8 billion in forced liquidations, altcoins collapsing multiple times more than bitcoin, and funding rates turning deeply negative, the setup is both chaotic—and full of opportunity.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price and wider crypto market flash crash comes amid macro economic turmoil, with traders watching for any further sign that a further crash could be brewing. “Bitcoin dominance above 60% signals a new structural phase, while short-dated volatility above 50% opens the door for some of the most attractive option trades in months," 10x Research analysts added. "Yet beneath the headlines, a bigger macro story is unfolding—oil below $60, Treasury yields breaking lower, and the S&P 500 showing its first technical cracks since spring. Will Trump’s next tweet spark relief—or fuel another selloff?”

Title: What to Expect in Markets This Week: Big Bank Earnings, Fed Speakers, Shutdown Data Delays

After Friday’s big selloff as President Trump fired back at China’s tightening of rare earths export curbs with higher tariffs, investors will be watching closely for the latest trade policy developments. An ongoing federal government shutdown may delay the release of several economic reports, but investors can look forward to a full slate of corporate earnings from big banks and mainstays in the semiconductor industry. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and American Express are on the list of major financial firms set to report this week, while reports from TSMC, Johnson & Johnson, and United Airlines will also be in focus. Without a resolution to the budget dispute, the government shutdown will enter its third week, likely delaying the release of data on wholesale inflation, retail sales, housing starts, and jobless claims. Homebuilder confidence and small business optimism surveys are still scheduled, and several Federal Reserve speakers are expected to deliver remarks, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The bond market is closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday (observed in some places as Indigenous Peoples Day), while major stock exchanges are open. The Federal Reserve system, major financial institutions, and many federal, state, and local government offices will be closed on Monday. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. This week is set to bring third-quarter updates from some of the world's biggest banks and top financial institutions, starting with Tuesday's release from JPMorgan Chase. The world’s largest bank by market capitalization has reported better-than-expected revenue in the year’s first two quarters, even as sales declined and net interest income came up short in its most recent report amid CEO Jamie Dimon’s warnings about "turbulence" in the economy. Others expected to release quarterly financials Tuesday include Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and CitiGroup. Reports from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are due to follow Wednesday, while Charles Schwab, Bank of New York Mellon, and U.S. Bancorp are scheduled for Thursday. Earnings from American Express, Truist Financial, and State Street are slated for Friday. The world's largest chip manufacturer, TSMC, is set to report its results Thursday, after growing its revenue by 40% in the first half of 2025 on strong sales of AI chips. Chipmaking equipment maker ASML looks to report Wednesday after the Dutch firm raised worries about future growth amid tariff pressures. Also this week, cloud computing giant Oracle will host a three-day AI World conference beginning on Monday, and customer relationship management software firm Salesforce's Dreamforce event starts Tuesday. With the federal government shutdown heading into its third week, the blackout on economic data releases is likely to continue. The Thursday reports on U.S. retail sales and initial jobless claims and Friday’s update on housing starts could be delayed by the shutdown. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said last week it plans to release on Oct. 24 the Consumer Price Index inflation report for September that was originally scheduled for release on Wednesday. Several Federal Reserve officials are also scheduled to speak, coming as the central bank is set to release its Beige Book economic update on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell is due to give an economic update on Tuesday, with remarks also expected this week from Fed Governor Stephen Miran, Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and Fed Governor Christopher Waller. Some data releases are still expected, including a survey of small business optimism on Tuesday and report on homebuilder confidence on Thursday.
