Sunak’s appointment comes after resigning from the PM role last year after a loss to Keir Starmer’s Labour Party Goldman Sachs has named former United Kingdom Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a senior adviser, adding a veteran policymaker to its roster as banks navigate rising geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. The investment bank announced Sunak’s appointment on Tuesday. Sunak, who remains a Conservative member of parliament from a seat in northern England, previously worked at Goldman as an analyst in the early 2000s before joining a series of hedge funds. Through a combination of his past career in financial services and the family wealth of his wife, whose father co-founded the Indian IT services company Infosys, Sunak became the wealthiest British prime minister, drawing criticism of being out of touch with most UK voters. He has remained largely out of the spotlight since resigning as leader of the Conservatives after the party’s worst defeat in more than a century in July last year. He took up posts at Oxford and Stanford universities earlier this year. Goldman’s hiring of Sunak, who had also served as the UK’s finance minister, adds to a long list of senior politicians taking up positions in finance, where their policy backgrounds and global networks are viewed as strategic assets. “I am excited to welcome Rishi back to Goldman Sachs,” Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. “In his role, he will work with leaders across the firm to advise our clients globally on a range of important topics, sharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape,” Solomon said. Former British finance ministers George Osborne and Sajid Javid have also made the move to finance with Osborne holding positions at asset manager BlackRock and advisory firm Robey Warshaw and Javid becoming a partner at investment firm Centricus.

Former British prime minister Rishi Sunak will return to Goldman Sachs in an advisory role, the Wall Street bank said on Tuesday, taking a new post a year after he led the Conservatives to a crushing electoral defeat.

Current growth trajectory suggests IBIT may reach 1.2 million BTC in the next year. BlackRock’s IBIT Spot Bitcoin ETF has officially crossed 700,000 BTC in assets under management, valued at approximately $76 billion as of July 17. The milestone comes just 18 months after the fund’s launch in January 2024, marking a rapid accumulation pace that has drawn industry-wide attention. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted the achievement on July 8, noting that IBIT is now 62% of the way toward surpassing Satoshi Nakamoto as the largest known single holder of Bitcoin. According to Balchunas, the fund has been adding roughly 40,000 BTC per month, or about 1,300 BTC per day, and could reach 1.2 million BTC by May 2026 if the current trend holds. In addition to its growing Bitcoin holdings, IBIT has also become a top-performing revenue generator for BlackRock. Of the asset management firm’s 1,197 ETFs, IBIT now ranks third in revenue generation at $191 billion, and it is less than $9 billion away from claiming the top spot.

"Volatility may be on summer break, but Q3 and Q4 could still deliver fireworks," the analysts wrote in a recent blog post. The current low volatility is a sign that markets have priced in a Goldilocks scenario with delayed tariffs, rate cuts from the Federal Open Markets Committee later this year, and sustained fiscal deficits, the analysts wrote. "While whales, OGs, and miners largely sidelined, Bitcoin remains just 2 to 3 percent below all-time highs," they said. "This is supported by steady inflows from ETFs and public corporate treasuries." BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, which trades on the Nasdaq under the IBIT ticker, has netted nearly $53 billion in inflows since its debut 18 months ago and just reached 700,306.7922 Bitcoin in its holdings. It has been the fastest-growing exchange-traded fund in the industry's 32-year history. That means that BlackRock holds 3.52% of the 19.8 million circulating supply of Bitcoin. And Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at Bitget Wallet, noted that the company's iShares Ethereum Trust now holds 1.5% of all ETH. "If ETF inflows continue, we could be entering the early stages of a structural supply squeeze," he said. "That means less ETH circulating on the open market, more volatility, and stronger upward pressure on price." The QCP analysts also noted that equities are "extending their melt-up rally." At the time of writing, the S&P 500 was trading at $6,226.78—up 3.6% over the past month. And the Nasdaq 100 index has gained 4.2% over the same period. Both indexes have recently hit all-time highs. QCP analysts also noted that "credit spreads are the tightest they've been since the March-April correction." Credit spreads refer to the extra yield investors demand to hold riskier corporate bonds over safer government debt. For the spread to be especially narrow is a sign of investor confidence because they're not demanding much compensation for the credit risk. The real macro signal to watch will be whether President Donald Trump can get more trade deals signed before his new August 1 deadline. Risk assets, like Bitcoin, have largely taken the new tariff deadline in stride, QCP wrote, having come to expect blustery tariff rhetoric without action. "Should Trump decide to follow through, however, the impact would be materially anti-growth," the analysts said. "It would mark a true test for global risk resilience."

War in the Middle East, The Rothschilds. The Confidential Pentagon Memo: “Take Out 7 Countries… Finishing off Iran.” Resisting War By Robert J.

Michel Chossudovsky By Prof Michel Chossudovsky and Michelle Leduc Catlin, July 08, 2025 Destabilizing the social, political and economic structure of 190 sovereign countries cannot constitute a “solution” to combating the virus. But that was the imposed “solution” which was implemented in several stages from the very outset of the corona crisis in January 2020. It’s the destruction of people’s lives. It is the destabilization of civil society. Genocide in Palestine. Displacement as Negotiation: The Ever-Enduring Logic of Plan Dalet By Rima Najjar, July 08, 2025 Today, the world is witnessing the original logic of Zionist territorial consolidation in the Levant as it mutates but persists — like a serpent uncoiling through time, holding Plan Dalet in its forked tongue and injecting it with new poison. Militarism and Organized Crime: U.S. Neocolonialism and Mass Poverty. Stephen Sefton By Stephen Sefton, July 08, 2025 Currently, the year-on-year growth figures of the largest world economies show that the economies of China and India are growing by more than 5% while the North American economy is growing by 2% on a downward trend, Japan and the United Kingdom by less than 2% and countries such as France, Italy and Germany by less than 1%. Ukraine Transformed into an “Underdeveloped Country”: Why Did BlackRock Suddenly Give Up on Zelensky and the Kiev Regime By Drago Bosnic, July 08, 2025 When the NATO-orchestrated Ukrainian conflict started in 2014, American and multinational conglomerates rushed to ensure they got their “piece of the pie” in the unfortunate country. In around a decade or so, the Kiev regime changed laws and enabled the total or near-total takeover of every remotely valuable asset built by generations in the Soviet Union. BRICS at Rio de Janeiro: And What Next? By Kester Kenn Klomegah, July 08, 2025 Popularly referred to as BRICS, the informal group of emerging-market economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), meeting in Rio de Janeiro, has outlined a new unprecedented multitude of goals to challenge unipolar system. In the context of rising uncertainty, BRICS has further set up new models to change the economic architecture through South-South cooperation. Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” — Salvation or Disaster? Neither or Both? By Richard C.

Title: Truth Social Goes Full Crypto—SEC Considers Trump-Linked ETF Filing
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/truth-social-goes-full-crypto-sec-considers-trump-linked-etf-filing/
Time Published: 2025-07-08T15:00:55Z
Full Content:
US regulators have kicked off the formal review of a new spot‑crypto fund. Investors won’t know for sure if it clears the hurdles until the US Securities and Exchange Commission makes a final call. But the filing itself signals growing acceptance of directly held crypto products. According to the SEC filing, Trump Media’s Truth Social unit wants an ETF listed on NYSE Arca with 75% in Bitcoin and 25% in Ether. Yorkville America Digital would sponsor the fund, while Foris DAX Trust Company—Crypto.com’s custody arm—would hold the coins. US President Donald Trump’s team submitted the S‑1 form on June 16, starting what is likely a 45‑day review clock. Based on reports, the fund would value Bitcoin each trading day using the CME CF Bitcoin reference rate. Ether would use the CME CF Ether rate, unless the sponsor chooses another source. Private keys for both assets would sit in a cold wallet, kept separate from customer accounts. That setup aims to address long‑standing worries over hacks, theft and tangled custody failures. Wall Street giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have filed pure‑Bitcoin ETF applications. Some firms are eyeing Ether‑only funds. Now a dual‑asset product is in the mix. If the SEC finalizes its planned “automated” listing framework, reviews could shrink from many months to a few. That rule would standardize disclosures, custody standards and market‑integrity checks for all spot‑crypto ETFs. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s spot‑Solana ETF hit another delay. The SEC pushed back its March 25 application and opened a new public‑comment window—21 days for feedback, 35 days for replies. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart called this hold‑up “expected,” noting it shows the agency is still fine‑tuning data and disclosures before any approvals. Now the ball is in the SEC’s court. Regulators can sign off, send back comments or reject the bid. If leadership keeps up the push for faster, automated reviews, spot‑crypto ETFs might reach market this year. Until then, every move—from amendment requests to public comments—will matter for funds backed by Bitcoin, Ether and beyond. At stake is more than branding. Fees, trading speed and trust in custody will shape which funds win big money. And sponsors will need muscle to stand out in a growing field of nearly 10 proposals. Investors should keep a close eye on filings and deadlines to know when to act. The race launched with Trump Media’s Truth Social filing, and it may well end—with approval or denial—under its banner. Truth Social’s entry has put a fresh spin on the push for regulated crypto products. Featured image from Getty Images, chart from TradingView For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

The fund raising would be by group companies Adani Green Energy and Adani Energy Solutions, they said. The companies will be tapping private equity firms and sovereign funds from the Middle East, the US and Canada and some of the investors could be existing bond holders in the group, the sources said. Separately, the group is also negotiating a loan amount of around ₹16,000 crore with Indian banks for its airport arm. This will most likely be finalised towards the end of the year, the sources said. It will be used for the next phase of expansion of the Navi Mumbai International Airport, which is being built in phases. The airport, which is tentatively scheduled to start operations around September this year, will be able to handle 20 million passengers and 0.5 million tonne cargo annually in the launch phase. When the project is complete it will be able to handle 90 million passengers and 3.2 million tonnes of cargo. Over the last six months the Gautam Adani-controlled conglomerate has raised funds from global asset managers and funds such as Blackrock and Apollo and also from its joint venture partner TotalEnergies. In January Adani Green raised $1.425 billion, through $1.125 billion infusion by the promoter group and $300 million from TotalEnergies. The purpose of this was for early redemption of bonds and for capital optimisation. In March Adani Green again refinanced a $1.06-billion construction facility for its renewable energy projects in Rajasthan. In June it raised $750 million in a private bond issuance to fund its cement expansion. The group, which is in a perpetual expansion, growth and acquisitive mode, regularly taps the global markets for its funding needs.

Title: Ukraine Transformed into Underdeveloped Country: Why BlackRock Suddenly Gave Up on Zelensky and the Kiev Regime
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/blackrock-gave-up-neo-nazi-junta/5894166
Time Published: 2025-07-08T14:52:43Z
Full Content:
When the NATO-orchestrated Ukrainian conflict started in 2014, American and multinational conglomerates rushed to ensure they got their “piece of the pie” in the unfortunate country. In around a decade or so, the Kiev regime changed laws and enabled the total or near-total takeover of every remotely valuable asset built by generations in the Soviet Union. While the socialist superstate certainly had its flaws, the legacy it left in former Ukraine has never been matched by any government since the latter’s “independence” in 1991. Namely, while the country had a massive industrial sector until then and a population of 52 million, mostly well-educated and working in various specialist fields (Soviet Ukraine was a scientific and industrial powerhouse no less than Russia itself), after 1991, all this collapsed for good. By the early 1990s, relatively prosperous Ukraine turned into an underdeveloped country with only a fraction of its Soviet-era scientific and industrial potential, selling mostly agricultural products and essentially serving as a cheap resource for the political West’s brutal (neo)colonial exploitation. By the mid-2010s, NATO fully hijacked the unfortunate country and turned it over to the Neo-Nazi junta that’s now effectively conducting genocide against Ukrainians themselves. Namely, the demographic collapse is so catastrophic that it’s highly likely there’s only half of Ukraine’s 1991 population in the country at this point. The suicidal war with Russia (its closest kin) continues, while the United States is now openly demanding whatever’s left of Ukrainian resources (with even this lost to Russian all-out advance across the frontlines). In fact, the situation is so bad that the infamous BlackRock, the world’s most exploitative (neo)colonial conglomerate, has actually given up on NATO-occupied Ukraine. According to Bloomberg, it suspended work on “a multibillion-dollar Ukraine recovery fund”, supposedly following President Donald Trump’s election win. Apparently, this prompted France to work on a replacement deal, with initial support from Germany, Poland and Italy. The report, published on July 5, further states that BlackRock ceased all efforts to “search for institutional investors in January”, effectively ending the planned $500 million fund that was intended to be secured from various Western governments, development grants and investment banks. In turn, another $2 billion from other private investors was also lost after they withdrew. The report also points out that the investment stopped due to “a lack of interest amid perceived uncertainty in Ukraine”. In other words, nobody wants to sink billions of dollars into an endemically corrupt mafia state run by Neo-Nazi goons in the middle of an unwinnable war with a military superpower nextdoor. Truly shocking. However, jokes aside, it doesn’t take an economic expert to understand that the most basic logic implies that nobody remotely sane would make that kind of investment. Worse yet, the notion of “perceived uncertainty” is even more laughable. Namely, as previously mentioned, the Russian military is now advancing on multiple fronts, meaning that this “uncertainty” is not a matter of perception, but an objective reality that any thinking investor would take into account. The Bloomberg report further states that the investment fund was scheduled to be unveiled at the “Ukraine Recovery Conference” on July 10-11 in Rome. A BlackRock spokesperson said that the conglomerate “completed advisory work for the recovery fund pro bono in 2024, but no longer has any active mandate”. Worse yet, although France promised to “step up”, it seems this is also falling through. Citing “people familiar with the matter” Bloomberg reports that “it remains uncertain how effective the plan will be without American backing”. In other words, investors from the European Union are just as skeptical as their US counterparts, which tends to happen when people are getting their information from sources other than the mainstream propaganda machine which still insists that the Kiev regime is “defeating Russia”. Numerous independent authors from around the world (particularly at InfoBRICS), have been reporting that the so-called minerals deal that the Trump administration was trying to push for since it came to power would fall through. We repeatedly argued that the minerals promised by the Neo-Nazi junta weren’t even under its control, while areas with any known resources lack the mining industry to support extraction. It would take years and tens (if not hundreds) of billions in investment just to establish it. In other words, the investors would need to give lots of money to the losing side. Expectedly, such business deals are wholly unattractive to people who don’t like losing massive financial assets. The Kiev regime tried to do everything in its power (effectively selling the entire country) to change their opinions, but to no avail. For instance, the Neo-Nazi junta frontman Volodymyr Zelensky pompously announced his $1 trillion “reconstruction plan” years ago, even promising each corporation what can only be described as free rei(g)n in oblasts (regions) they invested in. The results have been catastrophic for NATO-occupied Ukraine, with around 30% of its arable land handed over to (neo)colonialists. In addition, cheap Ukrainian agricultural products flooded European markets (after they were initially promised to starving Africans and for which Russia was blamed by the mainstream propaganda machine), resulting in massive protests by farmers across the “old continent” as their market share collapsed virtually overnight. However, even this turned out to be a bad investment, particularly after the Russian military entered the Dnepropetrovsk oblast. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Goldman Sachs hires former British PM Sunak as adviser

Goldman Sachs has today named former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak its senior adviser, adding a veteran policymaker to its roster as banks navigate rising geopolitical and regulatory uncertainty. For Sunak, the appointment marks a return to the bank where he first worked as a summer intern in investment banking in 2000 and later as an analyst between 2001 and 2004. "In his role, he will advise our clients globally on a range of important topics, sharing his unique perspectives and insights on the macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape," Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a statement. The move underscores a well-established career trajectory in which former government officials often transition to finance, where their policy background and global network are seen as strategic assets. Former Chancellors of the Exchequer George Osborne and Sajid Javid also moved into the industry, with Osborne joining BlackRock as an adviser and Javid becoming a partner at investment firm Centricus. Currently, banks are placing even greater value on such experience as they seek to guide clients through an increasingly complex geopolitical landscape. Sunak was the UK's prime minister between October 2022 and July 2024, and Chancellor of the Exchequer from February 2020 to July 2022. He resigned as prime minister and Conservative Party leader last year after a heavy loss to Keir Starmer's Labour Party. He is currently the MP for Richmond and Northallerton.

Business FILE PHOTO: People walk outside the Nasdaq Marketsite in New York City, U.S., April 3, 2025. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo ReserveOne, a new crypto venture with ties to industry veterans and a former U.S. commerce secretary, will list on the Nasdaq through a merger with blank-check firm M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp and is expected to raise more than $1 billion. The company will manage a portfolio of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ethereum and Solana, while aligning its holdings with the U.S. strategic crypto reserve, it said on Tuesday. The deal, expected to close in the October-December quarter, is the latest in a series of efforts to wrap crypto assets into equity and make them more appealing for traditional investors. The exponential stock price growth of Michael Saylor's Strategy, which pivoted to a bitcoin-focused business model in 2020, has also popularized the playbook.

July 8, 2025 8:30am by Barry Ritholtz The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Kate Moore, Citi Wealth CIO, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, yet another extra special guest. Wow. What a fascinating career. Kate Moore is having. Her background is everything from Morgan Stanley to more capital to Bank America, Merrill Lynch to JP Morgan to BlackRock. She’s now Chief Investment officer of Citibank’s Citi Wealth, which runs, you know, something like a trillion dollars. The breadth and depth of her experience makes her uniquely situated to be a chief investment officer. She’s had, you know, just about every job on the buy side and sell side, including portfolio manager, consultant to LBOs and m and as she’s just done so much stuff, it’s so interesting that she really brings just this unique set of experiences to Citi. I thought this conversation was really interesting and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with Kate Moore. Kate Moore: Thanks so much, Barry. I’m psyched to be having this conversation today Barry Ritholtz: Long overdue. Yeah, we’ve, we’ve been like ships in the night. I, I’m so glad I finally got, got you here. Let’s start a little bit with your academic background. Yeah. Which is kind of surprised me. Bachelor’s in political and social thought from the University of Virginia, a Master’s in Political Economy from University of Chicago. What was the original career plan? Kate Moore: I mean, I think Barry underlying your question was like, Kate, you sound kind of nerdy but not as nerdy as some of the folks who have like triple degrees in statistics. But so where did this political and social thought and political economy stuff come from? So at University of Virginia, this PST program is interdisciplinary and that was really attractive. You also apply during your second year so you have a chance to like send it, cut a sample, some different disciplines before you do it. And it’s an incredible seminar program. So you’re working with some really amazing professors throughout the way. I loved being able to take classes in economics, in politics, in theory, in philosophy. I also took a lot of studio art classes and stuff as an undergrad, but I was able to combine all of this stuff together. So I loved that. And then I worked for a couple years and I decided, you know, hey, what I really am good at and what I love is academics and I wanna be a professor. This was my, my idea. I’m gonna go back to school and get my PhD and be a professor. I had this whole vision for myself that involved like, you know, writing books in the summer I would be doing cool research. I have a pack of golden retrievers and you know, I’d like rock climb on the side. This is whole vision of my academic life. So I applied to PhD programs and I went to University of Chicago for political economy. So this intersection of policy and politics, you know, international theory and you know, economics. And I found once I was there, honestly, that many people in my program are taking eight to 10 years to get through their PhD and becoming so specialized in very arcane topics. And it was like not appealing to me since I had already worked and everything. So I left after my master’s, but I did my work on, you know, this intersection of economics and policy with a focus on emerging markets and China. So I was ahead of my time. Barry Ritholtz: It’s so interesting that you talk about how specialized some people become. It’s pretty clear, at least historically, many of the greatest investors in history had a very broad set of interest and a broad set of skills. Few of them were an inch wide and a mile deep. They weren’t a mile wide and an inch deep, but they were broad enough that they were able to pull in things from other fields that applied to investing. Did you find something similar when you’re studying political science and economics to, how did that shape your investing philosophy? Kate Moore: Absolutely. I think, you know, the best macro investors or able to pull in, you know, different inputs from policy and politics, it’s also really helpful I think to understand human behavior. So if you’re taking an interdisciplinary approach to your academics and your investing life, I think you’re well set up. So in this, I mean I took a bunch of courses on game theory and stuff as a, in my graduate work and understanding payoffs and incentives, doing some work on behavioral economics, all of that combines really well. And my experience too was that the best investors that I worked for over the course of my career also took in all of these different inputs and we’re constantly trying to solve a puzzle, right? It wasn’t just, you know, a two variable puzzle. It was a multi-variable puzzle understanding that every day you wake up and you have to do it anew. Barry Ritholtz: Yeah, no, no doubt about it. It’s so funny you mention incentives. Whenever I see a situation that I find completely perplexing and can’t figure it out, what usually leads to the answer is what, what are the incentives that led to this situation? I want you to work backwards from that. So let’s talk a little bit about the strategy and consulting side. You begin your career, Mitchell, Madison and Silver Oak Partners, is that right? Yes. Those two shops. Tell us a little bit about what you did for them and the sort of work and problem solving you did for those firms. Okay, 00:05:34 [Speaker Changed] So both Mitchell Madison, silver Oak no longer exist, right? For the record, Mitchell Madison was formed out of a spinoff of a bunch of McKinsey partners and it was taking kind of a new way, a new approach frankly, to some of the similar types of clients as McKinsey had. And, but it had this very entrepreneurial kind of environment because it was a break off, but it was still really large and global. I did a bunch of like strategy consulting projects, things you would expect, including some cool stuff in the media space just at the time where the internet was becoming popular. And some of these websites like Amazon that we take for granted were getting launched. So I learned a lot about media and e-commerce in those early stages at Mitchell Madison, but Mitchell Madison, for those of you who may recognize it, went through a merger with us Web CKS, which was a technology consulting firm. 00:06:33 All the combined entity got rebranded as March 1st, which was the date that the deal was inked. Kind of a weird marketing decision on that part, but you know, the, the, the business started to change and a number of the partners like broke off and started Silver Oak, which focused on leverage buyout firms. Now here is what was really cool. I wasn’t doing work for let’s say the LBO in master form, but rather like a collection of the companies in the portfolio at the same time trying to find synergies. There were things that are traditional around sourcing, but things that were maybe less traditional around finding strategic combinations. And I had a great opportunity to get exposed to a lot of different industries, you know, from traditional manufacturers to telecom companies, financial services and everything in between. And I have to say, Barry, that experience, you know, working for these kind of small and mid-sized LBO owned companies really set me up well for understanding and investing in a broad array of equities. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk about the investing side. Your next stop is Morgan Stanley, obviously a legendary and giant sell side firm. Tell us your, about your experiences at Morgan Stanley. Yeah, Kate Moore: So how I got to Morgan Stanley investment management is perhaps kind of interesting. So we were just talking about my academic background and I was doing this, you know, political economy degree at University of Chicago and I had had this sort of moment where I realized I wasn’t gonna pursue the PhD. So I, you know, made an appointment with my advisor and I said, you know, professor Harold, I’m not sure I wanna do the PhD. And he starts laughing and we’re sitting in his office, he said, Kate, I’ve been waiting for this conversation for six months. Oh completely. Wow. I said, oh my gosh. Like do you know, do you think I’m screwing up here? He said, no, you’re top of the class. What I do recognize though is because you’ve worked before for a number of years before coming into a PhD program, you have a different skillset and you’re approaching this differently. He’s like, I think you can finish your PhD later. You know, do the master’s and whatever. So I had this in my mind and I, so I started to put out a couple feelers, but I wasn’t really committed to what I would do post, you know, getting my master’s degree. Barry Ritholtz:And this is out of Chicago, rght? 00:08:43 [Speaker Changed] It’s in Chicago. And then a strange thing happened, I was back on the east coast visiting my parents and I got a call from the career services people at University of Chicago. I was still, you know, enrolled in school there just getting my thesis graded. And they said, Hey, we got an incoming call from the Chief Investment officer of Morgan Stanley Investment Management. This guy’s name is Joe McLinden. Joe is looking to add to his macro investing team on the buy side and specifically is looking for candidates that are not MBAs. He wanted people who had this understanding of politics and economics and everything in between. And I said, Hey guys, I’m not interested in going back into that form of finance. I’m gonna do something different. They said, do us this favor and go on the interview. Barry Ritholtz: Just like, just just meet with them. Yeah. 00:09:35 [Speaker Changed] Like let’s put up a good candidate. You kind of meet the criteria. If it’s not your bag, it’s not your bag. And I went and met this team at Morgan Stanley investment management and people who had economics and history and philosophy degrees, but were macro investors. And I was like, okay, A, these people are cool and b, I love how they’re solving the problems. Two weeks later I accepted an offer. I fell into investing Barry. Barry Ritholtz: Wow, that’s that’s really fascinating. And, and you’ve had a breadth of experiences beyond Morgan Stanley. You were at more Capital well regarded hedge funds, bank of America, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, you spent a lot of time at BlackRock. Tell us what was fun, what did you learn at these other shops? Kate Moore: So I’ve had a really cool career in the sense that I’ve done, you know, a variety of different buy-side, more traditional mutual funds. But even when I was at s Im, we launched the first internal hedge fund. This is before Morgan Stanley bought Front Point and I worked at a big macro hedge fund through the financial crisis, as you mentioned, at more capital that was an adventure. I did a few years on the sell side at B of a Merrill as global equity and emerging market strategist. And then I went to JP Morgan, managed the discretionary multi-asset portfolios for the private bank. Then I spent a, a long time at BlackRock, most of it as a portfolio manager for global allocation, kind of the flagship multi-asset fund. I have to say I love the fact that I have experienced all sides of the investing business and it makes me understand what makes investors tick a lot more than people who just stayed in their lane. Like I get the retail side, the institutional side, what fast money does, what traders do, what fundamental investors do. And I interpret all this sort of sentiment and flow data as part of my process as a result of having this exposure to different parts of the investment management business. Barry Ritholtz: Sounds really, really interesting. So from all of these different backgrounds, what finally brought you to Citi? Kate Moore: Yeah, so I, I was at a bit of an interesting inflection point I would say in my career here I am. I’ve loved being at BlackRock, I really enjoyed the work, but I also recognized I was kind of ready to take the next big step and I could continue to be a portfolio manager at BlackRock and it’s an amazing firm, but I was kind of wondering what it would sort of, what what I should do to take this next step. And I looked around and said where are the areas of growth in the business? And traditional mutual funds we know are not a huge growth area for the business. Even if your performance is exceptional, you know, keeping your assets can be a challenge. And I saw wealth as an area of consistent growth. I think most people would agree on that front for sure. 00:12:22 And, and you know, there’s some growth in alternatives, but it felt like just a different flavor of the stuff I was doing. So I was sort of intrigued by this idea of, of working in wealth, especially because I’ve done a lot of asset allocation and the multi-asset discipline I come from and I love the challenge of helping people grow their money over time. But I hadn’t, I didn’t have like a great idea in my head of what I was gonna do. This was just sort of something that was a seed that was planted and not yet out of the soil if it were. Hmm. And in August of 2024, Andy Seig, who I’d known in the business for like 15 years or so, never worked together directly. But you know, we’d met a number of times, been on panels together, had good cordial relationship. He called me and said, Kate, I have an idea for you. And he had been at Citi for a year then as you know, CEO of wealth. And I thought, okay, this is interesting, but I need to turn it over in my head a little bit. Is this gonna be the right pivot? And ultimately I got so excited Barry because Citi was already in this massive transformation. Andy is a really inspirational leader. I’m not just saying that ’cause he’s my boss, but I think most people on the street will agree. He has a vision he executes and this was a new challenge for me. I’d be flexing different muscles and I thought to myself, for this next big push in my career, I wanna be someplace where I can be entrepreneurial, where I’m gonna be supported by the overall platform where, you know, I can continue to grow out my experience as an investor. And so ultimately I made the tough decision to leave a firm that I loved for a new and exciting challenge. Barry Ritholtz: Safe to say that this shift in career was the biggest inflection point. Kate Moore: It feels like it’s the biggest inflection point in my career, but it also feels cumulative. I don’t know if that makes sense, but perfect sense Barry Ritholtz: I understand exactly what you’re saying. All all of these different elements come together almost like a perfect storm. Yeah. And suddenly now we’re off to the, to the whole nother level. Kate Moore: Yeah. I’ve been building up these experiences over the course of my career and kind of setting me up to take on this new challenge. It does feel the largest in part because I’ve been so concentrated on being an investor over the course of my career. And this is a combination of strategy and, and business leadership and investing. And so as I said, I’m flexing, flexing a bunch of different muscles. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s put some numbers, some flesh on the bone. So the groups you lead the wealth group at at Citi, what’s the assets they’re investing and typically who are the clients? Are they mom and pop investors? Are they institutional? A little of both. Kate Moore: Yeah. So I’ll give you some numbers as of end of 2024 because everything else, of course is in flux in the first part. Barry Ritholtz: We know how that works. Kate Moore: Yeah. I’m in, in the middle of studying for series 65, what will be like my 39th millionth of Barry Ritholtz: But that one you could do in your sleep. It’s not like the seven, which is or the options. Yeah. I forgot which one was the options. That was a giant like wait, I need to learn about gamma, why not? Kate Moore: Totally. I’ve taken the options one too. What I will tell you is the one thing that’s a little bit annoying on the economic section of the series 65 is that, you know, I don’t always agree. Barry Ritholtz: Was gonna say the answers are wrong answer. Once you get past that, the test is really easy. Kate Moore: For Example, it was like, you know, our payrolls a leading lagging or coincident indicator. Very, of course Barry Ritholtz: It’s lagging! Of course or anything but lagging because it’s two months old. Kate Moore: Totally. And like plus or minus 100 Barry Ritholtz: They, they said coincidental, right? Totally. Yeah. It’s just there. I, I remember having an, this is by the way, 30 something years ago, 20 something years ago. I remember calling up and yelling at somebody like, just so you know, I didn’t get any of these answers wrong. And the three you marked wrong, you are wrong. And let me explain why totally. How, how can payrolls, which are a model that uses 1, 2, 3 month old data be anything other than a Kate Moore: Lagging and that get totally restated every two years. Right. And the, the error bands, but the subsequent monthly revisions, I mean by the time you get to the actual number, it’s like half a decade old. It’s nonsense Barry Ritholtz: a hundred percent. Kate Moore: We have to pretend.And yet of course the market moves a lot on payrolls stay and we have to pretend that matters in the moment. Yeah, we have to pretend. Okay, where were we going before? Barry Ritholtz: I have no idea. But I just love the fact that you’re studying for the 65. I know studying in air quotes, Kate Moore: I get to whiz through the equity and hedge fund and everything sort of sections of it. But I have to memorize their answers for economics. Barry Ritholtz: If it, if it wasn’t embarrassing to fail, yeah. I would say you can wing it and you’ll do just fine. I think 70 is a passing, you’ll get like 80 just off the top of your head. But no one wants to go in and fail ’cause it’s embarrassing Kate Moore: No, I’m very like, I, I’ve made my career off of being a perfectionist, you know, in my analysis. That’s so funny. And you know, I do not accept a barely passing grade. I do not expect, I, I accept, you know, index like performance. I’m always seeking alpha and I’m doing my best to do that in the most risk adjusted way, even Barry Ritholtz:In an examination that’s pass fail. Yeah. And we know objectively, logically anything over a 71 is wasted effort. But yeah. But I know where exactly where you coming Kate Moore: From. I can’t sleep at night. I can’t sleep at night if it’s just good enough. And that’s also how I wanna approach things for my clients. Okay, we’re talking about Citi here. And so Citi has about a trillion do, Citi Wealth has a trillion dollars in assets close to like 600, you know, billion of that is in investments and there’s other parts in deposits and loans and things like that. And there are three main segments, right? There’s a traditional kind of private bank, ultra high net worth service, right? There’s Citi Gold, which is mass affluent, and then there is a wealth at work which targets like very specific segments like the law firm population, et cetera. Barry Ritholtz: Makes a lot, makes a ton of sense. Kate Moore: What I will say is Citi as a bank has so many global customers and clients and people with longstanding relationships that haven’t been tapped. You know, there’s, there is an enormous amount of potential to grow the wealth business just from existing Citi customers. And I think as you probably know, half of our business is outside of the US and it is a, it is a, Barry Ritholtz:Is it 50%? It’s fully half, yeah. Wow. That’s amazing. Yeah. Kate Moore: And the Asia business for us and particularly our legacy in China and surrounding areas is incredibly strong. And that was something that was also very attractive to me, to be honest with you. As someone who has been an, an emerging markets investor at times and a student of China, you know, the ability to get really deep into the opportunity to grow wealth in multiple different areas was exciting. 00:19:15 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really fascinating. So before we talk about Citi, let’s start a little bit with your time at BlackRock. You joined them almost a decade ago in 2016 you were chief equity strategist. Tell us a little bit about your initial role and how that played off of what you had been doing previously. 00:19:35 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I joined BlackRock to be part of the BlackRock Investment Institute, which is kind of the internal macro think tank. And the institute has a couple of different functions. There is a segment that is client facing, but there’s also a big function around bringing together the investors across all the platforms in BlackRock and convening for, you know, forums and symposiums around specific topics. And although I was called Chief equity strategist, I actually sat on the equity platform with all the equity PMs and my job was to be basically embedded in all of the equity portfolios as the macro. My team was the macro resource for them and it was great. And you know, I always knew that I would do that for a little while. They basically said, can you do this and help to sort of change some of the equity culture and to have some macro inputs and then you can kind of figure out where you wanna sit. And ultimately, you know, moving back to a multi-asset fund made the most sense for me because here’s my joke, Barry, like I think of myself as being a macro equity investor, you know, combining macro stuff into equities, but the macro people will say, I’m equity and the equity people will say I’m macro. Yeah, that makes sense. So a multi-asset fund is a, is a good home for me. Huh? 00:20:50 [Speaker Changed] So 2019 you start working with the thematic strategy and portfolio manager group. Yeah. Tell us a little bit about thematics that’s become sort of an alternative to beta in a lot of shops. BlackRock especially. 00:21:06 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well let me say this, I actually started my career, you know, at Morgan Stanley investment management and the hedge fund that my team launched at MIM was a global thematic hedge fund. This is way back like over 23 years ago at this point. So we were ahead of our times, right? So I’ve actually had this thematic approach, frankly in my investment approach throughout my entire career. And it’s just now becoming really popular to call everything a thematic. So lemme say this, I think there are three ways at this time to approach thematics, three different flavors if you will. The first is this kind of like long duration slow bleed thematic. Like eventually we are going to have reduce the amount of plastics in all of our goods. And so we wanna lean into companies that are investing in that transition. You 00:22:01 [Speaker Changed] Don’t think microplastics accumulating in your lungs and bloodstream is a bad thing. 00:22:06 [Speaker Changed] It is definitely a bad thing. I wonder if I’m a little bit cooked when it comes to that already. But this is kind of a set it and forget it strategy, right? Where you identify companies that are making these changes or facilitating the changes and you buy a basket of them and you or an ETF that invests ’em and then you just set it. The second type of thematics is what I would call like discontinuous change, catalyst driven thematics. And these are more tactical, like, you know, it could be a couple quarters, it could be up to a year or two or even longer. But this is kind of a more actively managed way to approach thematics, right? Where, so you identify the idea, you identify the catalysts, you identify the players, and actually there’s more of a rotation in the names and the sizing of that expression in the thematic. That’s really exciting. It’s also hard because sometimes you look around and say, I don’t see a ton of catalysts here. There’s nothing really jumping out. You 00:23:02 [Speaker Changed] Gotta get the theme, right? The asset class, right? And the timing right 00:23:05 [Speaker Changed] And the sizing, you know, within that, right? And so that’s not like by 40 companies that are thinking about microplastics. It is like four to eight names, a more concentrated expression around a theme. You’re taking some idiosyncratic risk and you are continuing to to invest around that. And then the third type of thematic investing, I would say is really business cycle thematic. And a lot of people talk about this, you know, today there’s a, you know, where are we in the cycle? What are the companies sectors or qualities that perform well in that part of the cycle? I’m thematically investing in inflation beneficiaries, et cetera. And I’ve always liked to do those two, kind of number two and number three together, which is the catalyst driven and the business cycle. And I think that together makes a nice portfolio. 00:23:54 [Speaker Changed] You know, I recall back in the day when we were talking about sort of thematic cycle investing, business cycle investing, it was used to go by the name sector rotation. Yeah. I don’t know if anybody still does that sort of stuff anymore, it 00:24:09 [Speaker Changed] Seems like, or the investment clock. Do you remember the investment clock? Sure, sure. Absolutely. Everyone had an investment clock, which was like this two dimensional representation of which sectors or which maybe style factors. Once that became part of our lexicon performed well in different macro environments, 00:24:26 [Speaker Changed] It was always sort of a sine wave. And here’s where we are in this sector here in the sector there. Yeah. If it only were, were that easy. 00:24:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, I, I won’t call out names, but I know some folks that like to chart where we are, which quadrant we’re in, right. You know, on a regular basis. And instead of this nice round circle or an oval, you know, it’s very sort of spastic point to point, to point to point because the macro data is moving so quickly and the positioning data, which also indicates, you know, investor risk, appetite changes so rapidly that we jump from one quadrant to the other sometimes month to month. 00:25:05 [Speaker Changed] So, so you mentioned removing plastic from the food supply or wherever. Yeah. What other trends have you looked at? Deglobalization, decarbonization ai. What gets you excited these days? 00:25:18 [Speaker Changed] Oh wait, you just said a hot button word for me, which is deglobalization. And let me just say I don’t believe in deglobalization. 00:25:24 [Speaker Changed] I’m with you, but I want to hear your reasons why. 00:25:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I don’t believe in deglobalization because even if, let’s say hypothetically the US and China continue to separate and by hypothetical I was making a joke for all the listeners, of course the US and China are gonna continue to separate. That doesn’t mean the relationships between each of these countries and other trading partners or allies is not gonna deepen, right? Maybe we call it re globalization instead of de-globalization, but a, a shifting of some other relationships. But I have spent a lot of my time, like a lot of folks frankly, looking at themes in and around technology. I mentioned the microplastics. It’s actually not a theme I’ve invested in. The only couple companies I’ve really seen who are geared towards that are private. And so it’s harder to access. But around technology, you know, a few areas I’ve been pretty excited about for a good considerable amount of time has been, you know, have been in, in software. 00:26:20 And one of those areas is cybersecurity. This was a major theme for me in the portfolio at Global allocation at BlackRock. And basically every time I was thinking that I’d want to either shift out of the theme or reduce it, there was another event on the horizon or something happening that led to increased spend in this space. I’ve now come to believe that investment in, in security software is existential for companies, right? And while there’s room to rotate, you know, names based on capabilities, et cetera, I believe it’s a, it’s a core part of a portfolio 00:26:54 [Speaker Changed] Longstanding secular trend that’s gonna be ongoing. 00:26:57 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But I first put on this investment in January of 2020 Okay. When I was at BlackRock and that was before the pandemic and it was basically based on geopolitical risk and of course the pandemic that increased the risk from all this data for many different companies. So we saw big up uptick in spends. As I said, it was a, it’s been a rolling series of catalysts over the last five and a half years and makes it more of a secular theme than a, a shorter term catalyst driven theme. So. 00:27:25 [Speaker Changed] So let’s drill down a little bit to your core investment philosophy. You’ve mentioned thematics, you’ve mentioned pursuing Alpha. Tell us what is Kate Moore’s investment philosophy? 00:27:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I think it’s really important to have three pillars to your decision making and one pillar that’s off to the side that’s controversial. So I think you have to start with a macro view. I think you need to understand politics policy, the major economic data you need to understand government behaviors. ’cause so much of that dictates the environment for different industries. And some people just sort of brush it off. By the way, I love my equity colleagues and friends, but nothing makes the hair on the back of my neck go up more and kind of me bristle than to hear. I don’t pay attention to macro because I just pick good companies. Well good, you’ll be out of business. You don’t have a choice in this environment. You can’t set it and forget it for the next three years and not focus on what’s happening in the business cycle and policy and how that may impact the interest and desire to own your asset class. 00:28:29 So I think macro is critical and a good starting point. I also like to get into the fundamentals of things, right? Like where are the fundamental thematically, like who’s growing, what technology has come out, where do we think about, you know, changes in consumer behavior, changes in supply chains, and where are the real kind of fundamental opportunities? What are the companies doing? Well I think that’s not controversial either, but with the third stage, and it’s really important to me, I mean it’s grown in importance over the course of my career is the positioning, sentiment and technicals. And this has become really, really, really important for your, for defining your entry and exit points, even if you are a long-term investor because the markets move really quickly and you need to be really thoughtful about how you enter and exit. So I pay attention to flows, hedge fund, mutual fund positioning, introduction of new instruments, you know, a million things we kind of look at at our dashboard. And then this is the one I was saying the pillar off to the side valuation is a nice to know, but it is not a driving force of my investment process. And people might kind of cringe when I say that, you 00:29:40 [Speaker Changed] Know, know what, let me jump in here and, and I won’t explore that ’cause I don’t disagree with any of that. People kind of forget that bull markets that run 10, 20 years, valuations tend to start on the lower end and they tend to end on the higher end. But if you decide, oh, we’re above the average valuation of the past cycle, you’re missing a lot of upside, aren’t you? 00:30:06 [Speaker Changed] Ton of upside. Well there’s also this assumption that that underpins this view on valuations. That there is some sort of mean reversion, right? 00:30:13 [Speaker Changed] Tomorrow we’re gonna snap at, look at the cape is my favorite example of that. Yeah, the Schiller cyclically adjusted PE ratio. You would’ve been out like 90% since 1990. A hundred. Yeah. If you followed that, it’s, it’s kind of wild. 00:30:26 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, for sure. You would absolutely have not taken advantage of an incredible run in equities. Like, just to make this point and underscore it, I say evaluation is a starting point for your investment decision, what you’re screening for and entry and exit points. You would never own US tech and you would be long Russia, you know, and anyone who wants to take that trade, God bless, but you’ll be out of business, right? 00:30:50 [Speaker Changed] Russia’s been cheap, but some stocks are cheap for a reason. 00:30:54 [Speaker Changed] They are European banks cheap for reason. And we know that kind of over the medium term, this I’ll define as kind of three years, you know, stocks can stay quote unquote expensive or the way I like to say it be valued at a higher end of the market range because they are superior businesses and they can stay at those levels for multiple years, sometimes much longer and continue to rerate and stuff can look like it’s a discount to the rest of the market, but be structurally impaired and therefore deserve the discount. The other problem I have when people do these kind of like mean reversion, you know, valuation trades as they say like, oh we need to go back to some historical period where s and p was at 14 times, right? Why? I mean the market composition from a sector perspective completely different. The balance sheets of these companies completely different. The cash profiles and free cash generation of these companies completely different. The regulatory environment, the politics, the behavior, the market technicals, I can go on and on and on. It is literally the laziest piece of analysis I have ever seen. 00:32:04 [Speaker Changed] When when you look at last century companies like US Steel or even General Motors, you know, the expression was men in material, they need tons of capital giant factories today, two people with a laptop and Amazon web servers. You could, you could do as much business as any startup from any decade previously. 00:32:27 [Speaker Changed] Totally. I mean another example I like to use, like near and dear to our hearts in terms of the investment landscape is, you know, how many analysts do I really need to cover all different sorts of sectors? You know? And it, there was a time where I needed everyone to be an expert in a different industry or a different sector and to be very siloed and and deeply specialized. But right now I can be in a meeting sitting across the table from A CEO or CFO and they may be talking about a business that I only know 50% about, right? And I, in real time, I can use my AI tools, I can pull up what their competitors have said in recent earnings calls or you know, in the social media, I can look up terminology, I can pull up data. I am a hundred times more informed. I don’t need to be briefed for three hours from an analyst before I walk into that meeting. You know, just by understanding the types of questions to ask and having this data at my fingertips, I’m a faster and better investor. 00:33:25 [Speaker Changed] So here’s the challenge, and we could talk about AI as a theme in a little bit, but the challenge is you’ve gone through that whole process over the past 10, 20 years where you’ve, you know, done the reps put in the heavy lifting. Yeah. How is the next generation going to become the Kate Moore in 25 years if they don’t get to go through that process? And AI seems to, the phrase I heard recently was removing the bottom rung on the career ladder. Is this, is this a genuine concern? 00:33:59 [Speaker Changed] It is somewhat of a concern and I think it’s more of a concern for, for kids who are going through school and are incredibly specialized about what they’re studying. And this is kind of a flag frankly, I would say to people, you don’t wanna just take courses in one discipline. Your job as an undergrad. And I would also argue even in grad school, even in MBA program, is to learn how to think and learn how to ask questions to get exposed to as many different disciplines as possible. So I tell like young folks, like you gotta study philosophy, you should also study things like art history because there’s context behind it. You should study things like you know, hard sciences because you know, it gives you a discipline in terms of the way that you’re thinking you should take a music theory class. I mean do all of this. You want your brain to be flexible and compliant. You want to be able to approach the problem by using these tools in unique ways. And people who are only point and shoot, only have one specific way of approaching an investment problem are often wrong. 00:35:04 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really, really interesting. So you were brought to Citi specifically to focus on the wealth business there. What’s your strategy for breathing life into that space? 00:35:18 [Speaker Changed] So I think there are a couple things. We have a lot of amazing raw material at at Citi in terms of human capital and of course our clients. But thinking about how to invest in a different way than perhaps my other wealth competitors invest is, is one of the greatest challenges and opportunities. And here’s what I will say, you know, I want to examine the way that we’re approaching discretionary multi-asset class asset allocation products, right? Just to sort of set it and forget it. Here’s your stock bonds cash, I’m not sure is gonna be the right path moving forward. I mean, we want to think about what is the right combination of both asset class and factor exposures for, for clients in different risk profiles and how do we implement in, in an interesting way in that space. So it’s not just like, hey we have a, you know, large cap stock fund or, and we have a, you know, mid, mid duration bond fund and this is what we’re kind kind of combining together. This is really about, you know, what are the best expressions of each of those things? How much of it should be beta? How much of it should be alpha seeking? Whether it’s you know, sector specific or thematic. What is the best implementation in alternatives? And particularly as we get more liquid alternatives available, you know, that sort of diversification in a portfolio is going to be kind of democratized and we’re gonna see more and more of our clients across risk spectrum be able to access that. So, 00:36:51 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about the opportunities in the wealth business. What’s driving the growth here? Is it just the amount of capital that’s sloshing around? How big are demographics, the move towards alternatives? There’s so many different cross currents going on that make that space so attractive. What do you see as the key drivers? 00:37:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, there’s a bunch of different drivers, Barry. I’d say, you know, first of all there’s been an enormous amount of wealth created. We know over the last, you know, 10 years, it’s longer than that. But let’s just say in the last 10 years 00:37:23 [Speaker Changed] Post-financial crisis. 00:37:24 [Speaker Changed] Post-financial crisis, great 15 00:37:25 [Speaker Changed] Year run. 00:37:26 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And big concentrations of wealth and frankly a lot of very wealthy families have held a lot of these, this wealth in cash, you know, or in cash equivalents or have reinvested in their business. I think there’s now an understanding that they wanna diversify. So the investment opportunity set for all this wealth creation is huge. I’d say there’s another trend, and I’m sure people have talked about this before with you, which is like the transfer of wealth that’s gonna happen from the b the boomer generation to my generation, and then ultimately to our, you know, younger generation. And the values and the interests on the investing side change from generation to generation. You know, the types of risk clients wanna take, the types of like bespoke opportunities and private stuff that they wanna do. Maybe it’s around, you know, environmental social governance stuff. Maybe it’s around specific geographies, mission aligned. I mean I think that the flavor of investing is changing, which also makes us super exciting. And then finally I would say can, you know, the, the breadth of investment instruments that are available to individual investors and into wealthy families is actually really exciting because you can do cooler things than just a 60 40 portfolio, which was kind of the way wealth businesses ran in the past. 00:38:46 [Speaker Changed] Hmm. So you had mentioned the role of behavioral finance in some of your education and background. You were at University of Chicago, which has become a hotbed of behavioral finance. Dick Thaler. Yeah. He’s recipient of the Nobel. Tell us how you think about behavioral economics in your day job. How do you help clients steer through some of this year as a perfect example, a lot of volatility, a lot of sterman, drang, and here we are above where we were before liberation day. How do you guide people through that? 00:39:21 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, this is such a tough one, Barry, because you know, this is where understanding kind of the positioning, the technicals and the biases really differentiate a good investor from maybe a less good investor. One of the things I try and pay close attention to are all of these sentiment indicators and like, you know, the dashboard for sentiment indicators continues to change, right? Sometimes we look at, you know, historic filings, but we know that mutual funds and hedge funds change their positions really quickly. Sometimes we look at the volume and the flow. I like to pay attention to more kind of third party and, you know, coincident things like what, what’s being discussed in different social media or on different message boards or whatever. And to just try and understand what’s capturing the attention and energy from different client segments. But I also pay really close attention to frankly, how the market responds to different types of news. And that gives you a good sense. You gotta have your finger on that pulse. You know, I, I learned this from someone named Ben Hunt, who you may be familiar with. Of course, 00:40:32 [Speaker Changed] You’re right. Epsilon theory. 00:40:33 [Speaker Changed] Epsilon theory. So I learned this from Ben years ago, but he said, you know, number one, the first order to getting things right is like having a good forecast, right? Let’s just say you have a forecast for stock earnings. The second order is to understand what consensus thinks, right? And comparing your number against that, right? But to get it really right in the market, you need to understand what consensus thinks. Consensus thinks 00:40:59 [Speaker Changed] It’s a Kane’s beauty contest. 00:41:02 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. And, but, but kind of instilling that in my team is really important because it’s like, great, I’m so glad you think we’re gonna have $263 of s and p earnings this year. If consensus actually thinks it’s 2 67, we should know that too. But if the printed number is 2 67 but everyone’s just dragging their feet on cutting the numbers and they’re actually at 2 55, that makes a difference in terms of how people take risk and respond to different news. And so, you know, kind of, of putting all these pieces together, doing the work, understanding what like written or published consensus is and then getting all these kind of sentiment inputs to really evaluate what is the whisper real number versus what’s published. 00:41:46 [Speaker Changed] So let me push back slightly on sentiment ’cause I want to get your take on this. So my experience generally has been most day-to-day sentiment is kind of noisy and it really matters when it hits an extreme. At least that’s a trader’s perspective. But the thing I really wanna push back on has been the University of Michigan. Yeah. Consumer sentiment data, which over the past couple of years it’s been worse than the financial crisis, worse than the beginning of the pandemic, worse than the the 2001 September 11th attacks or the.com implosion worse than the 87 crash. How do we figure out what’s going on in sentiment where it seems to have just detached from consumer behavior, Hey, everything is terrible, but we’re going out and spending totally, 00:42:38 [Speaker Changed] We’re still going out to restaurants even though we think the world is ending, right? Yeah, no, you’re absolutely right. So any single sentiment indicator or survey needs to be discounted, right? We need to come combine all these things and look at it kind of on a moving average of a number of prints. Another one that kind of flagged for me was the conference board confidence, which hit the lowest levels from like September of 2011, you know, last month. And that was a crazy number, right? Because it, September of 2011, we had just gone through this debt fiasco. We were going to Operation Twist, you know, there was like 00:43:11 [Speaker Changed] Post flash crash, it had gotten even crazy. 00:43:14 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. So, you know, that, that seemed really disconnected from reality. So sometimes you have to discount all of these things, but your point is well taken. There has been a generalized sentiment deterioration. Another one I look at is the, what is now the Richmond Fed, but historically had been the Duke Fuqua CFO survey. And you’ve seen over the past couple years this massive decoupling between expectations for own company over the next six months where the CFOs are going, like things are pretty good actually. And expectations for the economy where they’re like, the economy’s in trouble. 00:43:46 [Speaker Changed] It’s so funny you bring that up ’cause well first I had Tom barking and not too long ago, but second, we see that everywhere my congressman’s okay, but the rest of Congress thinks totally my financial circumstances seem to be pretty good, but we think the economy is going lower. Like that exact sort of sentiment split. What do you imagine is driving people to think, Hey, things aren’t that bad for me, but everywhere else it stinks. 00:44:14 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I, hmm, this is tough one, but I, I honestly think the news flow, how media portrays recent events, the echo chamber on social media, the fact that people are not getting a broad based view. Do you see all these, you know, traditional news programs now that are trying to dedicate one night a week or whatever the heck it is to the good news, right? They’re 00:44:36 [Speaker Changed] Is that true? That’s, 00:44:37 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. It’s like, that’s funny. There’s a, there’s a, a local channel I’ve watched that it will do one good story after they’ve just reported a bunch of like murders and you know, everything for the previous 25 minutes. The last story is like, they’re trying to leave you on a positive note, huh? I’m mean like, okay, but the skew is definitely really negative. 00:44:55 [Speaker Changed] If it, if it bleeds it leads, that’s always been the news thing. Yeah. 00:44:58 [Speaker Changed] Really, really fascinating. But now people are consuming more of that 00:45:01 [Speaker Changed] And so I think, I think you’re definitely onto something. But 00:45:04 [Speaker Changed] So we, yeah, we do maybe need to z score the sentiment right now, let’s just put it that way. We, we have to adjust for this declining overall sentiment. But when I’m talking about sentiment, I also like, I’m trying to infer sentiment from price reactions to different news, right? And that might be a better gauge in some of these surveys where people can say, you know, the sky is falling but then just book a carnival cruise, right? Like, you know the, and you know, if a stock puts up pretty good numbers in terms of earnings but doesn’t beat by huge margin and falls 15%, you can tell that like people are at the edge, right? And so, you know, you have to kind of correct your own equity exposure for that type of behavior, huh. But your point’s well taken on you mish and on, you know, all of these other surveys, there’s been a generalized decline. We have to correct for that. 00:45:52 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really interesting. So let’s talk a little bit about today’s market environment. 2025 has been kind of a volatile wacky year. What, what’s your current macro view on the global economy? What’s going on in markets? The fed yield inflation, tariffs, it all seems to be kind of tumbling together at once. 00:46:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I have to say 2025 has been a tough year for anyone and it’s also been a tough year candidly for me to start a new job. I like to say that every time I start a new job there’s some big volatility event. This one might be the biggest and frankly totally self-induced as opposed to some kind of exogenous or external shock. So it’s been really difficult to navigate through this market and yet, you know, there are some things we can still anchor to paying attention to what companies are saying about their businesses. This kind of sort of sentiment stuff we were talking about a moment ago. Looking at the long-term trends, this all leads us to say like okay, we can still be invested. But I am deeply worried Barry about what’s gonna happen to the economy over the summer and and into the beginning of 2026. 00:47:05 We know that companies have been operating more or less BAU business as usual despite all of the shocks on headlines around tariffs and consumers, you know, may have pulled forward some demand, but they’re also kind of operating BAU for the most part. There’s not been a significant change. And yet we know that the introduction of these tariffs and the risk aversion that’s a result of these tariffs and changes in policy and changes in expectations for global supply chains is going to lead to some weakness and activity. The thing I just wanna point out is like going into the end of 2024, in the beginning of 25, I was also like a little worried frankly that the economy was slowing not catastrophically, not recession style, but there were enough cracks across the consumer and enough indications from companies to basically suggest like this was not gonna be an accelerating year even before these policy shocks. 00:48:01 And now I think despite some adjustments, you know, immediately after the tariff announcements, companies don’t have an incentive to do a bunch of different things. And that is engage in real CapEx, they’ll spend what they need to to stay in business or to maintain or things that are absolutely necessary, but they’re gonna prioritize expansionary CapEx and acquisitions I think are off the table. Number two on the labor market. We’ve heard a lot of people talk about it being frozen. Yes there’s still some hiring, but when you look at kind of the composition of the hiring, it’s not as exciting as it might have otherwise been in a, you know, policy, you risk free economy and I think companies have an incentive to kind of keep their labor force where it is without really expanding. ’cause they don’t know if that’s gonna make sense for margins and stuff going forward. 00:48:51 And then the third thing I would say is, you know, companies need to ask themselves what should my supply chain, what should my corporate relationships look like over the course of, you know, the next couple years? Because the truth of the matter is if they have to realign ’em, it will be a significant cost. It will take a ton of time and take a ton of energy. And yet if there might be a policy shift either at the midterms or under a new administration, the incentive to make these multi-year investments as low. So I get this sort of paralysis that’s playing out in terms of the market in, in terms of corporate behavior. And so I’m a little, I wouldn’t say worried about a recession, but concerned about much slower activity in the second half of the year. 00:49:35 [Speaker Changed] So that raises so many different issues. We keep hearing from CFOs, CEOs about the lack of clarity. If you don’t know what the policy’s gonna be, how do you relocate manufacturing plan a headquarter? How do you plan to do any sort of expansionary hiring? So I’m completely with you that hey, this seems to be this self-inflicted wound that’s preventing the economy from accelerating and yet despite all that the economy seems to be incredibly resilient and not taking too big of a hit from all of these on again off again tariffs. Does that just mean that this administration inherited a really robust economy? 00:50:23 [Speaker Changed] Yes, and I think there’s another element to it. I do think this administration, you know, inherited a resilient economy. One that was perhaps underappreciated over the last couple years because not everyone was feeling that resilience in the same way or wealth creation wasn’t as broad as some would’ve liked. Okay. But I think there’s another element to this too, and this goes a little bit into kind of corporate behavior and how investors react to corporate decisions. Which is, you know, if a company pulls back prematurely, let’s say they shed a bunch of workforce or they cut a lot of CapEx and they really hunker down for a bad economic environment and that doesn’t actually show up for multiple quarters and they la 00:51:08 [Speaker Changed] Kinda like the past few years. Yeah. Everybody forecasting recessions that never came 00:51:12 [Speaker Changed] And they lag their peer group and they look weak relative to the rest of the industry. Wow. That, that makes people lose confidence in that management team. Hmm. So there’s almost an incentive for management teams to maybe have contingency plans to talk about that with their board and the rest of their leadership, but not necessarily communicate that with the investment community and keep operating with only a tiny bit of defensive action because there’s gonna be a penalty on their stock price and frankly in the confidence people have in the management team, if it looks like they’re being too emotional and reactionary. 00:51:48 [Speaker Changed] This sounds like the game theory work you did at UFC Yeah is coming into the 00:51:52 [Speaker Changed] Before a a hundred percent that that it plays a huge part in the way I think about this. So you know, no company has an incentive to talk about how concerned they actually are publicly because the first one that does it will be penalized. 00:52:05 [Speaker Changed] Huh. That’s interesting. And, and since you work at a giant bank, we’ve seen bank earnings that are pretty strong across the board. Yeah. That’s kind of unexpected. Tell us a little bit about what does that mean in light of this environment? Relatively high rates really just more normalized than what we’ve seen in the prior two decades. What’s going on in the banking sector? 00:52:31 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, well I can talk a little bit about Citi because we’ve had some pretty awesome operating performance and there are a couple things really driving that. Of course, you know, there’s been a real focus in terms of cost and expense. This is not just Citi, this is across the board at major financial institutions and frankly investment investors really love this. They want to see that discipline continue. Number two, like the mix shift has actually contributed to earnings. And I think as you well know, you know, wealth has been a huge driver for many of the diversified financial services companies. I expect it con will continue and I’m looking forward to wealth being an even bigger driver for Citi over the next couple years. And then I think there’s a, you know, another element too, which is that the speed and sort of the, the facility that management has in toggling between different types of business for different parts of the cycle has significantly improved relative to how people think about banks 15 years ago. So we were talking about valuations earlier and you know, financial services and kind of banks more specifically kind of dragged down overall market multiples when they were a huge part of the market cap for the US large cap indices in the past. 00:53:39 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about soft data. It’s kind of been negative when we’re talking about sentiment and things like that. This really hasn’t translated into the hard data yet. Tell us what you’re looking at in that space. 00:53:54 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, of course. I mean, I’m shaking my head as you say that ’cause it’s absolutely right. The soft data into hard data in a normal period, you know, gets translated in in over inconsistent time period. So there’s not like a map that says like, hey, the soft data does x and then three quarters later or one month later it translates into something in the market or some other hard data and economic activity. So it’s always a bit of an art interpreting the soft data into the hard data. And yet it’s really important to, to pay attention because it may impact the marginal decision. Right now the soft data has went from catastrophic post the April 2nd to tariff announcements to really awful, to maybe a hair better, but still pretty bummed out. And as we’ve talked about, the economic data has stayed somewhat resilient. That doesn’t mean that the economic data will never show weakness. And again, I’m expecting some soft pockets throughout the second half of the year. Not recessionary, but kind of like sub 2% sub one point half percent growth. I think we should buckle down for, and that’s where I expect more durable earning stories. Secular growth stories will outperform the rest of the market. 00:55:06 [Speaker Changed] So it sounds like there are a couple of catalysts in the pipeline and you’re just waiting to see which direction the majority of these go. Tell us a little bit about what you see is upside and downsized. 00:55:18 [Speaker Changed] Catalysts. Okay. So around tariffs, any given day that we’d be having this discussion, there would be, there’s a new set of news. One thing I do know is that we have a series of deadlines over the course of the summer where people are hoping for some level of resolution. And the way I say talk about this, Barry, is this, is that we may be past peak tar of shock, but we are nowhere close to peak tariff pain. We don’t really know how bad it’s going to be quite yet. And this is why of course companies have been reluctant to significantly change their guidance and their earnings revision ratios have looked, you know, better than some people expected. Here’s what I will say. Even if the reciprocal tariffs don’t hold up and they end up going to the Supreme Court and that’s a decision, the sectoral tariffs which take longer to implement are much stickier and frankly have much long larger. 00:56:09 [Speaker Changed] When you say sectoral like North America Canon? 00:56:12 [Speaker Changed] No, like semis. 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] Oh, okay. Gotcha. Pharma, 00:56:16 [Speaker Changed] Copper, steel, all of these sectoral tariffs are much stickier and have much greater potential impact than the country to country bilateral reciprocal tariffs. 00:56:28 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s so interesting you mentioned that someone was from a biomedical device company was having a conversation with me. It’s like I don’t understand an iPhone is exempt from China tariffs, but the pacemakers we make that save people’s lives are not, and if we have to relocate this to wherever, to Taiwan, to Vietnam, to Canada, right? The FDA process starts over and it’ll be eight years. So for about half a decade or so, as the the Chinese manufacturer at pacemakers sell off, but before the new ones come online, there’s not gonna be enough pacemakers 00:57:07 [Speaker Changed] Right there. We have a real risk of some of these important raw materials and these important consumer goods and these important medical goods, you know, not being adequately supplied. And so we have to really watch this. So I, so I will say this, that the tariff side is not gonna be resolved over the course of the summer and because it’s gonna bleed out for longer, we may have slower growth, but not catastrophic. But eventually we’ll have some really big sectoral consumer and business impacts. 00:57:36 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really interesting. You mentioned some of the news stories and how things are affecting sentiment. How do you see the role of narratives driving market responses? It seems like there are different stories for different asset classes every other week. 00:57:54 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. The narrative changes. It sometimes it feels like on 30 minute increments, it, you know, it used to be you’d have a couple weeks of a narrative taking hold. I know many people think about this, but the market can really only focus on one thing at a time, one major narrative at a time. You know, and that’s where you end up seeing the bulk of the price movement. For example, is it around tariffs? Is it around inflation data? Is it around fed expectations? Is it around the technology conflict between the US and China? Is it around some geopolitical shock? You know, it’s, but it’s not gonna be all of those things at once, even though I would argue all of those things are happening concurrently. And I think the market has become even more short attention span if we can, you know, personify it here. And as a result, the narratives are shifting very quickly. This is why it’s really important to, when you’re thinking about portfolio construction, to anchor on the right asset class and factor exposures, to layer it with more sort of medium term thematic alpha generating ideas and then offer some ballast to the portfolio, either in less correlated assets or in expressions of the asset class or factor that that has a different duration. So, 00:59:07 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk about some of the quote unquote less correlated asset classes. There has been a giant move into alternatives, most especially private credit, private equity. What do you see in that space? How is that evolving over the next five to 10 years? 00:59:25 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, let me answer that second part first. I think the evolution of this, this broad bucket of alternatives is gonna be towards more liquid expressions. 00:59:34 [Speaker Changed] More liquid, yes. 00:59:36 [Speaker Changed] Or at least more vehicles that allow for individual investors and, you know, family offices and things like that to invest in these types of vehicles. Right? You don’t have to set it and forget it for like 10 years. I think there’s gonna be a lot of demand just as we’ve seen say traditional mutual fund transfer into ETFs, active ETFs, but be more kind of combined vehicles. The challenge I think is that there’s been so much money, and we know this, we’ve got great data on this chasing this like a small number of deals. And it has become so popular to think about alternatives as an asset class that the returns that some of these strategies have been able to achieve in the past, I think are much more challenged in the future. 01:00:21 [Speaker Changed] Ha Haven’t we seen that in sort of venture capital land? Absolutely. Back in the absolutely the eighties and nineties VC numbers were spectacular. And post.com implosion. Yeah. Not only you have more companies staying private for longer, it just seems like a ton of low hanging fruit were picked, you know, decades ago. Yeah. 01:00:39 [Speaker Changed] The narrative is like 85% of US companies are actually still private. And so it’s really important to have all these vehicles to access them on the equity on the credit side. I hear that. But there’s certain major differences. Of course, if you’re a private company, you may continue to need different types of funding. You don’t have to disclose to your shareholders on a regular basis, of course, that you don’t have to deal with the, the stock price fluctuation and, and all of that, what that might mean for your employees who are paid and, and shares. But it also creates a complicated environment where when you don’t have to disclose, when you don’t have to report, you know, you may make a different set of decisions. Some of that might be good for the long term and some of it may be just like a poor allocation of capital. ’cause no one’s calling you out on it because the capital’s already locked in. So it’s, I would say this 85% of companies that are still private, that the alternative managers are exciting about, about giving you exposure to not all of them are the same quality as the, you know, publicly available, you know, large cap, mega cap companies. 01:01:46 [Speaker Changed] Makes a lot of sense. I want to get to my favorite questions. Okay. But before I do that, I gotta throw you at least one curve ball. You are on the resource council for the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. Yeah. Tell us about that. Does 01:01:59 [Speaker Changed] That sound random to you, 01:02:00 [Speaker Changed] Barry? Yeah, it sounds totally ra I know you’re a former ski bum. I am. So maybe there’s some relationship with that. Yeah, I 01:02:08 [Speaker Changed] Actually split my time between New York City and Jackson Hole. So I spent a lot of time in the Jackson community. I’m super passionate about the conservation and nature programs at Grand Teton National Park. And I’ve been on the Resource council now for about three years. It is a kind of sub-board of the, of the board of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation. And we do some really amazing things. One of the things I’m most passionate about are some of these wildlife programs and the money that we raise specifically for research that benefits some of the biologists in the park and also that, you know, all of the visitors to the park can take advantage of. My favorite thing to do every summer, Barry is the Wolf Watch, which we do some, some days during August, we’ll go up with a biologist to this bluff and we will watch a, a pack that lives in Grand Teton National Park and learn all about wolf habitats behaviors and changes in their patterns. 01:03:04 [Speaker Changed] So, so this is part of the National Park system, but yet there’s a private foundation that helps raise assets and manage resources for the park. Tell us a little bit about that 01:03:15 [Speaker Changed] Structure. Yeah, actually, almost all the national parks have friends groups. And this Grant Teton National Park Foundation is the friends group for Grand Teton National Park. We are a very large and successful one and we’ve really helped to partner with the park on everything from like visitor centers to, you know, accessible options to the, to rivers, to redoing the trail system, to sponsoring some of the biologists, et cetera. The park is run by the park, but the superintendent and the CEO Grant Teton National Park Foundation are close partners. And I like to think, yeah, we’re the best friends group out there. 01:03:47 [Speaker Changed] Huh, really, really quite fascinating. Let’s jump to our favorite questions ’cause I only, I know I only have you for a few more moments. We’ll, we’ll make this our speed round. Starting with what’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you watching or listening to? 01:04:03 [Speaker Changed] Okay, so I don’t watch television at all very infrequently. 01:04:07 [Speaker Changed] No Netflix, no prime, no Apple tv, none of that. 01:04:10 [Speaker Changed] It’s not really my jam. Wow, 01:04:12 [Speaker Changed] That’s really 01:04:13 [Speaker Changed] Interesting. Yeah, it’s not really my jam. I do watch like things, sometimes a news magazine or whatever, but for the most part I’m just an avid reader and I like to spend my time when I’m not working, reading, playing sports, listening to music, and I’m an amateur artist, so I’ve been watching screens after being in front of screens all day long is unappealing to me. 01:04:35 [Speaker Changed] Can I tell you that sounds shockingly healthy. 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I try to be shockingly healthy. I also try to put my devices down and be focused on other things because I get enough screen time during the day. 01:04:46 [Speaker Changed] I, I totally get it. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 01:04:52 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know that I had a lot of official mentors. I will tell you, I had more peer mentors, if that makes sense. You know, growing up in the business, I, I was often the only woman in the room, or the only woman on the investment committee. And I built really strong peer relationships with other investors of similar levels around the street. And there are a lot of people who’ve helped to influence my way of thinking or have challenged me. But yeah, I mean, I try and be a mentor to as many, especially young women as I can in the business since I didn’t have that available to me at the time. But I wish I had a long list of mentors, but I would say it’s, it’s more my peer group that I’ve really linked arms with and grown with that I think of as kind of playing that role for me in my career. 01:05:37 [Speaker Changed] Huh, interesting. So you mentioned you read a lot. Let’s talk about books. Yeah. What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:05:44 [Speaker Changed] Okay. I’m a giant sci-fi in fantasy nerd. 01:05:47 [Speaker Changed] Oh boy. Were you talking to the right person? 01:05:49 [Speaker Changed] I mean, so on this theme of not watching screens after I work, I like to really escape, like deep in escape after a long day of staring at numbers and analyzing, you know, economics. So here’s what I will say. I am in an amazing series right now, the Murder Bot series by Martha Wells. I know it’s been made into a series. I will not watch it because it will ruin the entire vision. 01:06:15 [Speaker Changed] It’s on Apple tv. It’s gotten mixed reviews so far. Yeah, so far. But I have that in my queue, the first murder box. 01:06:22 [Speaker Changed] Oh, it’s so good. It’s amazing. And you know, thinking about this intersection between bots and AI and the future, and there’s a lot of inner dialogue in there that I don’t think will translate well into a series. But anyway, neither here nor there. So I love to read that before I, I’m on book six now. Before I started that I read the latest from Town of French, which is called the Searcher and, and that and the Hunters two books together, it takes place in Ireland. She’s one of my favorite contemporary fiction authors. It’s like, these are mysteries. And so I love that. And yeah, I pretty much gobble up anything that will make it onto the Hugo or Nebula shortlist. Right. And try and geek out as much as possible. 01:07:05 [Speaker Changed] I had no idea you were a geek. Any non-fiction that that crosses your transom? 01:07:10 [Speaker Changed] Well, the one that’s really kind of stood out to me, and it was recommended by a former colleague of mine from BlackRock is 4,000 weeks. 01:07:17 [Speaker Changed] So good. 01:07:18 [Speaker Changed] So good. And as someone who’s tried to optimize my life many times in the past, but have had a couple he health setbacks and things like that, this was a great reminder that getting through the to to-do list is not the goal. 01:07:31 [Speaker Changed] Right. Oliver, Oliver Burke, something like that. 01:07:34 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. 01:07:34 [Speaker Changed] The, the line that I remember from that book was 4,000 weeks is about 80 years is human lifespan. Yeah. Human life is insultingly brief. Yes. And that phrase just stood out. 01:07:48 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. And this idea that we are all, every day approaching our death is actually empowering. Yes. Instead of discouraging. If you know that you don’t have infant time, you make better decisions. Frankly, 01:08:02 [Speaker Changed] Scarcity is an important economic thesis. 01:08:05 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. But you cut out the stuff that’s not important and you focus on the things and the people and the experiences that are, and anyway, I love this book. 01:08:15 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, no, I totally agree. Final two questions. Yeah. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career of, normally I would say whatever the person’s specific specialty is, but you’ve done so much across consulting and strategy and buy side and sell side and hedge funds and portfolio management, and now chief investment strategy. Someone interested in just finance or wealth management. 01:08:44 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I would say the most important thing is to keep an open mind. One of the most frustrating things, you know, young graduates and even young graduates from business school or or other graduate programs, is that they have like a path in mind. You know, in three or five years I expect to be here in 10 years. And I say keep an open mind because there’s so much disruption and so much change across these industries. You can’t have a mapped out plan. Your goal is to be a sponge and to learn and learn and learn, and also to be patient. Honestly, Barry, I’d say this a lot because you know, you get some like really smart 23, 24, 20 8-year-old who you know, wants to find out what’s over the next hill. And I wanna remind them, you know, if the actuarial tables are even somewhat right, they have 70 more years of life ahead of them. I think that’s right. And they don’t need to rush. They can enjoy the moment of learning, enjoy the experience, and understanding that not just, they’ll have the opportunity to pivot. They’ll have the mandate to pivot. As you know, industries get disrupted and technology evolves. Huh. 01:09:43 [Speaker Changed] Fascinating. And our final question. Yeah. What is it that you know about the world of investing today? You wish you knew 25, 30 years ago when you were first getting started? 01:09:54 [Speaker Changed] I thought there was a more systematic way to approach investing when I first started, you know, close to three decades ago. And now I understand that true investing is both art and science. Maybe that’s the reason why I think I’ll stay in this business for the rest of my life because I’m constantly intellectually challenged to not get frustrated if a model doesn’t work out. In fact, sometimes the process of going through creating a model or a piece of analysis or going down a rabbit hole in research that doesn’t yield anything this year may actually be really helpful for me in three years, or help to reframe my thought process. So understanding that it’s not perfect and that it’s art and science. 01:10:33 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting. Thanks Kate for being so generous with your time.

Title: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum’s smart-contract platform has crossed a major line. According to data shared by Token Terminal on X, the total value of tokenized assets on Ethereum now tops $6 billion. That figure covers products from asset managers, fund houses and blockchain firms. It proves institutions are treating on‑chain finance as more than a tech demo. BlackRock leads the pack. The world’s largest asset manager holds the biggest share of tokenized AUM on Ethereum. Close behind are Franklin Templeton, WisdomTree, Superstate, Apollo and Ondo Finance. Franklin Templeton focused on parts of its US Government Money Fund. WisdomTree launched funds you can buy through a mobile app. Superstate and Apollo each add smaller but steady sums. Based on reports, these six names together make up most of the $6 billion milestone.

Adoption started slowly around mid‑2023. It rose further in early 2024. Then by January 2025, the line on the stacked chart shot straight up. That jump comes as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton pour in fresh tokens. Faster trades and fewer middlemen are big draws. Trades that once took days can now settle in minutes or seconds. That kind of speed appeals to big investors, who want clarity and a clear audit trail. This push into tokenized finance shows a shift in how big firms manage money. Ethereum still faces questions about scaling. If gas fees jump again, trading costs could rise sharply. Regulators in the US, Europe and Asia have yet to set clear rules. A clampdown in one region might push firms toward other chains or private blockchains. Competition from Solana, Avalanche and new networks is already heating up. With $6 billion on‑chain, tokenized assets are past the trial stage. More firms will likely join once rules firm up and scaling solutions roll out. Markets could see new fund types, cross‑border trades and on‑chain yield tools. For now, Ethereum holds the lead. Yet the next hurdles—fee pressure, rule making and rival chains—will test whether it can keep growing. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Government approves establishment of commission of inquiry into historic sexual abuse in schools
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/07/08/government-approves-establishment-of-commission-of-inquiry-into-historic-sexual-abuse-in-schools/
Time Published: 2025-07-08T12:17:32Z
Full Content:
The Government will “pursue all levers available” to compel the religious orders to pay redress to victims of historic sex abuse in schools, the Minister for Education Helen McEntee has stated. A commission of inquiry into allegations of historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools has been established by the Government with a time frame to report within five years. Speaking after the commission was approved by the Cabinet, Ms McEntee said any redress due to the victims arising out of the commission should be paid for by the religious orders. The compensation will be a “measure of accountability” for what happened to victims. This will include looking at changes to the statute of limitations on civil claims and changes to the status of unincorporated associations, as well as looking at the assets that religious orders have. An examination of how to get compensation from religious orders will run in parallel with the commission of investigation. The Attorney General Rossa Fanning and his office has been involved in drawing up proposals to pursue the religious orders for money. Successive governments have had little success in pursuing religious orders for compensation. A deal made in 2002 that capped contributions from the religious orders at €128 million – less than 10 per cent of the eventual compensation liability – was widely criticised. The religious orders fell short of the 50:50 split in relation to the 2009 Ryan Report and only two religious orders out of eight offered redress to survivors of mother and baby homes. On foot of that failure, the Minister for Children Norma Foley asked the Attorney General to examine ways that might lead to the sequestration of assets or the seizing or freezing of bank accounts of religious orders. When asked how the Government plans to improve on collecting money from the religious orders, she said: “There is more work that needs to be done to find out exactly what is owned and is in the possession of the religious orders or institutions. “It is clear that any redress scheme approved by Government will have to be funded by these religious organisations.” Under the terms of reference of the report, which were published on Tuesday, Mr Justice Michael MacGrath must report within five years – and write to the Minister for Education within two years, updating her as to the likelihood of meeting that target. The commission will begin its work in October and Ms McEntee said the cost of it is likely to “run into tens of millions of euro”. [ Schools sexual abuse inquiry: It was open season on children’s bodies. These men did what they likedOpens in new window ] Labour has brought forward a Bill that would remove legal obstacles to the Government forcing the religious orders to pay redress. “These orders cannot be allowed to hide behind trusts and legal mechanisms to avoid accountability,” Labour leader Ivana Bacik said. “This legislation provides a clear and immediate pathway to justice, and Government should support its passage without delay . . . Survivors have waited long enough.” Abuse survivors’ support organisation One in Four said it welcomed Tuesday’s news. Chief executive Deirdre Kenny said the commission’s scale “reflects the thousands of lives affected and the deep impact on families and communities for generations”. However, the group said it is “concerned that the issue of redress will be further delayed. While we appreciate this is complex, survivors have shown immense resilience and patience; therefore, we are concerned about any further delay. Delays disadvantage survivors and may allow institutions to avoid accountability and responsibility.” Last September, the then government formally agreed to establish a statutory inquiry into the sexual abuse of children at day and boarding schools, following recommendations in the 700-page scoping inquiry report, led by Mary O’Toole SC. The report disclosed 2,395 allegations of sexual abuse at 308 schools run by religious congregations, involving 884 alleged abusers. A high number of allegations were concentrated in special education schools, where 590 allegations were recorded in 17 institutions involving 190 alleged abusers. [ ‘Their childhood stopped the day the abuse started’: Almost 2,400 allegations of abuse in religious run-schoolsOpens in new window ] The inquiry was set up following revelations of widespread sexual abuse of boys at Willow Park and Blackrock College in south Co Dublin. It followed the broadcast of RTÉ radio documentary Blackrock Boys in November 2022 and the launch that month also of a restorative justice programme involving abuse survivors and the Spiritan congregation, which runs the schools. There will be a sampling approach used – whereby cases will be chosen that have sufficient witnesses and documentary evidence available to allow the commission to fulfil its functions. An initial survey will be undertaken to identify the potential number of survivors.

Title: The Democratization Of Wall Street: AI Trading For All
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/douglaslaney/2025/07/08/the-democratization-of-wall-street-ai-trading-for-all/
Time Published: 2025-07-08T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByDouglas B. Laney ByDouglas B. Laney, Contributor. AI and man superimposed looking at a stock chart It’s 1988, and somewhere in New York, a young financial analyst named Larry Fink is nursing a bruised ego and a $100 million loss. That catastrophic trade at First Boston would haunt him, but also sparked an obsession that would quietly reshape global finance. Fink's solution was to build a sophisticated AI system to prevent such disasters. He called it Aladdin. Fast-forward nearly four decades, and that same system now manages over $20 trillion in assets, roughly 7% of the world's financial wealth. BlackRock's Aladdin has become the invisible hand guiding institutional investment decisions worldwide. Today, BlackRock expects the AI boom to continue boosting U.S. stocks throughout the year, despite concerns about debt and global uncertainty clouding the outlook. The firm is betting big on AI-driven market rallies, and now individual investors can finally join that bet with tools that were unattainable, if entirely unimaginable, just a decade ago. Today, however, AI-driven approaches are finally reaching retail traders and testing Wall Street's hegemony. Some entrepreneurs saw this democratization coming years before others. TechBerry, a Germany-based trading company, began developing AI-driven trading models in 2014, launching commercially in 2015 just as the enterprise AI revolution was in its infancy. Its concept and timing both proved prescient. While institutional giants were tuning their systems for trillion-dollar portfolios, TechBerry's founders saw gaping market whitespace for individual investors. "Our biggest challenge was assembling a top-tier team of experts to build a unique AI model back in 2014, when the industry was just emerging," said Techberry CEO, Bruno Baily. "We had to do it with limited personal investment since investors showed little interest in our startup back then. Quite a contrast to the attention we receive today." As early movers in this space, they demonstrated that AI trading could be effective at scale beyond institutional walls. While institutions focused on managing trillions of pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, an enormous underserved market of individual traders was left wanting for similar sets of tools. Unlike the perfunctory AI solutions that many fintech companies were peddling (basically repackaged algorithms with flashy interfaces), TechBerry invested in building what it claims is the world’s largest dataset of historical trades. Its platform now counts over 110,000 active traders, creating network effects that improve performance for everyone involved. This trader dataset creates genuine competitive moats in ways that traditional Wall Street firms struggle to replicate. Techberry CEO, Bruno Bailey Two years after TechBerry launched, Larry Fink saw the writing on the wall. "We have to change the ecosystem. That means relying more on big data, artificial intelligence, factors, and models within quant and traditional investment strategies," he declared to The New York Times in 2017. He doubled down: "BlackRock must bet big on the power of machines, be it Aladdin, the firm's risk management platform, robo-advisers, big data, and artificial intelligence." Fink wasn't just describing BlackRock's future. He was validating what TechBerry had already understood: AI would fundamentally rewire investment management. But while TechBerry was building for individual traders, the institutional world had been operating with this advantage for decades. Aladdin's Monte Carlo simulations can stress-test portfolios against a range of scenarios, from government collapses to global pandemics. For the longest time, this kind of technological firepower remained locked away in institutional vaults. During the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, while retail investors scrambled with basic tools and gut instincts, big corporations and government agencies had Aladdin whispering market secrets in their ears. The exclusivity wasn't accidental. Building these systems required the kind of capital and expertise that only the largest financial institutions could muster. The barriers to entry seemed insurmountable for anyone operating outside the institutional ecosystem. What sets TechBerry apart from the typical Silicon Valley AI narrative is its European perspective on technology and regulation. Operating from Germany within the EU's strict financial services framework while serving a global user base, they've built compliance into their DNA rather than treating it as an afterthought. This regulatory-first approach has paid dividends in credibility. TechBerry's performance has been verified by independent third-party auditing services, including FXAudit and Myfxtools, which have shown verified monthly returns of 11%. This transparency was virtually unheard of in retail AI trading just a few years ago. For decades, retail traders have been burned by systems that worked boffo in backtests but crumbled under real market conditions. Thankfully, third-party auditing provided the kind of institutional-grade accountability that retail trading has desperately needed. Democratization genuinely levels the playing field. TechBerry's approach shows how real-time information from a broad base of investors can create entirely new competitive advantages, rather than simply copying institutional playbooks. Its expansive trader network generates fresh data continuously, potentially offering insights that even established institutions might lack. While systems like Aladdin excel at institutional portfolio management, platforms like TechBerry can tap into the collective intelligence of thousands of individual traders putting their own money on the line. That's a fundamentally different and potentially equally valuable dataset. Instead of top-down institutional wisdom, you get bottom-up market intelligence from people with skin in the game. The trend toward sophisticated trading algorithms becoming accessible to individual investors shows no signs of slowing. TechBerry plans to expand its AI model into cryptocurrency trading, potentially bringing institutional-grade analysis to one of the most volatile and retail-dominated markets. Their goal of growing its trader base to 200,000 suggests confidence that AI democratization can scale without compromising performance. The broader implications are staggering. If AI trading becomes truly democratized, will it level the playing field or simply create new advantages for early adopters? The evidence so far suggests both outcomes are possible, but companies like TechBerry are proving that individual investors no longer need to accept second-class citizenship in the world of algorithmic trading. What seems certain is that the exclusive club of AI-powered trading is rapidly expanding. The same sophisticated analysis that once required institutional resources is becoming available to anyone with internet access and modest capital. When a European AI-driven startup can deliver serious returns through democratized data and analytics, it signals that the barriers may be crumbling faster than anticipated. As Larry Fink predicted back in 2017, the ecosystem is evolving rapidly. While BlackRock continues to bet on AI-driven market growth, individual investors can place similar bets using similar tools. The question isn’t whether AI will transform trading for individual investors, it’s how quickly they’ll adapt to this new ascendancy.

The joint venture between Jio Financial Services, backed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and BlackRock, enters India's 72.2 trillion rupee ($844 billion) funds market with a business structure that threatens to shake up the sector, as it leverages its large digital network to bypass traditional distributors used by the rest of the industry. Jio BlackRock plans to leverage Jio, India's largest telecom network, and BlackRock's investment management platform Aladdin, to offer differentiated products in the crowded market, two of the three sources said. The asset manager has applied to the market regulator to launch eight funds, the two sources said, adding to the first three funds it launched last month. The funds will allow for investments as low as 500 rupees ($5.83), the two sources said. The asset manager said on Monday that it has raised more than $2.1 billion across three debt mutual fund schemes and that 90 institutional investors and 67,000 retail investors have invested in these funds so far. On average, the cost associated across plans will be lower for Jio BlackRock funds compared with the industry average, one of the sources said, declining to specify a level. "By being direct only, Jio BlackRock plans to do away with the cost of distribution," this person added. Jio BlackRock declined to comment on Reuters' inquiries regarding its fund launches and pricing strategy, which have not been previously reported. At present, active funds offered through distribution on an average have a total expense ratio of about 1.78%. They can charge a maximum 2.5% of the investment amount. Direct funds generally reduce costs by 0.5% to 0.6%. Jio BlackRock intends to bypass the dominant channel of distributors, offering funds directly to institutional and retail investors, the sources said. That will reduce fee or expense ratios associated with the funds, they said. Ambani's Jio has been known to disrupt markets with its pricing and reach. Jio, India's largest telecom carrier by subscriber count, launched in 2016, became the largest by offering mobile phones and voice and data packages at well below prices prevailing in the industry. Jio BlackRock will use the distribution reach of its partner and target the existing 8 million active users of financial services on its digital platforms such as MyJio and Jio Finance, a second source familiar with the matter said. BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager at $11.6 trillion as of December 2024, is known for its passive funds, which track established indexes. It manages $7.8 trillion through exchange traded and index funds. However, Jio BlackRock plans to offer a mix of active and passive funds in India, where active funds still dominate. "Passive funds are growing in India every year and there is a potential for BlackRock to further build this segment," said the first source. Passive funds accounted for 12.11 trillion rupees, or 16.78% of total assets in India as of May, marking a 25% growth from a year earlier. The fund house plans to leverage Aladdin, an investment and risk management system, to deliver consistent returns, said the first source. Aladdin is an end-to-end investment management system that collates all analytics in one place to enable portfolio managers to take investment calls. "Relevant portions of Aladdin will be made available to Jio BlackRock's investors as well," the first source said. ($1 = 85.3730 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Jayshree P.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds 700,000 bitcoin BTC$109,291.21, according to Glassnode data, and has amassed $76 billion in assets under management in just 18 months, outstripping both the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which tracks the U.S. equity benchmark, and iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap U.S. stocks. The figures beats the 600,000 BTC held by Strategy (MSTR), which started purchases in 2020, and compares with Fidelity FBTC's 203,000 BTC and Grayscale GBTC's 184,000 BTC. “New milestone, iShares Bitcoin ETF now holds over 700,000 BTC. 700,000 Did this in 18 months. Ridiculous,” Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, commented in a post on X. The U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) debuted in January 2024 and have become the most successful ETF introductions of all time. Since inception, they have attracted $50 billion in net inflows. IBIT is now the third highest revenue-generating ETF for BlackRock across all its ETF products. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that BlackRock operates a total of 1,197 funds.

Set in the former O’Brien’s Pub building, which was subsequently home to The Chop House, this is now a serious diningroom with a long counter for walk-ins and a smaller room at the back. The menu sticks to local and seasonal produce – seafood chowder, deep-fried calamari, pan-fried halibut with leek and mussel sauce, duck leg confit with spring onion champ and buttered carrots. There’s also an 18-seat garden terrace – uncovered, unheated, and fully weather dependent. Corinna Hardgrave When the sun is shining there is no better place to be than outdoors at Fisk with a selection of their original seafood dishes lined up in front of you and a cold drink in hand. Think gochujang glazed trout, buttery brioche roll stuffed with prawn cocktail or spicy Bloody Mary topped with oyster and shrimp. It turns out that chef Tony Davidson is also rather handy with Mexican food too, so dig in. Joanne Cronin A Green Egg barbecue runs hot here, chargrilling vegetables such as asparagus for brunch, served under a heated 80-seat yurt-style tent. Rose O’Toole (formerly of Misunderstood Heron, Aimsir) runs the kitchen, serving up Irish crab and smoked black pudding benedict, Doyle’s sausage brunch burger and house-made sourdough with romesco. The wood-fired oven slow-cooks meats for sandwiches and will fire up again for Grangecon Kitchen pizzas on summer weekends. Sunday pop-ups offer a set menu (€45-€55) built around local produce. CH It’s a bit of a drive to Helen’s Bar, but the reward is a table outside overlooking Kenmare Bay – boats bobbing below, mountains stacked behind. The menu keeps it simple: bowls of mussels, plates of crab claws, fresh fish pulled from the bay and straight on to the plate. Good value, easy-going service and seafood that repays the detour in full. CH Lobster grilled with garlic butter and chips sets the tone here, backed by wild Irish fish and chips, mussels with cream, garlic and white wine and crab claws caught aboard the Atlantic Freedom, served swimming in garlic butter. There’s also wild Irish smoked ling – “smokies” – baked with crème fraîche. A heated terrace with a permanent roof and three beach huts makes outdoor eating possible whatever the weather. CH In Clifden’s former post office, Michael and Hannah Nagle serve a seafood menu that gets straight to the point. Fish and chips (€21), half lobster and chips (€28), mussels with sourdough (€15), and crab claws (€16) are the backbone, while daily specials like mackerel with apple and cucumber (€12) keep things fresh. The live-fire konro grill adds a smoky edge, and outdoor seating with heaters and blankets makes it a great spot, rain or shine. Larger groups can book a two-set menu (€30-€65). CH Diarmuid Ó Mathúna runs one of the best daytime spots around – breakfast, brunch and lunch built on proper seasonal produce. The taco with deep-fried Ros an Mhíl haddock, Aran Islands crab salad with Velvet Cloud yoghurt, and the toastie with Feeney’s pulled bacon collar are all worth the trip. Outside, there’s now a 40-seat garden, half covered, backed by 22 solar panels. They even make their own condiments, from honey mustard mayo to berry compote. CH Casual by day with small plates and sandwiches, more focused at night, William Browne’s Blackrock spot has James Strathern (ex-Dede, Orwell Road, Roe Wines) in the kitchen. There’s a short a la carte and a six-course tasting menu at €64. Cod and nduja arancini, red mullet crudo, wild garlic gnocchi and sausage and ricotta ravioli keep it tight. A sea-view heated deck with 12 uncovered seats makes the most of the setting. DJ nights and summer events are planned. CH Keith Coleman – formerly of Roots, Fumbally and Fia – is behind some of the best casual food in Dublin. The evening menu runs Thursday to Saturday: roast Iona Farm carrots with labneh and chermoula, cauliflower with smoky cashew sauce, free-range chicken thigh with tzatziki and hot honey. The sheltered 42-seat garden, planted and properly thought through, is one of the best places in the city to sit and eat when the weather behaves. A new bakery and test kitchen are on the way later this year. CH In a restored 1820s coach house, Ciaran Kiely (ex-Oliveto) is cooking over a bespoke ember pit, working with Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach and Higgins butchers. The menu runs from Sheelagh’s beetroot with St Tola’s goat’s cheese to Kilmore Quay monkfish, pork belly, and a Wagyu cheeseburger that means business. Outside, a 40-seat terrace – half covered, marble tables, wood stove and heaters – makes outdoor eating worth a gamble. Thursday nights run a two- or three-course neighbourhood menu.

Title: Revenue veto ‘caps use of Scarp small business rescue scheme’
URL: https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/revenue-veto-caps-use-of-scarp-small-business-rescue-scheme/a955052136.html

Expert warns the potential opt-out stops some firms using the project Dessie Morrow, of Azets Ireland. Photo: Brian Claffey An effective veto the Revenue Commissioners have over allowing debtors to use the small company administrative rescue process (Scarp) is weighing on wider adoption of the scheme, despite increasing signs of distress on firms, according to Dessie Morrow, a specialist in company rescues. The latest Scarp Index from accountancy firm Azets, where Mr Morrow is a partner, shows construction, hospitality and alcohol producing sectors accounted for the highest proportion of businesses using the scheme so far this year. It also shows a 15pc increase in the number of businesses being restructured using the Scarp, compared to the first half last year, an increase that is consistent with higher numbers of insolvencies and other forms of distress. The latest index shows a total of 100 business have now used the Scarp process since scheme launched in 2021. Mr Morrow says 1,314 jobs have saved thanks to use of the rescue process. Scarp was introduced following lengthy consultation with industry as an alternative to the more expensive and lengthy examinership regime. The idea is to provide a simplified restructuring mechanism for viable small companies facing financial distress, with only a relatively light court involvement. A Scarp process is initiated by companies themselves and can begin without any court approval being required, helping to slash overall costs. The first step is the appointment of a specialist adviser – generally an accountant specialising in insolvency who must then notify creditors the process is under way and they have 50 days to come up with a rescue plan acceptable to the various affected parties. Including a 21-day cooling-off period, the process must be concluded within 70 days. Creditors who stand to lose under a rescue deal can object. Crucially however, state agencies including Revenue and the Department of Social Protection, can opt out of a Scarp arrangement, meaning even if a deal is done with other creditors and landlords, for example, a business may be left with what is regards as unsustainable tax debts including warehoused Covid era liabilities. Mr Morrow says Revenue has in practice been willing to engage with rescue efforts, but the risk it will not row in behind a scheme is a disincentive to businesses operators from attempting to restructure. “The Revenue opt out does deter businesses,” he said. It is one of a number of issues identified by Azets following an analysis of the 100 Scarp cases. It is calling for the existing Revenue opt-out at the start of the process to be removed. It also argues the short time frame of the process can create resource constraints in particular for micro companies where an individual may be responsible for a number of areas within the business – everything from staffing the counter to bookkeeping. The proposed solution is to bring the process to a pre-populated form-filling stage as a first phase. Meanwhile, the Scarp Index for the first half of the year shows 15 processes have started to date in 2025: hospitality (20pc) accounted for the highest proportion of cases, followed by the construction (13pc) and alcohol producing (13pc) sectors, an indicator that uncertainty around trade tariffs may already be impacting the export orientated boutique spirits sector. Among the businesses to have successfully undergone Scarp with the support of Azets advisers this year are Big Mike’s Restaurant in Blackrock and New Century Engineering.

Title: EU regulators probing Robinhood’s tokenized equity plans after OpenAI raises concerns

OpenAI's disavowal prompts EU inquiry into Robinhood's compliance on tokenized equity plans. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Robinhood’s private equity tokens, offering exposure to tech stocks like SpaceX and OpenAI, have triggered regulatory scrutiny in Europe after OpenAI raised concerns and said that the digital assets do not represent equity ownership in the company, CNBC reported on July 7. The Bank of Lithuania, which serves as Robinhood’s primary regulator in the European Union, confirmed it is seeking detailed clarifications before assessing the products’ legality. A spokesperson for the central bank told CNBC: “Only after receiving and evaluating this information will we be able to assess the legality and compliance of these specific instruments.” The controversy centers on Robinhood’s recent announcement of an expansion into tokenized securities, including plans to issue over 200 tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs for European investors. The brokerage announced plans to launch its private equity tokens and a new layer-2 blockchain on June 30, positioning itself as a major player in the rapidly growing tokenization sector. However, OpenAI has distanced itself from the tokens, warning investors that Robinhood’s so-called OpenAI tokens do not provide any equity stake or direct ownership rights in the company. The scrutiny comes as financial institutions ramp up efforts to capture a slice of the tokenization market, which is valued at over $24 billion as of June 30. Although tokenized private credit and U.S. Treasury debt currently dominate the sector, accounting for the majority of value, tokenized equities remain a small but potentially fast-growing segment, with just $188 million in current market share. Major players such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have also entered the tokenization space, issuing tokenized money market funds and exploring blockchain-based settlements to improve efficiency and transparency. However, despite the optimism, legal and regulatory uncertainties remain significant. Regulators and lawyers continue to debate whether tokenized equity instruments require full securities registration or if derivative-like structures are sufficient to meet compliance standards in Europe and the U.S. For Robinhood, the regulatory probe in Lithuania could set an important precedent as the brokerage seeks to roll out its tokenization framework globally. Its recent presentation at the EthCC conference in Brussels outlined plans to tokenize a wide range of financial instruments, but the backlash highlights the fine line between innovation and investor protection in the fast-evolving digital asset market.

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy At CRED iQ, our mission is to provide commercial real estate professionals with the data and insights needed to navigate an ever-evolving market. This week, our research team took a deep dive into loan delinquency trends, expanding our lens from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) to the present day. By focusing on FDIC-insured commercial banking and savings institutions, which includes community banks, we’ve uncovered critical patterns in CRE loan performance, offering a clearer perspective on today’s marketplace. Two key segments and what they tell us Our analysis spans from March 2007 to March 2025, shifting focus from securitized and agency markets to FDIC-insured institutions. We examined two key segments: multifamily properties and “core” CRE, which includes office, retail, hotel, industrial, self-storage and other property types. This approach builds on our earlier research, providing a comprehensive view of delinquency trends and their implications for the CRE industry. Key findings from Q1 2025 Our analysis revealed several trends in loan performance: • Core CRE lending growth slows: The long-term average annual growth rate for core CRE lending balances is 4.55 percent. The first quarter of 2025, however, saw an annualized growth rate of just 1.22 percent, the lowest since 2012, signaling a cautious lending environment. • Core CRE delinquencies rise: Total delinquencies across core property types reached $31.4 billion in Q1 2025, equating to a 1.7 percent overall delinquency rate. Of this, $25.1 billion are loans 90-plus days delinquent, while $6.3 billion are 30 to 89 days delinquent. • Net losses decline for core CRE: Net losses in the core sector totaled $3.9 billion in Q1 2025, down from $5.9 billion in the prior quarter, suggesting some stabilization. • Multifamily losses peak: Multifamily properties reported net losses of $767 million in Q1 2025, the highest quarterly total since 2012, highlighting growing challenges in this sector. Comparing March 2020 to March 2025 To contextualize recent trends, we compared delinquency metrics from March 2020 to March 2025: • Multifamily delinquencies surge: Delinquent loan balances in the multifamily sector grew from $1.5 billion (0.3 percent delinquency rate) in 2020 to $9.4 billion (1.5 percent) in 2025. Loans 90-plus days delinquent increased dramatically, from $560 million to $6.71 billion. • Core CRE delinquencies double: Delinquent loan balances in the core segment rose from $15.4 billion (1 percent) in 2020 to $31.4 billion (1.7 percent) in 2025, with 90-plus day delinquencies climbing from $9.7 billion to $25.1 billion. These shifts underscore the increasing pressures on CRE loan performance, particularly in the multifamily sector, where rising delinquencies and losses signal heightened risk.

Title: BlackRock Set to Acquire Real Estate Investment Firm With $7.3B in Assets

Time Published: 2025-07-07T20:21:58Z

© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Multinational investment firm BlackRock is making big moves in the asset management business. BlackRock has entered an agreement to acquire ElmTree Funds, a real estate investment firm focusing on single-tenant, built-to-suit commercial properties with $7.3 billion in assets under management, according to a Monday announcement. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to provide the acquisition price for the ElmTree deal, but the announcement said payment for the purchase will be primarily in stock, with the potential of “additional consideration” depending on ElmTree’s performance over the next five years. The transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of this year. ElmTree has investments in 122 properties across 31 U.S. states. Once the deal closes, the firm will be integrated into BlackRock’s Private Financing Solutions (PFS) platform, the announcement said. BlackRock created PFS through its $12 billion purchase of credit firm HPS Investment Partners last year, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news. The platform has “broad capabilities across senior and junior credit solutions, asset-based finance, real estate, private placements and CLOs,” according to a December release. “Structural shifts in the real estate sector are creating new opportunities for private capital,” Scott Kapnick, chairman of PFS’s executive office and CEO of HPS, said in a statement. “The combination of a premier triple-net investor with our leading private financing solutions platform will position us to capture these opportunities for our clients,” Kapnick added. “ElmTree has the team, expertise and relationships that will help drive growth and deliver differentiated investment solutions.” Founded in 2011, ElmTree has six offices across the U.S. in St. Louis, New York City, Chicago, Austin, Phoenix and Newport Beach, Calif., according to its website. As part of the acquisition, ElmTree will position PFS to scale its real estate offering, expand into new markets as an owner-operator, and accelerate its long-term growth, according to the release. In addition, the platform will be “positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns with favorable structures” and offer clients the “long-term, stable income investment solutions they seek for their portfolios,” the release said. “Our specialized bricks-and-mortar expertise will be augmented by HPS’s ability to provide financing and other solutions that fuel the corporations and developers driving the economy forward,” said ElmTree CEO and founder James Koman, who will continue to lead ElmTree’s investment strategies as part of the new deal. “By joining HPS and BlackRock, we are better positioned to meet market demand and serve our partners by growing alongside them for the long term,” Koman added. The deal also comes as part of BlackRock’s larger acquisition spree, after purchasing both HPS and Global Infrastructure Partners last year, Bloomberg reported. Also last year, BlackRock expanded its current 1 million-square-foot New York City headquarters at Related Companies’ 50 Hudson Yards by more than 50,000 square feet, as Commercial Observer previously reported.

NEXT | The Queue: Far from home The Collector’s Bounty buff is currently active in World of Warcraft until July 29 at 8AM pacific time that boosts the drop rates of rare mounts and transmogs from all raids and dungeons in legacy WoW content, aka, everything before Dragonflight. Mount drop rates have been increased by up to 10 times, and in one specific (yet unknown) case, 25 times, and the transmog drop rates have been doubled. While all of the raids have transmog rewards, only some of them reward mounts and other rare items, like the Warglaives of Azzinoth which are also affected by this buff. You still have to run the correct version of the activity to get the rare items but fortunately most of the legacy raid content can be done solo you still have to run the correct version of the raid to get the rare items. To access the LFR difficulty, you have to speak to certain NPCs in order to get in. For raids on any of the other difficulties (Normal, Heroic, Mythic), choose the version you want by right-clicking your character’s profile picture under “Raid Difficulty” and then entering the raid at its location on the map. The raid section of the adventure guide has a “Show on Map” feature that will point you to where you need to go but we’ve also got you covered on where to find these raids if you haven’t run them in awhile, or if you’ve never run them before.

Title: Chris Hedges: Profiting From Genocide
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/chris-hedges-profiting-from-genocide/
Time Published: 2025-07-07T20:00:00Z
Full Content:
Editor Activism Chris Hedges, ScheerPost War is a business. So is genocide. The latest report submitted by Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories, lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc., Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institue of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as Blackrock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. The report, which includes a database of over 1,000 corporate entities that collaborate with Israel, demands these firms and institutions sever ties with Israel or be held accountable for complicity in war crimes. It describes “Israel’s “forever-occuption” as “the ideal testing ground for arms manufacturers and Big Tech – providing significant supply and demand, little oversight, and zero accountability – while investors and private and public institutions profit freely.” The post-Holocaust industrialists’ trials and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission laid the legal framework for recognizing the criminal responsibility of institutions and businesses that participate in international crimes. This new report makes clear that decisions made by the International Court of Justice place an obligation on entities “to not engage and/or to withdraw totally and unconditionally from any associated dealings, and to ensure that any engagement with Palestinians enables their self-determination.” “The genocide in Gaza has not stopped because it’s lucrative, it’s profitable for far too many,” Albanese told me. “It’s a business. There are corporate entities, including from Palestine-friendly states, who have for decades made businesses and made profits out of the economy of the occupation. Israel has always exploited Palestinian land, resources and Palestinian life. The profits have continued and even increased as the economy of the occupation transformed into an economy of genocide.” In addition, she said, Palestinians have provided “boundless training fields to test the technologies, test weapons, to test surveillance techniques that now are being used against people everywhere from the Global South to the Global North.” You can see my interview with Albanese here. The report lambasts corporations for “providing Israel with the weapons and machinery required to destroy homes, schools, hospitals, places of leisure and worship, livelihoods and productive assets, such as olive groves and orchards.” The Palestinian territory, the report notes, is a “captive market” because of Israeli-imposed restrictions on trade and investment, tree planting, fishing and water for colonies. Corporations have profiteered from this “captive market” by “exploiting Palestinian labour and resources, degrading and diverting natural resources, building and powering colonies and selling and marketing derived goods and services in Israel, the occupied Palestinian territory and globally.” “Israel gains from this exploitation, while it costs the Palestinian economy at least 35 per cent of its GDP,” the report notes. Banks, asset management firms, pension funds and insurers have “channeled finance into the illegal occupation,” the report charges. In addition, “universities — centres of intellectual growth and power — have sustained the political ideology underpinning the colonization of Palestinian land, developed weaponry and overlooked or even endorsed systemic violence, while global research collaborations have obscured Palestinian erasure behind a veil of academic neutrality.” Surveillance and incarceration technologies have “evolved into tools for indiscriminate targeting of the Palestinian population,” the report notes. “Heavy machinery previously used for house demolitions, infrastructure destruction and resource seizure in the West Bank have been repurposed to obliterate the urban landscape of Gaza, preventing displaced populations from returning and reconstituting as a community.” The military assault on the Palestinians has also “provided testing grounds for cutting-edge military capabilities: air defense platforms, drones, targeting tools powered by artificial intelligence and even the F-35 programme led by the United States of America. These technologies are then marketed as ‘battle proven.’” Since 2020, Israel has been the eighth largest arms exporter in the world. Its two biggest weapons companies are Elbit Systems Ltd and the state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries Ltd (IAI). It has a series of international partnerships with foreign weapons firms, including “for the F-35 fighter jet, led by United States-based Lockheed Martin.” “Components and parts constructed globally contribute to the Israeli F-35 fleet, which Israel customizes and maintains in partnership with Lockheed Martin and domestic companies.” the report reads. Since October 2023, F-35s and F-16s jets have been “integral to equipping Israel with the unprecedented aerial power to drop an estimated 85,000 tons of bombs, much of it unguided, to kill and injure more than 179,411 Palestinians and obliterate Gaza.” “Drones, hexacopters and quadcopters have also been omnipresent killing machines in the skies of Gaza,” the report reads. “Drones largely developed and supplied by Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries have long flown alongside fighter jets, surveilling Palestinians and delivering target intelligence. In the past two decades, with support from these companies and collaborations with institutions such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, drones used by Israel acquired automated weapons systems and the ability to fly in swarm formation.” Japan’s FANUC companies sell automation products and “provide robotic machinery for weapons production lines, including for IAI, Elbit Systems and Lockheed Martin.” “Shipping companies such as the Danish A.P. Moller — Maersk A/S transport components, parts, weapons and raw materials, sustaining a steady flow of United States-supplied military equipment post-October 2023.” There was a “65 per cent surge in Israeli military spending from 2023 to 2024 – amounting to $46.5 billion, one of the highest per capita worldwide.” This “generated a sharp surge in their annual profits,” while “Foreign arms companies, especially producers of munitions and ordnance, also profit.” At the same time, tech companies have profited from the genocide by “providing dual-use infrastructure to integrate mass data collection and surveillance, while profiting from the unique testing ground for military technology offered by the occupied Palestinian territory.” They enhance “carceral and surveillance services, from closed-circuit television (CCTV) networks, biometric surveillance, advanced tech checkpoint networks, ‘smart walls’ and drone surveillance, to cloud computing, artificial intelligence and data analytics supporting on-the-ground military personnel.” “Israeli tech firms often grow out of military infrastructure and strategy,” the report reads, “as the NSO Group, founded by ex-Unit 8200 members, did. Its Pegasus spyware, designed for covert smartphone surveillance, has been used against Palestinian activists and licensed globally to target leaders, journalists and human rights defenders. Exported under the Defense Export Control Law, NSO group surveillance technology enables ‘spyware diplomacy’ while reinforcing State impunity.” IBM, whose technology facilitated Nazi Germany’s generation and tabulation of punched cards for national census data, military logistics, ghetto statistics, train traffic management and concentration camp capacity, is once again a partner in this current genocide. It has operated in Israel since 1972. It provides training for Israeli military and intelligence agencies, especially Unit 8200, which is responsible for clandestine operations, the collection of signal intelligence and code decryption, along with counterintelligence, cyberwarfare, military intelligence and surveillance. “Since 2019, IBM Israel has operated and upgraded the central database of the Population and Immigration Authority, enabling collection, storage and governmental use of biometric data on Palestinians, and supporting the discriminatory permit regime of Israel,” the report notes. Microsoft, active in Israel since 1989, is “embedded in the prison service, police, universities and schools — including in colonies. Microsoft has been integrating its systems and civilian tech across the Israeli military since 2003, while acquiring Israeli cybersecurity and surveillance start-ups.” “As Israeli apartheid, military and population-control systems generate increasing volumes of data, its reliance on cloud storage and computing has grown,” the report reads. “In 2021, Israel awarded Alphabet Inc. (Google) and Amazon.com, Inc. a $1.2 billion contract (Project Nimbus) — largely funded through Ministry of Defense expenditure — to provide core tech infrastructure.” Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., and Amazon “grant Israel virtually government-wide access to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing, decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities.” The Israeli military, the report points out, “has developed artificial intelligence systems such as‘Lavender,’ ‘Gospel’ and ‘Where’s Daddy?’ to process data and generate lists of targets, reshaping modern warfare and illustrating the dual-use nature of artificial intelligence.” There are “reasonable grounds,” the report reads, to believe that Palantir Technology Inc., which has a long relationship with Israel, “has provided automatic predictive policing technology, core defence infrastructure for rapid and scaled-up construction and deployment of military software, and its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which allows real-time battlefield data integration for automated decision-making.” Palantir’s CEO in April 2025 responded to accusations that Palantir kills Palestinians in Gaza by saying, “mostly terrorists, that’s true.” “Civilian technologies have long served as dual-use tools of settler-colonial occupation,” the report reads. “Israeli military operations rely heavily on equipment from leading global manufacturers to ‘unground’ Palestinians from their land, demolishing homes, public buildings, farmland, roads and other vital infrastructure. Since October 2023, this machinery has been integral to damaging and destroying 70 per cent of structures and 81 per cent of cropland in Gaza.” Caterpillar Inc. has for decades provided the Israeli military with equipment used to demolish Palestinian homes, mosques, hospitals as well as “burying alive wounded Palestinians,” and killed activists, such as Rachel Corrie. “Israel has evolved Caterpillar’s D9 bulldozer into automated, remote-commanded core weaponry of the Israeli military, deployed in almost every military activity since 2000, clearing incursion lines, ‘neutralizing’ the territory and killing Palestinians,” the report reads. This year, Caterpillar “secured a further multi-millionaire dollar contract with Israel.” “The Korean HD Hyundai and its partially-owned subsidiary, Doosan, alongside the Swedish Volvo Group and other major heavy machinery manufacturers, have long been linked to destruction of Palestinian property, each supplying equipment through exclusively licensed Israeli dealers,” the report reads. “As corporate actors have contributed to the destruction of Palestinian life in the occupied Palestinian territory, they have also helped construction of what replaces it: building colonies and their infrastructure, extracting and trading materials, energy and agricultural products, and bringing visitors to colonies as if to a regular holiday destination.” “More than 371 colonies and illegal outposts have been built, powered and traded with by companies facilitating the replacement by Israel of the Indigenous population in the occupied Palestinian territory,” the report concludes. These building projects have used Caterpillar, HD Hyundai and Volvo excavators and heavy equipment. Hanson Israel, a subsidiary of the German Heidelberg Materials AG, “has contributed to the pillage of millions of tons of dolomite rock from the Nahal Raba quarry on land seized from Palestinian villages in the West Bank.” The quarried dolomite is used to construct Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Foreign firms have also “contributed to developing roads and public transport infrastructure critical to establishing and expanding the colonies, and connecting them to Israel while excluding and segregating Palestinians.” Global real estate companies sell properties in colonial settlements to Israeli and international buyers. These real estate firms include Keller Williams Realty LLC, which has “had branches based in the colonies” through its Israeli franchisee KW Israel. Last year through another franchisee called Home in Israel, Keller Williams “ran a real estate roadshow in Canada and the United States, jointly sponsored with several companies developing and marketing thousands of apartments in colonies.” Rental platforms, including Booking.com and Airbnb, list properties and hotel rooms in illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank. Chinese Bright Dairy & Food is a majority owner of Tnuva, Israel’s largest food conglomerate, which utilizes land seized from Palestinians in the West Bank. In the energy sector, “Chevron Corporation, in consortium with Israeli NewMedEnergy (a subsidiary of the OHCHR database-listed Delek Group), extracts natural gas from the Leviathan and Tamar fields; it paid the Government of Israel $453 million in royalties and taxes in 2023. Chevron’s consortium supplies more than 70 per cent of Israeli energy consumption. Chevron also profits from its part-ownership of the East Mediterranean Gas pipeline, which passes through Palestinian maritime territory, and from gas export sales to Egypt and Jordan.” BP and Chevron also serve as “the largest contributors to Israeli imports of crude oil, as major owners of the strategic Azeri Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and the Kazakh Caspian Pipeline Consortium, respectively, and of their associated oil fields. Each conglomerate effectively supplied 8 per cent of Israeli crude oil between October 2023 and July 2024, supplemented by crude oil shipments from Brazilian oil fields, in which Petrobras holds the largest stakes, and military jet fuel. Oil from these companies supplies two refineries in Israel.” “By supplying Israel with coal, gas, oil and fuel, companies are contributing to civilian infrastructures that Israel uses to entrench permanent annexation and now weaponizes in the destruction of Palestinian life in Gaza,” the report reads. “The same infrastructure that these companies supply resources into has serviced the Israeli military and its energy-intensive tech-driven obliteration of Gaza. ” International banks and financial firms have also sustained the genocide through the purchase of Israeli treasury bonds. “As the main source of finance for the Israeli State budget, treasury bonds have played a critical role in funding the ongoing assault on Gaza,” the report reads. “From 2022 to 2024, the Israeli military budget grew from 4.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent of GDP, driving the public budget into a 6.8 per cent deficit. Israel funded this ballooning budget by increasing its bond issuance, including $8 billion in March 2024 and $5 billion in February 2025, alongside issuances on its domestic new shekel market.” The report notes that some of the world’s largest banks, including BNP Paribas and Barclays, “stepped in to boost market confidence by underwriting these international and domestic treasury bonds, allowing Israel to contain the interest rate premium, despite a credit downgrade. Asset management firms — including Blackrock ($68 million), Vanguard ($546 million) and Allianz’s asset management subsidiary PIMCO ($960 million) — were among at least 400 investors from 36 countries who purchased them.” Faith-based charities have “also become key financial enablers of illegal projects, including in the occupied Palestinian territory, often receiving tax deductions abroad despite strict regulatory charitable frameworks,” the report reads. “The Jewish National Fund (KKL-JNF) and its over 20 affiliates fund settler expansion and military-linked projects,” the report reads. “Since October 2023, platforms such as Israel Gives have enabled tax-deductible crowdfunding in 32 countries for Israeli military units and settlers. The United States-based Christian Friends of Israeli Communities, Dutch Christians for Israel and global affiliates, sent over $12.25 million in 2023 to various projects that support colonies, including some that train extremist settlers.” The report criticizes universities that partner with Israeli universities and institutions. It notes that labs at MIT “conduct weapons and surveillance research funded by the Israeli Ministry of Defense.” These projects include “drone swarm control — a distinct feature of the Israeli assault on Gaza since October 2023 — pursuit algorithms, and underwater surveillance.” You can see my interview with the MIT students who exposed the collaboration between the university Israeli military here. Genocide requires a vast network and billions of dollars to sustain it. Israel could not carry out its mass slaughter of the Palestinians without this ecosystem. These entities, which profit from industrial violence against the Palestinians and mass displacement, are as guilty of genocide as the Israeli militray units decimating the people in Gaza. They too are war criminals, They too must be held accountable. Activism Activism Activism Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: What to know about private equity in your 401(k)

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week BlackRock is making private investments available in employer-sponsored retirement plans Historically, private equity has not been among the investment options available for 401(k) plans. But that could soon change, providing a new opportunity for retirement savers — though also one that may carry substantial risk. In evidence of this potential shift toward private investments, at the end of June, BlackRock, the "world's largest asset manager," announced that it "plans to offer a 401(k) target-date fund with a 5%-to-20% allocation to private investments," said The Wall Street Journal. BlackRock is the "biggest such provider yet to announce that it will make private investments available" in employer-sponsored retirement plans. Still, it "will be up to employers to decide whether they want to add them," said the outlet. Investors, too, should evaluate the opportunity carefully. Private equity is a "form of investment in privately held companies that are not publicly traded on stock exchanges," said SmartAsset, a personal finance blog. Usually, private equity investment is "made through funds pooled from institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals" who are "aiming to acquire ownership stakes in businesses with growth potential." Participation often requires "significant capital" and a certain level of investment knowledge or wealth. Escape your echo chamber.

The potential incorporation of private equity into 401(k) investment options would follow an "increasing push to provide more private capital investment opportunities for retail investors and participants in workplace retirement plans," said CNN Business. Private equity firms "see the $12.2 trillion market for 401(k)-type retirement plans as a way to reach the everyday investors that are crucial to their growth," said the Journal. They also make the case that investors deserve access to these opportunities. According to Jaime Magyera, the co-head of BlackRock's U.S. wealth advisory business, "private assets play an increasingly important role in the global economy," which is "why the company believes it is important to give 401(k) investors access to them," said the outlet. President Trump has also indicated an openness to allowing the shift. In Trump's first term, the Labor Department "issued an information letter to plan fiduciaries, telling them that private equity may be part of a 'prudent investment mix' in a professionally managed asset allocation fund in a 401(k) plan," said CNBC. Private equity investments "would offer more choices and potentially higher returns" for those investing for retirement, but they also have "significant drawbacks," said Investopedia. "These investments typically carry higher risks, charge steeper fees and offer limited liquidity." They are also "less transparent, making them more difficult to assess than traditional retirement investments." Further, evidence of the returns is "mixed," according to "academic and industry studies on it," said CNN Business, citing Jason Kephart, the senior principal for multi-asset strategy ratings at Morningstar. This means there is "no guarantee that you will enjoy meaningfully better returns in your portfolio" in exchange for the downsides.

Title: BlackRock expands real estate holdings, buys ElmTree Funds with $7.3 billion in assets

BlackRock Inc has announced its agreement to acquire ElmTree Funds, a real estate firm which leases custom-built commercial properties to single-tenant renters. The acquisition will add an investor with $7.3 billion in total assets under management to BlackRock’s portfolio. ElmTree will be integrated into Private Financing Solutions, BlackRock’s newly established platform created through the firm’s $12 billion purchase of HPS Investment Partners last year, Bloomberg reported. The payment for ElmTree will primarily be settled in stock, with the potential for additional consideration based on ElmTree’s performance over the next five years. While the purchase price and other financial details aren’t yet disclosed, the transaction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year. The real estate firm was founded in 2011 by James G. Koman who currently also serves as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the firm. ElmTree has offices in various locations, including St. Louis, New York, Chicago, Austin, Phoenix and Newport Beach, California. Other than that, the firm also has investments in 122 properties across the 31 cities of the United States. The deal will allow ElmTree, which is currently focusing on industrial real estate, to expand into new markets as an owner-operator, according to the statement cited by Bloomberg. “Our specialized bricks-and-mortar expertise will be augmented by HPS’s ability to provide financing and other solutions,” James Koman, ElmTree’s founder and CEO, said in the statement. While the ElmTree purchase is considered small compared to the $11.6 trillion in assets that BlackRock oversees in recent times, it deepens CEO Larry Fink’s objective to tap into private markets over the past two years in search of heftier fees. BlackRock has also bought other real estate firms such as HPS and Global Infrastructure Partners as part of its acquisition spree in this particular industry, the news agency reported.
