Title: Vitalik Buterin Reveals the Most Disappointing Moment for Ethereum

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced concerns over criticisms directed at Ethereum’s stance on blockchain-based gaming applications. During a Wednesday AMA session on the chat app Tako, Buterin addressed user Mable Jiang’s inquiry about moments in the past year that left him frustrated or disappointed with the Ethereum Foundation, its community, or the industry. Jiang also asked if he had ever considered taking a break. In response, Buterin expressed his disappointment, particularly over criticisms that Ethereum is “bad and intolerant” for not embracing blockchain-based casinos as openly as other networks. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” He stated. Despite occasional online rants about the network, Buterin, however, noted he finds comfort in personal interactions with the Ethereum community, most of whom remain committed to the platform’s original values. “I have a responsibility to this community and cannot abandon them. We Ethereum need to work together to create the world we want to see,” he added. Buterin also suggested potential strategic shifts to enhance the network, emphasizing the need for structural improvements for the network and greater decentralization within the Ethereum Foundation. He noted that the foundation, which currently facing a backlash for lack of neutrality, might need to be less neutral at the application layer and take a more active role in supporting certain initiatives. “This will require some changes,” he stated, adding, “But this project is worth doing.” Notably, Buterin’s response comes amid an ongoing debate in the blockchain space about balancing ethical considerations with open access. Some networks, like Solana, have taken a more permissive approach, welcoming applications across various sectors, including gambling and speculative ventures. However, this openness has also led to high-profile failures, such as the collapse of LIBRA, a meme coin on the Solana network. Recently, LIBRA collapsed, wiping out $4.5 billion in investor funds and causing a 15% drop in Solana’s value. Ethereum, in contrast, has long positioned itself as a network focused on decentralization, innovation, and long-term sustainability. These qualities have attracted institutional interest, with entities like BlackRock launching tokenized investment funds on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, beyond his frustrations, Buterin remains actively engaged in Ethereum’s evolution, particularly its scalability through Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In January, he reaffirmed Ethereum’s commitment to scaling via L2s, identifying key challenges such as insufficient space for BLOB objects and L2 heterogeneity. He detailed upcoming upgrades, such as the Pectra update, which aims to enhance Ethereum’s transaction throughput with long-term goals, including achieving 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). He also underscored the importance of Ethereum’s economic model, advocating for ETH to serve as a “triple point asset,” functioning as a means of exchange, a consumable product, and a store of value. To strengthen Ethereum’s economic position, he proposed incentivizing L2 projects, optimizing rollup revenue structures, and adjusting BLOB pricing strategies.

Title: Open-Access Networks Explained: A New Way to Get Internet

How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities across the US, but they don’t work like typical internet service providers. It may not be Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. Locating local internet providers An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Locating local internet providers Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Title: The House of Cards of Russian Aggression Against Ukraine Collapses

The news from the New York Times is explosive: “U.S. Opposes Calling Russia Aggressor in G7 Declaration on Invasion”. U.S. opposition to a draft Group of 7 statement on the third anniversary of the Russian attack on Ukraine comes after President Trump blamed Kyiv for starting the war. Trump’s shift towards Putin’s Russia reverses generations of US policy. At the opening of the peace talks in Saudi Arabia, President Trump made it clear that Russia’s days of isolation are over and suggested that Ukraine is to blame for its invasion. Zelensky and Trump exchanged blows as the feud over the peace talks escalated. President Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky an ‘unelected dictator’ after the Ukrainian President said Trump was ‘in a web of disinformation’. “Europe,” writes the Wall Street Journal, “is looking for a response after Trump blamed Kyiv for the war in Ukraine. Stunned by the US rapprochement with Russia over Ukraine, European leaders are trying to find common ground.” . . . Screenshot from WSJ . Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni “reaffirmed Italy’s support for Ukraine”, but prudently did not go to Kyiv to the commemoration of the third anniversary of the war. Vice-President Matteo Salvini is explicitly siding with Trump, wishing that “he will absolutely go ahead”. The parliamentary left-wing declares through Fratoianni “nothing in common with Trump on Ukraine.” However, it is announced that in Kyiv “the EU will reaffirm Zelensky’s legitimacy as president of Ukraine.” Who Zelensky is and what his role is, we documented in Grandangolo of 11 August 2023. We, therefore, report the essential part of it: Scott Ritter’s investigative documentary showing the offshore companies set up by Zelensky and his associates in tax havens, through which “his puppeteers provided him with a financial cushion” with a first payment of 41 million dollars. The film shows the luxurious villas that Zelensky owns in Miami (this one alone is worth $34 million), in Israel, in Forte dei Marmi (Italy), in London, in Georgia, in Greece, and even in Crimea (the only bad investment, because Zelensky no longer owns it). Scott Ritter’s investigation also shows how Ukraine is being robbed of its most fertile land, sold off by Zelensky and Co. to multinational corporations. Still, it is also becoming increasingly indebted as the huge military supplies he receives from the US and the major European powers are not given away, but given on credit. This debt will increase with the ‘reconstruction‘ that Zelensky has put in the hands of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Exclusive — Nate Morris: America Has to Fight Back Against the Climate Change, 'ESG Mafia'

Kentucky businessman and potential Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris on Breitbart News Saturday said that America has to fight back against the environment, social, and governance (ESG) “mafia,” noting how large Wall Street firms push leftist policies on corporations. Morris spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as he considers a potential run for Senate to replace the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). The Kentucky businessman, who founded a waste management company, said that the pressure he received to back ESG policies was like nothing else, noting that the waste management business often has mafia connections, citing the hit television show the Sopranos. “I’ve never seen extortion like what I saw with the ESG mafia and the thugs that try to push corporate America into doing things that satisfy a political agenda,” Morris said on Breitbart News Saturday. ESG was one of the major vectors by which Wall Street firms, namely asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, could push publicly listed companies to back leftist policies such as anti-climate change policies, diversity quotas, among others. Companies, facing a backlash, stopped employing these controversial policies. Morris then said he invested in Strive, a firm backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, that seeks to push anti-ESG policies, and challenge BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. “We got to fight the ESG mafia that has been coming against our corporate leaders as an extension of politics to satisfy the leftist agenda,” he remarked. Morris said that the country needs to expose “ESG for the scam it is.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.

It’s halftime at Twickenham and Scotland lead England 10-7. Thank you for your company today. Ireland win in Cardiff and all roads lead to a meeting with France at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday week. Man of the match Jamison Gibson-Park 🗣 "They're an unbelievable team, a proud nation, they showed that today."🗣 "It would be a dangerous thing to do to come over here with preconceived ideas."Player of the Match Jamison Gibson-Park after Ireland's battling win in Cardiff. #WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/Lgv9nrNqt5 MATCH REPORT: Gerry Thornley has his say. “The home side were, as expected, much improved; beyond recognition in truth. As was always liable to be the case, Matt Sherratt had injected enthusiasm, energy and no little cohesion in his first game in charge. Their set pieces were strong and with a much more balanced 9-10-12-13 combination their attack had variety, shape and width. Ireland’s initially confident and smooth start unravelled in large part through ill-discipline and especially scrum penalties. This was compounded by Garry Ringrose incurring a red card following a bunker review for his 35th-minute high hit on Ben Thomas, and Ireland were relieved and indebted to this being a 20-minute red card, not least as Bundee Aki was an ideal replacement.” You can read the full match report here Scotland lead England 10-7 at Twickenham after 24 minutes. James Lowe produced another brilliant performance. He’s what he had to say about a tough afternoon in Cardiff. One of Ireland's key men yet again this afternoon.Great to chat to James Lowe live from Cardiff.#WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/EM4moAonb0 PLAYER RATINGS: Johnny Watterson gives James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park and Jack Conan 8/10.

There’s lots of things we could have done better. I’m pleased with how we got ourselves out of a hole.” ⌚️ Sam Prendergast slotted the three points for Ireland against Wales to steer his side to a win and a Triple Crown in Cardiff 🙌#Breitling #DefiningMoment @Breitling pic.twitter.com/MvYnOUZPWh Watching the Andrew Porter incident again. No wrap from replacement tighthead prop Thomas his arm in tucked and even though it is chest to shoulder, it is not a legitimate attempt to tackle. Therefore should have been a yellow card. Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are going through the subbing machine and will be available here presently. Simon Easterby, calm and measured in victory. Acknowledged some of the shortcomings, gave credit to Wales, which they deserved and pointed to the fact that his tea showed character to see out a match that got sticky.

Jamie Osborne is there to collect the ball and score!! #GuinnessW6N pic.twitter.com/5Eq7cq0Lz8 Johnny Watterson’s player ratings, lot of red pen you’d suspect, Gerry Thornley’s match report and all the reaction coming here. That’s a 14th Triple Crown for Ireland. MATCH SNYOPSIS: Ireland led 7-0, trailed 13-10 at half-time and 18-10 early in the second half, before Gibson-Park, Lowe and Osborne combined for the latter’s try and then Prendergast’s boot saw them home. Ringrose had a yellow card upgraded to a red card. Ireland win a Triple Crown. Performance was well below par, individually and collectively. To Ireland the spoils, including a Triple Crown but to Wales the plaudits in performance terms. Coming off a 14-match losing streak, that’s now gone to 15, and given very little hope but the home side was so courageous in defeat, playing some cracking attacking rugby to boot. Ireland will be relieved rather than happy. Finlay Bealham, Ryan Baird and Bundee Aki made a huge difference on their arrival. Full-time: Wales 18 Ireland 27 80 mins: Prendergast takes on long range penalty that drops short after Beirne won a ruck penalty. Wales with one last effort in chasing a bonus point. 77 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Great counter-ruck from Ireland led by van der Flier supported by Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle leads to a penalty. Henshaw and Baird with key tackles in the build-up. Prendergast is unerring. Gibson-Park announced as man of the match. No argument. Brilliant again. Conor Murray on at scrumhalf Wales 18 Ireland 27 75 mins: Gus McCarthy on for captain, Sheehan. Brilliant again from Osborne in tidying up. Wales 18 Ireland 24 72 mins: Brilliant response from Wales and Ellis Mee is deemed to have scored a try by referee Ridley. His on-field decision is try. Tempest the TMO is rocking and rolling the angle, I think his hand is in touch. 47 angles later. Knock-on. Hits short and it’s a knock-on. That’s unfortunate for Wales. Another superb passage of play in attack. Ireland are very, very lucky. Good work from Hansen, who’s now been replaced by Jack Crowley and Osborne. Boyle and Bealham win a scrum penalty. Crowley is on at fullback, Osborne moves to the wing. Wales 18 Ireland 24 Jack Boyle becomes the 12th St Michael’s College old boy to be capped at senior level by Ireland; 11 have been in the last decade.

A blood splattered Bundee Aki wins a penalty at a ruck, clamped on after Sheehan’s tackle. Prendergast is going to take it on. It’s two metres inside the Welsh half. The outhalf strikes it superbly. Gibson-Park with a brilliant relieving kick from the re-start. Jack Boyle is on for his debut. Wales 18 Ireland 24 68 mins: Porter is hit in the head by Thomas, referee thinks it’s chest. Ian Tempest agrees. NO further sanction. NO foul play. Wales 18 Ireland 21 64 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Wonderful catch and kick from Lowe. Ryan back on for McCarthy. Gibson-Park with a wonderful sniping break. Hansen denied a try, held up brilliantly by Murray and Morgan. Ireland were on penalty advantage. Hansen might have given Sheehan a scoring pass in hindsight. The Irish hooker and captain asks Prendergast to kick the penalty and the young outhalf bisects the posts. Wales 18 Ireland 21 62 mins: It’s another brilliant counter-attack from Wales who are playing without fear. Width to their attack, first instinct is to offload. Joe Roberts is on for try scorer Tom Rogers. Free-kick Ireland ats scrum, the first after Welsh loosehead Nicky Smith has gone off. Wales 18 Ireland 18 58 mins: Osborne has done superbly in the air for the most part. It’s been a superb post interval response from Easterby’s side. The one caveat is the discipline. 11 penalties now, the latest for a neck roll. Wales 18 Ireland 18 55 mins: TRY OSBORNE. That’s a great reaction from Ireland. On penalty advantage Ireland pack Sheehan, O’Mahony X2, Baird carry and Gibson-Park with a cross-kick with the boot is tapped back brilliantly by Lowe into the waiting arms of Osborne. Prendergast misses the conversion. It’s all tied up. Wales 18 Ireland 18 53 mins: Ireland have conceded nine penalties to date. Fantastic piece of skill from Prendergast, brilliant spiral for a 50/22 after great play from Osborne. Ireland deep inside the Welsh 22. Wales 18 Ireland 13 52 mins: Henry Thomas on for WillGriff John for Wales. McCarthy with a superb play. Ireland scrum. Anscombe off for a HIA. Jarrod Evans is on. No referee changes his mind. Penalty Wales. Wales 18 Ireland 13 50 mins: McCarthy is back on for Ryan having passed his HIA. Wales with some lovely running angles and offloading but Henshaw comes up with a brilliant turnover. Great line kick from Prendergast and Ireland are back up to 15 players, as Aki replaces Ringrose. Wales 18 Ireland 13 47 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Ireland win a scrum penalty inside the Welsh 22, more direct around the fringes, where there is space. Baird involved several times. Finlay Bealham on for Clarkson. Wales 18 Ireland 13 42 mins: ROGERS TRY. Ireland are panicky. Osborne kicks away possession, Sheehan gives away possession and it all ends in a try for TOM ROGERS. Flamboyant finish. Ireland again the architect of their downfall. Anscombe misses the conversion. Conan off with an injury. Ryan Baird, who didn’t expect to play today, is on. Wales 18 Ireland 10 Ireland will have to survive another 10-minutes a man down until Ringrose’s 20-minute red card is played out and they can bring on Bundee Aki. Referee Ridley confirms the red card ruling as the second half gets under way. “High degree of danger and no mitigation.” James Ryan is on for McCarthy (HIA) Okay, how to unpack that. Ireland conceded four scrum penalties, two against Porter, two against Clarkson. Apart from the opening 15-minutes, they have been very disjointed, dogged by basic mistakes, handling hasn’t been good and some of the decision making has been flawed too. They will rue that missed opportunity when Osborne’s pass to Ringrose went to turf as a try beckoned. That would have out them 17-3 up. Wales though deserve hue credit for the manner in which they have hung around and to be honest played the better attacking rugby. They’ve troubled Ireland particularly out wide. Ireland will need to be a lot more precise and composed in possession. They’ll need to sort out the scrum, be better disciplined and connected in attack and defence. The high point of the Irish half from an Irish perspective The Power of Jack Conan 😮‍💨💪#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/aIUIWgCk6d RED CARD: Ireland’s Garry Ringrose’s yellow card has been upgraded to a 20-minute red card. Head on head contact on Ben Thomas. The correct decision. Needed to be lower. Half-time: Wales 13 Ireland 10 40(+2) mins: TRY Morgan. Wales on penalty advantage from the lineout after Ireland come in from the side at the maul; van der Flier pinged. Clarkson saved a try with a great tackle. Anscombe kicks the penalty to the corner. Rowlands takes, backs join maul. Wales pound the Irish line, stopped by millimetres until captain, Morgan forces his way over. Anscombe converts. Wales have deserved that. Wales 13 Ireland 10 36 mins: Prendergast hits an upright with a long-range penalty. Superbly struck but the outhalf then knocks on a high ball. Ireland are at sixes and sevens defensively, looking a little ragged on both sides of the ball and there are simply too many missed straight up tackles. Ireland concede a fourth scrum penalty. Leads to a schemozzle. Seven penalties Ireland have conceded, four at scrum time. Wales 6 Ireland 10 31 mins: Ireland are guilty of ball watching at a ruck. Van der Flier protects the ball, but no one goes in to move it on in the absence of Gibson-Park and Ireland penalised for holding on. Osborne with a superb tackle at Wales go on the attack again. They are inside the Irish 22. Ireland are penalised, Ringrose not rolling away. The television match official Ian Tempest advises the referee Christophe Ridley to look at a Ringrose tackle previously. Ringrose receives a yellow card and it will be reviewed by FPRO, Matteo Liperini (Italy). 34 mins: Anscombe kicks the penalty. Wales 6 Ireland 10 30 mins: Should have been a try for Ireland, great work by McCarthy and Peter O’Mahony in the build-up, the visitors sweep wide, but Osborne throws a poor pass. Ringrose was in for a walk in try, if the pass had gone to hand. A long pass was required but Osborne slapping the turf tells you he felt he should have done better. Smith is back in the front row. Scrum is completed. Wales 3 Ireland 10 27 mins: Good work from Ireland, good strike, Conan gets off the base of the scrum superbly and Lowe completes the clearance with his left foot. Wales though are back on the attack and they’re playing some lovely rugby. Wales 3 Ireland 10 24 mins: A poor enough re-start from Prendergast, too far and Tomos Williams with a superb clearance into the Irish half. Ireland kick away possession, Wales get it to the edge. Sheehan rescues his team by covering a kick through but Osborne doesn’t get much on the clearance. Brilliant work from Wales down the touchline but Williams knocks on what would have been a try scoring pass from Jac Morgan. That’s a huge let off for Ireland. Wales 3 Ireland 10 22 mins: Brilliant take from Beirne at the re-start, Sheehan knocked on though and Ireland are caught offside. Anscombe kicks the easy penalty. Wales 3 Ireland 10 19 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Gareth Thomas (Ospreys) on for Nicky Smith at loosehead prop. We’re about to have another scrum. Wales 3-0 up on penalties. What will the change do? Ireland win a scrum penalty. Thomas, the new boy penalised. Prendergast points at the posts and thumps it over. Wales 0 Ireland 10 15 mins: Lovely fluency from Ireland in attack, going from one touchline to the other. Move ends when Lowe goes through a gap but loses the ball in contact seven metres from the Welsh line. Wales win a third scrum penalty. Clarkson called again, this time by Gianluca Gnecchi, the other assistant referee. Worrying for Ireland. All three officials have called a scrum penalty against Ireland. Wales 0 Ireland 7 11 mins: Ireland are penalised at the second scrum, this time Thomas Clarkson for dropping his bind. Josh van der Flier reclaims an overthrow at a lineout. Hansen kicks through but Blair Murray rescues Wales and the home side clears. Good work from Lowe and Ringrose. Prendergast kicks the ball away. Wales 0 Ireland 7 8 mins: Good clearance from Jamison Gibson-Park from the re-start, Tom Rogers beats Jamie Osborne to Gareth Anscombe’s up and under. Wales get some continuity. The home side penalised, Elliot Dee for a tip tackle on a ruck clear-out. Tadhg Beirne inverted. Ireland clear but Henshaw knocks on from the long throw over the back. Wales 0 Ireland 7 6 mins: TRY Jack Conan. Superb from Conan, great power and a one-handed fend to stretch and reach over the Welsh line. Prendergast kicks the conversion. Wales 0 Ireland 7 5 mins: Good direct running from Ireland, Taulupe Faletau penalised two metres from his line. The visitors take it off the tail. Joe McCarthy great carry, James Lowe too. Wales 0 Ireland 0 4 mins: A bit of aerial tennis ends in a Welsh knock-on and the first scrum of the match. Collapses. Re-set. Andrew Porter penalised. Call came in from assistant referee Nika Amashukeli. Nothing in it. Ball had gone. Should have been play on. Jack Conan wins turnover. Mack Hansen counter-ruck. Garry Ringrose great grubber for a 50/22. Wales 0 Ireland 0 Ireland kickoff through Sam Prendergast. Roof closed, wonderful atmosphere, passionate rendition of the anthems. Let’s go.

Time for the anthems. Tommy Bowe knows a thing or two about Irish and Welsh rugby. What is the secret to Ireland's rugby success? 🤔@TommyBowe has his say 🗣️ #BBCRugby #SixNations pic.twitter.com/C0YdCVQPrL Right a little under half an hour to go to kickoff. Johnny Watterson will have green and red markers as he does the Player Ratings post match, Gerry Thornley will have his match report and I’ll keep you up to date with all the post match reaction. Stay here and all that will be coming your way on the blog. We will link everything to this blog. Statistics, the last refuge of the scoundrel. And I’d know. One that caught the eye was that Ireland had just 47% possession in their first two games – the second lowest after Italy (44%) – but they have enjoyed more territory (56%) than any other side and made more entries into the opposition 22 (22) than anyone else. Other reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective. Wales have conceded the most (26) and been awarded the fewest (14) penalties of any side in the Six Nations. We'll wear our new alternate white kit in Cardiff on Saturday to help supporters impacted by colour blindness! ⚪️#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/h1D22FiGck The reason that Ireland will wear their changed strip today. In a significant move to support spectators and viewers with colour vision deficiency (CVD), Ireland will wear their new alternate white kit against Wales. This decision, driven by new World Rugby regulations, aims to prevent kit clashes that can be problematic for those affected by CVD. Colour vision deficiency, commonly known as colour blindness, affects approximately one in 12 men and one in 200 women. The traditional red jerseys of Wales and the green jerseys of Ireland create a challenging visual scenario for those with CVD, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams on the pitch. The stage is set! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/dPIAtAvJ2L Today’s teams WALES: Blair Murray (Scarlets); Tom Rogers (Scarlets), Max Llewellyn (Gloucester), Ben Thomas (Cardiff), Ellis Mee (Scarlets); Gareth Anscombe (Gloucester), Tomos Williams (Gloucester); Nicky Smith (Leicester Tigers), Elliot Dee (Dragons), WillGriff John (Sale Sharks), Will Rowlands (Racing 92), Dafydd Jenkins (Exeter Chiefs), Jac Morgan (Ospreys) (capt), Tommy Reffell (Leicester Tigers), Taulupe Faletau (Cardiff).

Referee: Christophe Ridley (England) Assistant Referees: Nika Amashukeli (Georgia), Gianluca Gnecchi (Italy) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Matteo Liperini (Italy) BREAKING NEWS: Cian Prendergast has had to withdraw from the Ireland bench because of illness and his place goes to Ryan Baird. That’s very unfortunate for the Connacht captain but Ireland are fortunate to have such an accomplished stand-in. A word from the coaches. Simon Easterby: “Playing Wales in Cardiff is one of the great tests and we know the challenge that awaits us. “With a new coaching set-up in place, Wales will be re-energised and determined to impress in front of a vocal home support. “There will also be a huge Irish travelling support which, when added to the closed roof and the great respect and rivalry between the two nations, will add to an electric atmosphere.” He added: “We have made a few changes to the squad this week, some of which were enforced, and we’re confident that the 23 we have selected are primed and ready to go. “Dan’s (Sheehan) selection as captain is recognition of his high standing within the squad, both on and off the pitch. I have no doubt that he will relish the opportunity to lead Ireland for the first time. “Equally, I would also like to congratulate Jack Boyle on his inclusion in the matchday squad for the first time. Jack has impressed for his province Leinster, and in the national training camps over the last number of months, and he’s a young forward with a bright future.” Wales interim head coach Matt Sherratt: “We’re looking forward to the challenge of facing Ireland. We have spoken this week about being brave, but not reckless and making sure everyone knows their roles. “We also know that keeping our discipline will be huge. Everyone is excited for our first home game of the Six Nations. “The atmosphere Wales fans create at the Principality Stadium is incredible, and playing at home is something the players really look forward to.” Love the sentiment behind this image.

C'mon @IrishRugby - you got this!#TeamOfUs #ShouldertoShoulder pic.twitter.com/RKZR9pBOMK For those of us who have been around a while (!) I remember the Triple Crowns of 1982 and 1985 - our 5th and 6th ever in history. Glory days ! Today we’ll be going for our 8th this century after 04, 06, 07, 09, 18, 22 & 23. @IrishRugby has come a long way …. Welsh Twitter is certainly going all-in on the victory of the Wales Under-20 side as a positive harbinger for this afternoon’s game at the Principality Stadium. I am half expecting to see them point to the fact that the Irish 20s and the senior side were/are in the changed white, and I use that description loosely, strip. Maybe it’s an omen. A little under an hour and a half to go to kickoff in Cardiff. Just enough time to grab a bite and a drink of choice and read Gerry Thornley’s preview Former Wales great Jonathan Davies things that the Welsh 20s can inspire their senior brethern. Great win for Wales U20s just the boost Welsh rugby needed. 👍💪👏👏👏 Time to rip the plaster off the Ireland Under-20s performance in the 20-12 defeat to Wales at Rodney Parade last night. Once again they dominated territory and possession but the same old failings came back to haunt them in the opposition 22, leaving behind oodles of points. To their credit Wales defended with courage and grit, making over 228 tackles to their opponents 67 but the visitors made that job easier with an attack that lacked shape and cohesion and a multitude of handling errors. Nathan Johns was in Newport and here’s his thoughts on Ireland’s shortcomings. The best of both worlds for one Welsh fan. About to make the long long drove to Monmouth services for a @GreggsOfficial And while I’m in the area i thought i might catch Wales playing Ireland in the #GuinnessM6N Say hi if you’re about! pic.twitter.com/S1EIYYQqlp Go well Ireland 🙌#SUAF ☘️ | @SixNationsRugby | #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/TGkgHmnghd The bookmakers have Ireland as 25-point favourites on the handicap for today’s game and offer Wales at 14/1 against on a straight bet, which is long, long, long odds in a two-horse race to mix sporting metaphors. However, the Irish side would do well to remember that the tournament has had some famous upsets in the past, starting on the opening weekend on the first ever Six Nations in 2000. Scotland, the defending Fix Nations champions, travelled to the Stadio Flaminio in Rome to face an Italian side playing their first ever game in the Six Nations and lost 34-20. Italy’s, Argentine born outhalf, Diego Dominguez kicked 29-points. Wales beat raging hot favourites England 31-30 at Wembley in 1999 to deny them a Grand Slam. A late try by Scott Gibbs gave Wales the win and Scotland the title on points’ difference. In 2019 Ireland had just toppled world champions New Zealand in an unbeaten series of matches in November and sat on a run of 12 home wins on the bounce and 18 victories from their past 19 games. England, the visitors, hadn’t scored a try in Ireland in eight years, so it was no wonder that Joe Schmidt’s men down as heavy favourites on the day. England, under Eddie Jones, cruised home 32-20 for only their second win in Dublin since 2003. Italy enjoyed two huge upset wins in Rome, the first in 2011 when the squeezed-out France 22-21 with Mirco Bergamasco the hero, while two years later it was Ireland that suffered a similar fate losing 22-15 in the last game of Declan Kidney’s tenure as head coach. When Scotland beat England 11-6 at Twickenham in 2021, they were 9/2 underdogs with their hosts 1/6 to win that match. England were the reigning champions and it was a first win for the Scots in 38 years at the London venue. Good news and bad news today. Bad news is I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Good news is… I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🤣 Come on boys 💪🙏🏉 #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/Gpy9NIL9am Hello and welcome to the Irish Times blog for today’s Six Nations match at the Principality stadium. John O’Sullivan here and I’ll be taking you through the afternoon, before, during and after the game. We have some exclusive content too, not just what’s been on the website or in the newspaper. Will Wales get the big game bounce under new management with Cardiff coach Matt Sherratt taking over in an interim capacity following Warren Gatland’s departure, a decision based on mutual agreement between the New Zealander and the Welsh Rugby Union? The home supporters will be hoping that’s a fervent, ‘yes.’ Ireland are also under an interim coach, albeit in happier circumstances, in Simon Easterby, who is caretaking while Andy Farrell devotes himself to the British & Irish Lions head coach’s role. Not sure, when, if ever you would have had two countries facing one another in a Six Nations clash under interim head coaches. That’s not the only similarity. Wales and Ireland share a common identity prior to today’s match as the only two sides capable of winning the Triple Crown in this season’s Six Nations Championship. Ireland have safely negotiated two thirds of that remit with victories over England and Scotland, while for Wales this is the first leg of the treble with games against England and Scotland to come. Ireland take on Wales this afternoon as they look to keep their perfect start to this year’s Six Nations campaign going and claim the Triple Crown, although eyes are firmly set on the bigger prize with a third championship in a row and a grand slam within their sights. Simon Easterby has made seven changes to his side for the game with Dan Sheehan set to captain his country for the first time. Ireland come into the game as heavy favourites after the poor start Wales have had to the tournament and the departure of Warren Gatland. Follow our live story for all the action before, during and after the game.

Title: Here's what to know about Germany's election this Sunday

Rob Schmitz People walk past a truck with an election campaign poster featuring Friedrich Merz, leader of conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Oberhausen, Germany, on Feb. 21. VOLKER HARTMANN/AFP via Getty Images hide caption BERLIN — An economic slump, an immigration crisis and the lifting of a security blanket provided for decades by its most powerful ally are on the minds of German voters as they head to the polls for Sunday's national parliamentary election. The general election of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not supposed to come until September of this year. But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election. The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%). The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government. "I'm just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form," says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break." The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table. Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world. Merz's longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany's parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction. Röttgen has known Merz for more than 30 years. The two entered parliament together and have worked side by side through successive governments. He says Merz has strong beliefs: "Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people," says Röttgen. "And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist." Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies. The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says. "I think Merz, by disposition, would be more open to also support Ukraine more decisively," says Puglierin. "But he has to work in a framework. He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population." After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says. Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic. Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz's potential leadership. "He claims to be up to the job, and we know he's a good businessman, but I worry he will go back on his promise to never enter into a coalition government with the AfD," she says, referring to repeated vows Merz has made throughout the campaign. Another voter, Ulrich Hinz, a 74-year-old retired businessman from Frankfurt, says he thinks Merz's pro-European outlook could help at such a trying time for Germany. "We need a chancellor and a government that is more European and one that can get along better with the French, Italians and the Poles," he says. "That's the only way we are going to be able to keep up with China, Russia, and the United States." Esme Nicholson contributed to this story from Berlin. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Travel Startups Raise $580 Million Over Two Weeks

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else In the past two weeks, six travel startups have collectively raised $580 million, showcasing ongoing investor interest in travel technology advancements. Companies like Archer Aviation are leading the charge with significant funding aimed at developing flying taxis, with plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Klook and RoomPriceGenie are leveraging AI and automation to enhance travel experiences and hotel pricing, underscoring a shift towards modernizing traditional travel sectors. Tech companies promising to automate old industries are still getting big investment deals in 2025. Klook, which is modernizing the historically low-tech sector of ticketed experiences, just landed its second large fundraise in the past 18 months. And RoomPriceGenie, despite having several notable competitors, raised $75 million to help hotels automate pricing — an area that’s seen a lot of demand as hotels have been looking to modernize and generate more revenue since the pandemic. While startups developing flying taxis and renewable jet fuel are not producing much revenue yet, they’re raking in large amounts of money with the promise of big business in the future. Six travel startups raised nearly $580 million over the past two weeks. Archer Aviation, which is developing a flying taxi for commercial flights and defense clients, has raised $301.8 million. Investors included funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. The company has now raised over $2 billion, including its most recent deal of $430 million in December. The company said the latest fundraise brings its total liquidity to around $1 billion. California-based Archer is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. It is designed to hold a pilot with four passengers and luggage for urban trips of 20-50 miles at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. It is powered by six independent battery packs, each supporting a pair of electric engines, the company said. Archer said it now has manufacturing contracts worth over $6 billion. That includes a recent purchasing agreement for up to 100 aircrafts from Soracle — owned by Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation — which plans to operate a flying taxi service in various cities in Japan. The company recently unveiled plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles ahead of some major sporting events: the World Cup in 2026, the Super Bowl in 2027, and the Summer Olympics in 2028. The network includes vertiports (eVTOL airports) at Los Angeles International Airport, University of Southern California, Orange County, Santa Monica, Hollywood Burbank, Long Beach, and the Van Nuys neighborhood. The company is also planning to establish a vertiport near the SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles football teams Rams and Chargers. The plan is to begin LA network operations in 2026. This is in addition to plans for a network at California airports where Southwest Airlines operates, along with five vertiports in the Bay Area. The funding will go toward the continued development of the company’s aircraft. Klook, an online travel agency for tours and attractions, has raised $100 million The company said that the fundraise brings its valuation to over $1 billion for the first time. Vitruvian Partners led the round. The company last raised $210 million in equity and debt in 2023. Hong Kong-based Klook says it offers hundreds of thousands of ticketed experiences, such as walking tours, in 2,700 destinations globally. The company has also been expanding to offer hotels, trains, and car rentals. The new funding will go toward AI initiatives, such as for enhancing merchant operations, through an expanded partnership with Google Cloud. (See Skift’s story.) RoomPriceGenie, which provides AI-powered pricing tech for hotels, has raised $75 million. The funding comes from Five Elms Capital. Switzerland-based RoomPriceGenie provides a revenue management system for independent hotels and groups. The tech is meant to automate updating room rates based on changing market conditions. Competitors include Duetto, which was acquired by a private equity firm last year. The company says it has more than 3,000 hotel clients in 65 countries. The company also said it appointed Chas Scarantino as CEO. The co-founder and previous CEO, Ari Andricopoulos, is now the chief strategy officer. The funding will go toward expanding internally. Twelve, a renewable jet fuel production startup, has raised $83 million. Investors included DCVC, Amazon (The Climate Pledge Fund), Mitsui & Co., Development Bank of Japan, Japan Hydrogen Fund, Greycroft (Coca-Cola Sustainability Fund), 2551 Capital, SMBC, TPG, Pulse Fund, and others. The company most recently raised a series C round of $200 million in September. The new funding is a mix between an extension of the series C round plus financing to build a production facility. California-based Twelve says its tech generates jet fuel by converting a mix of carbon dioxide from either tanks or the atmosphere, along with water and renewable energy. Airline customers so far include Alaska Airlines and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways. Superlogic, which helps users apply loyalty points to ticketed experiences, has raised $13.7 million in its series A funding. Superlogic, a trailblazer in experiential rewards technology, today announced a first closing of $13.7 million in its Series A funding round. Led by Powerledger led the round, with support from including Sangha Capital, 10SQ, Nima Capital, Actai Unicorn Fund, Hyla Liquid Venture Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Amex Ventures, Galaxy Interactive, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation, Recharge Capital, Dispersion Capital, Sanctor Capital, and more. Miami-based Superlogic provides an AI-powered platform that loyalty programs can use to connect users with experiences tailored to their interests. Spark e-Fuels, which is developing tech to make renewable jet fuel, has raised $2.4 million (€2.3 million) in pre-seed funding. Nucleus Capital led the round, with support from Zero Carbon Capital, IBB Ventures, Chemovator, Voyagers.io, 1.5° Ventures, and a group of angel investors. Spark is focused on building its first e-fuel pilot plant and expanding its team to accelerate technology development and commercialization. The Berlin-based startup is developing tech that converts renewable resources like carbon dioxide, into jet fuel. The funding will go toward building its first pilot production plant and hiring.

Title: Coinbase CEO’s Hot Take: Bitcoin Is Basically A ‘Meme Coin’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/coinbase-ceos-hot-take-bitcoin-is-basically-a-meme-coin/
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:00:16Z
Full Content:
Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has recently made an audacious statement regarding Bitcoin that has caused quite a stir in the crypto industry. He recently proposed that Bitcoin could be regarded as “somewhat of a meme coin,” which sparked a debate among enthusiasts, analysts, and investors. Like meme currencies, Armstrong pointed out that the value of Bitcoin is essentially derived from popular or collective belief. He explained that unlike conventional assets, Bitcoin lacks inherent value connected with actual objects or direct use. Instead, its value is swayed by societal trust and the shared perception of its significance. He also likened Bitcoin to the US dollar, noting that although the dollar’s value has persisted mostly due to mass acceptance and faith in its purchasing power, and it is not connected to the gold standard. This comparison highlights Bitcoin’s status as a store of value rather than a commodity with inherent worth. Armstrong did not intend to undermine Bitcoin’s credibility; however, his statements underscored the expanding influence of meme coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two cryptocurrencies that have amassed substantial followings despite possessing minimal fundamental utility. On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they’ve become hugely popular. Arguably, they’ve been with us since the beginning –… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 19, 2025 For example, Dogecoin, which originated as a joke, experienced a price increase of over 15,000% in 2021 as a result of social media publicity and endorsements from prominent figures such as Elon Musk. Shiba Inu reached an all-time market cap of around $40 billion. This trend is a reflection of how sentiment and viral appeal can push asset valuation up, much like what Armstrong suggests applies to Bitcoin. Armstrong agreed that, in spite of the comparison, Bitcoin is still the most well-known cryptocurrency. The crypto continues to dominate institutional adoption, regulatory discussions, and long-term investment strategies. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of Bitcoin has been strengthened even more by the trust big financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have in the crypto asset. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and decentralized nature also sets it apart from the typical meme coin phenomenon. Armstrong’s statement has fueled discussions about how cryptocurrencies derive their value. Some critics argue that equating Bitcoin to a meme coin undermines its role as “digital gold,” while others believe it accurately describes the evolving nature of financial assets in the internet era. Featured image from PC World, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. They say journalists never truly clock out. But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

The best a company can do is examine both external and internal communications — and be prepared. “If you go running from DEI in a very public way, after having embraced it over the last three years, you might be hit by traffic going both ways,” Goldstein said. “The worst thing that can happen to a company is: You’re still on that list, but you’ve lost all your good faith and credibility with folks on the other side of these issues.” Source: America First Legal, American Alliance for Equal Rights Source: America First Legal (With assistance from Gerson Freitas Jr., Jaewon Kang, Brody Ford, Sabah Meddings, Mary Schlangenstein, Deena Shanker, Matt Day, Silla Brush, Andrew Martin, Natalie Lung, Jeannette Neumann, Thomas Buckley and Alexandre Rajbhandari.) ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) vowed this month that a stablecoin bill, dubbed the GENIUS Act, will be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed into law within the first 100 days of President Donald Trump’s administration. As the bill gains momentum, some experts say the industry may be at a crossroads. While the measure would for the first time provide a pathway to legality for stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle, it would also likely unleash massive competition. A federal framework would embolden countless companies to dive into the $233 billion stablecoin market, according to Niklas Kunkel, the founder of blockchain oracle builder Chronicle Labs. At the least, many firms will consider what strategic advantages stablecoins have, he told Decrypt. “As soon as this legislation passes, there are going to be 10,000 companies looking at this,” Kunkel said. “I would expand that beyond just payment companies and asset issuers. [...] You can include tech companies: the Amazons, Ubers, Metas and Googles of the world." Among interested firms, Kunkel bet 1,000 of them would debut a stablecoin within the following year that stablecoin legislation is passed. In lieu of adopting an existing stablecoin like Circle’s USDC, however, Kunkel said firms will be incentivized to release their own equivalent. “They would love their users to use their own branded stablecoin because they can make the yield on the underlying reserves,” he explained. “They may even be white-labeled.” As an example of a white-labeled stablecoin, Kunkel pointed to Paxos. The company once issued a Binance-branded stablecoin called BUSD, while playing a central role in PayPal’s stablecoin foray as the issuer of PayPal USD (PYUSD). As digital assets are pegged to the price of a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, stablecoins are often backed by reserves of cash and U.S. Treasuries that generate yield. In Coinbase’s fourth quarter, the company disclosed $224 million in revenue from assets backing USDC. A report published by S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday found that the GENIUS Act would increase the adoption of stablecoins in the U.S. The lack of regulation in the U.S. is “one of the main impediments” to broader adoption, the analysts wrote. In November, Paxos CEO Charles Cascarilla wrote in a letter addressed to Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris—then the Democratic presidential candidate—that America’s opportunity to cement financial dominance through stablecoins had been stifled so far by “countless examples of regulatory overreach.” Though firms like BlackRock have issued tokenized money market funds that resemble stablecoins, S&P analysts wrote that a lack of regulation and supervision has prevented their broader adoption in fields like everyday payments. Chronicle Labs is developing a network for oracles, which allow blockchains to connect with external, real-word data sources. Before starting the Switzerland-based firm, Kunkel worked for five years at MakerDAO, the popular lending protocol behind the stablecoin DAI. (MakerDAO has since rebranded to Sky and replaced DAI with USDS.) Kunkel was part of the founding team at MakerDAO when the organization launched in 2017. And at this point, building something that resembles a bank and operates solely on stablecoin rails is possible, he said. The regulatory backdrop just needs to catch up. “As soon as you get the government involved, everything slows down to a crawl,” he said. “The rate at which that iceberg thaws is going to determine how far into the future that we have to look before we realize this.” When PayPal introduced its stablecoin in 2023, the firm faced criticism from Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), a top Democrat on the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. She said that “federal oversight and enforcement of its stablecoin operations is essential,” expressing deep concern that the payments giant had moved before a framework was passed. Ultimately, stablecoin legislation may further intertwine the U.S. financial system with crypto’s sprawling decentralized finance, or DeFi, landscape, according to S&P analysis. “In our view, the role of stablecoins will continue to evolve and could eventually lead to more integration between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” they wrote.

Title: New UK-Based Climate Group Emerges as Banks Retreat

Time Published: 2025-02-20T15:41:21Z
Full Content:
It was a dank, drizzly February evening when about 120 people gathered in the brightly lit art gallery of London’s Guildhall, surrounded by gold-framed paintings ranging from Pre-Raphaelites to realists. At the event, Alok Sharma, a former member of the UK parliament who served as president-designate of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2021, announced the launch of the Transition Finance Council. The goal of the London-based group, which includes banking executives, is to rally the City of London, companies and policymakers to scale funding for decarbonization efforts at home and abroad. The intention is “to ensure that London is positioned as a preeminent financial hub for transition financing” and to “deliver at scale the finance to transition the global economy” to cleaner energy sources, Sharma said in his speech. As Sharma pointed out, it was five years ago almost to the day that a similar event took place in the same building. The UK government, together with the Bank of England, had rallied six times as many people for the launch of what was called the private finance agenda for COP26. That gathering was a more boisterous affair. The room was “packed to the rafters,” Sharma recalled. Mark Carney, then BOE governor, took the stage to interview legendary biologist and broadcaster David Attenborough. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, dialed in. It was “the point at which talk of sustainable finance and climate action moved from being a [corporate social responsibility] issue to being a C-suite issue,” Sharma said. A year later, Carney introduced the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, an industry initiative uniting firms with more than $70 trillion of assets to accelerate the transition to net zero. Much, of course, has changed since then. Starting in December, all of the largest US and Canadian banks began fleeing the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, itself once part of the broader GFANZ framework. And last week, Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd. said it too was retreating from the coalition. The defections occurred as financial institutions seek to avoid right-wing attacks on sustainability and renewable energy, a US Republican-led war on behalf of the oil industry that’s only intensified with Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The insurance sector’s climate alliance also has been discontinued, while a similar group in the fund-management industry is on pause as it seeks to ensure that it remains “fit for purpose.” There’s “a lot of turmoil,” said Nina Seega, director of the Centre for Sustainable Finance at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. “Rhetoric is shifting and climate denial is becoming much more mainstream, so you then see a shift in the way different financial institutions are dealing with that.” Some are under more pressure than others, she said, but “none are immune.” Last week, a few minutes before Sharma took the microphone to announce the Transition Finance Council’s formation, one chief sustainability officer (CSO) of a large UK-based investment manager was asking attendees who they thought would be the next company to retreat from net zero. The query wasn’t surprising. CSOs face a more difficult landscape these days, what with big firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and BlackRock Inc. quitting climate-finance groups. On Wednesday, HSBC announced it’s pushed back its deadline to meet a number of key climate targets by two decades. As more companies back away, there are serious questions about the financial industry’s long-term commitment—and capacity—to help slow increasingly catastrophic global warming. Forced to battle headwinds both inside and outside their firms, many CSOs are concerned they may no longer have the full support of their companies and leadership teams. “Finance is being politicized, if not weaponized,” said Clemens Calice, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who set up his own investment and advisory firm, Cygnum Capital. “Companies are under increasing pressure to align with a side or an agenda.” For CSOs, all of this amounts to a “very challenging operating environment,” said James Alexander, chief executive of the UK Sustainable Investment and Finance Association. Politics and policy have “become much more fractured,” making judgment calls “much harder to make.” At the same time, he said, “if you’re managing money, your responsibility is to consider risks, and sustainability is undeniably one of those risks.” Britain stands out as a rare example of a country that’s advancing on climate action. Seven of the world’s 10 largest economies missed a recent deadline to file updated emissions-saving plans with the United Nations. The UK was the only one to outline a strategy for the next decade that’s anywhere close to consistent with the Paris Agreement target to keep warming below 1.5C. “I’m very pleased to say” that the UK “has a government which recognizes that there is no trade-off between economic growth and the drive to decarbonize the economy,” Sharma said. The country is “uniquely positioned to lead.” (GFANZ is co-chaired by Michael R. Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg News parent Bloomberg LP, and Mary Schapiro, the former head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.) North Carolina-based Duke Energy Corp., one of the biggest US power providers, removed a mention of climate targets in its latest earnings release as the company builds more natural gas plants and even reconsiders its plans for coal, the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. Duke said in its third-quarter earnings release last year that it was “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” and noted its goals to emit net-zero methane by 2030 and net-zero carbon by 2050. But the company’s fourth-quarter release on Thursday, while stating it was “executing an ambitious energy transition,” omitted the word “clean” and left out emissions goals. Though Duke says its strategy hasn’t changed, the move comes as Trump, who previously called climate change a “hoax” though has occasionally modulated that claim since, is nevertheless trying to increase production of fossil fuels while simultaneously seeking to zero-out net-zero policies. Duke said late last year it would consider shifting its plans for coal plants if the US president follows through on his promises to terminate rules governing power-plant pollution.

Title: Wisconsin More Than Doubled BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Holdings to 6M Shares

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The state’s investment board’s stake is worth more than $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10. Wisconsin’s investment board saw fit to significantly add to its bitcoin (BTC) bet in the last three months of the year. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) disclosed ownership of just over 6 million shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as of the Dec. 31, per a 13F filing on Friday, up from roughly 2.9 million shares three months prior. The position is valued at $340 million at IBIT’s current price of $56.10 and would be worth about $588 million at bitcoin’s current price near $98,000. The fund in 2024 became the first of its kind to report a bitcoin ETF purchase, initially buying 94,562 shares of IBIT and some shares of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which it later sold. The State of Michigan Retirement System later also reported owning shares of bitcoin ETFs, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and two of Grayscale’s bitcoin products. SWIB, established in 1951, oversees more than $156 billion in assets including funds from the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) and the State Investment Fund (SIF). The board manages investments on behalf of state employees and other trust funds. Today marks the deadline for institutional investors managing at least $100 million in assets to report quarterly holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The market is closely monitoring these filings to gauge whether large traditional finance firms have been adding bitcoin ETFs to their portfolios since their launch last year. UPDATE (Feb. 14, 18:49 UTC): Updates current valuation of State of Wisconsin’s stake in IBIT.

Title: Bird flu: They Are Re-Running The COVID Script

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED! by Rhoda Wilson | Feb 20, 2025 | Coincidence, Conspiracy Fact and Theory, Headline News, Health | 2 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at The Exposé. Bird flu is a rerun of COVID-19. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The pandemic planners have a playbook; they used it for COVID-19 and now they are using it for bird flu, with one difference. With COVID-19, they targeted us directly. With bird flu, they are targeting us indirectly through our food supply. It is currently being claimed that bird flu is widespread in wild birds worldwide and is causing outbreaks in poultry, dairy cows and cats, and has resulted in several human cases in the US, including a recent case in Wyoming. By coincidence, yesterday, the US Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) gave conditional approval for an updated bird flu vaccine for poultry. An outbreak of bird flu at a farm in New Zealand in December resulted in the culling of almost 160,000 hens. But, warned New Zealand’s Biosecurity Minister yesterday, a different strain of the flu was circulating globally and would likely arrive in New Zealand. At the end of January, GAVI “Vaccines Work” was delighted to announce that restrictions had been put in place in the UK to curb the spread of bird flu. Almost 1.8 million farmed and captive birds have been culled in the past three months due to avian flu outbreaks across the UK. Reuters reported yesterday that there has been an outbreak of bird flu in Canada. And so, it goes on. Countries’ pandemic-vaccine industries are moving in lockstep, just as they did with COVID-19. In the following, Clayton Baker explains more about their pandemic playbook, which they used for COVID-19 and are now using for bird flu. “Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it,” he writes. Although he refers to the pandemic industry in the USA, similar can be applied worldwide. Bird Flu Is a Rerun of the Covid Playbook By Clayton J. Baker as published by Brownstone Institute Bird flu can be very confusing. This is true because, as is so often the case with our government, those who claim to be trying to solve the problem – our so-called “public health” and “pandemic preparedness” “experts” – are actually the ones who created the problem. What is worse, they are actively seeking to perpetuate it. In this brief article, my goal is to explain what is happening with H5N1 Bird flu in the clearest, most fundamental terms. I hope to make it so clear that all our elected officials can understand what is going on and therefore can take action to stop it. The key to understanding the current bird flu panic is this: Bird flu is a complete rerun of the covid script. There is just one twist: Last time, with covid, the pandemic-planning bioterrorists directly blackmailed us by taking away our civil rights, to coerce us to accept their unsafe and ineffective vaccines. This time, with Bird flu, the pandemic planning bioterrorists are indirectly blackmailing us by targeting our food, to coerce us to accept more of their unsafe and ineffective vaccines into our food supply and those who supply it. Here is their playbook. Learn it, and you can understand how to put an end to it. Let’s review. What happened during covid? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” genetically manipulated a bat coronavirus to be both transmissible and virulent in humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In late 2019, the laboratory-manipulated coronavirus bioweapon, SARS-CoV-2, was leaked from a laboratory. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines were rushed into production, “public health” authorities took advantage of the laboratory leak by denying its occurrence while simultaneously coercing governments to impose lockdowns and other civil rights violations on the human population. 5. To perpetuate the lockdowns, “public health” authorities performed indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the population, knowing full well this would generate countless false positives. 6. The authorities used this excessive testing, along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the lockdowns and the civil rights abuses. 7. The lockdowns and civil rights abuses were used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines into their own bodies in exchange for a return to normal life. What is happening now with H5N1 bird flu? 1. Over many years, bioweapons scientists, under the guise of “pandemic preparedness,” have genetically manipulated the H5N1 avian influenza virus to cross classes of animals and even become more transmissible to humans. In other words, they created a bioweapon. 2. Meanwhile, they also developed and patented technologies for vaccines against that same virus. In other words, they created the countermeasure to their bioweapon. 3. In early 2022, a lab-manipulated bird flu bioweapon leaked from the USDA Southeast Poultry Lab in Athens, Georgia. Multiple Bird flu leaks have also occurred from other laboratories. 4. While the countermeasure vaccines are being rushed into production, “public health” authorities take advantage of these lab leaks by denying their occurrence while simultaneously coercing our government to impose mass slaughter of farm animals, creating food shortages for the human population. 5. To perpetuate the mass slaughter and worsen food shortages, “public health” authorities are performing indiscriminate PCR testing for the virus among the animal population and farmers, knowing full well this will generate countless false positives. 6. Authorities are using this excessive testing along with media-generated fear-mongering and governmental abuse of power, to prolong the mass slaughter of farm animals and the food shortages. 7. The mass slaughter of farm animals and resulting food shortages are being used to blackmail the population into mass acceptance of the vaccines in their food supply, in exchange for a return to normal life. This is not a conspiracy theory. This is basic pattern recognition. The “pandemic planners” are operating just like a moderately competent, if unimaginative, high school football coach. If you run a play, and it works, run it again. Keep running it until they stop it. How do we stop it? Here’s how: 1. End the brutal mass slaughter of poultry flocks immediately. This disgusting, death-wish practice is directly analogous to the deadly and unconstitutional human lockdowns during covid. It is also an act of biological terrorism. It traumatises farmers, wastes resources, creates food shortages, is inhumane in the extreme to animals and does nothing to stop the virus. Let the flocks develop natural immunity. Slaughtered flocks cannot develop natural immunity to a virus, just as locked-down human populations cannot either. Sound familiar? 2. End the indiscriminate PCR testing for Bird flu in animals and humans immediately. A positive PCR test is like the proverbial grand jury indictment – you can get one on a ham sandwich if you try hard enough. Willy-nilly PCR testing creates innumerable false positives, which fuels the fear porn and hysteria, paralyses decision-makers and promotes population-wide blackmail. 3. The USDA appears to be acting as a rogue agency. The USDA’s leadership needs to be thoroughly reviewed and, well, culled. All those attached to the pandemic preparedness industry, and all those perpetuating the fear-mongering, irresponsible mass PCR testing, mass slaughter of animals, etc. must be immediately removed from the agency. They represent not only a threat to animals and the food supply but to President Trump’s entire second term. 4. The personnel at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) need a similar prompt and thorough overhaul.TheCDC, while somewhat chastened by President Trump’s executive order silencing Health and Human Services (“HHS”) agencies, and benefitting from the departure of former Director Mandy Cohen, is still led by Biden-era appointments whose past resumes raise serious doubt about their willingness to abandon the covid era “pandemic planning” model of public health. For example, acting director Susan Monarez, PhD’s biography shows multiple Deep State connections to the pandemic preparedness industry. Should she remain at the CDC? 5. The USDA Southeast Poultry Research Lab in Athens, Georgia, should be shut down and thoroughly investigated. 6. The Kawaoka Bird flu laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, which has been doing reckless gain-of-function research for decades, and which has had multiple lab leaks, should be shut down and investigated as well. 7. Brooke Rollins, the new USDA Secretary, needs to be fully briefed on H5N1 Bird flu by honest experts who are not embedded in the pandemic preparedness industry. People such as Meryl Nass, MD, and Peter McCullough, MD and his team would both be excellent choices. 8. President Trump should follow through on his 2024 promise to disband the redundant, Biden-created Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy (“OPPR”).Mr. Trump’s instinct was correct then, and it remains correct now. 9. The $590 million bird flu vaccine development contract to Moderna that the Biden administration approved a couple of days before President Trump’s inauguration should be cancelled. 10. The USDA’s reported “conditional approval” of a Bird flu vaccine with Zoetis should be cancelled. Bird flu vaccination in poultry flocks has been demonstrated in other countries to select for more virulent strains. Furthermore, the CEO of Zoetis has close ties to Pfizer, BlackRock and the Gates Foundation, all well-established bad actors during the covid era. Beware, Mr. President. The “pandemic preparedness” racket isn’t as complicated as it seems. Once one comes to terms with the fact that the arsonists are running the fire department – as they have been demonstrated by DOGE to be doing in so many other areas of government as well – we can recognise what is actually happening and apply the necessary solutions.

Highlighting an article... Since Trump is intent on issuing as many executive orders as he can, why hasn’t he ordered USDA to stop testing chickens for the (figmentary) bird flu? Not only is that rogue agency culling entire flocks for just one “asymptomatic” positive PCR test, they’re using it as an excuse to cull the flocks of commercial farms within 5-7 miles of the PCR positive flock. Trump’s failure to stop the psychopaths from executing the Covid script against our nation’s poultry farmers is the reason for the eggflation. Now the script has extended to PCR testing cattle, which means higher beef prices are no doubt ahead. SB, its a chess game. My theory is that Trump is letting this kind of stuff (which terrifies the ignorant, the same ones that oppose his efforts) so much of his opposition (press?) is occupied with this stuff and have even more trouble keeping up with and criticizing Trump’s waste and fraud cleansing efforts. I’ve thought on this a while and wondered the same. I think Trump is allowing this to confuse and terrify his enemies. So many are worried about the bird flu and their attention is split away from TDS activities. You must be logged in to post a comment.

Top mutual fund manager Vanguard has paused meetings with portfolio companies while it reviews the impact of new guidance on investor activism from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to people familiar with the matter. In a recent notice, the SEC, whose acting chair was appointed by President Donald Trump, revised its “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations in ways that could put new burdens on firms like Vanguard that now rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the SEC said managers may need to use the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs, if they pressure management on matters like climate questions or whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Vanguard put the pause in place because it is “trying to process and understand the new guidelines so they can remain a 13G filer and not a 13D filer,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. Ending the meetings could reduce the power of shareholder activists focused on environmental, social or governance questions, corporate attorneys say, the apparent goal of the SEC’s current leadership. But it could also diminish the input that executives receive from top investors on more traditional corporate questions like executive pay. A Vanguard representative did not respond to questions on Tuesday. Rival asset manager BlackRock had also paused meetings with some of its portfolio companies. A company representative did not immediately comment on the status of these meetings on Tuesday.

Title: Ireland under-20 coach Neil Doak makes two changes for Wales clash
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/19/ireland-under-20-coach-neil-doak-makes-two-changes-for-wales-clash/
Time Published: 2025-02-19T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
Ireland head coach Neil Doak has made two changes and a positional switch to the starting team that beat Scotland for Friday night’s Under-20 Six Nations Championship clash with Wales at Rodney Parade (7.45). Cork Constitution’s Eoghan Smyth returns to the side having started in the defeat against England before being sprung from the bench against Scotland. His robust defence and straight running were missed in Edinburgh. Smyth resumes his midfield partnership with one of Ireland’s outstanding players to date, Connor Fahy, who switches back to outside centre. Gene O’Leary Kareem reverts to the replacements. The other change is in the frontrow where Ballynahinch tighthead Tom McAllister gets a chance in the run-on team, swapping places with Blackrock’s Alex McMullan, another standout player, who is on the bench. The other alterations to the replacements see UCD hooker Mikey Yarr, who played last year, return after recovering from injury. Highfield’s Conor Kennelly comes in for a try scorer the last day, Shannon’s Oisín Minogue, while Tom Wood, a son of former Lions and Ireland hooker Keith, is included in the matchday 23 for the first time. Several Ireland players have received a vote of confidence from the coaching team despite lapses in individual, and indeed the collective, performances to date and will need to repay that faith with greater clarity, precision and execution on both sides of the ball. Ireland assistant coach Andrew Browne, who won a Grand Slam at this age-grade as a player in 2007, admitted that the group had spoken about being sharper mentally and physically. “In the England game we had a lot of possession, a lot of 22 entries, [that] we just didn’t convert. We were inaccurate, which was really disappointing. “In the Scotland game we started really well and then tailed off a little bit. Then into the second half, they started the stronger and that’s something we have reviewed, how we came out in that second half because they got that momentum at the end of the first half. We did manage to redress it a little bit, but how can we be more consistent? “We talk about being relentless, we talk about being ruthless and how can we actually live [up] to those words a little bit more. That’s something we have addressed over the last couple of weeks. So, hopefully we can see a bit more of it come Friday night.” On the changes to the team, Browne explained that they wanted to have a look at a few players in a slightly different capacity, including Wood. “Tom’s a really good player. I know he’s under-19, but he was in various camps. We get to see Tom now in a competitive game, a competitive environment; it just builds that strength and depth which you’re always looking for.” Fullback Todd Lawlor is due to play an AIL match in the next couple of weeks having recovered from shoulder surgery, but it is unlikely that wing Derry Moloney, prop Niall Smyth, secondrow Alan Spicer and backrow Luke Murphy will be fit in time to play a part in the tournament, while Alex Usanov won’t. Wales beat Italy 20-18 at the Stade Comunale di Monigo last time out having lost to France in their opening game of the tournament.

Title: Trump’s SEC Leader Shifts Power From Investors to Boardrooms

New policies from the top U.S. securities regulator hand corporate boards more power over investors in ways that could curtail investor-initiated reform efforts on everything from climate policy to director contests, experts say. Since last month when U.S. President Donald Trump named Mark Uyeda acting chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency has made it easier for boards to block shareholder resolutions, put stricter filing requirements on passive funds, and limit investors’ communication abilities. The changes give directors more scope to nix efforts to have companies limit emissions or report workforce diversity details, while traditional activists running their own director slates could also find it harder to challenge boards, attorneys say. “It’s a relatively dramatic reallocation of power away from large shareholders back to corporate management, not just to make corporate policy but to protect themselves against activists,” said Tulane University business law professor Ann Lipton. Uyeda and other Republican officials – including Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to run the SEC – have made clear their skepticism of environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment considerations. “Shareholder meetings were not intended under state corporate laws to be political battlegrounds or debating societies,” Uyeda said in a 2023 speech. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Atkins did not respond to questions sent via his current firm. FEWER BALLOT ITEMS The SEC’s changes are in line with other Trump administration efforts such as dismantling diversity programs and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement. ESG resolutions drew significant support in 2021 and 2022, but less so since. In a February 11 legal bulletin the SEC made it easier for companies to skip votes on the resolutions such as by claiming the proposals “micromanage” their businesses. That change could make it harder for ESG-minded activists even to start talks with corporate executives. “If it’s harder to get your resolution through at the SEC, it will be harder to do that kind of work,” said Rick Alexander, CEO of the Shareholder Commons, which tracks and writes resolutions. On Feb. 11, the SEC also revised “beneficial ownership reporting” interpretations to broaden the requirements on firms like asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard, which often rely on the SEC’s Schedule 13G form to report major holdings. Going forward, the agency tightened when managers can use the form rather than the more complex Schedule 13D, which would increase their costs. A new SEC test is if a company “exerts pressure on management” such as tying director votes to whether a company has a staggered board or poison pill takeover defenses. Proxy voting policies of both BlackRock and Vanguard suggest those circumstances could lead to critical votes. BlackRock and Vanguard declined to comment. BlackRock temporarily paused meetings with some portfolio companies as of Tuesday with an eye on the new rules. Jessica Strine, CEO of shareholder advisory firm Jasper Street Partners, said the SEC’s new interpretation could have a potential downside for companies as well if they cannot know what their top investors think. “It’s not a complete gift to management teams if it means they no longer have engagement opportunities with their top shareholders,” she said. “That means they don’t get to make their case” before votes are cast at annual meetings on matters like executive compensation. Caroline Crenshaw, currently the lone Democratic member of the SEC via e-mail said the change could chill the big funds’ outreach. “The interpretation muddies the waters for institutional investors, with the unstated goal of dissuading them from engaging with corporations. At bottom, this policy is bad for capital formation,” Crenshaw said. COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN A third change involves new guidance on when investors can use the SEC’s electronic records system to distribute so-called “exempt solicitations,” or communications with other shareholders. Once meant as a tool to reveal closed-door discussions among bigger institutional holders, smaller investors started filing their own exempt solicitations as a cheap way to make their arguments on issues like whether to oppose a certain director or support a shareholder resolution. In a January 27 update the SEC narrowed their permissible use. The documents are “not intended to be the means through which a person disseminates written soliciting material to security holders,” the SEC said, but rather only to notify the public of written materials sent to security holders through other means. For Tom Quaadman, Senior Vice President for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a top business lobbying group, the SEC’s changes were welcome. “You’re seeing a rebalancing of SEC policies and rules that are designed to take out special interest activism and bring things back to a focus on investor return,” he said.

HOUSE PRICES CLIMBED last year at almost double the growth rate seen in 2023, leaving prices 16.8% higher than at the peak of the Celtic Tiger property boom in 2007. According to new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO), residential property prices increased by 8.7% in the 12 months to December last year, up from 4.4% the previous year. House prices in Dublin rose by 8.3% in December, with prices outside of the capital up by 9%. The median, or mid-point, price of a house purchased in the year to December was €355,000, compared to €327,500 in December 2023. In the year to December, house prices in Dublin rose by 8.7% while apartment prices increased by 6.9%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Fingal at 10%, with South Dublin seeing a rise of 6.9%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 9.3% and apartment prices increased by 5.8%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Border (Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Monaghan, and Sligo) at 14.2%. At the other end of the scale, the Mid-East (Kildare, Louth, Meath, and Wicklow) saw a 5.9% growth in price. The figures show that 5,177 property purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue last December, an increase of 2.3% when compared with the 5,063 purchases in December 2023. Advertisement The lowest median price for a house was €182,250 in Longford, while the highest median price was €660,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The most expensive Eircode area over the 12 months to December was A94 ‘Blackrock’ with a median price of €730,000, while H23 ‘Clones’ had the least expensive price of €131,000. Looking at the full year, the median price paid by households for a house was €355,000, compared with €259,000 in 2019, and €155,000 in 2013. A total of 48,775 dwelling purchases by households at market prices were filed with Revenue in 2024. This represents a 2.9% decrease compared with 50,234 purchases in 2023. The annual national index for 2024 reached a value of 183.4, which is 12.7% higher than it was for 2007 when it reached a peak of 162.7. Overall, prices of new dwellings have risen by 130.2% from their trough in the middle of 2013. Prices of existing dwellings are now 161.6% higher than at their trough in 2012. Commenting on today’s figures, senior mortgage advisor with NFP Ireland Gerry Griffin said affordability is an increasing challenge, particularly for first-time buyers. “While the pace of price increases has slowed slightly, demand remains strong, and supply is still struggling to keep up,”Griffin said. He said that if the European Central Bank proceeds with an expected interest rate cut in March, mortgage rates could fall, boosting borrowing power. “While this would benefit buyers, it could also drive further price inflation by increasing competition for available homes,” he said.

Even with lower interest rates, repayments will still be substantial given the high price levels. “For policymakers, the focus must remain on delivering more housing at a faster pace to balance the market and prevent additional pressure on prices.” Rachel McGovern, deputy chief executive at Brokers Ireland, said prices rose last year “at levels beyond what most industry commentators expected. “These levels are not sustainable except for those on high salaries and those wealthy enough to not be dependent upon mortgage finance,” she said. “There are appalling consequences for our society if policymakers don’t turn around housing in the near future and ensure that those on average incomes can achieve the ambition of owning a home. “We would call on the Government to be brave and decisive and not let another year pass before it acts on the recommendations of the Housing Commission in particular,” she said. Earlier this week, Cabinet approved €450 million in funding that is set to provide 3,000 cost rental, affordable and social homes over three years. However, Sinn Féin’s Eoin Ó Broin said the government is allocating less capital funding for social and affordable housing in 2025 that it spent in 2024.

Franklin Templeton, a major global asset manager, said Wednesday it has launched its tokenized U.S. Treasury fund in Luxembourg, expanding access to European institutional investors. The launch of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund marks the first Luxembourg-domiciled fund investing in U.S. government securities that's fully tokenized, the asset manager claimed in a press release. This means shares in the fund are recorded and transferred on the blockchain rather than through traditional processes, using Franklin Templeton's proprietary blockchain-based transfer agency platform for handling transactions to offer enhanced efficiency, transparency and security. The fund is available on the Stellar network (XLM) for institutional investors in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, following regulatory approval in October by Luxembourg regulators. The U.S.-registered version of the fund has attracted over $580 million of assets since its 2021 debut and is limited to U.S.-based investors only, per rwa.xyz data. Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have been at the forefront of red-hot real-world asset tokenization efforts, growing into a $4 billion asset class this year. Franklin Templeton was the first among traditional financial institutions to release such a product, and its the third largest tokenized treasury fund by assets under management behind Hashnote's USYC and BUIDL, issued by BlackRock and Securitize.

Title: Vanguard, BlackRock, And Citadel Now Hold 7.8 Million Additional Shares In Trump Media And Technology Group (DJT), With The Company Reporting Actual Billings Of Just ~$200,000 For 2024

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. When some of the biggest asset managers in the world start gobbling up shares of a company that barely makes any money, one is compelled to pause for a bit and wonder: "what do they know that I don't?" Look no further than Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) as an emblematic example of this phenomenon. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, Trump Media and Technology Group is the parent entity of the Truth Social platform, the Truth Plus content streaming service, and the soon-to-be-launched asset management and ETF service under the Truth.Fi banner. Despite its growing product portfolio, the company has yet to show any material earnings. For the year that ended on the 31st of December, Trump Media and Technology Group reported just $3.6 million in sales. What's more, when you remove the amortization of deferred revenue from this figure, actual billings for the year amount to just ~$200,000 (unearned revenue on the balance sheet declined from $4.41 million to 1.01 million by the end of 2024, implying unearned revenue recognition of $3.4 million vs. reported sales of $3.6 million). Nonetheless, Trump Media and Technology Group does have one thing going for it: its gigantic post-SPAC-merger cash balance. And, the company is now beginning to deploy its copious cash coffers to bolster its earnings. As we previously reported, Trump Media's board has now approved the diversion of up to $250 million from its current reserve of around $700 million in cash and cash equivalents towards setting up customized Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) and ETFs, including one dedicated to Bitcoin, under the Truth.Fi banner and in partnership with Charles Schwab and Yorkville advisors. Coming back, the requisite Form 13-F filings for the previous quarter - which are now available for public scrutiny - contained a shocker: Vanguard, BlackRock, and Citadel increased their stake in Trump Media and Technology Group by a combined 7.8 million shares, and this is before the launch of the company's asset management service under the Truth.Fi banner. Of course, it is quite likely that these asset managers were simply betting on President Trump's star power to drive further gains. After all, DJT is not a stock that trades on fundamentals. Meanwhile, in another unusual development, Trump Media and Technology Group has now sued a Brazilian supreme court judge in Miami for illegally censoring right-wing voices on social media. The judge in question is currently overseeing a number of investigations into the affairs of the former Brazilian president and a staunch Trump ally, Jair Bolsonaro.

Title: Scalable Capital to open access to private equity

With a new segment on its digital investment platform, Scalable Capital is setting new standards for investors: Soon, suitable investors in Germany will get access to alternative investments such as private equity. 0 19 February 2025 Be the first to comment This content is provided by an external author without editing by Finextra. It expresses the views and opinions of the author. Through the Scalable Broker, they will be able to invest in companies that are not listed on stock exchanges for the first time. Until now, benefiting from this additional return and diversification potential has been primarily reserved for professional investors. At the start of the new offer, Scalable Capital is the first digital investment platform to offer access to the BlackRock Private Equity Fund. The fund is managed by BlackRock, one of the world's leading private markets investors trusted to manage 450 billion US dollars in alternative assets.(1) After a minimum one-off investment from 10,000 euros, the fund is also available in a savings plan. There are no front-end loads for the fund. This is a further step in the endeavour to open up the entire investment spectrum to long-term oriented investors for their financial future."As alternative investments such as private equity are becoming increasingly relevant for participation in economic growth, we now make them accessible to our investors," says Julius Weller, Vice President Broker at Scalable Capital. "With the expansion of our investment platform to include this segment, clients gain access to the high return potential of private companies. We also achieve the favourable terms and simple handling for private equity that Scalable Capital is known for."An attractive, strongly growing investment market outside of the stock exchangesGlobally, the vast majority (88%) of companies with a turnover of more than 100 million US dollars is privately held - hence not listed.(2) Making these companies investable creates a huge new investment universe that could continue to grow in the coming years, as the share of listed companies has been continuously declining for two decades. In Europe, the number of listed companies has fallen by almost 23% since 2009, while the number of private companies has risen by over 17%.(3) Germany showcases a distinct extreme in relation to this development. Here, over 98% of companies with more than 100 million euro turnover are privately owned.(4) These include numerous ‘hidden champions’ that are global market leaders in their field and represent the strength and innovative power of mid-market enterprises. Companies worldwide instead of going public prefer to remain private completely or significantly longer than before and are increasingly financing themselves via private equity. One reason for this shift is the growing need for long-term financing that private equity can offer, to adapt to advancements like artificial intelligence; additionally, accessing this capital has become more attainable. Private equity also offers more flexibility in the development of business models and strategies, contrary to what was often assumed in the past. As a result, a large part of economic value creation is shifting to the private markets. Their invested volume almost quadrupled globally between 2013 and 2023 to USD 15 trillion and is expected to rise further to USD 29 trillion by 2030.(5) Accordingly, the demand for private equity is increasing, as the asset class offers suitable investors additional investment opportunities to diversify their portfolio with high return potential. For investors who have a long investment horizon, not needing to access their money in the short term and with the corresponding risk capacity, private equity has achieved 14.9% annual growth in US dollars over the past 20 years - outperforming the popular MSCI World Index.(6) In the context of asset allocation, analyses from the BlackRock Investment Institute indicate that a mix of private market investments can be sensible at up to 20% of a portfolio. Such an allocation to a traditional portfolio with 60% stocks and 40% bonds shows a better risk-return profile in historical comparison: the expected return increases from 5.5% to 7.2% over a ten-year period, while the risk disproportionately rises from 11.3% to 12.7%.(7) This return potential is now made available to Scalable Capital clients with the respective risk capacity. Long-standing expertise in modern fund structureThe BlackRock Private Equity Fund focuses on co-investments in which majority stakes in private companies around the world are acquired together with an established network of leading private equity managers (so-called buyouts). In order to make such long-term investments in the real economy accessible to suitable investors, the European Commission created a regulation called the European long-term investment funds (ELTIF) in 2015 and recently simplified it further. Contrary to many previous private equity funds, which were mostly closed, this fund is structured as an open-end fund. This means that investors are more flexible in terms of the time of their investment and can redeem invested capital more regularly as with closed-end funds after the second anniversary of the fund’s launch date. Returns and dividends are reinvested by the fund which may result in higher compound interest and higher returns in the long term. BlackRock has more than two decades of experience in investing in the private equity asset class on behalf of its clients. The co-investment approach enables lower costs relative to similar funds and broad diversification across sectors, investment periods and regions. Fund assets can be invested quickly thanks to broad market access. Co-investments also offer the advantage that several investors thoroughly check and analyse which companies to invest in.Christian Bimueller, Head of Digital Distribution Continental Europe at BlackRock: “We’re very excited to introduce our new Private Equity solution onto Scalable Capital’s investment platform, allowing wealth investors in Germany digital access to BlackRock’s private markets capabilities for the first time. With private companies increasingly driving economic growth, we are offering a unique opportunity for long-term investors to unlock potential returns blending with traditional public markets. By breaking down barriers to investing in private assets, we are enabling wealth investors to diversify their portfolios and access institutional-quality private market investments in a digital format.”Simple investment in private equity through seamless integration into the Scalable BrokerAlternative investments will be seamlessly integrated into the Scalable Broker. The access happens conveniently via the app, where manual and postal steps are no longer required. Investors in alternative investments can also expect automatic offsetting of capital gains against loss pots and exemption orders as natural as for all other securities. Scalable Capital has added numerous functions to its platform specifically for the new asset class: the fully digitalised suitability check, a two-week revocation option for purchase orders and a comprehensive range of information to make an informed assessment of the long-term investment on offer.New asset class first in the Scalable BrokerInterested parties in Germany can from now on sign up to a waiting list to receive regular updates until the planned start in April. They will also receive information on private markets investments and be the first to find out when the BlackRock Private Equity Fund will be available in the Scalable Broker.Shares can be redeemed for the first time two years after the fund's launch. After that, a sale is possible in general once a quarter. Due to the long-term nature of the investments, the total of redemptions are limited to 5% of the fund volume. There are no front-end loads nor redemption fees. The management fee for the actively managed fund is 1.95% p.a. If the fund exceeds its minimum return, the fund manager also receives a performance-related profit share.

The top brass from JP Morgan, Blackrock, Abrdn, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Fidelity, and Schroders were welcomed into No11 Downing Street for breakfast this morning, as part of ongoing engagement with industry to hone the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy - one of the eight key growth sectors identified in the Modern Industrial Strategy.Rachel Reeves spoke about the importance of going further and faster to drive growth and revealed that the Government had accepted all recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group - confirming that the UK will move to a ‘T+1’ standard for settling securities trades from 11 October 2027.The change means that a typical securities trade, such as buying and selling shares, would be settled the day after it is agreed - instead of the current two-day standard. Faster settlement will support economic growth by putting the UK at the forefront of modernised, highly efficient and automated capital markets, bringing the UK into line with key international markets such as the US and reducing costs for investors by limiting risks when making trades.Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said: I am determined to go further and faster to drive growth and put more money into people’s pockets through our Plan for Change. Speeding up the settlement of trades makes our financial markets more efficient and internationally competitive.Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, Nikhil Rathi said: We highlighted how the move to T+1 will make our markets more efficient and support growth in our recent letter to the Prime Minister. We will support industry as they move to T+1 and expect firms to engage and plan early.Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey said: Shortening the UK securities settlement cycle to T+1 will bring important financial stability benefits from reduced counterparty credit risk in financial markets. It is important that firms and settlement infrastructures have robust plans for an orderly transition in October 2027. As part of this effort, the Bank looks forward to continuing dialogue with regulators in other markets which are pursuing similar changes.The government has accepted all the recommendations made by the Accelerated Settlement Technical Group, which has created a detailed implementation plan to ensure a smooth transition to T+1, and confirmed that it will bring forward legislation to implement the change, including setting the date to move to the new standard. Terms of Reference have been published for the next phase of the project, which will continue to be led by the industry taskforce with Andrew Douglas as chair and HMT, the FCA and the Bank as observers. Industry chairs from the EU and Switzerland have also been invited to observe the UK industry taskforce to encourage alignment across Europe.The taskforce will oversee and manage implementation of the recommendations up until T+1 is successfully implemented, and for a short period afterwards to evaluate the short-term impacts.The government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England support the industry recommendation to move to T+1 settlement in UK markets by 11 October 2027 and call on the industry to engage with the recommendations and start their planning as soon as possible.Notes to editors Stakeholder commentary:Tiina Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Citi UK said: We welcome the move to a T+1 settlement cycle in UK markets and appreciate the hard work in achieving the alignment of timelines with the EU. Based on Citi’s experience with global investors, coordinated market reforms are critical to the growth and competitiveness of the UK. We look forward to working with other industry participants to ensure a smooth transition in October 2027.Conor Hillery, Deputy CEO & Head of Investment Banking in EMEA, JP Morgan, said: We welcome the Chancellor’s continued dialogue with UK financial services on its role in facilitating growth, which requires the right policy and regulatory framework. This move to a modern T+1 settlement cycle will contribute to keeping London as a competitive financial centre, so we support the government’s efforts to make it happen.Clare Woodman, Head of EMEA and CEO of Morgan Stanley said: We welcome the UK Government’s commitment to move to a T+1 settlement cycle in October 2027. The shift to a shorter settlement cycle will generate market efficiencies supporting the competitiveness of UK markets.Additional notes: The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce recommended that the UK should move to T+1 by the end of 2027. The Technical Group was set up to recommend a detailed implementation plan, including determining the detailed technical and operational changes needed to move to T+1 as well as recommending a precise implementation date. The group’s recommendations are set out in The Accelerated Settlement Taskforce Technical Group report, published on 6 February.

Title: Germany Goes To The Polls On The 23rd February

BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 03: Friedrich Merz, chancellor candidate and leader of the Christian ... [+] Democrats (CDU), speaks to delegates at a CDU party congress on February 03, 2025 in Berlin, Germany. The congress is taking place following Merz's recent controversial move in the Bundestag, in which he sought to push through legislation on immigration and security, knowing it depended on support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Germany faces snap parliamentary elections on February 23. (Photo by Maja Hitij/Getty Images) We are now a few days away from the German general election (February 23), which is becoming even more significant in the context of the Munich Peace Conference where pronouncements from America officials that the U.S. is pushing Europe to take a greater role in its defense (and in that of Ukraine), and in particular the courting of the far-right AfD by both Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance, have proven highly controversial. As we write the center-right CDU has close to 30% in polls, the AfD has 21%, the SDP 15% and the Greens are on 13%. My sense is that the next Chancellor will be Friedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU (allied to the CSU in the south of Germany), and he will lead a coalition, most likely made up of the Social Democrats – where Olaf Scholz might be deposed as leader (by Boris Pistorius) if that party does not perform well. It is possible, given their hawkish stance on Russia that the Green party might also be part of the coalition. At the same time, it is not clear whether the FDP — currently a coalition partner, will garner enough votes to take part in parliament, and the same is true to the far-left, nationalist Sahra Wagenknecht party. The context to the election is important. Germany’s economy has been moribund – weighed down by the shock of the war in Ukraine, a muddled energy policy, the constraints that planning laws put on urban development and a growing debate on immigration, amidst several terror attacks. The economy, immigration and to a lesser extent military spending are the main issues in the campaign. In particular, Merz — a corporate lawyer and former chairman of BlackRock in Germany — has recently upped the ante on immigration, and a week ago proposed a new policy on border control in parliament. The fact that the far-right AfD voted with this proposal caused consternation because the mainstream political parties in Germany have a “firewall” on any form of cooperation with the AfD. In a subsequent public speech Merz stood his ground and re-affirmed his tougher stance on immigration, in a sign that he is prepared to take much bolder policy decisions than Olaf Scholz (who is seen to have had an indecisive chancellorship). The attention that American politicians and Musk have paid to the AfD is not only a sign of poor judgement on their part, but a development that will significantly damage relations between the U.S. and Germany. The AfD have little to no chance of serving in government. Assuming that Merz is elected he has several policy challenges. The first is to reform Germany’s energy policy, potentially by introducing more nuclear and fusion driven power, the second is to pare back planning regulations, and the third will be to find pragmatic ways around Germany’s debt bake in order to permit greater military spending (combat readiness is an very serious issue for Germany’s military). From an economic and investment point of view the question we are focused on is whether the coronation of Merz as chancellor will catalyze a change in sentiment in the German economy, and a recovery in the economy. The DAX index is already powering ahead this year and is one of the best performing equity markets. Once the election is over, the focus will be on the urgency and speed with which a coalition can be formed (compromised will need to be found on issues like tax reform, immigration and foreign policy), and the extent to which Germany starts to play a leadership role on the EU stage.

Check out the other features included with Digiday+ to help you stay ahead When ad agencies first began signing up to the B Corp movement, execs hoped the climate-friendly status would appeal to new clients and draw industry recruits (as well as further environmental causes). Agency leaders still cling to that hope, but they do so in a changed political environment. Last week, Stagwell media agency Assembly certified its European and Asia-Pacific businesses as B Corps. Its U.S., African and Indian businesses are also going through the certification process. At the same time, global full-service agency Dept re-certified its B Corp status — expanding its climate and social commitments beyond its European base and across its global network. Less attention has been given to the companies pulling back from sustainability promises than to those retreating from diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) commitments in recent weeks and months. Amazon, Meta, Publicis Groupe and McDonald’s are among the companies that have reset their DE&I policies, for example. But following the inauguration of President Donald “drill, baby drill” Trump in January, climate commitments could well be the next frontline between right wing politicians and the advertising world. That month, the six largest banks in the U.S., including JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo — as well as asset management firm BlackRock — announced their withdrawal from a collective agreement first signed at Cop26, which pledged to support net zero-aligned investments. The announcement came just a week before the Palisades Fire began tearing through much of Los Angeles County. “There’s quite a lot of negative discourse at the moment surrounding sustainability and companies pulling targets and their commitments,” said Gaby Sethi, head of global impact at Assembly. In addition to its B Corp certification, ​​Wayne Blodwell, Assembly’s recently appointed global svp of programmatic, has been tasked with making the agency’s media trading practices more environmentally sustainable, according to Sethi. “We are using this as a moment to double down on what we’re doing and why we’re doing it, and making sure that our people know that we’re not going to be swayed,” she said. It’s a marked change from the business atmosphere of just a few years ago, when companies forged ahead on climate promises and the industry’s biggest players made public pledges to reduce advertising’s direct impact on the environment. Since 2022 GroupM, for example, has worked to reduce its carbon emissions per media impressions by half, by the end of the decade. It’s unclear how far along the media network is in that goal, but in its most recent update on its progress (in WPP’s 2024 annual report), GroupM owner WPP reported it had reduced its CO2 emissions 18% year-on-year. A spokesperson for the network told Digiday that its commitments are “key” to competitive reviews, but especially for ones covering EMEA. It’s less of a concern for U.S. clients. B Corp status is a difficult label to acquire for many businesses — Sethi said the process took over two years for Assembly — and requires that companies alter the legal “articles of incorporation” documents to include commitments to the planet and society, as well as to shareholders. Where it matters to clients, though, is during the initial stages of a competitive pitch. In October, for example, Chocolate brand Tony’s Chocolonely, for example, partially credited its decision to work with agency Total Mediaplus to its B Corp status. Similarly, Sethi credited two client wins to the agency certifying as a B Corp, though she declined to name the new accounts. “Having the B Corp status has been really important,” she told Digiday. For the most part, however, climate and sustainability commitments remain common ”hygiene factors” for brands reviewing prospective partners — not “deciding factors” — according to MediaSense’s chief strategy officer, Ryan Kangisser. “You want to know that you’re doing business with companies that are focused on the right things,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve won any pitches on being B Corp in itself,” said Dept CEO Dimi Albers, who added that the badge gave agencies a calling card that expressed their values to clients. It hadn’t tipped Dept over the edge in a pitch, but he said: “Informally, I think it’s a massive difference maker.” Even if B Corp status or other environmental commitments aren’t deciding factors for clients, they do help agencies recruit staff. Albers said Dept’s B Corp status had helped it hire new talent since it first qualified, while Sethi told Digiday: “We’ve started to see it come [up] in the conversations we’re having with candidates.” Ultimately, a claim to have access to the best talent can also become a selling point for an agency’s new business team. “For clients, that’s music to their ears,” said Kangisser. Agencies act downstream of their clients, though. Before Citi Bank and JP Morgan Chase cut their ties to the Net Zero Banking Alliance, several brands had already decided their commitments to climate-friendly business had become obstacles. In 2024, Nike laid off sustainability staffers during its summer restructuring; Crocs set its net zero target back another 10 years to 2040; and Coca-Cola and Nestlé missed virgin plastic-reduction targets. That July four Havas agencies — the holding company was the first of the big agencies to embrace B Corp as a vehicle for environmental and social progress — were stripped of their accreditation by B Lab, the company that manages the scheme, after it decided Havas Media Network’s appointment to Shell’s global media account was ”a breach of the B Corp community’s core values.” And the Global Media Sustainability Framework (GMSF), initially unveiled by the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM) and Ad Net Zero at Cannes Lions — was then left without its central patron after GARM folded under the pressure of an Elon Musk lawsuit. After years of mounting climate commitments from advertisers, Dept global impact lead Pooja Dingidal said companies must now factor in a political “backlash” to their thinking about risk. Meanwhile, those that would like to jettison eco-friendly policies to aid the bottom line have the political cover to do so. It would be unsurprising if, now that some advertisers are taking their foot off the gas, agencies consider following in their wake. While Assembly and Dept are sticking to their promises — others may decide that if clients aren’t impressed, the work of B Corp accreditation or net zero targets aren’t worth it. Whether that holds for the rest of the year is anyone’s guess, but Amazon’s impact on ad pricing is already undeniable. Shifting search habits have put a dent in Google’s market dominance. It’s not the only company affected, though. Digiday caught up with Snap executive Sid Malhotra to get the lowdown on how important SMBs are to Snapchat’s overall ad revenue stream, what the platform can offer advertisers that its platform peers can’t, and what prevented advertisers from giving the company a proper chance — until now.
