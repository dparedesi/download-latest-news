Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Panama Canal Authority Administrator Ricaurte Vasquez tour the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City Feb. 2, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS By Clare Jim and Scott Murdoch March 5 (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump has hailed a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8 billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison which includes assets along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the U.S. consortium control of key Panama Canal ports amid White House calls to remove them from what it claims is Chinese ownership. On the first trading day after the deal’s announcement, CK Hutchison stock soared nearly 25%. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” The deal with the BlackRock-led consortium includes 90% of Panama Ports Company, which has operated the Balboa and Cristobal ports at each end of the canal for over two decades, CK Hutchison said. In total, the consortium, which includes Terminal Investment and Global Infrastructure Partners, will control 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries, the conglomerate said. The conglomerate’s stock rose as much 24.7% on Wednesday, outpacing a 1.7% rise in Hong Kong’s broader Hang Seng Index .HSI. Its price is now the highest since August 1, 2023. The sale involves CK Hutchison’s 80% stake in Hutchison Ports with an equity value of $14.21 billion. However, the conglomerate will receive more than $19 billion following repayment of some shareholder loans. The size of the proceeds would be similar to CK Hutchison’s entire Hong Kong market value prior to Wednesday’s share rally. The remainder of Hutchison Ports is owned by Singapore’s PSA International. About 12,000 ships used the Panama Canal last year that connects 1,920 ports across 170 countries. Its position is strategic for the U.S. as more than three-quarters of vessels passing through originate in or are bound for the United States. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt in a statement. The conglomerate had been waiting for Panama Supreme Court to make a final ruling about the legal status of its contract to operate the ports after the local attorney general determined the contract “unconstitutional.” SURPRISE CK Hutchison, controlled by billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing, has businesses in areas as varied as infrastructure, retail and telecom. It is also the world’s largest privately owned port operator. The sale of the ports unit does not include any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China, the conglomerate said in the statement. Sixt said the transaction was the result of “a rapid, discrete but competitive process” during which CK Hutchison received numerous bids and expressions of interest. JPMorgan in a report said while selling the Panama business is “understandable,” the deal is nevertheless a “surprise” given most of CK Hutchison’s other ports are not in regions directly exposed to Sino-U.S. geopolitical tension. It could be “an opportunistic deal,” JPMorgan said. “Based on our understanding of the management philosophy of CKH, any deal is possible as long as ‘the price is right’.” The brokerage said the deal would represent a significant strategy shift because ports would only account for 1% of the conglomerates earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, from 15%. The contribution of infrastructure, currently the largest segment, will rise to 33% from 28%. The $19 billion that CK Hutchison is set to receive from the sale is well above a $13 billion valuation on the ports assets estimated by analysts. “The disposal would be significantly value enhancing for CK Hutchison if it is completed on the preliminary essential terms,” Citigroup analysts said. CK Hutchison’s net debt level was HK$138 billion ($17.76 billion) in June and the sales proceeds could put the conglomerate into a net cash position, UBS analysts said.

The sale is "wholly unrelated to recent political news", a managing director said but was welcomed by President Donald Trump who said his administration "will be reclaiming" the Panama Canal. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Wednesday 5 March 2025 14:45, UK Two major Panama Canal ports have been sold from their Hong Kong owner to a consortium including American multinational investment company BlackRock. It comes after US President Donald Trump expressed a desire for America to "take back" the key shipping lane from alleged Chinese control. Hong Kong-based logistics giant CK Hutchison Holdings announced plans to sell a majority stake in the business that controls Balboa and Cristobal ports - which sit at each end of the shipping lane. The sale is of a 90% interest in Panama Ports Company, which is contracted to run the important ports until 2047. Money blog: Dollar sinks and market gains wiped out The Panamanian ports are being sold to a consortium including US financial behemoth BlackRock for nearly $23bn (£17.8bn). It comes after President Donald Trump applied pressure to end what he says is China's influence and control over the important shipping lane through which most goods pass. As part of wider comments, on taking control of other sovereign territories, Mr Trump threatened earlier this year to "take [the canal] back" having said, "China is running the Panama Canal". However, on Wednesday, CK Hutchinson Holdings insisted that the deal was "wholly unrelated to recent political news". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The deal was made a month after a visit to Panama City by US secretary of state Marco Rubio and was welcomed by Trump on Tuesday night. A happy Trump "My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," Mr Trump told Congress. "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals." The purchase is part of a wider deal for Hutchison Port's global business. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries, CK Hutchison Holdings said. The conglomerate pushed back against the idea the deal was impacted by politics.

A Hong Kong-based company has announced plans to sell a controlling stake in a business operating two major ports on the Panama Canal to a consortium of investors led by an American multinational. The deal comes amid mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump over alleged Chinese influence on the crucial waterway. Addressing a special joint session of the two chambers of the US Congress on Tuesday, the US president claimed he is making a successful diplomatic push to reclaim the Panama Canal, which he describes as a vital infrastructure project created by Americans for Americans. Asian logistics giant CK Hutchison Holdings will sell a 90% interest in Panama Ports Company to a consortium that includes US investment holding BlackRock, its subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners, and Geneva-based container terminals major Terminal Investment, according to a joint statement issued by CK Hutchison and BlackRock on Tuesday. Panama Ports Company holds the contract to run the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at the Pacific and Atlantic entrances of the canal respectively, until 2047. The deal also covers the sale of an 80% stake of CK Hutchison’s ports subsidiaries operating 43 ports across 23 countries, including in the UK, Germany, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, and South Korea. According to the statement, the agreement, valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, does not have any interest in a trust that “operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China.” Shares of CK Hutchison, the market capitalization of which amounts to HK$148 billion ($19 billion) soared 22% in morning trading in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Trump has repeatedly threatened to take back control of the Panama Canal, citing “ridiculous fees” and concerns over China’s growing influence around the waterway, which was built by the US in the early 20th century and handed over to Panama in 1999. In February, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino made a concession to Washington by refusing to renew the country’s 2017 agreements with China under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Title: Reclaiming the Panama Canal, the end of wokism, flag on Mars: Highlights from Trump’s keynote speech to Congress
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/613742-trump-congress-speech-recap/
Time Published: 2025-03-05T08:51:42Z

US President Donald Trump reaffirmed key tenets of his ‘America First’ agenda during his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening, and outlined the steps his administration has taken to make good on his campaign promises since he took office in January. The televised speech followed a largely anticipated trajectory and was largely directed at the president’s voter base. Although functionally analogous to a State of the Union address, it is not classified as such within American political tradition, as Trump delivered it in his inauguration year. As Trump entered the House chamber at the US Capitol, his supporters chanted “USA!” while detractors jeered, foreshadowing the turmoil that would unfold later. Heckling from Democratic Representative Al Green of Texas and others necessitated an interruption in Trump’s speech, prompting Speaker Mike Johnson to have the 77-year-old lawmaker escorted out. Throughout his address, the president criticized his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, accusing him of undermining the country’s interests through his policies. He also launched a personal attack against Senator Elizabeth Warren, referring to her as “Pocahontas,” a taunt referencing her disputed claims of Native American ancestry. Trump reiterated his commitment to ending the Ukraine conflict, asserting that Warren would prefer it to persist for another five years. He emphasized that hostilities between Kiev and Moscow have resulted in millions of unnecessary casualties, calling the violence “senseless.” The speech followed a recent quarrel in the White House that disrupted a US-Ukrainian minerals deal. A signing ceremony scheduled for last Friday was canceled after Vladimir Zelensky questioned Trump’s willingness to engage with Russia and reiterated Kiev’s demand for American security guarantees. The US president and Vice President J.D. Vance then chastised him for perceived ingratitude and inflexibility. In the Tuesday speech, however, Trump said that the minerals agreement was back on track, citing Zelensky’s recent commitment to peace and partnership with the US, and reiterated that fostering normal diplomatic relations with Russia serves American interests. Trump reaffirmed his foreign policy ambitions, particularly regarding Panama and Denmark. He declared that his administration is “reclaiming the Panama Canal” for the sake of US national security, seemingly referencing recent reports that US investment firm BlackRock will be purchasing the port infrastructure from its current Chinese owner. ”The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others,” Trump asserted, noting that while other nations may use this strategic link between the Atlantic and Pacific, “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back.” He further expressed support for the right of the people of Greenland to determine their future, suggesting they could break away from Denmark and join the US. Trump said Washington needs the island and will secure it “one way or the other,” despite Copenhagen’s rejection of Trump's previous offer to purchase the land. The speech primarily focused on domestic issues, with Trump spotlighting his administration’s achievements in crucial areas like border security. During his campaign, he promised a robust crackdown on illegal immigration, implementing measures such as deportations and intensified law enforcement. Among the guests Trump invited to Capitol Hill were individuals intimately connected to the debate: family members of crime victims allegedly targeted by undocumented immigrants, a US Border Patrol agent who was injured near the Rio Grande in the line of duty, and a teenage boy battling brain cancer, whose dream to become a cop earned him honorary membership in a Florida police department. Trump claimed credit for turning the tide on “woke policies” – left-wing initiatives at the center of America’s cultural wars. He declared a nationwide end to “the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies,” stating that “our country will be woke no longer.” He called on Congress to criminalize “sex changes on children,” denouncing the notion that a child can be “trapped in the wrong body” as “a big lie.” While LGBTQ activists argue that the Trump administration's stance marginalizes individuals grappling with their identity, his supporters view his policies as a long-overdue measure to protect impressionable teens from life-ruining hormone treatments and genital mutilation. Additionally, Trump defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, proclaiming that American soldiers “won’t be activists and ideologues – they will be fighters and warriors.” Trump praised Elon Musk for his efforts to curb government waste and corruption through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), claiming that billions in fraud have been uncovered under the billionaire’s leadership. He warned federal employees opposing his goal of dismantling the “rule by unelected bureaucrats” that they would face termination. Celebrating the American spirit of pioneers and civilization builders, Trump vowed that his second term would yield significant accomplishments. He said: “We are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond.” Musk strongly advocates for the colonization of Mars.

Title: Li Ka-Shing’s CK Hutchison To Sell Panama Canal Ports To BlackRock As Part Of $23 Billion Deal

Li Ka-shing, senior advisor of CK Hutchison. CK Hutchison Holdings, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed to sell a majority stake in its Panama Canal ports to a BlackRock-led consortium, after U.S. President Donald Trump raised concerns over perceived Chinese influence on the critical trade waterway. CK Hutchison said late Tuesday it’s selling a 90% stake in its Panama Ports Co. to BlackRock and its Global Infrastructure Partners unit, as well as Terminal Investment, the port unit of Swiss billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s shipping giant MSC. Panama Ports Co. operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in the pro-U.S. country, which are located at either side of the Panama Canal; Balboa is on the Pacific Ocean end and Cristobal is on the Atlantic Ocean side. The deal also involves CK Hutchison divesting an 80% interest in Hutchison Ports, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries, the company said in a statement. The deal is worth $22.8 billion and will earn CK Hutchison cash proceeds of more than $19 billion if finalized, according to the statement. The consortium has agreed that negotiations will be on an exclusive basis for 145 days. Shares of CK Hutchison on the Hong Kong stock exchange surged almost 22% on Wednesday, boosting its market cap to HK$180.4 billion ($23.2 billion). CK Hutchison has been operating the ports of Balboa (pictured) and Cristobal at the Panama Canal for almost three decades. CK Hutchison, whose business operations span ports, retail, infrastructure and telecommunications in about 50 countries, has in recent months been caught in political crosshairs. It started in December, when Trump threatened to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal, which handles about 5% of global trade annually. Trump accused Panama of charging the U.S., the canal’s biggest user, excessive rates, and claimed that the Central American country had ceded control of the waterway to China. China and Panama deny the claim. A U.S.-Panama treaty signed in 1977 requires the Panama Canal to remain neutral after Washington handed over the American-built shipping lane to Panama in 1999. In a joint address to Congress in Washington D.C. on Tuesday, Trump touted BlackRock’s deal to buy the two Panama Canal ports. “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,” said Trump. “That agreement (the 1977 treaty) has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt said in the statement that the transaction “is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” CK Hutchison is the biggest port operator by market share at the Panama Canal, followed by America’s SSA Marine, Taiwan’s Evergreen and Singapore’s PSA. The Hong Kong-based conglomerate has been running the ports on both entrances of the Panama Canal for almost three decades. In the first half of 2024, CK Hutchison generated 20% of its HK$28.8 billion earnings before interest and taxes from its ports operation, making it the company’s third-biggest business. During the same period, it earned HK$21.6 billion in revenue from ports operation, with 82% of it coming from ports outside of mainland China and Hong Kong. “The deal will remove business uncertainty for CK Hutchison,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong in a note. “The company is well positioned to replenish its portfolio with assets that are less prone to geopolitical tensions.”

While not an official State of the Union address, Trump's speech laid out his vision for a second term and promised "the golden age of America has only just begun." By Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore, Ben Cohen, Alan Jaffe, Jessica McDonald, Catalina Jaramillo, Saranac Hale Spencer and Lori Robertson Posted on March 5, 2025 Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino. In his first address to a joint session of Congress in his second term, President Donald Trump distorted the facts on fraud, immigration, aid to Ukraine, the economy, autism and more. While this address, coming early in a new term, technically isn’t a State of the Union address, Trump’s March 4 speech was longer than any prior SOTU, clocking in at an hour and 39 minutes, as measured by the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Trump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by White House adviser Elon Musk, has “found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.” However, the most recent update on DOGE’s website from March 2 reports that the department has only created an estimated $105 billion in savings thus far. Although Trump ticked off several examples of what he called “appalling waste” found by DOGE, it’s unclear if any of the savings touted by DOGE are related to actual fraud. We also cannot verify DOGE’s savings figure, as the department has not yet uploaded evidence of each transaction it has conducted. The website includes a “Wall of Receipts” described as “a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30% of total savings.” However, the “subset” of transactions listed on the website does not meet this 30% threshold. In total, DOGE’s “Wall of Receipts” lists about $19.8 billion in estimated savings, which is less than 19% of the $105 billion in total savings claimed by the department. Of this $19.8 billion in savings, $8.9 billion comes from the cancellation of contracts, $10.3 billion comes from the termination of grants, and $660 million comes from the termination of government leases. DOGE has faced scrutiny for inflating and miscalculating the savings figures posted on its website. The New York Times reported that DOGE deleted hundreds of transactions previously posted to its “Wall of Receipts” and also found that DOGE incorrectly claimed credit for canceling government contracts that had already been terminated before Trump entered office. Other errors by DOGE identified in media reports include a typo mislabeling $8 million in savings as $8 billion and triple-counting the cancellation of a single contract. Speaking about DOGE’s efforts on Feb. 11, Musk said, “We will make mistakes, but we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes.” Trump went on to cite a Government Accountability Office report that estimated annual fraud losses to the government of between $233 billion and $521 billion. But we could not verify how much, if any, of the DOGE savings identified to date includes instances of fraud. Rather, most of the savings appears to be related to spending that it deemed wasteful. In a Feb. 16 post on X, White House adviser Elon Musk shared a screenshot of a spreadsheet denoting that the Social Security database categorizes nearly 21 million people over the age of 99 as alive. Trump read the data from Musk’s post during his speech and misleadingly claimed that “money is being paid to many of” the centenarians still listed as alive. As we’ve written, internal audits conducted by the Office of Audit in the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Inspector General have identified that millions of deceased individuals were still listed as living in the Social Security database. However, the number of dead recipients still being sent benefits is likely in the thousands, not the millions. In total, the SSA distributed payments to 89,106 individuals aged 99 and older in December 2024. A July 2023 report published by the Office of Audit found that there were 18.9 million people with Social Security numbers born in 1920 or earlier with no record of their deaths. The vast majority of these records are clearly outdated, as the Pew Research Center estimated that there were only 101,000 Americans who were 100 and older in 2024. However, very few of these dead individuals incorrectly labeled as alive still receive Social Security benefits. Among this group of 18.9 million, the report found that only 44,000, or 0.2%, were still receiving Social Security benefits. The report did not specify how many of these benefit payments were believed to be improper. A portion of the 44,000 recipients were likely living Americans over the age of 103 who continued to receive payments in July 2023. The Office of Audit provided a more specific estimate of improper payments to deceased individuals in a November 2021 report. That report concluded that the “SSA issued approximately $298 million in payments to about 24,000 deceased beneficiaries in suspended payment status.” The report also noted that while the SSA did recover some of the funds, $214 million of the improper payments remained unaccounted for. In a statement published on Feb. 19, Lee Dudek, the newly appointed acting commissioner of the SSA, explained that the data posted by Musk does not reveal millions of dead individuals who continue to receive benefits. “I also want to acknowledge recent reporting about the number of people older than age 100 who may be receiving benefits from Social Security,” he said. “The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits.” In September 2015, the SSA began a process that automatically designates individuals aged 115 and older as deceased and ends payments to them. Trump repeated a claim he’s made frequently in recent weeks – telling the joint session of Congress that “we’ve spent perhaps $350 billion” to support Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion since 2022, while Europe has spent $100 billion. Those figures are wrong. As we’ve written before, the total amount that Congress has appropriated since 2022 is $174.2 billion. According to a report from the special inspector general who is overseeing the U.S. support for Ukraine, the U.S. has made a total of $182.75 billion available for the broader response. Figures from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organization that tracks funding for Ukraine, show that the U.S. has so far allocated about $121 billion compared with about $140 billion from Europe. Additionally, the institute shows that Europe has committed another $122 billion that hasn’t yet been allocated, while the U.S. has committed another $5 billion. The institute’s figures include direct, bilateral aid. We didn’t get an immediate response from the White House to an email asking where Trump had gotten his numbers. Trump exaggerated the state of the economy when he took office earlier this year, and he misleadingly placed the blame for higher consumer prices solely on the Biden administration. “As you know, we inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” Trump said. “Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up the cost of groceries, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions of Americans. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country — they’re not sure.” As we wrote in January, before Trump began his second presidential term, he inherited a “resilient economy that has grown by at least 2.5% every year since he left office in early 2021,” as well as a “post-pandemic jobs boom that has driven the unemployment rate well below the historical norm.” We also noted that inflation “has come down significantly” from the annual inflation rate of 9.1% in June 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that was “the largest 12-month change since the period ending November 1981” — not in history, as Trump said. Most recently, the Consumer Price Index increased 3% for the 12-month period ending in January. It’s also wrong to suggest that Biden administration policies alone increased prices on energy, food and other consumer goods. As we’ve also written, economists primarily blame the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain disruptions that followed and rising labor costs, among other reasons, for the dramatic price increases while Biden was president. Shortly after introducing DJ Daniel, a 13-year-old who was diagnosed six years ago with brain cancer, Trump cited two autism prevalence figures that need context. “Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong,” the president said. “As an example, not long ago — and you can’t even believe these numbers — 1 in 10,000 children had autism. 1 in 10,000. And now it’s 1 in 36. There’s something wrong. 1 in 36 — think of it. “So we’re going to find out what it is and there’s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you,” he continued, referring to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “to figure out what is going on.” Trump made nearly identical remarks about the autism rate on Feb. 13 when swearing in Kennedy as the new health secretary. Trump’s higher figure of 1 in 36 is correct. That’s the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest estimate, in 2020, of the number of U.S. children who have been identified with autism. The 1 in 10,000 number, however, is decades old — and isn’t directly comparable to today’s figure. As we’ve explained before, some studies in the 1960s and ’70s estimated autism affected about 1 to 5 in 10,000 kids. But these studies used a much more stringent definition of autism. Awareness and recognition of autism has also dramatically improved since then. Much of “what is going on,” then, is actually a broader clinical definition of autism capturing more mild cases, along with better awareness. There may be a slight true increase in the condition, researchers say, in part due to known risk factors, including parents having children at older ages and more babies surviving birth complications. Autism is largely a genetic disease. Kennedy and others around him have previously used the same or similar statistics to falsely suggest that vaccines may be behind the surge in autism diagnoses. Numerous studies have failed to find any link between autism and vaccines. Trump said the Biden administration had “closed more than 100 power plants.” That’s misleading. The number of electric power plants went up by 2,187 since the last full year of Trump’s first administration to 2023, according to the latest data from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration. The number of power plants fueled by coal did decrease by 57 plants, from 284 in 2020 to 227 in 2023. Plants powered by petroleum and other fossil gas also declined by 23 plants. But the number of other types of electric power plants, including natural gas and renewable energy, went up. In April 2024, a rule finalized by the Biden administration to limit the pollution from existing coal power plants required those plants, and any new natural gas-fired power plants, to capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032, if they intend to operate after 2039. The rule was contested by some Republican states and industry groups, but in October the Supreme Court decided that the rule could go into effect while legal cases work their way through the courts. During his campaign, Trump promised to kill Biden’s power plant rules. Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently advocated for the need for coal-fired power plants, Bloomberg reported. In February, the EIA reported that electricity generators plan to retire about 8 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity this year. During his address to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said, “We are opening up many of those power plants right now.” Trump said he is focused on “building the most powerful military of the future,” and one of the first steps will be building a “Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland.” “Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago,” Trump said, “but the technology just wasn’t there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It’s incredible, actually. And other places, they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it, and the United States should have it too, right?” But the technology for the U.S. isn’t there yet. Trump said repeatedly during his campaign that during his presidency the U.S. would develop a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Israel has used that air defense system since 2011 to shoot down short-range rockets fired from neighboring Gaza. Israel’s Iron Dome, along with its Arrow 3 system — an air defense system that can intercept ballistic missiles — and with help from the U.S. and others, shot down nearly 300 drones and missiles launched at Israel by Iran in April 2024. Israel’s system, developed by an Israeli company and the U.S. weapons manufacturer Raytheon, can detect and intercept “a variety of shorter-range targets such as rockets, artillery and mortars,” Raytheon’s website explains. The system can target threats launched from 2.5 to 43.5 miles away. But “against the normal threats to U.S. security, the Iron Dome is not a useful system,” Stephen Biddle, adjunct senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us when we wrote about this issue last year. “Iron Dome is designed to deal with short-range threats, especially unguided rockets,” not long-range ballistic missiles that could be launched by China, Russia or North Korea. “If the North Koreans launched intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S., an Iron Dome would not be able to intercept reentry vehicles,” explained Biddle, referring to the parts of intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying warheads back into Earth’s atmosphere before hitting a target. The defense technology company Lockheed Martin is apparently working on a “Golden Dome” system that Trump referred to in his remarks to Congress, and the Pentagon is seeking proposals from other defense contractors. The Lockheed Martin website says, “[W]e will bring in the best and brightest of American innovation to rapidly develop game-changing tech – like space-based interceptors and hypersonic defenses – that will ensure America’s Golden Dome stays well ahead of adversary threats.” But the Golden Dome technology is still being developed, and defense experts are skeptical that a missile defense system will be able to protect the entire U.S. Trump made several misleading and unsupported claims about immigration. Trump began by boasting that after declaring a national emergency on the southern border and cracking down on illegal immigration, by February, his first full month in office, apprehensions of those crossing the border illegally “were by far the lowest ever recorded.” Although U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not yet released its official February apprehensions data, the agency reported via X on March 1 that February “saw just 8,326 encounters at the Southwest border—the lowest documented by U.S. Border Patrol.” That eclipses the figure of 11,127 in April 2017, Trump’s third full month in office during his first term — and previously the lowest month going back to at least 2000. However, it’s not the lowest “ever recorded.” Government data going back to 1925 shows entire years in the 1920s and 1930s that were close to the February figure. Trump went on to say that under Biden, “there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month.” Illegal immigration did soar through most of the years Biden was in office, with apprehensions by Border Patrol averaging about 150,000 per month. Apprehensions reached a monthly high of 251,178 in December 2023. But the numbers dropped dramatically after Biden enacted emergency measures in June 2024 to restrict asylum eligibility for those illegal border-crossers. Between July and December, the last full month under Biden, apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally averaged about 55,000 per month. That’s lower than the average during the last few months of Trump’s first term. We should note that after tough talk on immigration in the 2016 campaign, the number of apprehensions plummeted in the first few months of Trump’s first term as well, what some referred to as “the Trump Effect.” After that dip in the months immediately after he took office, apprehensions of illegal border-crossers steadily increased over the next two years, reaching a peak of 132,856 in May 2019. The figures then began to steadily decline again, going to 16,182 in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic. Trump also made his oft-repeated but unsupported claim that “people from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country.” As we have written, immigration experts in the U.S. and in countries in South America where Trump has alleged that kind of activity have told us they have seen no evidence of that. And finally, Trump claimed that “over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States.” As we have written, that’s double the total number of people caught trying to enter the country illegally (7.3 million, which includes repeat attempts), those who came to legal ports of entry without authorization to enter (1.2 million), and the estimated number who evaded capture (2 million). Comprehensive Department of Homeland Security data on the initial processing of these encounters show that 2.9 million were removed by CBP and 3.2 million were released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or given other classifications, such as parole. While talking about his reasons for putting new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, Trump claimed that both countries have “allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.” But comparing Canada to Mexico is misleading. No one knows exactly how much illicit fentanyl comes into the U.S. each year because comprehensive data is not available. U.S. Customs and Border Protection does publish drug seizure statistics, which are often used as a proxy for how much gets into the country undetected. The 43 pounds of fentanyl seized by authorities at the northern border in fiscal year 2024 is more than the 2 pounds seized in fiscal 2023 and the 14 pounds seized in fiscal 2022. But that is significantly less than the 21,148 pounds of fentanyl seized by officials at the southwest border with Mexico during the 2024 fiscal cycle. As we’ve written, for at least the last three full fiscal years, the amount of fentanyl captured coming into the U.S. from Canada has made up less than 1% of the fentanyl seized nationwide by the Border Patrol and the Office of Field Operations. Trump repeated a false claim about the oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S. “As you’ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far,” Trump said. “And now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It’s called drill, baby, drill.” As we’ve written before, Trump is wrong. The Brookings Institution has noted that while “estimating reserves is an inexact science and methodologies differ,” the U.S. generally ranks between ninth and 11th in the world in the size of its crude oil reserves, and it ranks fourth or fifth in recoverable natural gas reserves. And although Trump would like oil and gas companies to do more drilling, it’s worth noting that oil and gas production in the U.S. already reached new record levels in 2024. Trump wrongly repeated his claims that 38,000 American lives were lost during construction of the Panama Canal and that Panama had ceded control of the canal to China. The canal was “built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure, 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work,” Trump said. As we have written, Trump grossly overstates the number of American lives lost building the canal. About 7,600 people died during the more than decade-long American phase of the construction of the Panama Canal, which started in 1904, according to Noel Maurer, an associate professor of international affairs and international business at George Washington University, and co-author of the book, “The Big Ditch: How America Took, Built, Ran, and Ultimately Gave Away the Panama Canal.” Most of those deaths weren’t Americans, Maurer told us via email. “Rather, about two-thirds of them were either West Indian (mostly from Barbados), and a smaller unknown share of Spanish laborers who were hired at the start of construction.” In total, fewer than 1,000 Americans died due to accident or infectious disease during the canal’s construction phase, he said. Trump also continued to falsely suggest that China has been operating the canal. The canal “was given away by the Carter administration for $1 but that agreement has been violated very severely,” Trump said. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” It’s not accurate to say the canal was given to China. A Hong Kong-based company managed ports at either end of the canal, which has raised concerns among some in the U.S., including the head of U.S. Southern Command, who last year warned Congress the ports could be used by the Chinese military as “points of future multi-domain access.” But canal experts and Panamanian officials have said China had no involvement in operation of the canal. And in any case, as Trump noted in his speech, an American investment group led by BlackRock has agreed to purchase both ports owned by the Hong Kong company.

Q: Is it true that under the SAVE Act married women will not be able to register to vote if their married name doesn’t match their birth certificate? A: The proposed SAVE Act instructs states to establish a process for people whose legal name doesn’t match their birth certificate to provide additional documents. But voting rights advocates say that married women and others who have changed their names may face difficulty when registering because of the ambiguity in the bill over what documents may be accepted.

Title: SGOV, STIP, TIP iShares ETFs: Claim Your State Income Tax Exemption (2024/2025)

My Money Blog As a follow-up to my posts for Vanguard and Fidelity money market funds, iShares ETFs (Blackrock) has also recently released their US GOI percentages for 2024 tax year. US Government Obligation Interest (US GOI) like Treasury bills and bonds are generally exempt from state and local income taxes. However, in order to claim this exemption, you’ll likely have to manually enter it on your tax return after digging up a few extra details. The tax document has a pretty good summary of the situation for all brokers: The Form 1099-DIV (or substitute form) you received from your financial advisor or brokerage firm may include income derived from U.S. Government and agency obligations. This income may be excluded from state income tax (although in many states, only the income from Treasury obligations is exempt from personal state income tax). The information below is provided to assist with the completion of shareholder state income tax returns. The amount in Box 1a of 2024 IRS Form 1099-DIV should be multiplied by the applicable percentages below to obtain the dollar amount of income derived from the sources categorized below. Because the qualifications for exclusion vary by state (some states have investment threshold requirements), please consult your tax advisor for details. It’s notable that even things like the iShares iBonds 20XX Term TIPS ETFs are not 100% US government obligations, so it’s important to reference this document and not assume. For iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) and iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF (STIP) the USGOI percentage for 2024 was indeed at 100.00%. For iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV), the USGOI percentage for 2024 was 97.53%. This is pretty good and why SGOV is my default cash position at most brokers. The tax document also confirms that at least 50% of the assets of the fund were invested in Federal Obligations at the end of each quarter of the fiscal year. That means that SGOV met the minimum criteria for the dividend income to be exempt in the states of California, Connecticut, and New York.

Title: Li Ka-shing Escapes Trump’s Glare With $19 Billion Port Deal

After a lifetime of dealmaking, 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing may have just pulled off one of his boldest transactions yet. Under pressure from the Trump administration over two ports at the Panama canal controlled by CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., Li’s company announced a plan to sell off the bulk of global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. In return, the Hong Kong firm will receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Investors, and even some of CK Hutchison’s closest advisers, were surprised that what began with two Panamanian ports has now evolved into a much larger deal. Under the agreement, the company will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The group sees the sale as an opportunity to cash out at a time when global geopolitical tensions and trade barriers have weakened the outlook for the ports business, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity involved in the deal. Investors welcomed the news, with analysts saying CK Hutchison got a good price. The company’s shares surged as much as 25%, adding almost $5 billion to its market value. Before the announcement of the deal, the stock had fallen 6.9% since the beginning of the year. The sale “is a perfect example of turning geopolitical risks into opportunities,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA. “The firm has taken the chance to bundle and sell its port business at a premium, including the Panama Canal.” CK Hutchison didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In an earlier statement, a spokesman for the group declined to comment beyond the public announcement, which says the transaction “is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” Before the deal was made public, CK Hutchison’s market capitalization was equivalent to the size of the sale at about $19 billion. That reveals “how grossly undervalued the group had been,” said Vincent Lam, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based VL Asset Management. “CK Hutchison is sandwiched between China and the US and is unable to please anyone,” Lam said. “Some investors may consider that this deal could help reduce political risks and release value for the group.” Li, who began diversifying his business empire outside of China since the late 1980s when the country was enshrouded in political uncertainty, has over the next decades grown CK Hutchison into a conglomerate spanning retail, telecommunications, infrastructure and ports. It now counts half of its revenue from Europe and only 12% from mainland China and Hong Kong. Its global profile has helped the company steer through months of political unrest in Hong Kong in 2019, as well as China’s recent economic slowdown. The ports sale highlighted how Li’s son Victor, who now led the group, has to find ways forward for the business as his father once did, at a time when the group is facing increasing geopolitical risks escalated by tensions between the US and China. The sale gives the company considerable firepower to pursue acquisitions in safer areas. Deals have been one of the main drivers for CK Hutchison’s growth over the past decades. After a relatively quiet period during the 2019 protests in Hong Kong and the following three years of Covid closure, the group has accelerated global expansion efforts again. It’s been looking to expand overseas in recent months, most notably in the UK. CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. made a preliminary £7 billion bid last month to take a majority stake in Thames Water, the Financial Times reported. CK Hutchison is also considering a bid for UK waste management firm Viridor Ltd., which could value the business at as much as £7 billion including debt, Bloomberg News reported this month. Now led by Li’s son Victor, the company may hand back some of the port sale proceeds to shareholders in the form of a special dividend. “We believe the company could distribute most of this windfall to shareholders,” said Dan Baker, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. The sale “greatly exceeds our expectations.” The previous valuation for CK Hutchison’s ports business was only $10.5 billion, according to his estimates. The deal lifted the wealth of Li, who’s now a senior advisor to the business he founded. His fortune rose $1.3 billion to $30.6 billion in the wake of the deal’s announcement, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His stakes at CK Hutchison and CK Asset Holdings Ltd. represent just over 40% of his wealth, according to the data. While ports have for decades been one of CK Hutchison’s core businesses, bringing in recurrent, stable income, its contribution to the group’s profit has fallen behind other sectors. In the first half of 2024, ports accounted for 9% of the group’s revenue and 15% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. Li’s CK Hutchison had also been facing pressure from the EU as well as the US over its ports business, according to David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors who publishes on Smartkarma. “This is a great deal, both from a monetary standpoint and from a geopolitical one,” said Blennerhasset. “Li Ka-shing is a canny business person.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Trump hails ‘reclaiming’ of Panama Canal after ports deal

US President Donald Trump has hailed a deal led by the US investment firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of the Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison which includes assets along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the US consortium control of key Panama Canal ports amid White House calls to remove them from what it claims is Chinese ownership. On the first trading day after the deal’s announcement, CK Hutchison shares soared nearly 25%. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the US Congress on Tuesday night. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” The deal with the BlackRock-led consortium includes 90% of Panama Ports Company, which has operated the Balboa and Cristobal ports at each end of the canal for over two decades, said CK Hutchison, controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. In total, the consortium, which includes Terminal Investment and Global Infrastructure Partners, will control 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries, the conglomerate said. The sale involves CK Hutchison’s 80% stake in Hutchison Ports with an equity value of $14.2 billion. However, the conglomerate will receive more than $19 billion following repayment of some shareholder loans. The size of the proceeds would be similar to the entire Hong Kong market value of CK Hutchison shares prior to Wednesday’s share rally. The remainder of Hutchison Ports is owned by Singapore’s PSA International. About 12,000 ships used the Panama Canal last year, which connects 1,920 ports across 170 countries. Its position is strategic for the US as more than three-quarters of vessels passing through the canal originate in or are bound for the United States. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt said in a statement. The conglomerate had been waiting for the Panama Supreme Court to make a final ruling about the legal status of its contract to operate the ports after the local attorney-general determined the contract “unconstitutional”. CK Hutchison has businesses in areas as varied as infrastructure, retail and telecoms. It is also the world’s largest privately owned port operator. The sale of the ports unit does not include any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China, the conglomerate said in the statement. Sixt said the transaction was the result of “a rapid, discreet but competitive process” during which CK Hutchison received numerous bids and expressions of interest. JPMorgan in a report said that while selling the Panama business is “understandable”, the deal is nevertheless a “surprise” given most of CK Hutchison’s other ports are not in regions directly exposed to Sino-US geopolitical tension. It could be “an opportunistic deal”, JPMorgan said. “Based on our understanding of the management philosophy of CKH, any deal is possible as long as ‘the price is right’.” The brokerage said the deal would represent a significant strategy shift because ports would only account for 1% of the conglomerate’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, down from 15%. The contribution of infrastructure, currently the largest segment, will rise to 33% from 28%. The $19 billion that CK Hutchison is set to receive from the sale is well above a $13-billion valuation on the ports assets estimated by analysts. “The disposal would be significantly value enhancing for CK Hutchison if it is completed on the preliminary essential terms,” Citigroup analysts said. CK Hutchison’s net debt level was HK$138 billion (US$17.7 billion) in June and the sales proceeds could put the conglomerate into a net cash position, UBS analysts said.

Title: Trump says US 'taking back' Panama Canal after ports deal

President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States had started to take back the Panama Canal after a deal by a Hong Kong firm to sell ports to a U.S.-led consortium. "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," he said in a speech to Congress. "We're taking it back." Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has agreed to sell control of two ports near the Panama Canal to US-based investment company BlackRock, according to an announcement on Tuesday. Trump has repeatedly threatened the use of force to seize the canal, claiming that Hutchison's ownership of two ports, one at either entrance to the canal, gave China control over the strategic waterway that links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The sale includes transferring 90 percent interests of the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama from CK Hutchison to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and Terminal Investment. The transaction also includes the consortium receiving units that hold 80 percent of the Hutchison Ports group, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. The sale will generate cash proceeds of $19 billion for CK Hutchison, said Frank Sixt, the holding’s co-managing director. Sixt said the “transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports” on the Panama ports. But analysts said it came as a relief nonetheless for President Jose Raul Mulino, who had been under fierce pressure to reduce China's footprint in the country without riling the second-largest user of the canal after the United States. South Korea's Air Force said Thursday that one of its fighter jets had accidentally dropped eight bombs in the wrong place during a training exercise, resulting in civilian injuries. Early bookings suggest that the targets of 65 million visitors and $64 billion in tourism revenues set for 2025 are within reach, Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy has said. Fenerbahçe football club head coach José Mourinho has ignited a heated debate following his comments after a Galatasaray-Fenerbahçe derby match on Feb. 24 in which he stated that “everyone on the opposing bench was jumping like monkeys.”

The acquisition marks a geopolitical shift, reinforcing U.S. dominance over the Panama Canal and safeguarding global trade routes. In a landmark $23 billion deal, BlackRock, the worldâs largest asset manager, has acquired majority stakes in two strategic ports at the Panama Canal, effectively pushing out Chinese-linked influence over one of the worldâs most vital trade routes. The transaction, which was announced on Tuesday, transfers control of the ports from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings to a U.S.-led consortium spearheaded by BlackRock. This move aligns with President Trumpâs longstanding warnings about Chinaâs growing influence over global infrastructure and marks a significant shift in geopolitical control over the canal, which handles more than 70% of U.S.-bound shipping. The deal grants BlackRock control of Panamaâs Balboa and Cristobal ports, which are located at the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal, respectively, as well as 43 other ports across 23 countries. The acquisition, executed through BlackRockâs subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) in partnership with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), underscores the firmâs growing role in global infrastructure investments. A strategic win for U.S. interests The Panama Canal has long been a linchpin of global trade, with its operations critical to U.S. economic and military strategy. For years, U.S. officials have raised alarms about Chinaâs expanding presence in the region, warning that Beijing could exploit its control over ports for intelligence gathering, military positioning, or even disrupting shipping to harm the U.S. economy. âChina is getting kicked out of Panama, and America is winning. Thank you, President Trump. MAGA!â wrote the House Foreign Affairs Committee Majority in a post on X, celebrating the deal. Trump, who has repeatedly emphasized the canalâs importance to U.S. national security, hailed the acquisition as a step toward âreclaimingâ the waterway. âThe United States has a vested interest in the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of the Panama Canal,â Trump said in a Truth Social post. âWe would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!â A purely commercial deal? Although CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt insisted the transaction was âpurely commercial in nature,â the geopolitical implications are undeniable. The deal removes Chinese-linked entities from controlling critical infrastructure near the canal, a move that aligns with the Trump administrationâs broader efforts to counter Beijingâs influence in the Western Hemisphere. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized the dealâs economic significance, stating, âThese world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital.â A turning point in geopolitics The acquisition represents a significant shift in the balance of power over global trade routes. By placing control of the Panama Canal ports in American hands, the deal mitigates the risks associated with Chinese influence, such as potential surveillance, military pre-positioning, or economic leverage in geopolitical disputes. As the Trump administration continues to push for greater U.S. control over the canal, this deal marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle for dominance over critical global infrastructure. With BlackRock at the helm, the U.S. has taken a decisive step toward safeguarding one of the worldâs most strategic trade corridors.

Title: CK Hutchison stocks up 25% after Panama ports sale

East Asia FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, at the Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun/File Photo HONG KONG: Shares in CK Hutchison soared 25 per cent in Hong Kong on Wednesday (Mar 5) after it agreed to sell its lucrative Panama Canal ports to a US-led consortium under fierce pressure from US President Donald Trump. The firm owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing said it would offload a 90 per cent stake in the Panama Ports Company (PPC) and sell a slew of other non-Chinese ports to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock. The sellers will receive US$19 billion in cash, the company said in a statement. Hutchison subsidiary PPC has for decades run ports at Balboa and Cristobal on the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the interoceanic waterway. But since taking office in January, Trump has complained that China controls the canal - a vital strategic asset that the United States once ran. "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," he said in a speech to Congress Tuesday. "We're taking it back." Trump had refused to rule out a military invasion of Panama to regain control, sparking angry protests and a complaint to the United Nations by the Central American nation. In a joint press release with the buyers, Hutchison said the deal was motivated by business, not politics. "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," co-managing director Frank Sixt said. "This transaction is the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received," said Sixt, who described the chosen agreement as "clearly in the best interests of shareholders." BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said the transaction demonstrated his consortium's capacity to "deliver differentiated investments for clients". "These world-class ports facilitate global growth," he added. The Panamanian government, for its part, said the sale was "a global transaction, between private companies, driven by mutual interests". It added that an audit launched into the PPC by the Panamanian comptroller's office that oversees public entities will continue in spite of the sale. The deal entails 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. CK Hutchison Holdings is one of Hong Kong's largest conglomerates, spanning finance, retail, infrastructure, telecoms and logistics. Shares in CK Hutchison soared 25 per cent in Hong Kong after the sale was announced. In February, Marco Rubio visited Panama on his first overseas trip as secretary of state, proof of the canal's importance to the new administration. Rubio won a commitment from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino to exit the Belt and Road Initiative, China's signature infrastructure-building program. He also pressed for free passage of US vessels through the Panama Canal, which was denied. Since 1999, the canal has been run by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) - an autonomous entity whose board of directors is appointed by Panama's president and National Assembly. The 80km-long canal handles 5 per cent of global maritime trade, and 40 per cent of US container traffic. Beijing has consistently denied interfering in the canal. JPMorgan in a report said while selling the Panama business is "understandable", the deal is a "surprise" given most of CK Hutchison's other ports are not in regions directly exposed to Sino-US geopolitical tension. It could be "an opportunistic deal", JPMorgan said. "Based on our understanding of the management philosophy of CKH, any deal is possible as long as 'the price is right'." The brokerage said the deal would represent a significant strategy shift because ports would only account for 1 per cent of the conglomerate's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, from 15 per cent. The contribution of infrastructure, currently the largest segment, will rise to 33 per cent from 28 per cent.

Title: BlackRock to buy Hong Kong firm's Panama Canal port stake amid pressure

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery An investor group backed by BlackRock has agreed to buy a majority stake in the Hong Kong subsidiary that runs ports along either side of the Panama Canal, giving a U.S. firm control of key docks amid pressure from the White House to take them from China. The $22.8 billion sale by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to U.S. and Swiss investors also includes dozens of ports in other countries, the companies announced Tuesday. The move appears to be a win for U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive diplomacy just hours before he is due to tout the successes of the first six tumultuous weeks of his second term in an address to the U.S. Congress. He vowed to wrest control of the strategic canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans during his Jan. 20 inauguration speech, falsely claiming China is operating it. The transaction appears to hand command of the vital docks on both entrances of the canal to U.S. interests.

Title: Selected Articles: Rebuilding Ukraine for the Ukrainians and Gaza for the Gazans – As a Trump “Deal”?

Rebuilding Ukraine for the Ukrainians and Gaza for the Gazans – As a Trump “Deal”? By Peter Koenig, March 04, 2025 The rare earths deal was not signed. The truth is, a mining deal for Peace would not be ethical. President Trump knows that and would unlikely go down that rabbit hole. But Zelensky fell for the deal, hoping he could incite President Trump to defend his, Zelensky’s, side against President Putin. How wrong he was! Hong Kong Firm Sells Panama Canal Stake to BlackRock, Making It Majority Owner Amid Trump’s Pressure to Curb Chinese Influence By Jim Hoft, March 05, 2025 The $23 billion deal, which includes $5 billion in debt, will effectively place the strategic ports under American control—a move long advocated by President Donald Trump and national security hawks concerned about China’s grip on global infrastructure. Macron, Starmer, Merz: Righteous, Confused and Unwilling Politicians: Europe’s Dangerous Ukrainian Predicament By Dr. Binoy Kampmark, March 04, 2025 European states are divided ahead of the March 6 summit, where the EU will supposedly approve some 20 billion euros for the purchase of missiles and air defence equipment for Ukraine. Universal Healthcare Is the Solution to a Broken Medical System By Dr. Gary Null, March 04, 2025 For over 50 years, there has been no concerted or successful effort to bring down medical costs in the American healthcare system. Nor are the federal health agencies making disease prevention a priority. Regardless whether the political left or right sponsors proposals for reform, such measures are repeatedly defeated by both parties in Congress. It Is All About Energy! US in Artificial Intelligence Race Driving Quest for Minerals By Uriel Araujo, March 04, 2025 Elon Musk’s Starlink is increasingly facing competition from China’s SpaceSail. Meanwhile, Trump’s new “energy Tsar” has said that Washington is doomed to lose the “AI arms race” without fossil fuels. Energy production does seem to be a priority for the new administration. Globalisation with the Chinese Face? By Konrad Rękas, March 04, 2025 Without globalisation, the rapid development of the Chinese economy would not be possible, which is evident every time it has to rely on the internal market, which is huge but disproportionate to the capital and investment capabilities of Beijing, which simply have to find an outlet somewhere, and even then, they can get out of breath. Zelenskyy and Netanyahu – A Tale of Two White House Visits By Gavin OReilly, March 04, 2025 In further contrast to the themes of ending US foreign aid that marked Zelenskyy’s visit to Washington, both Trump and Netanyahu then went on to hold a joint press conference outlining plans to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip in line with Israeli policy, and to use US troops to do so.

Title: BlackRock CEO sees rocky 2025, but bets on long-term tech boom amid escalating trade tensions

Time Published: 2025-03-05T03:09:03Z

Share this article BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expects market volatility and elevated inflation in 2025 but remains bullish about long-term growth opportunities, projecting a “big economic boom” driven by advancements in science and technology. Speaking today at the RBC Capital Markets Global Financial Institutions Conference, Fink said that this year would be a “rocky” year as markets adjust to trade tensions and policy shifts. He noted that the “next six months” will be marked by increased market volatility. “In the next six months, I think we’re going to have a lot of volatility and volatility is creeping up quite considerably,” he said. Yet, Fink anticipates the country will overcome the current social and economic challenges. “The world’s fine. I mean, a lot of noise. We’ll get beyond — we’ll get by this,” Fink said. “All of that is going to be just a reorientation. And ultimately, we’ve — we find ways of fixing it. But in the short run, we’re going to have elevated inflation,” he said. Fink urged investors to buy during the dips, emphasizing his confidence in the enduring strength of the US capital markets. “For long-term investors, if there’s a big dip, good, good time to buy and I truly believe that. I believe we’re getting set up for a big economic boom,” Fink said, anticipating the boom will largely be driven by new technologies and science. Addressing the growing anxiety surrounding tariffs and potential deportations, Fink said they could cause immediate economic disruptions they could cause. However, despite the current climate of trade uncertainty, he stays optimistic about the possibility of a positive outcome, suggesting a potential trade agreement between the US and China. “We expect in the short run volatility, we expect elevated inflation, moderation of the economy in the short run. But over the course of three quarters, four quarters, I think we’re going to be resuming a pretty good trajectory,” he noted. Discussing AI, Fink highlighted the potential of the technology to drive innovation, efficiency, and ultimately, deflation. “The Generative AI is going to transform the science and all the sciences so rapidly,” he said. The CEO pointed out that AI implementation is currently expensive, limiting its accessibility to large corporations. However, he expressed optimism that the cost of AI models will decrease, allowing for wider adoption and “democratization” of the technology. Fink believes that the US technology sector, driven by AI, will be a major driver of stock market growth and investment opportunities over the next five years. Fink also noted the rapid evolution of robotics, where AI and visual technology are enabling robots to perform increasingly complex tasks. He contrasted older, code-driven robots with new AI-powered machines capable of delicate and precise actions. “The ability to overlay AI with robotics with visual technology is going to be transformational,” Fink said. “And that’s why when you think about so many functions and so many things, it will be ultimately very deflationary.” Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: March 1, 2025
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/03/march-1-2025/
Time Published: 2025-03-05T03:05:37Z

Dear friends, Welcome to the March issue of Mutual Fund Observer. I am surprised, sometimes, at how much I now appreciate some of the stuff that I found most mindless and annoying in high school. (I’m still not there with Moby Dick; the whole idea of a monomaniacally obsessed old guy leading his ship to destruction because he can’t be reasoned with and won’t back down, just strikes me as implausible, but I’m willing to listen.) My secret hope as a professor is that I’m like the gardener scattering seeds too early, in patches that seem disconsolate, for those seeds still sprout whither they would. And so, I teach my students about Thorstein Veblen, one of his age’s most impenetrable geniuses (he coined “conspicuous consumption”), and Sherry Turkle, one of our age’s most thoughtful, who asks “What do we become when we talk to machines?” We read about Hitler, and about the disastrous misjudgments – by mainstream politicians who had faith that they could control him and German industrialists who had faith that they could harness him to their everlasting profit – that led to the rise of Hitler. We read the reflections of the decent, hardworking Germans who convinced themselves that it was better to keep their heads down and pray. This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow-motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter. . . (A German professor speaking with Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. University of Chicago Press, 1955) We read the final report of Herbert Hoover’s 1929 Committee on Recent Economic Changes that hailed an “almost insatiable appetite for goods and services,” and envisaged “a boundless field before us … new wants that make way endlessly for newer wants, as fast as they are satisfied.” The kids from Nepal and Mongolia read it alongside the kids from Naperville and Milwaukee, read it very differently from one another, and speak to each other with increasing confidence about how they connect to the readings … and connect to each other. And so, in the spring of my 41st year at the college, I’ll continue scattering seeds and nurturing hope. Heck, perhaps one day they’ll reflect on my classes as I’ve reflected on Dickens. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” ― Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities (1859) Our colleague Lynn Bolin continues looking at bonds as an attractive alternative, on a risk-adjusted and valuation basis, to stocks just now. “Spicy Bond Funds” explores “spicier” (higher-yielding) bond investments in the current market environment. Lynn analyzes various risk factors including inflation, duration risk, and policy uncertainty, and provides a comprehensive ranking system for bond funds. Spoiler: you might want to check Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a relatively safe way to achieve higher yields in the current market, Lynn complements that with a new take on an old strategy, bond laddering. In “ETF Bond Ladders,” he examines ETFs designed for bond laddering, focusing on products from Invesco (BulletShares) and BlackRock (iShares iBonds). The essay concludes with the note that corporate BBB-rated bond ladders will be Lynn’s mainstay investment, with potential additions of high-yield bonds for near-term investments and municipal bonds for tax-efficient accounts. In “The Great Rotation” (below), I highlight the surprising extent of the change in stock investors’ preferences – small, value, international, and emerging are being rediscovered – and offer up the funds that should be on an investor’s shortlist. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the Trump administration has gutted efforts to minimize global warming, coordinate international responses to it, or maintain a credible information infrastructure for it. In January we noted that the necessary response to allowing such a collapse was a shift to infrastructure investing to manage the effects. In February, we extended the analysis to water infrastructure. In “The Climate Denial Profit Paradox,” we update the state of government efforts and lay out additional investing opportunities. (I’ll go back to being optimistic about the future next month.) After markets get pricier and shakier, asset managers are doing what asset managers do: they’re rolling out new products in new asset classes using new algorithms that guarantee that happy days will be here again. After walking through the sad wreckage of other “can’t miss” innovations, we highlight the risks surrounding three new funds and ETFs in “Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality.” All of which brought to mind the stunning collapse of Firsthand Technology Value Fund, a tale that continues to this day. Launched in 1994, the fund returned 60% a year in the 1990s and gave rise to a half dozen siblings. Twenty years after launch it became a business development company doing private equity investing in the same sorts of tech companies. And ten years later, the fund is trading for $0.06/share and isn’t even able to liquidate. The cautionary tale is in “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund.” Speaking of rising and falling, The Shadow documents the death of Matthews Asian Growth & Income, a fund made famous by Paul Matthews and Andrew Foster as the least volatile, most consistently excellent way to invest in Asia equities from 1994 to about 2011. But thereafter … We can establish two things about the stock market with great confidence: The US stock market has a giant problem. “Giant” in the sense that investors have poured money so steadily and so long into a handful of leaders that their valuations are beginning to redefine “irrational.” Jason Zweig notes, “Even after the stumble in tech stocks late last month, the Magnificent Seven traded this week at an average of 43.3 times what analysts expect them to earn over the next 12 months” (“What You Should Do About the Stock Market’s Giant Problem,” com, 2/7/25). That leaves most of the US market and virtually all of the rest of the world with tolerable valuations. Spencer Jakab reports that “developed-market large growth stocks were trading last week at 98th-percentile valuations… [meaning] they have been more expensive only 2% of the time.” (Ever.) Simultaneously, “developed-market large value is at the 2nd percentile, so it has been cheaper only 2% of the time” (“Stocks have a big, expensive problem,” WSJ, 2/25/25, B10). Morningstar pictures it this way: Source: Morningstar.com, Market Valuation View, 2/28/2025 Leuthold Group reports that small caps are selling at a 26% discount to large caps, adjusted for earnings, and value is selling at a near-historic discount to growth. Investors have noticed. As of March 3, 2025, Vanguard Value ETF is up 4.5% on the year, Vanguard Growth ETF is down 1.2%. Similarly, the Vanguard FTSE EM ETF is up 1.6%, Vanguard Total International Stock ETF is up 5.7% and the value-oriented Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF is up 6.6%. Contrarily, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is down 6% YTD. Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is down 2%. Tesla is down 27% YTD. Google is down 10%. Trump Media & Tech is down 32%. All of this is separate from broader concerns about chaos, tariffs, reciprocal tariffs, escalating tariffs, government shutdowns, and burgeoning deficits. What might an investor consider? If you’re a young investor with a diversified portfolio (think more than 50 stocks representing many different industries, ideally spread over several countries), do nothing to your portfolio. You’re fine. This might be unpleasant, but that’s part of the price of playing the game. If you’re an investor with all of your eggs in one small basket (you have a tech ETF and shares of Nvidia, Google, and Amazon), broaden your exposure. That doesn’t mean selling what you own. It might mean adding something like Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). At base, the equal weight 500 counteracts the large/growth/momentum biases embedded in many portfolios. It gives equal exposure to the largest and smallest companies in the S&P 500 which creates an immediate contrarian balance. It is more oriented toward less expensive stocks, smaller stocks, old-economy stocks, and dividends than the S&P or the typical portfolio. In Morningstar terms, it is a one-star fund which is precisely its appeal: it invests in the companies left for dead by the FAANG/MAG7 mania. If you want to increase your exposure to value-oriented stocks, consider Wisdom Tree US Value ETF (WTV) or Goodhaven Fund (GOODX). Why these two? We turned to the MFO Premium screener which allows us to assess open-end funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds side-by-side. We screeners for funds with three essential characteristics: We applied that screener to large value, mid-cap value, and multi-cap value funds for the past three years. Thirty-four value funds and ETFs showed both excellent manager performance and excellent resilience over the past three years. Wisdom Tree US Value had the highest information ratio of all, and Goodhaven had the highest ratio for all mutual funds. If you want to increase your exposure to small cap stocks, consider Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity, North Square Dynamic Small Cap, or Adirondack Small Cap. Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity is an actively managed, low-cost small-cap blend fund that holds about 500 names (yikes! But it works) with a growth-at-a-reasonable-price discipline. It charges one-third of the category average and is about as diversified as can be. North Square Dynamic Small Cap employs a systematic, quantitative approach to identify behavioral inefficiencies in small-cap equity markets, leveraging sophisticated data science to exploit pricing dislocations caused by investor biases. That “behavioral finance” angle is fairly distinctive. Adirondack Small Cap is the top-performing small value fund, earning a remarkable 11% annual return in one of the market’s left-for-dead categories. The fund specializes in identifying undervalued small-cap companies that have fallen out of favor with investors, seeking to capitalize on these “turnaround situations” before mainstream investors take notice. They target companies that might rebound within three years. The team has been around forever and is heavily invested in the fund. If you want to increase your exposure to international stocks, consider the Janus Henderson Global Research or Moerus Worldwide Value. The Janus Henderson Global Research is a global large-cap growth fund that employs a distinctive sector-driven approach where specialized teams of dedicated sector analysts build high-conviction portfolios of their best ideas worldwide. They also work to hedge away most macroeconomic risks leaving the portfolio performance mostly driven by stock selection. Moerus Worldwide Value is a globally unconstrained deep value fund managed by Amit Wadhwaney, who employs a disciplined approach to identifying companies trading at significant discounts to intrinsic value across developed and emerging markets, with a particular emphasis on strong balance sheets over income statements. Amit has three decades of value investing experience and willingness to embrace market turmoil as an opportunity, seeking out underfollowed businesses, complex situations, and temporarily distressed sectors that most investors avoid, creating a distinctive portfolio of 30-40 high-conviction holdings with minimal index overlap. And if you’re simply freaked out, (a) welcome to the club and (b) increase the strategic cash allocation in your portfolio. Cash and cash alternatives are paying 4-5% a year with minimal downside. If you don’t have any great conviction in risk assets, take a deep breath and invest in some variation of an ultra-short bond fund or money market. CrossingBridge is run by David Sherman & co., and they have an outstanding record of low-risk income investing. Fidelity Conservative Income is a cheap, active, middle-of-the-road ultra-short bond fund. The “cheap” is really useful here. We’ve also included the profile of the money market peer group. In reality, there’s no downside to any of them and precious little upside deviation. So, the whole group sits at 4.2% give-or-take 0.2%. Pick whichever one is convenient to you if you don’t want the prospect of adding just a bit of upside with CrossingBridge or Fido. The bottom line: running around in panic is not your friend. Hiding is not your friend. Taking a deep breath and making rational adjustments is. We’ll help. March has been designated as “B Corp Month.” Hallmark has not yet taken notice. In an era of growing disillusionment with traditional corporate structures, B Corps stand as beacons of a more conscientious approach to business. While many companies prioritize profits at any cost, Benefit Corporations (B Corps) represent a revolutionary paradigm that balances financial success with positive social and environmental impact. B Corps are businesses that meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Unlike conventional corporations that answer primarily to shareholders, B Corps legally commit to considering all stakeholders: workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. In the US, 2,400 corporations are organized as B Corps. Worldwide, that swells to 9,500. What makes B Corps worth celebrating? They’re proving that business can be a force for good. From fair wages and diverse workforces to sustainable sourcing and ethical production, these companies demonstrate that profit and purpose aren’t mutually exclusive, they’re mutually reinforcing. The B Corp movement isn’t just idealism; it’s pragmatism for our times. As consumers increasingly vote with their dollars for companies that reflect their values, B Corps are showing that ethical business practices create resilience, innovation, and long-term success. The Annual Report of B Lab documents a lot of ways in which these companies really are different. I am not surprised, though I am slightly appalled, by the speed with which Corporate America as a whole has thrown all principles except shareholder (and executive) gains under the bus. By supporting the good guys, you aren’t underwriting the swift abandonment of employees, communities, and the environment by the billionaire-dollar corporations that were cheerleading for it, flying rainbow flags, and signing on to global initiatives … for precisely as long as it was convenient. Support how?? Follow B Lab Global, the certifying body, on social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X) and follow the #GenB or #BCorpMonth hashtag to see the different stuff happening throughout March. You can also use the ‘Find a B Corp’ directory to discover businesses that are part of the community and use your purchasing power to support B Corp companies, and the movement of business as a force for good. You might also consider Bookshop.org as an ethical alternative to Amazon, at least as a bookseller. They’ve donated $36+ million in profits to local bookshops since their launch during Covid. Nice people, good selection. Amazon has recently changed policy, they now forbid Kindle users from downloading their books, giving them permanent control of your purchases. (You might recall their freakish decision to remove the book 1984 from all Kindle readers a few years ago.) Bookshop has e-books and is working with folks like Kobo to make them available on readers. Similarly, a handful of major retailers have recognized the business case of sustaining a diverse and vibrant workforce and have, to date, refused to roll back corporate efforts to support their employees. Those include Costco, Crate & Barrel, Home Depot, Ikea, Kroger, Sprouts Wayfair, West Elm … and Whole Foods (?). To our faithful “subscribers,” Wilson, S&F Investment Advisors, Greg, William, William, Stephen, Brian, David, and Doug, thanks! To, Sara from Brooklyn, Charles of Michigan, Ronald from Alexandria, Marjorie (thank you, ma’am, I also get such a headache some days) of Chicago, The Grinch Redux, and dear Binod from Houston, thanks! And for more than just financial support. You make a difference. It’s planting time. Chip is busily searching seed catalogs for spring-planted garlic (stiff neck mostly, because they generate delicious garlic scapes) and mild onions. I’ll continue searching for the perfect potato. And somewhere in there, more native wildflowers and grass (sheep fescue looks cool) will continue their relentless incursion on our lawn. Planting is an act of hope. Gardening is a gesture of resilience. Pursue both, dear friends. As ever, David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts). Cofounder, lead writer.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican representative from Louisiana, warned against disrupting Trump’s speech. “Members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the house and to cease any further disruptions,” Johnson said. He then again addressed the chamber, saying: “Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of the quorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the sergeant-at-arms to restore order to the joint session.” Johnson also directly told Green to take his seat, before ordering the house sergeant-at-arms to remove him from the chamber. Green is a vocal critic of Trump and has filed articles of impeachment against the president. Other Democratic representatives could be seen holding black paddles that said “Save Medicaid”, “Protect Veterans” and “Musk Steals”. Representative Rashida Tlaib, from Michigan, held a whiteboard reading: “That’s a lie.” Representative Melanie Stansbury, from New Mexico, was spotted holding a sign that read: “This is not normal” as Trump entered the chamber. First elected in a special election in 2021 to replace then-interior secretary Deb Haaland, Stansbury represents a solidly Democratic district. She is also the top Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee. Someone grabbed the sign from across the aisle and threw it. Some Democratic representatives — including Stansbury and Texan representative Jasmine Crockett — have since walked out of the chamber, after taking off their jackets to reveal words in white on their backs. Some said: “Resist.” Florida representative Maxwell Frost’s said: “No More Kings.” In his speech, Trump declared “America is back” and said his administration had ended what he called the “tyranny” of diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government. “Our country will be woke no longer,” he said, adding he is “getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military”. “We don’t want it — wokeness is trouble, wokeness is bad — it’s gone.” Trump last month signed an executive order banning transgender athletes from taking part in women’s and girls’ sports. He referenced this, say he signed an executive order banning public schools from “indoctrinating” children with “transgender ideology”. In attendance on Tuesday was former high school athlete Payton McNabb, who the White House said “suffered a severe injury by a male competitor in women’s sports”. “Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls’ team, or they will lose all federal funding,” Trump said. “Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America,” he said. “From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. “We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years. “And we are just getting started. “I return to this chamber tonight to report that America’s momentum is back, our spirit is back, our pride is back, our confidence is back, and the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before. “The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed and perhaps will never witness again. “It’s never been anything like it. “The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. “We won all seven swing states, giving us an electoral college victory of 312 votes We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country.” After he was escorted out of the chamber, Green said when Trump spoke about his “mandate” it “triggered something”. “It really did,” Green said, “because he doesn’t have a mandate, and he doesn’t have a mandate to cut health care from poor people.” The interview with Green was interrupted by Capitol Police, who removed media from the area where they were speaking. Democratic representatives Maxine Dexter and Andrea Salinas, both from Oregon, have also now been escorted out of the chamber. In response to Trump’s talk of a mandate, Republicans in the chamber stood up and cheered, chanting: “USA!” As he was starting to speak again, however, some politicians started booing him. In his speech, Trump also touched on major political talking points including immigration and health. Trump made “migrant crime” a centerpiece of his campaign, and many family members of victims of such crimes appeared with him either on the trail or in videos produced by the campaign that aired during his rallies. He referenced the Laken Riley Act, which was approved in a bipartisan effort earlier this year. The bill was named for Laken Riley, a nursing school student who was murdered last year in Athens, Georgia. A Venezuelan citizen who had entered the US illegally was convicted of her murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Trump later praised Robert F. Kennedy Jr. while speaking about autism in the United States, saying there’s “nobody better” than his recently confirmed health and human services secretary to “figure out what’s going on”. “You have the best to figure out what is going on,” Trump said. “OK, Bobby, good luck. It’s a very important job.” Kennedy has long used anti-vaccine rhetoric and his platform to claim without evidence that early childhood vaccines cause autism. In 2018, Kennedy founded Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine nonprofit group. When pressed on the issue by Republican Senator Bill Cassidy at his Senate confirmation hearing, Kennedy refused to plainly state that vaccines do not cause autism, despite decades of research dispelling any link. Trump later said his administration will be “reclaiming the Panama Canal”, adding that it has “already started doing it”. He mentioned a deal made earlier today, in which the Hong Kong company CK Hutchison said it would sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates two ports on the Pacific and Atlantic sides of the canal to a consortium that includes the US asset manager BlackRock. Trump also addressed “the incredible people of Greenland”, saying that he supports the right to determine their own future and that they are welcome to join the US. “We need it really for international world security — and I think we’re going to get it one way or the other,” Trump said. Clocking in at roughly an hour and 40 minutes, Trump’s speech broke the record for longest presidential address to Congress — including his own — by over 10 minutes. — With CNN 2 min read 2 min read Stream free on 1 min read 1 min read 2 min read 1 min read 1 min read 1 min read 1 min read 3 min read 1 min read 1 min read 2 min read 1 min read 1 min read 1 min read 1 min read 3 min read Stay informed with the free 7NEWS app. Available on iOS & Android.

Title: Hong Kong Firm Sells Panama Canal Stake to BlackRock, Making It Majority Owner Amid Trump’s Pressure to Curb Chinese Influence

BlackRock Inc. has secured control over key ports near the Panama Canal, stripping away Chinese-linked influence over one of the world’s most crucial shipping routes. The $23 billion deal, which includes $5 billion in debt, will effectively place the strategic ports under American control—a move long advocated by President Donald Trump and national security hawks concerned about China’s grip on global infrastructure. The transaction, announced Tuesday, involves Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings selling its controlling stake in Hutchison Port Holdings and Hutchison Port Group Holdings to a U.S.-led consortium spearheaded by BlackRock, AP reported. This historic acquisition grants control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including major sites in Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan, and Panama’s critical ports of Balboa and Cristobal—the two primary gateways to the Panama Canal. Fox Business reported: BlackRock announced the $22.8 billion deal with CK Hutchison’s subsidiary Hutchison Port Holdings, which will see the firm acquire the Panama ports of Cristobal and Balboa, which are located at the Atlantic and Pacific ends of the canal, respectively. It will also acquire Hutchison’s controlling interest in 43 ports in 23 other countries. The world’s largest asset manager will partner with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL) to operate the ports in concert with the BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). “This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP’s combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. “These world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.” […] Frank Sixt, CK Hutchison co-managing director, said the transaction was the “result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received” and added that the deal should deliver cash proceeds in excess of $19 billion to the group. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt added. “China is getting kicked out of Panama and America is winning. Thank you, President Trump. MAGA!” wrote House Foreign Affairs Committee Majority. . Read on X . “Victory for America & our allies. China leverages commercial port operations throughout the Western Hemisphere, including the Panama Canal, to project power, enable surveillance, facilitate trafficking, and pre-position for conflict,” Homeland GOP wrote. . Watch on X . Donald Trump has warned that the United States could seize back the Panama Canal unless the country agrees to lower its costs and counter Chinese influence. In a post on Truth Social, the incoming president urged the Panamanian government to start taking care of the canal or face the consequences. He wrote: The United States has a vested interest in the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of the Panama Canal, and that was always understood. We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands! It was not given for the benefit of others, but merely as a token of cooperation with us and Panama. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question. To the Officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly! Trump later followed up with another post explaining its role preserving America’s economic and national security: The Panama Canal is considered a VITAL National Asset for the United States, due to its critical role to America’s Economy and National Security. A secure Panama Canal is crucial for U.S. Commerce, and rapid deployment of the Navy, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and drastically cuts shipping times to U.S. ports. The United States is the Number One user of the Canal, with over 70 percent of all transits heading to, or from, U.S. ports. Considered one of the Wonders of the Modern World, the Panama Canal opened for business 110 years ago, and was built at HUGE cost to the United States in lives and treasure – 38,000 American men died from infected mosquitos in the jungles during construction. Teddy Roosevelt was President of the United States at the time of its building, and understood the strength of Naval Power and Trade. When President Jimmy Carter foolishly gave it away, for One Dollar, during his term in Office, it was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else. It was likewise not given for Panama to charge the United States, its Navy, and corporations, doing business within our Country, exorbitant prices and rates of passage. Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, especially knowing the extraordinary generosity that has been bestowed to Panama by the U.S. This complete “rip-off” of our Country will immediately stop…. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: $1.7b NZ non-residential sales in 2H24: CBRE lists 10 biggest deals where prices are declared

Time Published: 2025-03-05T02:00:00Z

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. NZ Safety Blackwoods' new distribution centre, as at February 2025. This base is at Drury South in Auckland. A list of the 10 largest non-residential property sales of last year’s second half was topped by a $66.5 million Drury real estate transaction. Zoltan Moricz, executive director and research head at CBRE in Auckland, released the latest investment transaction monitor listing sales where the price was made public. That showed a total value of 97 New Zealand non-residential sales in 2H24 totalled about $1.7b. The monitor said 2H24’s largest sale where a price was declared was at Drury, in a transaction dated December 1, 2024. Moricz said the top 10 list did not include the $180m planned sale of Precinct Properties' InterContinental Auckland hotel, announced on March 5. CBRE’s top 10 list of 2H24 non-residential New Zealand sales where prices were declared follows. Largest: $66.5m Drury South Crossing sale Calder Stewart Development sold a Drury property on Jack Stevenson Rd to industrial wholesale investment specialist FortHill Property Fund. This was the sale of an industrial property under construction by Calder Stewart. FortHill’s purchase is of the developed or finished asset. FortHill has associations with the vendor. Calder Stewart is a long-term developer from the South Island, where it has an extensive Christchurch portfolio. FortHill has been set up as a wholesale investment fund separate from Calder Stewart but associated. Last month, the Herald reported on the NZ Safety Blackwoods new distribution centre, which Calder Stewart is developing at 22 Jack Stevenson Rd. Sale date: December 1, 2024 Second largest: $63.7m Rolleston sale Active Canterbury investors Andrew and Phillip Carter sold 32 Iport Dr, Rolleston to Private Land and Property Fund. Sale date: July 12, 2024. That part of Rolleston is a fast-growing commercial hub where Costco Wholesale has been tipped to develop its second New Zealand store, although this has never been confirmed. Industrial developer Carter Group’s Rolleston Industrial Holdings won approval from the council for a scheme that potentially tagged Costco as having a base there. Third largest: $63.5m Māngere sale Wine business Indevin Group sold 470 Oruarangi Rd, Māngere to Blackrock. This is part of the former Villa Maria estate, established by founder Sir George Fistonich. In 2021, the Herald reported how Indevin had signed a conditional agreement to buy the vineyard land after owner FFWL was put into receivership by Rabobank and ANZ, owed nearly $212m. NZX-listed Goodman Property Trust bought much of that estate, planning a $500m-plus warehouse and logistics hub. Sale date: July 19, 2024. Fourth largest: $58m Papakura sale CBRE listed Fletcher Building as having sold 76-78 Hunua Rd, Papakura to a private investor, Bruce Miles. But CBRE also said that sale was as yet unconfirmed. Humes Papakura has its manufacturing plant at that address. A Fletcher spokesman today confirmed the $58m transaction: “We have sold the land with a perpetually renewable ground lease.” Sale date: November 1, 2024. Fifth largest: $56m Ōtara sale Private investor Quing Ye sold 291 East Tāmaki Rd, Ōtara to NZX-listed Argosy Property. Argosy said in its FY25 result it had unconditionally bought the property and adjacent titles. “This is a 4.6ha level site in a well-established industrial precinct, just 2km from State Highway 1. The initial purchase price and attendant capital works is $61 million, and the fully-let holding return is 4.8%. The site is currently 58% leased, with the balance expected to be leased up prior to settlement, in August 2025,” Argosy announced. Sale date: December 16, 2024. Sixth largest: $55m Wynyard Quarter sale CBRE listed Orams Marine as selling a Wynyard Quarter property to NZX-listed Precinct Properties. Sale date: December 1, 2024. This transaction was reported last August, the announcement being contained in Precinct’s full-year financial result. The company plans to jointly develop a waterfront site with Orams. Orams has long held plans to develop the waterfront sites it owns. But its three new Beaumont St refit sheds upset the neighbours who filed High Court action against development. The neighbours lost and Orams built the new sheds. But that’s only part of a wider plan for many more buildings on the land. In 2022, chief executive Neven Barbour told the Herald how the business was ploughing $140m into a new hub and far more was to come. Seventh largest: $51m Westgate sale CBRE lists the company, 21 Fred Taylor Dr, as selling Bunnings Westgate to NZX-listed business Investore Property. Companies Office records show the vendor is wholly owned by Cook Property Trust and the sole director of Benjamin David Cook. Bunnings Westgate opened in 2020. In 2020, the Herald reported investor Ben Cook of Cook Property as buying that store and two other properties. Cook declined to say then how much he paid, explaining he had entered commercially confidential agreements and was bound by them. However, market sources confirmed Bunnings Westgate had a market value of about $70m, Countdown Orewa about $30m and Countdown Aotea about $18m. Sale date: August 22, 2024. Eighth largest: $50.2m Kāpiti sale Templeton Retail sold the Kāpiti Landing shopping centre to PropCo No3LP, CBRE said. Colliers described Kāpiti Landing as a sprawling retail precinct, which in March 2020 was being offered for sale. Sale date: September 13, 2024. Ninth largest: $40.6m Christchurch sale Eastgate Holdings sold the Eastgate Shopping Centre to Willis Bond for this sum. Sale date: October 29, 2024. Tenth largest: $38.5m Waipuna sale The Mt Wellington Licensing Trust Board sold the Waipuna Hotel & Conference Centre in Auckland to Primeproperty Group. The Herald has previously reported how that property is valued for rating purposes at $44m. Sale date: September 1, 2024. Could this be even larger? No price was declared by NZX-listed Summerset Group when it bought the Hillary block of land at Belmont on the North Shore for a new village last year. Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei sold the parcel in a deal giving it company shares and employment and education opportunities for the hapū. The 5.7ha housing estate was once owned by the Royal New Zealand Navy but sold to Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei last decade under its Treaty settlement. Scott Scoullar, Summerset chief executive, said his company had bought the land outright. That is different from what Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei did with Ryman Healthcare on the Wakakura block, where Ryman leased it long-term to that listed retirement business. That block is not far from Hillary, but nearer Devonport. This transaction occurred in 2H24. Anne Gibson has been the Herald’s property editor for 25 years, written books and covered property extensively here and overseas.

Title: BlackRock to Buy Chinese Ports on Panama Canal

Time Published: 2025-03-05T01:58:14Z

After significant pressure was exerted by President Donald Trump, Chinese company CK Hutchison has agreed to sell its two ports on the Panama Canal to U.S. investment company BlackRock per a Tuesday announcement. This move comes after Trump's allegations of excessive Chinese influence over the strategic waterway and his threats to reclaim U.S. control. The deal also encompasses an 80% stake in CK Hutchison's global port operations, spanning 43 ports across 23 countries. Trump's administration had expressed concerns over China's potential military use of the canal and its growing influence in Latin America, prompting demands for Panama to reduce Chinese presence. The Panama Canal, managed by the Panama Canal Authority since its transfer from U.S. control in 1999, has become a focal point in Trump's efforts to counter China's global influence.

Title: News Wrap: Massive storm threatens Mardi Gras in New Orleans

Thank you. Please check your inbox to confirm. Leave your feedback In our news wrap Tuesday, a massive storm system is threatening to put a damper on Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans, Arab leaders from across the Middle East endorsed a plan to ­rebuild Gaza, at least three Serbian lawmakers were injured after chaos erupted in the country's parliament and an investor group led by a U.S. firm BlackRock is buying two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. Notice: Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Amna Nawaz: We start the day's other headlines with a massive storm system that's rumbling across much of the country, stretching from Chicago all the way down to the Gulf. Woman: This is what we're seeing. Oh, holy… Amna Nawaz: The most severe thunderstorms are carving a path across the South tonight, leaving toppled buildings, debris, and more than 400,000 people without power from Texas to Mississippi. The weather system hasn't brought just rain. It's also kicked up blinding dust storms across parts of the Southwest. And it's threatening to put a damper on Mardi Gras festivities in New Orleans tonight. Officials moved up and shortened the city's two biggest parades, hoping to wrap things up before high winds move in. Turning overseas, Arab leaders from across the Middle East endorsed a plan today to rebuild the Gaza Strip. The measure would allow the territory's two million Palestinians to remain in Gaza. It's a counterproposal to President Trump's vision, which calls for removing Palestinians from the area and creating a beach destination. Experts warned such a plan would be a war crime under international law. At today's summit in Cairo, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi laid out his $53 billion plan, under which Hamas would cede power to an interim independent administration. Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, Egyptian President (through interpreter): The plan starts with immediate relief operations and early recovery efforts, leading to the full reconstruction of the enclave. Egypt calls for adopting this plan at our summit today and mobilizing regional and international support for it. Amna Nawaz: The president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, was also there. He told the summit he's ready to hold elections as early as next year if — quote — "conditions allow." The Palestinians have not held presidential elections in some two decades. In Serbia, at least three lawmakers were injured after chaos erupted in the country's Parliament today. Opposition lawmakers threw smoke bombs and flares as the chamber was set to vote on a measure that would increase funding for universities. They say the session was illegal and that Parliament must first confirm the resignation of the prime minister and his government. Milos Vucevic stepped down in January after months of anti-corruption demonstrations related to the collapse of a train station canopy that killed 15 people. Opposition parties say the government has no authority to pass new laws and are calling for new elections. The U.S. Senate has voted not to move forward a bill that would have banned transgender student athletes from participating in women and girls sports. Man: Three-fifths of the senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. Amna Nawaz: The measure needed 60 votes to proceed. It failed along party lines last night. The House has passed similar legislation with two Democrats supporting that bill. Republicans, led by President Trump, have frequently leaned into the issue of transgender athletes, framing it as unfair to women and girls. Many Democrats argue that such measures distract from more important issues facing the nation and could further isolate and harm transgender youth. An investor group led by U.S. firm BlackRock is buying two ports at either end of the Panama Canal. Those terminals are currently operated by the Hong Kong-based group C.K. Hutchison. They have been at the center of a dispute between the Trump administration and Panama, as President Trump accuses China of influencing the critical waterway. Last month, Panama's president denied that China had any control over canal operations. The roughly $23 billion deal requires approval from Panama's government. And now for some egg-citing news about two celebrity lovebirds who found fame online. Bald eagle power couple Jackie and Shadow of California's Big Bear Valley are now proud parents of two baby eaglets. Yesterday, a livestream showed some cracks in two of their new eggs. Then, just before midnight, new life entered the nest. Over 80,000 viewers tuned into the livestream this morning to watch the protective parents admire the eaglets and monitor a third egg which is expected to hatch in the coming days. So congratulations to Jackie and Shadow and the new members of their family. And from the beginnings of life to the passing of another. Robert Clark has died. He was elected Mississippi's first Black lawmaker of the 20th century in 1967. A teacher and descendant of enslaved people in a deeply segregated state, Clark was ostracized by his colleagues, forced to sit by himself in the House chamber and at official dinners. But Clark rose to the second highest leadership role in the Statehouse, a position he held until he retired in 2004. His son, Bryant Clark, who took over his father's seat, says Robert Clark died of natural causes. He was 96 years old.

Title: Hong Kong-based company to sell Panama Canal ports
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyzlk259g2o
Time Published: 2025-03-04T23:28:31Z
Full Content:
A Hong Kong-based company has agreed to sell most of its stake in two key ports on the Panama Canal to a group led by US investment firm BlackRock. The sale comes after weeks of complaining by President Donald Trump that the canal is under Chinese control and that the US should take control of the major shipping route. Through a subsidiary, CK Hutchison Holding operates ports at the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean entrances to the canal. It said Tuesday that it would sell its interests as part of a deal worth $22.8bn (£17.8bn). CK Hutchison, founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, is not owned by the Chinese government. But its base in Hong Kong means it operates under Chinese financial laws. It has operated the ports since 1997. The deal includes a total of 43 ports in 23 countries around the world, including the two canal terminals. It will require approval by the Panamanian government. The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Up to 14,000 ships travel through it each year, including container ships carrying cars, natural gas and other goods, and military vessels. It was built in the early 1900s. The US maintained control over the canal zone until 1977, when treaties gradually ceded the land back to Panama. After a period of joint control, Panama took sole control in 1999. Trump has made several arguments for retaking control of the canal and the surrounding area. He argued that Chinese influence is a national security threat, that the US investment in the initial building of the canal justifies taking back control, and that US ships are charged too much for using the waterway. In a visit to Panama in February, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio demanded that the country make "immediate changes" to what he calls the "influence and control" of China over the canal. Panama rejected the US government claims and President Jose Raul Mulino has said the canal "is and will remain" in the central American country's hands. In a statement announcing the business deal, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said: "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports." BlackRock is one of the world's largest asset management companies. The group buying the ports also includes Terminal Investment Limited, a Swiss company. The city's ammunition plant makes weapons for Ukraine, whose president paid it a visit last year. The president has pledged to eliminate the federal agency that oversees the US education system. The president also appeared to threaten civilians in Gaza, saying they would be "dead" if they held hostages. Tariffs are a central part of Trump's political vision, but economists warn they could put prices up. The Justice Department said Chinese agencies paid as much as $75,000 (£58,200) for each hacked email inbox. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Title: American interests regain control of key parts of Panama Canal

By Bob Unruh March 4, 2025 One of the major targets of President Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again campaign is the Panama Canal. That asset, he pointed out, was built with American lives and American money, and turned over to Panama to operate. However, he charged that China had embedded itself in the control functions of the canal, and he said that wouldn’t be allowed, suggesting that America could “take it back.” Now that has happened, more or less.

An announcement has confirmed that money manager BlackRock has taken control of key canal ports in a $19 billion deal.

The acquisition secures control over 40% of the canal’s container traffic.” It said, “Trump has long claimed China ‘runs’ the canal and vowed to ‘take it back’” Now, BlackRock’s move effectively does it for him. With two-thirds of the canal’s cargo linked to the U.S., this deal reshapes control over a critical global trade route.” Business Insider said BlackRock’s acquisition brings ports “on both sides of the Panama Canal” under U.S. control and the move “removes them from the control of CK Hutchison Holdings.” The report explained BlackRock is acquiring “a 90% interest in the Panama Ports Company alongside Global Infrastructure Partners and container terminal group Terminal Investment.” Panama’s participation in China’s “Belt and Road Initiative” in which China takes control of various infrastructure around the world earlier was canceled. CBS pointed out that the deal transfers control of “43 ports in 23 countries,” including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia and Pakistan. “This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP’s combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,” BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said. The report explained, “U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President José Raúl Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.” Bob Unruh joined WND in 2006 after nearly three decades with the Associated Press, as well as several Upper Midwest newspapers, where he covered everything from legislative battles and sports to tornadoes and homicidal survivalists.

Title: Volatility of btc vs MSTR

MSTR, or MicroStrategy, is a company heavily invested in Bitcoin, and its stock price tends to be more volatile than Bitcoin itself. Recent analyses, such as from Portfoliolab, indicate MSTR’s volatility at 22.14% annualized, compared to BTC’s 17.13%. This suggests MSTR experiences larger price swings, making it riskier for investors. Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has stated that MSTR’s volatility is approximately twice that of Bitcoin, which aligns with market observations. This higher volatility is partly due to MSTR’s leveraged strategy, using debt and equity to acquire more Bitcoin, amplifying price movements. An interesting aspect is that MSTR’s volatility isn’t just tied to Bitcoin’s price but is also influenced by its business operations and market sentiment, creating a complex risk profile not fully mirrored by BTC. This note provides a comprehensive examination of the volatility comparison between MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock and Bitcoin (BTC), drawing from recent data and market analyses as of March 4, 2025. Volatility, defined as the degree of variation in trading prices over time, is a critical metric for investors assessing risk. Here, we explore historical data, correlation, beta, and expert insights to understand the relative volatility and its implications. MicroStrategy, a company known for its business intelligence software, has pivoted significantly toward Bitcoin, holding substantial amounts as part of its treasury strategy. This shift, led by CEO Michael Saylor, has made MSTR a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, but with added layers of risk due to its corporate structure and financial strategies. Bitcoin, as a cryptocurrency, is inherently volatile, but its volatility has shown a declining trend over recent years, as noted in analyses from iShares – Blackrock. However, MSTR’s volatility appears to exceed BTC’s, driven by leverage and market dynamics. Recent data from Portfoliolab, published on February 23, 2025, provides a direct comparison: Another dataset from the same source, dated August 17, 2024, shows: These figures suggest MSTR consistently exhibits higher volatility, with variations possibly due to different time periods analyzed. The discrepancy highlights the importance of context, as market conditions can affect volatility measurements. This table underscores MSTR’s higher volatility, with a notable gap, especially in the more recent data. Michael Saylor’s statement, referenced in an X post by r/MSTR, claims MSTR’s volatility is twice that of Bitcoin. This aligns with Coindesk reporting MSTR’s volatility outpacing BTC by 2.5 times, based on a 30-day implied volatility (IV) of 140.86% for MSTR versus BTC’s lower figure. Such statements suggest a leveraged effect, where MSTR’s financial strategies, including debt issuance for Bitcoin purchases, amplify price movements. Correlation between MSTR and BTC varies by source. Portfoliolab reports a low correlation of 0.20, suggesting price changes are not closely related, which might seem counterintuitive given MSTR’s Bitcoin holdings. However, Coindesk cites a 65% correlation using 12 months of daily closing price data, indicating a moderate to high relationship. This discrepancy may reflect different time frames or methodologies. Beta, a measure of volatility relative to a benchmark, is less straightforward for BTC as it’s not a stock. For MSTR, Yahoo Finance lists a 5-year monthly beta of 3.37 against the market, indicating high volatility. Analyzing the Correlation Between MicroStrategy’s Stock and Bitcoin suggests MSTR’s beta relative to BTC is around 1.10 to 1.14 over recent periods, implying it moves slightly more than BTC, supporting the volatility gap. MSTR’s volatility is not solely tied to BTC’s price. Its strategy involves issuing convertible bonds and equity to buy more Bitcoin, as noted in The math behind MicroStrategy’s bitcoin bet. This leverage creates a 2.5x volatility effect compared to BTC, according to Coindesk. Additionally, MSTR’s business intelligence operations and market sentiment, as discussed in Strategy vs Bitcoin, add further volatility, making it a complex investment vehicle. For investors, MSTR’s higher volatility means greater potential returns but also increased risk, especially in bear markets. Seeking Alpha notes MSTR moves 1.5 times more in the same direction as BTC, suggesting amplified gains in bull markets but sharper declines otherwise. This aligns with Reddit discussions, such as r/MSTR, where users observe MSTR moving 2x BTC up and down, reflecting leverage risks. Based on the data, MSTR exhibits higher volatility than BTC, with recent figures suggesting a range of 18.49% to 22.14% for MSTR versus 10.40% to 17.13% for BTC. CEO statements and market analyses reinforce this, with MSTR’s volatility estimated at 2 to 2.5 times that of BTC due to leverage and operational factors. This makes MSTR a riskier but potentially more rewarding investment compared to direct BTC exposure. When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS
