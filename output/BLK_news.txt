Title: Satya Nadella’s biggest AI bubble warning yet is a challenge to the Fortune 500: it’s time to reinvent the knowledge worker

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has been leading the charge on artificial intelligence for years, owing to his long alliance with OpenAI’s Sam Altman and the groundbreaking work from his own AI CEO, Mustafa Suleyman, particularly with the Copilot tool. But Nadella has not spoken often about the fears that rattled Wall Street for much of the back half of 2025: whether AI is a bubble. At the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella sat down for a conversation with the forum’s interim co-chair, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, explaining that if AI growth spawns solely from investment, then that could be a sign of a bubble. “A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” However, Nadella offers a fix to that productivity dilemma, calling on business leaders to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.” This change is not wholly unprecedented, as Nadella pointed out, comparing the current moment to that of the 1980s, when computing revolutionized the workplace and opened up new opportunities for growth and productivity and created a new class of workers. “We invented this entire class of thing called knowledge work, where people started really using computers to amplify what we were trying to achieve using software,” he said. “I think in the context of AI, that same thing is going to happen.” Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “No, no, it’s actually—it flattens the entire information flow. So once you start having that, you have to redesign structurally.” That shift may be harder for some Fortune 500 companies as structural changes could be accompanied by uncomfortable growing pains. Nadella says that leaner companies will be able to more easily adopt AI because their organizational structures are fresher and more malleable. On the other hand, large companies could take time to adopt new workflows. Despite widespread adoption of AI, the 29th edition of PwC’s Global CEO Survey found that only 10% to 12% of companies reported seeing benefits from the technology on the revenue or cost side, while 56% reported getting nothing out of it. It follows up on an even more pessimistic finding about AI returns from August 2025: that 95% of generative AI pilots were failing. PwC global chairman Mohamed Kande spoke to Fortune’s Diane Brady at Davos about the finding that many CEOs are cautious and lack confidence at this stage of the AI adoption cycle. “Somehow AI moves so fast … that people forgot that the adoption of technology, you have to go to the basics,” he explained, with the survey finding that the companies seeing benefits from AI are “putting the foundations in place.” It’s about execution more than it is about technology, he argued, and good management and leadership are really going to matter going forward. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools.” New entrants have the advantage of “starting fresh” and constructing workflows around AI capabilities, while larger firms will have to contend with the flattening effect AI has on entire departments and specializations. To be sure, Nadella says that large organizations have kept an upper hand, especially when it comes to relationships, data, and know-how. However, he maintains that firms must understand how to use those resources to their advantage to change management style, which could otherwise pose a major roadblock. “The bottom line is, if you don’t translate that with a new production function, then you really will be stuck,” he said.

Title: No Company ‘Can Just Coast’ in the A.I. Era, Warns Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella

No corporation, big or small, can avoid the challenges of adapting to A.I., according to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. Larger corporations will be forced to integrate the technology to ward off newcomers, while smaller players must contend with barriers to achieving scale. “It’s going to be a very competitively intense world,” said Nadella during an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, today (Jan. 20). “Neither side, whether you’re a new entrant or an incumbent, can just coast.” Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. In some ways, it may be easier for newer, smaller competitors to accommodate A.I.’s pervasiveness, since they can build their organizations with the technology in mind from the outset. Bigger and more established rivals, meanwhile, will be forced to navigate sweeping organizational change. “Unless your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools,” said Nadella. For now, large companies appear to have the edge. Across corporations with annual revenues exceeding $15 billion, nearly three-quarters of leaders said their organizations are using A.I. on an enterprise-wide basis, compared with just 22 percent of executives at companies with revenues of between $1 billion and $4.9 billion, according to a recent study from Forbes Research. But the disruptive effects of adopting A.I. also grow as companies scale. Most leaders at smaller firms predicted that fewer than 2 percent of roles would be eliminated by the technology over the next few years, compared with 45 percent of executives at larger corporations. It isn’t just companies that A.I. will help equalize, but countries as well. The quality of software developers, startups and large-scale organizations does not vary dramatically from nation to nation, according to Nadella. “It’s fascinating—you can show up in Jakarta, you can show up in Istanbul, you can show up in Mexico City. It’s not that different than showing up even in say Seattle or San Francisco,” Nadella said. The growing accessibility of A.I. has fueled its global spread. Still, Western countries—and in particular the U.S.—retain “more of an energy” when it comes to embracing the technology, said Nadella. As A.I. continues to integrate across societies and economies, the size of a corporation—and the country in which it’s located—will matter less and less. What will matter more, Nadella suggested, is how much control companies maintain over A.I. systems that incorporate their proprietary knowledge. If companies fail to embed that data, they risk “leaking” enterprise value to outside model developers, Nadella noted, describing this as an emerging competitive concern. “The topic that’s least talked about, but I feel will be most talked about in this calendar year, will be the sovereignty of a firm,” said Nadella. “It’s sort of fascinating that nobody’s talking about that.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: BlackRock’s billionaire CEO warns AI could be capitalism’s next big failure after 30 years of unsustainable inequality after the Cold War
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/20/blackrock-billionaire-ceo-larry-fink-capitalism-critique-ai-world-economic-forum-davos/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T17:51:56Z

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink opened the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, with a stark message to the global elite: AI’s unfettered growth risks pummelling the world’s working and professional classes. Beyond that, he warned that it could be capitalism’s next big failure after a 30-year reign after the Cold War that has failed to deliver for the average human being in society. In his opening remarks on Tuesday at the gathering of thousands of executives and global leaders, the billionaire boss of the world’s largest asset manager—often called one of Wall Street’s “Masters of the Universe”—said that as those in power discuss the future of AI, they risk leaving behind the vast majority of the world, just as they have for much of the last generation. “Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more wealth has been created than in any time prior in human history, but in advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain,” Fink said. Fink, who has used his annual BlackRock letters and annual appearances at Davos to set the agenda for a more progressive kind of capitalism, even one that is arguably “woke,” making him at times the face of ESG and of stakeholder capitalism, warned that the gains of the tremendous wealth creation since the 1990s have not been equitably shared. And the capitalist ideology driving AI development and implementation forward could come at the expense of the wage-earning majority, he added. “Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data and owners of infrastructure,” Fink said. “The open question: What happens to everyone else if AI does to white-collar workers what globalization did to blue-collar workers? We need to confront that today directly. It is not about the future. The future is now.” Fink, who was appointed interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab, has long espoused the reshaping of capitalism, seeing it as a responsibility of large asset managers like himself. Fink was formerly vociferous about the importance of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, and has argued that climate change is reshaping finance, creating an imperative for executives to reallocate their capital to address the crisis accordingly. In a 2022 letter to investors, published the day before the Davos summit, Fink emphasized a model of “stakeholder capitalism” of a business’s mandate to serve not just shareholders, but employees, consumers, and the public. Fink’s new primacy in Davos is the first without Schwab, following allegations that he had expensed more than $1 million, billed to the World Economic Forum, on questionable travel spending, as well as claims of workplace misconduct and research report manipulation. The BlackRock chief emphasized the need for the gathering to demonstrate its legitimacy in part by showing that it’s concerned with more than just swelling growth of companies and countries, but also the economic welfare of its employees and citizens. “Many of the people most affected by what we talk about here will never come to this conference,” Fink said. “That’s a central tension of this forum. Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone.” Though BlackRock announced in early 2025 it would roll back many of the diversity, equity, and inclusion goals it created a few years before, Fink has once again used his spotlight to call on leaders to transform their capitalist sensibilities, this time in how they imagine the AI future. Last year capped an explosion of growth in the AI sector, with Morningstar analysts finding a group of 34 AI stocks, including Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft, shot up 50.8% in 2025. AI firms and investors have seen their wealth skyrocket in the past year, with Per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the median increase in net worth last year was nearly $10 billion among the 50 wealthiest Americans. Google co-founder Larry Page and Sergey Brin, for example, got $101 billion and $92 billion richer, respectively, in 2025. The BlackRock CEO noted these gains, however, have been reserved for the richest few, alluding to a K-shaped economy of the rich getting richer, while the poor continue to struggle: The bottom half of Americans, in short, are not cashing in on the AI race. Although Fink didn’t get into the politics of utilities setting electricity prices, it seems the poor are actually paying higher bills to support the data centers powering the AI boom. According to Federal Reserve data, the poorer demographic owns about 1% of stock market wealth, translating to about 165 million people owning $628 billion in stock. Conversely, the top 1% of wealthiest households own nearly 50% of corporate equity. Fink’s framing of the post-Cold War era as one of exploding inequality represents a mainstreaming of a once niche view that has become increasingly mainstream in the 21st century. While the triumph of the west over communism was seen as the ultimate victory for capitalism, as epitomized by Francis Fukuyama’s The End of History and the Last Man, history has in fact continued. The unprecedented rise of China as an economic superpower, through its fusion of socialism and capitalism “with Chinese characteristics,” has complicated the narrative, as has the inequality alluded to by Fink. An internal critic of the post-Cold War world order is Andrew Bacevich, a military veteran and historian who likened the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 as “akin to removing the speed limiter from an internal combustion engine.” Bacevich’s 2020 book The Age of Illusions: How America Squandered Its Cold War Victory, was an early articulation of the once niche viewpoint that Fink lent support to on Tuesday. Similarly, the risks of the AI boom on workers extends beyond who has a stake in the technology industry’s growth. Nobel laureate and “godfather of AI” Geoffrey Hinton has previously warned this explosion of wealth for the few will come at the expense of white-collar workers, who will be displaced by the technology. “What’s actually going to happen is rich people are going to use AI to replace workers,” Hinton said in September. “It’s going to create massive unemployment and a huge rise in profits. It will make a few people much richer and most people poorer. That’s not AI’s fault, that is the capitalist system.” Some companies have already leaned into culling headcount to grow profits, including enterprise-software firm IgniteTech. CEO Eric Vaughan laid off nearly 80% of his staff in early 2023, according to figures reviewed by Fortune. Vaughan said the reductions happened during an inflection point in the tech industry, where failure to efficiently adopt AI could be fatal for a company. He’s since rehired for all of those roles, and he would make the same choice again today, he told Fortune. According to Fink, sustaining a white-collar workforce will depend on the world’s most powerful people creating an actionable plan that will defy the critiques of capitalism that has, so far, stood to predominantly benefit them. “Now with abstractions about the jobs of tomorrow, but with a credible plan for broad participation in these gains, this is going to be the test,” Fink said. “Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth, instead of spectators watching it happen.”

Title: Trump may name Jerome Powell’s replacement at Davos: Meet the top 4 candidates for Fed Chair
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/20/trump-naming-fed-chair-pick-davos-world-economic-forum-jerome-powell-kevin-warsh/

Between the usual panels and buzzier geopolitical debates grabbing headlines, the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is playing host to a high-stakes drama: Who will emerge as the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, and on what terms? President Donald Trump is nearing an announcement on who should lead the Federal Reserve once Jerome Powell’s term ends in May, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and speculation is growing that Trump could do so during his Davos address on Wednesday. Although Trump has claimed for weeks that he already knows his pick, he has appeared to relish turning what is typically a staid confirmation process into a political spectacle—what some analysts have likened to a Celebrity Apprentice–style reveal. What began as showmanship has now evolved into a full-blown institutional standoff among the Justice Department, members of the Senate, and jittery financial markets parsing every hint about whether the next Fed chair will lean dovish or hawkish. The search process has been upended by a Department of Justice investigation into Chair Powell, centered on renovations at the Federal Reserve’s headquarters. Powell has publicly decried the investigation as a “pretext” for political intimidation, a sentiment echoed by a bipartisan coalition of former Fed chairs and sitting GOP senators. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina has already signaled a potential blockade, vowing to oppose any nominee until the DOJ investigation is fully resolved. This move could prevent Trump’s pick from even reaching a floor vote, at least in the foreseeable future. For much of the past year, National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett appeared to be the natural heir apparent. A veteran of Republican economic policymaking and a key architect of the 2017 tax overhaul, Hassett enjoys credibility with GOP lawmakers and Fed officials alike. Yet his prominence inside the Trump administration has become a liability. Hassett has emerged as one of the White House’s most visible economic messengers, frequently defending administration policy on television. He’s good at that unsavory job, Trump said on Friday, and the president is afraid of “losing him” in that position. “I’m saying, ‘Wait a minute, if I move him, these Fed guys—certainly the one we have now—they don’t talk much,’” Trump said to reporters at a White House event, then addressed Hassett, who was listening in the audience. “I would lose you. It’s a serious concern to me.” Analysts suggest the move reflects a pragmatic calculation by the administration; given the toxic environment surrounding the Powell investigation, Hassett’s close political ties to the president might have made him an impossible sell for a Senate Banking Committee determined to reassert the Fed’s institutional independence. Markets were unhappy about the potential loss of a clear Fed dove, however, and the 10-year Treasury closed on a four-month high Friday. As Hassett’s path narrows, attention has increasingly shifted back to Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor who led the forced takeovers and bailouts during the 2008 financial crisis before publicly breaking with Chair Ben Bernanke over quantitative easing, in which the Fed creates money to buy bonds to push down interest rates. Warsh is widely viewed by markets as the “independence candidate,” hawkish on inflation, skeptical of political pressure, and institutionally orthodox. The more toxic the Powell investigation becomes, the stronger Warsh’s appeal grows among senators eager to reassert the Fed’s credibility. He was in the final running for Fed chair against Powell in 2017, and while he was praised (many times) by Trump for his good looks, he was ultimately passed up because of his relative youth.In the second Trump term, Warsh is not only 55, but has seen his main dogmas grow more in vogue. His famous slogan, “Inflation is a choice,” refers to his belief that the Fed raises interest rates when the economy “grows too much” and workers “get paid too much,” rather than owing to real inflation. He has warned for years that the government’s $38 trillion debt is influencing the Fed’s decision-making, incentivizing it to keep interest rates artificially low to reduce the cost of servicing the debt. Now that many economists and politicians have begun warning of “fiscal dominance,” Warsh’s views might be palatable to the markets and his potential fellow Fed governors. But if Warsh is also considered too political, Trump may turn to a quieter option, Christopher Waller. A sitting Fed governor with a reputation for accurate forecasting, Waller is seen by many as the technocratic fallback: less politically exposed, less polarizing, and potentially easier to confirm. When a group of CEOs at a recent Yale event responded to a live poll about who they wanted for Fed chair, 81% chose Waller. That’s likely because Waller has consistently argued for more rate cuts, with little evidence he is politically captured. That ability to thread the needle is more important now than ever. Markets might rejoice if Trump announces BlackRock executive Rick Rieder as the dark-horse pick. The only person on the short list with no Fed experience—something considered a positive in the administration—Rieder oversees $2.4 trillion in bonds as BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income. He has also vocally called for a lower neutral interest rate, noting that AI gains will be disinflationary and that the Fed’s challenge now is to avoid “labor potholes.” As the Davos summit begins, the focus remains on the “two Kevins” and the looming decision that will define the American economy for the latter end of the Trump era. If Trump does use his Davos address to name Jerome Powell’s successor, the pick would still need to get past the Senate Banking Committee to make it to the floor for a vote. If the DOJ investigation doesn’t get resolved, Trump might not be able to get anyone through the GOP coalition on the banking committee that is standing by Powell. But investors are betting that Powell will not be indicted, and Justice Department official Jeanine Pirro, who apparently spearheaded the investigation, has softened her posture slightly, writing on X that the matter is just a question of Powell responding to Justice Department “outreach.”

Alex Karp, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of the AI defense technology company Palantir, had a top humanities-based education. Karp graduated from Haverford College, an elite liberal arts college in Pennsylvania, with a degree in philosophy. He then attended Stanford Law School and later earned a Ph.D. in neoclassical social theory at a top German university. "A very, very strong education," Karp said during a panel at the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. In the age of AI, that kind of academic trajectory will doom you, Karp told Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, who was leading the discussion. AI "will destroy humanities jobs," Karp said. "You went to an elite school, and you studied philosophy — hopefully you have some other skill," Karp said, because that skillset is going to be very hard to market. The Palantir CEO said it would probably be possible for those with humanities backgrounds to keep a job once they secure it, but he said technicians and those with other vocational skill sets are going to be in the highest demand. He gave the example of people building batteries for a battery company, saying that "they're very valuable, if not irreplaceable, because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly." "There will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training," Karp told Fink. But not all at Davos agree with the tech leader's assessment of the future of jobs. Finance executives attending the global forum have been telling Business Insider's Dan DeFrancesco that liberal arts degrees might be the new hot commodity. As AI takes on more of the hard financial analysis, it is transforming the skill set executives prioritize in young recruits. Critical creative thinkers are back in the spotlight. Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei also weighed in on jobs during a joint panel on Tuesday, saying that entry-level hiring at their companies was already declining due to AI. Amodei said software and coding roles at Anthropic were down in both the junior and mid-levels of his company. Jump to

Title: Explaining the Japanese bond-market rebellion that has the whole world on edge

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump's latest threats to hike tariffs on major European economies are shaking up markets on Tuesday, but a surge in Japanese bonds yields is also weighing on investor sentiment. Japanese 40-year bond yields surged to 4.2% on Tuesday from 3.94% on Monday — the first time ever they've crossed the 4% mark. Yields started the year at 3.6%. Rates on 30- and 20-year bonds have also spiked. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Jeffrey Favuzza, an equities trader at Jefferies, called the Tuesday sell-off a two-standard-deviation move lower. When yields rise, bond prices fall. What's behind the volatility? A potential pause on food taxes. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi called a snap parliamentary election set to be held on February 8. Takaichi's goal is to gain more support for her agenda — which includes a proposed 2-year break from the 8% tax on food products — in the new parliament. The news has been too much for investors to swallow. Japan's government debt levels have already been a concern for markets, and investors fear such a tax holiday would exacerbate an already shaky fiscal situation. As of 10:30 am ET, the S&P 500 was down 1.16%, while the Nikkei 225 had fallen 1.11%. Meanwhile, gold, which investors have increasingly seen as a hedge to the threat of global fiat currency debasement, was up 3.3%. The Japanese bond turmoil was part of a one-two punch battering markets, along with Donald Trump's increasingly aggressive rhetoric on Greenland. "These moves highlight the extent to which investors are souring on this snap election that is promising a food sales tax holiday, which will only make a bad fiscal situation worse," David Rosenberg, the founder of Rosenberg Research, said in a note on Tuesday. "Since Takaichi took office in October, longer-term interest rates have jumped +80 basis points, with obvious spillover effects across the globe." Rising Japanese bond yields have an impact on broader markets because of the country's outsize influence on global capital flows. Both domestic and foreign investors have used low yields to lever up positions in higher-yielding assets like US Treasurys and stocks. With yields surging, Japanese investors could pivot away from US bond markets and simply buy domestic government debt. It also revives fears of an unwind of the "carry trade." Concerns about the carry trade have been on display in recent years, as investors fear an unwind of levered positions amid rising Japanese yields. Yields on 30-year US Treasurys rose to 4.9% on Tuesday from 4.84% on Monday. Generally, higher long-term government bond yields tend to hurt equity performance as investors can get attractive returns on risk-free assets. How things develop in Japan in the days ahead should be top of mind for investors, said Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, in a note on Tuesday. "On a quieter data week, we are looking at what global flash PMIs say about global activity. Otherwise, the focus is on Japan where the expected snap election may pave the way for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to pursue looser fiscal policy and add more pressure to global long-term bond yields," Boivin and his team wrote. There are plenty of other things happening this week for investors to keep an eye on, too. For one, Trump is speaking in Davos on Wednesday, perhaps offering another update to his approach to acquiring Greenland from Denmark. Trump may also join G7 leaders for dinner in Paris on Thursday, per an invite from French President Emmanuel Macron. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data is also out on Friday, which could provide a window into whether renewed tariff uncertainty is weighing on Americans' economic outlook. Jump to

Title: Disney Reverses Exclusion of Shareholder Proposal to Review Controversial Disability Access Pass Changes

Full Content:
Last month, we reported on a new proposal made on behalf of DAS Defenders calling on the Walt Disney Company to conduct an independent and public review of its controversial Disability Access Service policy changes. This resolution was originally excluded from shareholder consideration, but now Disney is reversing course and including it in its proxy materials for a vote. Here’s the latest on that, what it means and doesn’t, and why this is happening. As quick background, Disney overhauled DAS at Walt Disney World and Disneyland back in May 2024. According to the company, the changes were due in large part to abuse, misuse, and proliferation of the program’s use–with issuances of DAS tripling from 2019 to last year. For more about the specifics of the overhauled DAS, see Disability Access Service (DAS) Changes at Walt Disney World FAQ. The new system has now been in place for well over a year, and there have been direct impacts for disabled guests as well as indirect ones for all guests. To the latter point, we’ve written a lot about the impact of the DAS changes on wait times at Walt Disney World. Most recently, in Is Lightning Lane Multi Pass Still “Worth It” at Disney World? Suffice to say, standby lines are shorter and faster moving, with wait times being lower year-over-year as a result of the DAS crackdown. Even over 18 months later, the DAS overhaul remains controversial. It’s also a sensitive subject that is personal since it’s make or break for some guests trying to experience Walt Disney World and Disneyland. There have been reports of guests who previously had DAS being denied and advised to use alternative accommodations instead. here have also been a number of small tweaks to DAS over the last year, some of which could be attributed to a pending class action lawsuit. With that background out of the way, let’s turn to the shareholder proposal. Our previous coverage of this confused some readers, and the latest wrinkle is only going to compound that confusion (just look at that headline–quite the mouthful). Accordingly, we’re going to try to simplify and condense this to the greatest extent possible. Here goes nothing… Disney’s brand and financial stability are under strain from underperforming films, rising park costs, consumer boycotts, and waning trust. According to the resolution, a significant contributor to this strain is the company’s recent overhaul of disability accommodations at its parks due to negative media coverage, social media, guests canceling trips and Annual Passes, as well as legal exposure to a class action lawsuit. As a result of the controversial DAS changes, Disney exposed itself to legal claims, regulatory scrutiny, and brand damage. Other companies have faced multimillion-dollar settlements under accessibility-related actions. Future liabilities could include costly settlements, operational disruption, and weakened market positioning. Accordingly, shareholder resolution requests that Disney commission an independent review of DAS, conducted by a qualified third party. This review should assess legal, financial, and reputational risks; evaluate Disney’s policies against competitors; and identify opportunities for improvement. The resolution further requests a public summary on the findings for accountability and transparency. In its original response letter from late last year, the Walt Disney Company wrote that it intended to exclude the aforementioned shareholder proposal from the proxy materials for its 2026 annual meeting of shareholders. This meant that shareholders would not vote on whether to approve the resolution for the independent review. Disney also sought assurance of no enforcement action from the SEC following the exclusion. Disney’s argument for exclusion was that any attendance decrease in the last fiscal year was attributable to hurricanes. Moreover, park operations are ordinary business and not subject to shareholder micromanagement; that they’ve already done their due diligence on the DAS changes, and there’s no duty to disclose any nonpublic information. You can read Disney’s full argument here. Fast forward to January 2026, and Disney has sent a new letter to the SEC withdrawing its no-action request, meaning that they no longer are seeking any assurances from the SEC. The reason they’re doing this is simple: because they’ve reversed course and decided to include the aforementioned shareholder proposal in their proxy materials for the 2026 annual meeting. If you’re confused, you’re probably not alone. Here’s what this does and doesn’t mean, along with some quick commentary… For starters, this does NOT mean that the Walt Disney Company has suddenly had a change of heart and is agreeing with the shareholder proposal in any way, shape, or form. It does not mean they have agreed to the independent audit being sought. If that were the case, this would be a different letter entirely; probably a joint statement from Disney and the shareholder (or the advocacy group behind him) indicating that the parties are moving forward with collaborative and constructive efforts on reviewing the DAS changes and current policies. That sort of thing. Instead, what Disney is saying is that they’re going to let shareholders vote on whether to conduct such a review. This shareholder proposal will almost certainly be voted down. One of the reader misconceptions in response to our previous coverage was that this proposal was being driven by investors concerned about the impact of the DAS changes on the company’s financials. It’s probably better viewed as a subset of shareholders framing an issue that’s personally important to them in such a way to make it appropriate for proxy vote; a different angle for contesting the DAS changes, aside from litigation. Anyone who has listened to the annual meetings knows that there are a lot of politically-charged and niche causes presented. All of them are summarily shot down without much in the way of further discussion. As a Disney shareholder, I could write a proposal about how the company’s refusal to reimagine Journey into Imagination has resulted in financial strain, underperformance, unrealized earnings, social media backlash, and brand damage. I could cite things like popcorn bucket, merchandise sales, and DTB blog posts in support of my position. It would be a more ‘legitimate’ way of raising the issue (as opposed to during the Q&A), but it would be an equally futile effort. There’s no reason to believe the fate of this DAS proposal will be any different. While we strongly believe Disney should do a better job at finding a middle ground and have a more delicate touch in handling DAS, it’s hard to see this as something with which shareholders will concern themselves. One important thing to keep in mind here is that it’s not the individual shareholders who are outcome-determine on things like this. It won’t be plugged-in fans who are sympathetic to the plight of disabled guests casting the deciding votes. It’s the large institutional ones who are make or break. And although Disney’s stock has underperformed for the last several years, that’s definitely not attributable to the theme parks. If anything, the parks are what is carrying the company and preventing that share price from dipping well below $100. As we’ve covered in earnings call reports and crowds coverage, attendance was down year-over-year (by about 1%), but that was largely attributable to hurricanes ($120 million disclosed losses). Meanwhile, the parks continue to set revenue records and hotel occupancy continues to rise. Right or wrong, that’s what matters to shareholders. Simply put, institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity are not going to concern themselves with this. It will be deemed too trivial, and they will accept Disney’s arguments that were laid out above. The shareholder proposal will fail, and it won’t even be a close vote. Given that, the more curious question from my perspective is why Disney even bothered to exclude the shareholder proposal in the first place? One particularly astute commenter, Jack, offered this explanation in response on the previous post: First, they’ll have to draft a response in their proxy statement as to why shareholders should vote no on the campaign. This opens up its own can of worms – if they make a material misstatement, they could be liable for false/misleading proxy materials. The legal due diligence to prevent such an error probably isn’t cheap either. Second, letting the proposal come to vote is far more “public” than asking the SEC to issue a no-action letter. Most Disney tourists and media outlets aren’t going to search through EDGAR to see Disney’s request for non-enforcement from the SEC on this proposal (you are the exception that proves the rule, of course). But I could certainly see far more media attention on this issue if it came up during the annual shareholder meeting. Moreover, they’d be “on the record” as well. Disney can’t just point to Wall Street and say that businessmen voted against the proposal: Disney is the one *telling Wall Street* to vote against it! Finally, allowing the proposal to move forward would draw more attention to the DAS Defenders and activists proposals in general. As it stands, Disney is taking the position that this proposal isn’t even worth voting on – it’s shareholder micromanagement, substantially overlapping with current plans to review DAS access, etc. If Disney actually responded to the proposal in the proxy statement, it almost legitimizes the opposition. Disney, with its history of hostile activist campaigns since the ’80s and especially recently with Trian, likely doesn’t want to give even one inch here lest other shareholder activists get any ideas about taking a mile. I found this explanation to be persuasive at the time (and largely still do). Although the no-action request drew some media attention (including from the mainstream), more eyeballs will certainly be on the annual shareholder meeting. At the same time, there are always a lot of shareholder proposals that are quickly shot down and I seldom (if ever?) see coverage of those. It’s easy to zone out during that section of the call, as anyone who has ever listened can likely tell you. The signal to noise ratio is not so hot during that portion of the meeting. Regardless, it’s odd for Disney to reverse course at this point. Attention has now been drawn to an (likely doomed) shareholder proposal twice, and theoretically will again once the annual meeting rolls around. It makes me wonder what change happened in the background over the course of the last month. UPDATE: As KenMH pointed out in the comments to this post, the SEC issued a Statement Regarding the Division of Corporation Finance’s Role in the Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 Process for the Current Proxy Season on November 17, 2025. With this, the SEC has determined to not respond to no-action requests for, and express no views on, companies’ intended reliance on any basis for exclusion of shareholder proposals. That statement was made 10 days after Disney submitted its no-action letter, so Disney wouldn’t have known of that position when making the request. Basically, this means that the Walt Disney Company is not going to get a response from the SEC with regard to its no-action letter. On this same basis, many other companies have withdrawn their no-action requests, presumably due to the legal uncertainty of them (just look at all of the “withdrawn” parentheticals here). That’s the simplest and most straightforward for this reversal; that Disney is taking the certainty of the proposal being shot down by shareholders over the risk of an enforcement action resulting from excluding it without the backing of the SEC. My guess is that Disney’s proxy response will say as little as possible (for the reasons Jack laid out), likely just reiterating the ground covered in their original letter to the SEC. That’s probably all the convincing it’ll take for BlackRock, Vanguard, etc. Ultimately, we do not anticipate any major changes to DAS at Walt Disney World or Disneyland. Nor do we view there being any likelihood of success with the shareholder proposal. There is not going to be another overhaul to Disability Access Service, absent the aforementioned class action lawsuit or other litigation prevailing. That happening is also doubtful. Disney has been sued over every single iteration of its disability accommodations, and I’ve yet to find any record of them losing on any count. I can’t see anything different about this lawsuit; if anything, Disney might be able to better argue that lines and crowds are inherent to the theme park experience. The company has already endured a lengthy PR hit over these changes, there’s no chance they’ll voluntarily endure that again with another overhaul. What, if anything, does happen will be a slow trickle of rule relaxations. But with no major changes in the last several months, even that is now looking increasingly unlikely. We’ll conclude by once again reiterating our position that Disney should work towards improving DAS. Just because we believe this shareholder proposal is almost certain to fail doesn’t mean we don’t think Disney should take a second-look at its DAS policies. They should. The company has an exemplary reputation for guest service. The need for DAS reform was absolutely understandable, as there was rampant abuse exacerbated by social media, entitlement, and Disney creating an incentive for DAS scammers by monetizing line-skipping via Lightning Lanes. There have been heartbreaking stories of DAS denials, and these have made clear that a more flexible and humane approach offering greater discretion to Cast Members is optimal. It seems that Disney went too far with the DAS overhaul; the pendulum swung from one extreme to another. There has been a lot of collateral damage among disabled guests who needed DAS and have been denied under the overly-stringent system. The DAS changes haven’t just eradicated the scammers, they have hurt guests who are actually disabled. It’s time to recalibrate from the extremes to the center. The most obvious change we’d like to see is a “humanizing” of the interview, not just expanded rules and policies for the mechanics of that process. We’ve heard from many readers who have been denied, and there’s a word that has been used repeatedly to describe the process: interrogation. While we can appreciate how stressful this process is for Cast Members and the verbal abuse they take for disgruntled guests, there’s a better way of handling the process that feels less adversarial. Even if the letter of the DAS policies isn’t going to change, the company still should live up to its reputation by finding a gentler way to handle the process. Planning a Walt Disney World trip?

Thoughts on the shareholder proposal for an independent review of DAS changes at Walt Disney World and Disneyland? Hopeful that further changes will be made that result in increased approvals for those who truly need DAS while keeping abuse low? Agree or disagree with our assessment of the changes or policy as a whole? Please try to stay on topic–we’ve noticed some of these DAS comments sections get heated and personal. Discuss the policy itself, not others’ use (or lack thereof) of it. I have to agree with the comment that many accommodations were thought up in a different time- when you didn’t see half the attendees at the park qualifying with a disability and bringing their entire family in tow. Even if we ignore that gen z 53% stat – you can just add up general population percentages for some major diagnoses (autism, ADHD, anaphylaxis allergies, IBD, etc) and without much trouble you’re right up in the 30-40% range before looking at things like PTSD and anxiety. I would love the idea of a sensory waiting area – but that gets back to a combination of things people don’t want to say and things that they are already complaining about- the drama at the moment with the current situation is that people are saying it’s only autism that qualifies, so if you made the accommodation something that only addressed the needs of a specific stereotype of autism, we haven’t made progress. People want the freedom to do whatever with that wait time. (need and want, but it’s VERY individual) Penning them into a dark quiet room with half the park with the same pass is no better than leaving them in line. It begs the question of what about those of us who NEED that time for the bathroom? NEED to eat on a schedule, NEED to be away from the smells, the foods, etc. The people who see it as fair use and a need to go nap and return for their ride? It would be a massive endeavor significantly altering the business model (the amount of space would be mindboggling) and still nobody would be happy with it. You would now have a dark, sensory room crammed to the gills with screaming children waiting with their sibling who create the exact environment people in the room were escaping in the first place. There obviously isn’t an easy answer, but the reality that there IS significant data that giving a “do whatever with your time without waiting in the physical line” pass to everyone with a disability is an unreasonable tax on park operations and is unsustainable for not only everyone without the pass, but also for those who had the strongest need for it. It must be acknowledged that can be both unfair that people who are uncomfortable with a line are stuck in a line, and also unfair that the alternative asks others to wait in a line that takes 4x as long so that others don’t have to wait in the line. It might become more equitable if they could work out a system that considered usage – because when someone with a DAS can ride multiple times what a non-DAS user can in the same time, that is not equal. Then you get into it not being fair to limit the disabled group when others aren’t “limited” but the reality is the non-DAS group is in every practical way limited BY those using the DAS due to their lowered capability to accomplish the same tasks. We need DAS to return. The return time is important but especially with DAS Pass. The best part of DAS is that I receive a return time but I do not have to return at that particular time. I can come back anytime up until park closes. Yes, I can not get another pass until this one is used but it allows me to go on mine train when I feel I can without any issues. (Epileptic) I continue to go to WDW several times a year for the love of Walt Disney himself. My last trip a week ago was not able to get on anything. I have another trip planed in March at the BC and I know I will not get on anything again. Yes, I still have the shows. It is my hope that the powers to be will come up with something even if it is one ride per day. George MC My autistic son just got denied to get the DAS since the third party Health representative at the guest services decided that she can not give it to him unless he goes into the que inside Disneyland and if he gets a panic attack then she might consider. We have all the reports of his neurological assessment and a proof that he has autism, epilepsy, and severe anxiety, in addition to social disorder, still, she said that she can Not see his medical record and Does not want to read them.:” he doesn’t qualify for DAS. “He gets panic attacks around people especially in crowds and ques, yet he loves Disneyland. We always had the privilege to get him a DAS at Disney where he gets the best time of his life. After spending 3-7 pm ( 4 hrs) today asking for different managers, at the guest services, they all said that she is the one who decides on whether he qualifies or not. I am really heart-broken, we have booked the annual non-refundable magic passes, only to go back home with a mental and emotional breakdown. Thank you truly for writing that article, it is meant to be for me today. Disneyland is Not the Happiest Place On Earth Anymore. It is discriminatory, where families of special needs kids feel left out and never ever would make the same mistake of purchasing tickets again. Some thoughts: 1. KenMH is on the money, definitely missed that as well in the first news cycle. I think that there are some plausible explanations for the delay between asking for SEC staff comment on excluding the proposal and then the about-face here. There are the holidays, filing requirements for 10-Qs/10-Ks, and weighing the uncertain litigation risk from DAS Defenders if they were to exclude the proposal without SEC approval. The last factor is likely the most important. My guess is that after the SEC’s updated guidance, Disney Legal took their time mulling over the costs and decided that letting it come to a vote was worth it for a few reasons. First, shareholder litigation takes place in a specialized court in Delaware. Whereas in-house counsel probably deals with hundreds of tort cases in FL courts every year for slip-and-falls and the like, they’d have to hire (expensive!) outside counsel to deal with a shareholder suit. After a cost-benefit analysis of potential litigation vs. drafting a proxy statement, the latter was presumably cheaper. Second, Disney would be facing sophisticated counsel. Disney has dealt with shareholder litigation that is well-financed by outside parties as recently as 2023. See Simeone v. The Walt Disney Company (Del. Ch. June 27, 2023) (finding that a shareholder’s books-and-records request was pretextual, as they had been solicited to make the request by the Thomas More Society, a “public interest law firm championing Life, Family, and Freedom.”). While Disney Legal isn’t afraid of some heads-up baseball, so to speak, the off-chance that a shareholder suit is successful could have significant implications for how domestic park operations are managed. Why take the risk? Finally, Disney has already faced enough bad PR in recent times with regard to public litigation. The 2024 public’s reaction to Disney’s attempt to use mandatory arbitration under a Disney+ T&C clause was less than favorable. I don’t think they’re eager to take a stand in a court of law that would put then put them back in the court of public opinion for supposedly discriminating against disabled folks. 2. The next question is what will actually be in the proxy statement and if it even matters. Like you’ve pointed out, the institutional giants are probably going to vote No against the proposal no matter what. Thus, Disney is incentivized to minimize their exposure to bad PR by drafting a concise proxy statement with something along the lines of “We have been working in park operations and line management for 50+ years, world-class industry experts, carefully tuned the DAS system to appropriately deter cheaters and maximize accessibility, etc.” If the media even picks it up (as you’ve pointed out, most just tune out during this portion of the earnings call…), it’ll be one bad news cycle. Then Disney won’t have to deal with a similar proposal for 3-4 years due to exclusion rules related to unsuccessful shareholder proposals. 3. Finally, there’s the question of where we go from here. I think that DAS Defenders rightly points out that the park experience is declining in quality due to, in part, monstrous wait times. This is essentially a supply-and-demand problem. There is not enough ride supply to meet current guest demand. There are only so many rides at each park. Moreover, given the price of entry, people want to experience everything! So much so that they’re willing to pay an additional premium (Lightning Lane) to raise their chances of doing so. Thus, Disney faces conflicting incentives to solving the wait time problem by either shifting ride demand to other forms of entertainment (shows, street performers, dining options, etc.) or by increasing the supply of rides. They want to improve the guest experience and encourage repeat visits, but boy…that Lightning Lane money sure does juice up quarterly earnings – especially around the holidays! Not to mention, having guests wait in line is free. Street performers and new rides cost money. I’m not sure that we’re at a breaking point since ticket prices go up every year and the parks, aside from the pandemic years, have only increased their attendance figures. But I do think that the company recognizes that they are rapidly drawing from a water table of goodwill that may not last for much longer absent any major changes: hence, the massive influx of investment into Villains Land, Monsters Inc., Tropical Americas. The only issue is that these additions have to meaningfully offset the additional demand that they induce. If these additions are like adding an additional lane of traffic to the Texas interstate (“Just one more lane will solve traffic, trust me bro.”), then the problem will only get worse. But if the company follows a dense, singles-and-doubles approach to supply of entertainment where cheaper rides have high capacity, the park experience will meaningfully improve. It’s difficult but doable for the company and guests to have the best of both worlds – higher attendance figures and shorter wait-times. I think this is going to be an uncomfortable, controversial topic for a long time to come. A Deloitte survey found that 53% of Gen Z identify as neurodivergent. Even if there’s some substantial sampling error there, and even if some of that neurodiversity involves things like dyslexia only (which doesn’t typically involve things like sensory issues, unless there’s a co-occurring condition) – that’s still a substantial portion of Gen Z. Even if not every person who identifies as ADHD or autistic feels they need accommodations, presumably a significant number do, as sensory issues, anxiety, and difficulty with self regulation are fairly core for a lot of people. Honestly I’m not sure what to make of those numbers. I know rates of autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities have been rising exponentially, but are we really at 53% for young people? I don’t know. That doesn’t even get into other conditions, such as physical disabilities, PTSD, seizures, etc. I think the idea of disability accommodations as we know them were created in a different era, and we’ll see a lot of changes over the next few decades. I wouldn’t rule out a situation where theme parks simply have to create an alternative to lines in general (not in the next few years, of course, but in 30 some years I could see it.) “I know rates of autism, ADHD, and learning disabilities have been rising exponentially, but are we really at 53% for young people?” I wonder how much of this is rates of those disabilities increasing, versus diagnoses increasing. I’m not saying it’s solely an either/or proposition, but it also wouldn’t surprise me if we’re getting better at identifying those conditions–or testing has become more sensitive to catch borderline cases. Either way, your point stands–just another layer to the discussion that will assuredly play out in the years to come, and not just with Disney. I think the reason it’s so polarising is because it is an unusual combination of both necessary and unfair. It’s necessary because nobody would argue that people with disabilities should be prevented from experiencing attractions. But if someone with DAS uses it to ride Guardians 5 times in a day, is that fair? If they would have spent 5×90 mins queueing for the ride had they been able to, then absolutely yes it is fair. But statistically, not many people would do that. What I would say (and I don’t think this is controversial) is that hardening the eligibility is the wrong approach. That is a recipe for heartbroken guests. Better to err on the side of inclusivity, as implied in this article – and if this volume causes operational issues (or – more cynically – revenue loss from LL), the corrective should come from moderating the extent of the accommodation. For example (just one idea), use metrics on how much time guests are prepared to queue (on average) per day, and DAS uses come out of that quota. Completely agree! Although with DAS, you still have to wait in a queue – it’s just virtual. So if the line is 90 minutes, you would still need to wait that amount of time which prevents people to ride things immediately or over and over. If you have das, you can only use it once for each attraction. The only way you could ride 5 times is once with das and 4 times waiting in the standard cue. That’s how it always worked for my son It’s interesting you mentioned above that Disney already offers a line skipping product. Why isn’t that an alternative to DAS for most? The accommodation could be that a person who needs DAS can buy it even when sold out. And for attractions where a LL is not offered, then use a return time. ADA is supposed to make things accessible to all equitably, DAS is not necessarily that. With DAS, the person is given a return time for the attraction, granted it is the same amount of time as the wait time, however, they can go and do other things such a shop or eat lunch or even experience another attraction, while someone without DAS has to stand and wait in line. That’s really not equitable. I’m not really sure what the solution is, I will vote for no review. There is an obvious solution to the “doing two things” problem you describe, namely a sensory waiting area. Eligible guests and their party could check in to the waiting area (designed as a comfortable inclusive space with seats, soft drinks etc), and time spent inside the waiting area counts toward DAS queue time that they can use for a future ride. This would cost Disney more as they would have to staff it (and lose some F&B sales), but firstly facilities like this would be good PR in the first place, and secondly it would arguably be more profitable in the long run. Full disclosure, I have a decent number of Disney shares (not even a rounding error to the DIS market cap, I assure you LOL) and when the proxy arrives I will vote no. Not because I know much about the DAS changes – I count myself fortunate in that regard – but because putting park operations changes (or even studies of them) “up to a vote” strikes me as a terrible precedent. I do hope, per Tom’s comments, that a satisfactory middle ground can be found! Appreciate this perspective, and agree with it. Unfortunately, the DAS discourse has become so polarized that I fear this type of nuance is being lost. It’s okay to acknowledge that a proposal like this is destined to fail (because it is), or shouldn’t even be up for vote in the first place (because of the precedent it sets) and also think that DAS has been mishandled and needs further fine-tuning. I wonder if it’s worth considering the strategy of the other side. In respect of which, I am wondering if those challenging the current policy actually quietly accept it and do not envision a reversal, and rather their true motivation is to prevent further limitations. In this regard, Disney will be forced to make statements as to why the current system is balanced, proportionate and sustainable. Once those statements are on record, those statements can be used to directly argue against further erosion. I’d be very surprised if it’s about the long game. I’d also be surprised if Disney has anything now that functions as precedent preventing future changes. Keep in mind that there’s already past litigation that went through a lot of discovery, and that didn’t stop Disney from making subsequent changes. Pretty easy to argue that circumstances have changed if further changes are deemed necessary down the road. I worry that people need to stop pushing or Disney will get rid of DAS entirely. The ADA requires things like ramps, bathrooms, parking spaces for Disabled, and communication (phone calls that help the deaf, etc…). Line skipping isn’t an ADA thing. When I was young, the DAS pass didn’t even exist. DAS seems to have become a headache, and they don’t legally need to provide it. There’s a bit more nuance to it than that, but you’re on the right track. Businesses must make “reasonable modifications” in their policies, practices, and procedures to accommodate a person with a disability. However, they do not need to modify a policy if it would “fundamentally alter” the nature of the business’s goods or services. There’s a lot more to it than that, but that’s the nutshell version. The question thus becomes whether the requested accommodations pass a reasonableness test, and also whether waiting in lines is fundamental to the theme park experience. Disney does offer a paid line-skipping product, so the answer to the second question might be no. But maybe not–it’s something that could end up eventually playing out in court. Interested to see what Jack says, but the SEC limited their no-action relief in November, right? So Disney either has to supplement to get a formal response or just exclude the proposal without SEC opinion. Maybe just letting the proposal take the L in ordinary course is SOP now if you can’t get the no-action from the SEC? Great call–that’s gotta be it. Totally missed that in the aftermath of the government shutdown. And the timing of Disney’s original letter would’ve been before the SEC made the announcement of that limitation. Assuming this is the explanation (and I can’t think of anything else even remotely plausible), it really just comes down to Disney not being able to take the uncertainty. Outcome will still be the same, of course, but wow, what a long road to get there. I’ll go back and update the commentary in a bit in light of this…have to move on to F&F coaster for now.

Title: Trump’s Fed chair decision could come next week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says

Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday lodged a pointed attack against Fed Chair Jerome Powell – accusing him of putting “his thumb on the scale” if he attends upcoming Supreme Court arguments over President Trump’s attempt to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Powell, who is named as a defendant in Cook’s case seeking to block Trump from ousting her over mortgage fraud allegations, is reportedly planning to attend Supreme Court arguments on Wednesday. “I actually think that’s a mistake,” Bessent told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” Tuesday during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “If you’re trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale, that’s a mistake.” Bessent himself sat in the front row of the gallery during Supreme Court arguments in November about Trump’s authority to impose sweeping tariffs, alongside Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and top trade negotiator Jamieson Greer. In a different line of attack on Tuesday, the treasury chief took aim at Powell for not meeting with federal prosecutors last month before they issued subpoenas related to the criminal probe of the Fed’s headquarters project. Bessent also blasted Powell for asset purchases made around the pandemic that resulted in huge losses and for the resignation of “four to six” senior Fed officials related to compliance issues. “If that happened at a Wall Street firm, the CEO would be out,” Bessent said. Trump has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell, bashing the chairman for not lowering interest rates fast enough – but Bessent has previously appeared to take a more neutral stance on Powell. During a November speech at a US-Saudi investment forum, Trump even insinuated that Bessent had talked him out of firing Powell and let him serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May. Trump’s decision on his choice for the next Federal Reserve chairman could come as soon as next week, Bessent said Tuesday. The president has narrowed the race down to four potential candidates, including Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock exec Rick Rieder. “We’ve had substantial conversations about this. We’ve run a process that started in September – 11 very strong candidates. We’re now down to four candidates. The president has personally met with all of them, and it’s going to be his decision,” Bessent said. Powell could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. Last week, Powell revealed that he’s under criminal investigation for allegedly lying during congressional testimony last summer over the Fed’s $2.5 billion headquarters renovation in DC. “The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,” Powell said in a stunning video statement. “This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions – or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.” Trump first nominated Powell to lead the Fed at the start of his first presidential term. Last week, Warsh surged ahead of Hassett on prediction markets betting on the next Fed chairman after Trump said he’d like to keep Hassett in his current role as an economic adviser. Trump also ruled out Bessent for the role “because he wants to stay where he is.” Markets had placed better odds on Hassett for weeks. While Trump said he’d like to keep Hassett in his current job, it’s not impossible for him to win the nomination. After Fed Governor Adriana Kugler unexpectedly resigned last summer, Trump tapped Stephen Miran, then a top White House economic adviser, to fill the role. Miran refused to fully resign from his White House job, instead taking an unpaid leave of absence. Advertisement

This includes launching of a Sector Rotation Fund, setting up its entity at Gift City, rollout of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and gearing up for a comprehensive ETF build-out. “Having crossed 10 lakh customers since our launch last year, we are looking to expand our suite of offerings with a key focus on diversification. We intend to offer differentiated exposures to our investors via SIFs, ETFs and Gift City,” Sid Swaminathan, MD and CEO, JioBlackRock AMC, said. Additionally, the AMC intends to launch a series of funds across debt, equity and hybrid. “We continue on our path of giving our investors a choice of products with focus on cost efficiency, accessibility and long-term value creation,” he said. He also added that out of 10 lakh investors, nearly 18 per cent are first-time mutual fund investors. The joint venture between Jio Financial Services and BlackRock has also seen strong participation from investors beyond major metros, with 40 per cent of its retail investors coming from B-30 cities, significantly higher than the industry average of 28 per cent. B-30 cities in India refer to cities beyond the top 30. Giving details of the new offerings, a statement by the AMC said active funds will be based on BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) platform – the same platform that powers its maiden Active Equity offering – the JioBlackRock Flexicap Fund. The first of these is the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund, the NFO of which will open on January 27 and continue till February 9. “With equity markets tending to move in cycles, which impact each sector in different ways, the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund is built to adapt to these shifts by dynamically rotating across sectors based on macro and market indicators, while also managing risk in response to evolving market dynamics and emerging opportunities,” the company said. Further, the AMC plans rolling out SIFs aimed at meeting sophisticated investment requirements, deepening engagement with investors through differentiated products and risk-managed outcomes. As part of its broader product expansion, it is also gearing up for a comprehensive ETF build-out, with a focus on evaluating building blocks that can enable deeper retail penetration, institutional participation while creating scalable and cost-effective solutions, the statement added. The AMC is also in the process of setting up its entity in Gift City and securing the required regulatory permissions that will allow the development of cross-border fund structures and a retail presence. This will enable Indian investors to responsibly access global allocation opportunities and international investors to obtain access to differentiated investment opportunities in India, the statement said.

Title: KeyCorp Q4 Earnings Call Highlights

KeyCorp NYSE: KEY executives highlighted improved profitability, strengthening credit trends, and an accelerated capital return plan during the company’s fourth-quarter 2025 earnings call on Jan. 20, 2026. Management also outlined 2026 financial guidance and discussed continued investments in hiring, technology, and artificial intelligence, alongside several board changes announced the same morning. Get KeyCorp alerts:Sign UpFourth-quarter results: revenue growth outpaced expenses Chairman and CEO Chris Gorman said fourth-quarter and full-year results reflected progress on KeyCorp’s “organic path to achieving consistently higher returns on capital.” The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $0.43 per share, while CFO Clark Khayat noted earnings were $0.41 per share on an adjusted basis. Revenue exceeded $2 billion, growing 12% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, while expenses grew 2%. Keysight Technologies' Surge: The Market Wakes Up to This AI PlayKhayat said tax-equivalent net interest income rose 15% year-over-year and net interest margin (NIM) ended the quarter at 2.82%, up 7 basis points sequentially and above the company’s previously indicated target range of 2.75% to 2.8%. He attributed sequential NII growth to commercial client deposit growth and balance sheet optimization, including running off lower-yielding consumer loans and allowing higher-cost brokered CDs and borrowings to roll off. Non-interest income increased 8% year-over-year on an adjusted basis, which management described as broad-based across priority fee businesses. Fourth-quarter investment banking and debt placement fees were $243 million, up 10% year-over-year, driven by debt capital markets and commercial mortgage debt placement. Trust and investment services income rose 10%, supported by record positive net flows and higher market values, while assets under management reached a record $70 billion. Big Buybacks: 3 Large Caps Exceed 5% Repurchase PowerKhayat said fourth-quarter non-interest expense totaled $1.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and 2% year-over-year, but included roughly $30 million of “unusually elevated expenses,” which he cautioned should not be treated as a run rate. Full-year 2025: record revenue and operating leverage Management said KeyCorp met or exceeded the financial targets it provided at the beginning of 2025. Gorman described 2025 as a “substantial year of progress,” including record full-year revenue that increased 16% from the prior year. Expenses rose 4.6%, which the company said translated into approximately 1,200 basis points of operating leverage and PP&R growth of about 44%. Khayat said net interest income increased 23%, outperforming the company’s original expectation for 20% growth, aided by stronger commercial loan growth and deposit performance. Fees grew 7.5% versus an original expectation of “5%-plus,” with investment banking fees up 13% despite muted middle-market M&A activity for much of the year. Gorman said the company added nearly 10% to frontline banker staff across wealth management, commercial payments, middle market, and investment banking, and invested an additional $100 million in technology focused on customer-facing capabilities. Credit and balance sheet: improving trends and continued remix Both Gorman and Khayat emphasized improving asset quality metrics. The fourth-quarter provision for credit losses was $108 million, including $104 million of net charge-offs and a $4 million reserve build. The net charge-off ratio was 39 basis points in the quarter, and full-year net charge-offs were 41 basis points, which Khayat said was toward the better end of the company’s 40 to 45 basis point target range. Non-performing assets declined 6% sequentially, criticized loans fell by $500 million (down 8% sequentially), and delinquencies also improved, according to management. On the balance sheet, KeyCorp said average loans were relatively flat sequentially. Khayat pointed to a $1 billion increase in C&I loans, offset by the intentional runoff of $550 million of lower-yielding consumer loans and some paydowns in commercial real estate. Spot commercial loan growth was about $1.2 billion, with growth in both C&I and CRE, which Khayat said was driven primarily by the power and utility sector and broad-based middle-market growth across regions. Deposit trends were described as favorable. Average deposits increased by about $300 million sequentially, with $2 billion of commercial client deposit growth offset by a decline of $1.3 billion in higher-cost brokered CDs. Total deposit costs declined 16 basis points to 1.81%, and the cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta declined modestly to 51% through the fourth quarter. In Q&A, Khayat said the company expects a “low-to-mid 50s” beta in 2026 on a relatively stable deposit base. Management also discussed the continued runoff of the consumer loan portfolio, which Gorman described as largely super-prime mortgages to doctors and dentists yielding about 3.3%. He said KeyCorp expects roughly $600 million per quarter of runoff and that it could bottom out “in the next couple of years,” while the bank builds home equity capabilities and maintains its student loan refinancing platform for when vintages and rates align. Capital return ramps up; guidance and strategic priorities for 2026 Gorman said KeyCorp began a “more meaningful return of capital” in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of common stock—double the original commitment announced in October—at an average price of $18 per share. The company ended the quarter with a 10.3% marked CET1 ratio, which management described as peer-leading, and said it intends to manage the ratio down toward the higher end of its 9.5% to 10% targeted range by the end of 2026. Khayat said CET1 was 11.7% on a reported basis and reiterated plans to repurchase at least $300 million of shares in the first quarter and at least $1.2 billion for the full year 2026. Gorman added the company anticipates similar quarterly repurchase levels through 2026, supported by ongoing capital generation. For 2026, KeyCorp’s guidance included: Revenue up about 7%, driven by NII growth of 8% to 10% and non-interest income growth of 3% to 4%. Adjusting for business decisions described as net neutral to earnings, non-interest income is expected to grow 5% to 6%. Expenses up 3% to 4%, implying positive operating leverage of roughly 300 to 400 basis points. Average loans up 1% to 2%, with commercial loans up about 5% as consumer runoff continues and the bank remixes into higher-yielding relationship-based commercial loans. Net charge-off ratio stable at 40 to 45 basis points. Tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. In Q&A, Gorman said the company’s organic focus remains on three areas: middle market and payments, investment banking, and wealth—particularly mass affluent. He also emphasized ongoing investments in AI and technology, noting tech and ops investments increased from $800 million to $900 million last year and to $1 billion this year, with a goal of improving processes such as loan underwriting and processing. On M&A, Gorman said the company is “not focused on” bank acquisitions, reiterating that position when asked directly. However, he said KeyCorp is interested in “complementary fee-based and capability-enhancing acquisitions,” including group hires or boutiques, particularly in knowledge-worker-heavy businesses. Separately, management detailed board changes, including planned nominations of Tony DeSpirito (most recently Global CIO for Fundamental Equities at BlackRock) and Chris Henson (former head of banking and insurance at Truist and former president/COO/CFO at BB&T). The lead independent director role transitioned from Sandy Cutler to Todd Vassos, CEO of Dollar General. The company also said Carlton Highsmith and Ruth Ann Gillis plan to retire from the board at the annual meeting, and David Wilson retired immediately due to health considerations.About KeyCorp NYSE: KEYKeyCorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that operates through its primary banking subsidiary, KeyBank.

Khayat said net interest income increased 23%, outperforming the company’s original expectation for 20% growth, aided by stronger commercial loan growth and deposit performance. Fees grew 7.5% versus an original expectation of “5%-plus,” with investment banking fees up 13% despite muted middle-market M&A activity for much of the year. Gorman said the company added nearly 10% to frontline banker staff across wealth management, commercial payments, middle market, and investment banking, and invested an additional $100 million in technology focused on customer-facing capabilities. Credit and balance sheet: improving trends and continued remix Both Gorman and Khayat emphasized improving asset quality metrics. The fourth-quarter provision for credit losses was $108 million, including $104 million of net charge-offs and a $4 million reserve build. The net charge-off ratio was 39 basis points in the quarter, and full-year net charge-offs were 41 basis points, which Khayat said was toward the better end of the company’s 40 to 45 basis point target range. Non-performing assets declined 6% sequentially, criticized loans fell by $500 million (down 8% sequentially), and delinquencies also improved, according to management. On the balance sheet, KeyCorp said average loans were relatively flat sequentially. Khayat pointed to a $1 billion increase in C&I loans, offset by the intentional runoff of $550 million of lower-yielding consumer loans and some paydowns in commercial real estate. Spot commercial loan growth was about $1.2 billion, with growth in both C&I and CRE, which Khayat said was driven primarily by the power and utility sector and broad-based middle-market growth across regions. Deposit trends were described as favorable. Average deposits increased by about $300 million sequentially, with $2 billion of commercial client deposit growth offset by a decline of $1.3 billion in higher-cost brokered CDs. Total deposit costs declined 16 basis points to 1.81%, and the cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta declined modestly to 51% through the fourth quarter. In Q&A, Khayat said the company expects a “low-to-mid 50s” beta in 2026 on a relatively stable deposit base. Management also discussed the continued runoff of the consumer loan portfolio, which Gorman described as largely super-prime mortgages to doctors and dentists yielding about 3.3%. He said KeyCorp expects roughly $600 million per quarter of runoff and that it could bottom out “in the next couple of years,” while the bank builds home equity capabilities and maintains its student loan refinancing platform for when vintages and rates align. Capital return ramps up; guidance and strategic priorities for 2026 Gorman said KeyCorp began a “more meaningful return of capital” in the fourth quarter, repurchasing $200 million of common stock—double the original commitment announced in October—at an average price of $18 per share. The company ended the quarter with a 10.3% marked CET1 ratio, which management described as peer-leading, and said it intends to manage the ratio down toward the higher end of its 9.5% to 10% targeted range by the end of 2026. Khayat said CET1 was 11.7% on a reported basis and reiterated plans to repurchase at least $300 million of shares in the first quarter and at least $1.2 billion for the full year 2026. Gorman added the company anticipates similar quarterly repurchase levels through 2026, supported by ongoing capital generation. For 2026, KeyCorp’s guidance included: Revenue up about 7%, driven by NII growth of 8% to 10% and non-interest income growth of 3% to 4%. Adjusting for business decisions described as net neutral to earnings, non-interest income is expected to grow 5% to 6%. Expenses up 3% to 4%, implying positive operating leverage of roughly 300 to 400 basis points. Average loans up 1% to 2%, with commercial loans up about 5% as consumer runoff continues and the bank remixes into higher-yielding relationship-based commercial loans. Net charge-off ratio stable at 40 to 45 basis points. Tax rate of approximately 22% to 23% on a taxable equivalent basis. In Q&A, Gorman said the company’s organic focus remains on three areas: middle market and payments, investment banking, and wealth—particularly mass affluent. He also emphasized ongoing investments in AI and technology, noting tech and ops investments increased from $800 million to $900 million last year and to $1 billion this year, with a goal of improving processes such as loan underwriting and processing. On M&A, Gorman said the company is “not focused on” bank acquisitions, reiterating that position when asked directly. However, he said KeyCorp is interested in “complementary fee-based and capability-enhancing acquisitions,” including group hires or boutiques, particularly in knowledge-worker-heavy businesses. Separately, management detailed board changes, including planned nominations of Tony DeSpirito (most recently Global CIO for Fundamental Equities at BlackRock) and Chris Henson (former head of banking and insurance at Truist and former president/COO/CFO at BB&T). The lead independent director role transitioned from Sandy Cutler to Todd Vassos, CEO of Dollar General. The company also said Carlton Highsmith and Ruth Ann Gillis plan to retire from the board at the annual meeting, and David Wilson retired immediately due to health considerations.About KeyCorp NYSE: KEYKeyCorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, that operates through its primary banking subsidiary, KeyBank.

As part of Scottish Cities Week 2026, Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill launched the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme at an event bringing together Scottish city leaders, investors, finance sector stakeholders, and officials from the Scotland Office, Department for Business and Trade and the Office for Investment. A collaborative initiative between the UK Government, TheCityUK and the Scottish Cities Alliance (SCA), the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme will provide structured support, technical guidance and market intelligence to enable local authorities and cities attract inward investment from around the globe. Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill said: Scotland’s cities and regions hold immense potential for inward investment: We have the talent, the ingenuity, and the resources. This is about building a competitive advantage for Scotland, ensuring our regions and communities are ready to secure the vital capital that drives growth and creates jobs. Together, we will enhance capability, attract investment, and accelerate growth for the benefit of all of Scotland. Cllr Raymond Bremner, Chair, Scottish Cities Alliance and Leader, Highland Council said: Scottish Cities Alliance is proud to support the Scotland Investment Acceleration Programme. Building capability and fostering collaboration between governments, investors, and our Scottish city partners is essential to unlocking transformative investment. Through initiatives like Scottish Cities Week London, we champion inclusive, sustainable growth and showcase Scotland’s strengths to ensure our cities thrive in a competitive global economy. Miles Celic OBE, Chief Executive Officer, TheCityUK, said: Scotland’s world-class financial and professional services are key drivers of growth and innovation [and a core element of the wider British industry]. We are excited to team up with our public sector partners to boost investment and enhance collaboration between industry and government. This partnership will unlock new opportunities, create high-value jobs, and ensure Scotland remains at the forefront of the UK’s international competitiveness. The Programme will run throughout 2026, starting with the inaugural Scottish Cities Week Round Table in London, and continuing through events in Scotland. It will include teach-ins, workshops and webinars to build local authority leaders’ knowledge and capacity, technical sessions on investor expectations and project assessment criteria, guidance to help strengthen investment propositions, networking and peer learning forums to foster collaboration and share best practices, and support for showcasing opportunities and major investment events. At the Whitehall launch event today, Minister McNeill highlighted The UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy – a 10-year plan geared towards making it quicker and easier for businesses to invest in growth-driving sectors. Recent UK Government initiatives and funding streams that benefit Scotland were also highlighted to attendees, such as the £140 million Local Growth Fund and £280 million Pride in Place Programme to support improvements in Scotland’s most deprived areas. Participants heard expert insights on Scotland’s appeal to institutional capital, explored innovative financing approaches for local development, and engaged in open discussions to address current challenges and share practical experiences. Scottish Cities Week is the Scottish Cities Alliance’s annual flagship event targeting London-based investors, developers, and partners to showcase growth opportunities in Scotland’s cities. Events lay the foundation for collaboration between Scottish cities and the UK and Scottish governments to boost investor confidence. The roundtable was attended by stakeholders from Barclays, The CityUK, Scottish Cities Alliance, City of London Corporation, Phoenix Group, Scottish Cities Alliance, Aviva, Blackrock.

Title: Bridge Loan Platform Atlas Invest Raises $25M
URL: http://commercialobserver.com/2026/01/bridge-loan-atlas-invest-blackrock/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T15:00:59Z
Full Content:
© 2026 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Atlas Invest, an artificial intelligence-powered commercial real estate lending platform, announced Tuesday that it has raised $25 million in funding to expand access for institutional-quality debt investments. BlackRock led the mixed debt and equity partnership with Manhattan-based Atlas Invest. Along with $13 million previously raised, the new infusion increased the startup’s overall funding to $38 million, said Tal Shahar, co-founder and CEO at Atlas Invest. “We started the company a bit more than three years ago,” Shahar said. “Atlas is an AI operating system, and that means we see customers who are borrowers looking for financing. They reach out to Atlas and get quick and simple financing with certainty. On the other side, we enable institutional investors to invest in this space of real estate financing, real estate debt, through customized managed accounts.” Reflecting the growing institutional adoption of AI-driven bridge lending, Atlas Invest uses its proprietary technology for data-driven processes across sourcing, underwriting and servicing with risk-adjusted practices to redefine how private investors access, engage with and scale real estate debt investments nationwide. The company aims to scale significantly with the new funding, targeting a greater than 10-fold increase in transactions in 2026 over 2025, said Shahar. “The market is shifting, investors are demanding income strategies that combine security, predictable returns and professional oversight,” Nir Peled, Atlas Invest’s chief revenue officer and co-founder, said in a statement. “We built Atlas to deliver institutional-grade underwriting and monitoring at software speed, combining a deep operating platform with a disciplined credit approach. This scale and consistency allow us to raise the bar for transparency and reliability in real estate debt.” Atlas Invest speeds the entire lending process for borrowers, said Shahar. “A borrower can send an email and say, ‘Hey, my name is John. I want a loan for this property,’ and on the same day they’re going to get a term sheet, and in a couple of days they can get the financing,” Shahar explained. “Our system does the full analysis super quick, because it uses AI technology. In a few days we will give you the capital itself. So it’s very fast, with certainty, and a simple process.” Currently, due diligence to assess risk on deals is a lengthy, costly and limited process in terms of the visibility and value it provides. Atlas Invest claims to offer institutional-grade due diligence at regular intervals, tapping into a broader pool of information spanning facets of the developer and the asset, and continuously monitoring to mitigate risk. Atlas Invest’s key distinction is that its AI does not replace credit judgment, but compresses time, expands depth, and enforces consistency, allowing its team to make higher-quality decisions at scale with full auditability and human oversight, according to the company. The company works with hundreds of brokers and the borrowers behind them, as well as institutional investors from multiple continents, said Shahar. “We have insurance companies, banks and family offices,” he said. “And they’re coming to the platform because they want to invest their money in real estate debt. So they open their account, and the platform is doing everything for them, from sourcing opportunities, doing a very deep analysis, and then building their portfolio of investments and monitoring that for them.” Philip Russo can be reached at prusso@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Bishti named captain as Ireland U20 squad confirmed
URL: https://www.rte.ie/sport/rugby/2026/0120/1554110-bishti-named-captain-as-ireland-u20-squad-confirmed/
Time Published: 2026-01-20T13:53:29Z
Full Content:
Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Leinster's academy prop Sam Bishti has been confirmed as captain for Ireland Under-20s in the 2026 Six Nations Championship, after head coach Andrew Browne named a 29-player squad for the early rounds of the tournament. Bishti, who has been playing for UCD in the Energia All-Ireland League this season, skippered Blackrock College to Leinster Schools Senior Cup success last year, and will lead the Ireland U20s as they bid to recover from last year’s calamitous championship, where they finished bottom of the table with just one win. Just four of that 2025 squad remain in place this year, with Leinster trio Donnacha McGuire, Charlie Molony and Derry Moloney, as well as Munster’s Tom Wood – son of former Ireland captain Keith - playing a second year of U20s. Browne has also included recent Leinster academy back row Josh Neill in his squad. The highly-rated teenager (below, right) only linked up with the province’s academy this month following his arrival from his native South Africa, and the Irish-qualified flanker scored two tries in Saturday’s 29-10 warm-up win against Italy in Dublin. Ireland get their Championship campaign under way in France before returning home to Virgin Media Park in Cork to face Italy on Friday, 13 February. Browne’s side then travel to Bath to face England on Friday, 20 February, before welcoming Wales and Scotland to Cork for back-to-back home fixtures to finish the campaign on Saturday, 7 March and Sunday, 15 March respectively. "We have been working hard together as an extended squad for a number of months and it’s an exciting time for these young players, who have the honour of representing the wider group in the Six Nations," head coach Browne said. "We, as coaches, have pushed the players over the last number of months and I have been impressed by their work-rate, commitment, and application.

Today’s top news: Wall Street is finally capitulating into blockchain and around-the-clock trading. 📌 What Happened The New York Stock Exchange is preparing infrastructure to support 24/7 trading of tokenized stocks and ETFs. The effort is being developed under NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange, and would allow traditional securities to trade continuously using blockchain-based rails, rather than the fixed market hours and delayed settlement that define today’s equity markets. Key elements under consideration include: The platform would still require regulatory approval and isn’t live yet, but moving in the right direction for the crypto natives who have been calling for this eventuality for years. 🗣️ What They’re Saying “For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate. We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions, grounded in the unmatched protections and high regulatory standards that position us to marry trust with state-of-the-art technology.” - Lynn Martin, President of NYSE Group Back in December, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein said that finance is “entering the next major evolution in market infrastructure,” one that could move assets “faster and more securely than systems that have served investors for decades.” 🧠 Why It Matters The world’s most important stock exchange is building for a crypto-native market structure. This is a big deal for a few reasons: Now what does it mean for prices? Again, it will be slow moving. But the blockchains that become the home of the majority of tokenization (potentially Ethereum and Solana) are set up to be winners. And as the overall pie grows and crypto is taken more seriously, the bull case for crypto majors becomes easier to digest. This won’t happen overnight. But once the world’s most important exchange goes tokenized, there’s no looking back.

Title: Map shows how the rich and powerful are descending on Davos by private jet

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Scores of private jets landed near Davos on Monday as the rich and powerful descended on the Alpine town for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Business Insider tracked at least 157 private jets that arrived near the Alpine town, using data from ADS-B Exchange and JetSpy. These flight-tracking tools don't participate in privacy systems that many business-jet owners have signed up for to hide their movements from most similar tools. More than half of the flights tracked landed at Zurich International Airport. Another 45 came into Friedrichshafen, a German city on the shore of Lake Constance, just over the Swiss border. The rest were spread across other smaller airports in Switzerland. They included airplanes belonging to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, according to data from JetSpy. JetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Blackstone, Citigroup, Google, HP, JPMorgan Chase, Lockheed Martin, and the quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma. The most popular private jet was the Gulfstream G650, representing 31 of the flights tracked by Business Insider. Buying one typically costs over $65 million. It can accommodate up to 19 people or be configured with a double bed and a shower. The world's newest private jet, the G800, also appeared three times on Monday. Gulfstream only delivered the first one in August. At 7,600 miles, the longest trip was made by the Gulfstream G700 that JetSpy says belongs to Benioff. It flew for 14½ hours from Hawaii. Meanwhile, a commercial flight would have taken two stops and over 24 hours. Other major journeys included airplanes arriving from Kuala Lumpur, Mumbai, and Uruguay. Private jets flew in from dozens of different countries, including Sierra Leone and Montenegro. London was the most popular departure point, with 19 flights coming from four airports in and around the British capital. However, many of these planes appear to have stopped only briefly on the way toward Davos. For example, a Google private jet spent 13 hours on the ground near London after arriving from San Jose. 10 private jets departed from around New York, seven from the Bay Area metropolitan regions, and six from Dubai. Dozens more are expected to arrive throughout the week. Tuesday also saw the arrival of jets belonging to Bill Gates, Michael Dell, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to data from JetSpy. Jump to

Connacht centre Seán Walsh, a try scorer and impressive performer against South Africa, picked up an injury in a Challenge Cup match against Montauban and was ruled out. Josh Neill, the South African-born, Irish-qualified flanker, who has linked up with the Leinster academy, scored two tries in the victory over England. His brother Jordan has played ODI cricket for Ireland. The boys qualify through Irish grandparents. Ireland will play their three home games, against Italy, Wales and Scotland in Cork, will face France in Perpignan and England at The Rec in Bath. Tickets for the home games are available to purchase through Ticketmaster.ie. Browne said: “We have been working hard together as an extended squad for a number of months and it’s an exciting time for these young players, who have the honour of representing the wider group in the Six Nations. “We, as coaches, have pushed the players over the last number of months and I have been impressed by their work-rate, commitment, and application. Now our focus turns to performance and the opening game against France, which we know will be a big challenge first up. “We are looking forward to the opportunities over the coming weeks and are excited by the prospect of an Ireland Under-20s team returning to Six Nations action at Virgin Media Park in Cork, where we always have huge support.” Forwards (17): Tyrese Abolarin (QUB/Ulster), Sami Bishti (UCD/Leinster, capt), Ben Blaney (Terenure/Leinster), Jonathan Byrne (Garryowen/Munster), Max Doyle (UCD/Leinster), Joe Finn (Garryowen/Munster), Christian Foley (Young Munster/Munster), Rian Handley (Old Wesley/Leinster), Bill Hayes (Garryowen/Munster), Alex Lautsou (Shannon/Munster), Duinn Maguire (UCD/Leinster), Blake McClean (Instonians/Ulster), Donnacha McGuire (UCD/Leinster), Dylan McNeice (UCD/Leinster), Josh Neill (Old Wesley/Leinster), Diarmaid O’Connell (Corinthians/Connacht), Seán Walsh (MU Barnhall/Leinster).

Title: AI boom could falter without wider adoption, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella warns
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2026/01/20/ai-boom-could-falter-without-wider-adoption-microsoft-chief-satya-nadella-warns/

Full Content:
Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella has warned that artificial intelligence (AI) risks becoming a speculative bubble unless its use spreads beyond big tech companies and wealthy economies. Mr Nadella on Tuesday said that the long-term success of the fast-developing technology would depend on it being used by a broad range of industries as well as on uptake outside of the developed world. “For this not to be a bubble by definition, it requires that the benefits of this are much more evenly spread,” said Mr Nadella. He noted that a “telltale sign of if it’s a bubble” would be if only tech groups were benefiting from the rise of AI, rather than companies in other sectors. However, Mr Nadella said he was confident that AI would prove to be transformative across industries, such as helping to develop new drugs. “I’m much more confident that this is a technology that will, in fact, build on the rails of cloud and mobile, diffuse faster, bend the productivity curve and bring local surplus and economic growth all around the world,” he said. The Microsoft chief’s comments came as part of a talk with BlackRock chief Larry Fink on the first day of the World Economic Forum annual meeting at Davos, kicking off the first of several speeches by tech executives, including Google DeepMind chief, Sir Demis Hassabis and Anthropic’s Dario Amodei. A growing body of data from tech companies, including Microsoft, has shown a global divide in AI adoption rates, pointing to productivity benefits and work applications being concentrated in richer developed countries. Mr Nadella also reiterated his view that the future of AI adoption would not rely on one dominant model provider, which has driven the tech giant’s decision to work with several AI groups, such as Anthropic and xAI, as well as OpenAI. Microsoft gained an early advantage in AI through its $14 billion (€11.9 billion) bet on OpenAI, which gave the software group unique access to the ChatGPT maker’s technology and first claim on its data centre contracts. But after restructuring its partnership with Sam Altman’s start-up in October, Microsoft has dropped exclusivity over its data centre needs and will lose exclusive access to its research and models in the early 2030s. Mr Nadella said companies would be able to take advantage of multiple models, including open-source ones, or even building their own models using a technique called “distillation” to produce smaller, cheaper versions of powerful models. “So the [intellectual property] of any application or any firm is, how do you use all these models with context engineering or your data?” Mr Nadella said. “As long as firms can answer that question, they’re gonna be getting ahead.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2026 From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Capitalism has failed to spread wealth and prosperity — and AI could do the same, says BlackRock CEO

Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism. More wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim co-chair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab. "In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain," he said. Fink warned that the pattern of unequal wealth distribution could repeat in the era of AI. "Early gains are flowing to the owners of models, owners of data, and owners of infrastructure," said Fink.

If AI does to white collar workers what globalisation did to blue collar workers, we need to confront that today, directly." He urged those gathered at the annual meeting in Davos to rethink how prosperity is defined and to create a "credible plan" for broad participation in the gains AI can deliver. "This is going to be the test. Capitalism can evolve to turn more people into owners of growth instead of spectators watching it happen," said Fink. The world's wealthiest 10% own roughly 75% of global wealth, while the poorest half hold only about 2%, according to the World Inequality Report 2026, released in December 2025 and based on data compiled by 200 researchers. Fink acknowledged in his speech that the World Economic Forum has lost trust and "feels out of step with the moment." "Davos is an elite gathering trying to shape a world that belongs to everyone," Fink said, adding that the forum should be more transparent and precise about what economic success means, especially with those who don't feel represented at gatherings like Davos. "Prosperity just isn't the growth in the aggregate. It's not just GDP. It can't be measured by GDP or the market caps of companies. It has to be judged by many people who see it, who can touch it, can feel it, and can build their own future on it," said Fink. Fink has previously spoken about how the pandemic fueled a rethink of the US economy. In his 2022 annual letter to shareholders, Fink said the growth of stakeholder capitalism — the idea that companies should prioritize interests beyond shareholders — was a natural evolution of how capitalism can best work to build a strong economy. "It is through effective stakeholder capitalism that capital is efficiently allocated, companies achieve durable profitability, and value is created and sustained over the long-term," he said. BlackRock, which manages some $14 trillion in assets, has been one of the loudest voices in support of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) investing, with Fink often highlighting climate change and sustainability in his annual letters.

Jio BlackRock Asset Management, which launched its services in May, has built an investor base of 10 lakh, with nearly 18 per cent comprising first-time mutual fund investors, its MD and CEO Sid Swaminathan said on Tuesday. The joint venture between Jio Financial Services and BlackRock has also seen strong participation from investors beyond major metros, with 40 per cent of its retail investors coming from B-30 cities, significantly higher than the industry average of 28 per cent. B-30 cities in India refer to cities beyond the top 30. Speaking to reporters here, Swaminathan attributed this deeper market penetration to its technology-led approach and sustained focus on investor education. Jio BlackRock AMC manages assets worth over ₹13,700 crore, with equities accounting for around 30 per cent of the total assets under management, while the remaining 70 per cent is invested in fixed income and cash. Looking ahead, the company plans to focus on key strategic initiatives, including the launch of Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and on offering international investment exposure through GIFT City. "We have recently received a no-objection certificate from Sebi to launch Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), and we are very excited about this opportunity," he said. The initiative will enable Indian investors to access global allocation opportunities in a responsible manner, while also allowing international investors to tap into differentiated investment opportunities in India. Alongside this, the company is exploring the launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to ensure investors have access to a comprehensive set of core investment building blocks. The year could also see the rollout of a series of mutual fund offerings. The active funds will be powered by BlackRock’s Systematic Active Equity (SAE) platform, the same platform underpinning its maiden active equity offering, the JioBlackRock Flexicap Fund. The first of these new launches will be the JioBlackRock Sector Rotation Fund, with its new fund offer (NFO) opening on January 27 and closing on February 9. As equity markets tend to move in cycles, impacting sectors differently, the fund is designed to dynamically rotate across sectors based on macroeconomic and market indicators, while actively managing risk amid evolving market conditions and emerging opportunities.

Title: Natural gas surged 17% yesterday and it’s triggering a macro trap that could suddenly tank Bitcoin prices

If the spike sticks, inflation expectations can reprice, real yields can jump, and Bitcoin’s liquidity tailwind can flip fast. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Natural gas prices surged 17.76% on Jan. 19, driven by cold forecasts across Northeast Asia and Europe, tightening liquidity in global LNG markets, and short-covering in European storage inventories sitting 15% points below the five-year average. For most crypto traders, a weather-driven commodity spike registers as irrelevant noise. Something for energy desks to manage, not Bitcoin portfolios. However, the transmission mechanism from energy shocks to Bitcoin runs through real interest rates and dollar liquidity conditions. When those channels activate, the impact can materialize faster than the market price. The question isn't whether a single-day natural gas move dictates Bitcoin's trajectory. It's whether the energy shock reprices inflation expectations, drags real yields higher, and tightens the dollar-denominated liquidity conditions that Bitcoin increasingly tracks as it integrates deeper into macro markets. The evidence suggests the infrastructure for that transmission exists, even if the magnitude and duration of today's move remain uncertain. Bitcoin’s 2026 price may turn on macro liquidity, SEC market access, ETF flows, stablecoin supply, and exchange rules. Track the chokepoint bosses, not influencers. Real yields, which are nominal Treasury yields minus inflation expectations, have emerged as one of the clearest macro drivers of Bitcoin performance. NYDIG research frames Bitcoin as a liquidity barometer with a strengthening inverse relationship to real interest rates. BlackRock has similarly highlighted real yields as a driver of crypto volatility, noting that higher real rates tend to create headwinds for digital assets by making yield-bearing alternatives more attractive and signaling tighter financial conditions. The mechanism linking natural gas to real yields runs through breakeven inflation rates, which the Federal Reserve defines as the difference between nominal 10-year Treasury yields and 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yields. When energy prices spike persistently, they can push market-based inflation expectations higher, lifting breakevens. If breakevens rise faster than nominal yields, real yields fall, a configuration that tends to support Bitcoin. If nominal yields rise faster, or if the Federal Reserve reprices its policy path amid inflation fears, real yields climb, working as a headwind for risk assets. IMF research documents that commodity price shocks, particularly oil, can move longer-term inflation breakevens. European research ties natural gas price shocks specifically to inflation and inflation expectations, given gas's systemic role in power generation and heating across the continent. The current move differs from typical US-only weather squeezes because it's globally coupled: Asian spot LNG prices hit six-week highs on colder forecasts, while European gas inventories are roughly 52% of capacity, versus a five-year average of 67%. That tightness creates the conditions for a sustained premium rather than a transient weather-driven blip. Bitcoin stability is under threat as a diverging "protein stress ratio" reveals hidden economic risks most experts are missing. Not every energy spike reprices macro. For the natural gas move to translate into real-yield pressure and dollar liquidity shifts, three gates need to open. First, the move must persist beyond the day, changing forward curves and expectations rather than reverting as weather models adjust. The Energy Information Administration expects Henry Hub prices to ease slightly in 2026 but rise sharply in 2027 as LNG export demand growth outpaces domestic supply growth. If the market begins pricing that structural dynamic now, the spike becomes more than positioning noise. Second, inflation expectations must move meaningfully. If 5-year and 10-year breakeven rates drift higher in response to sustained energy pressure, the Fed's policy calculus shifts. Rate cuts get priced out, front-end rates reprice, and real yields climb. This is a configuration Bitcoin tends to struggle against. Third, the dollar must strengthen. Energy-driven inflation scares often support the US dollar as markets anticipate tighter monetary policy or as global risk appetite fades. A stronger dollar typically correlates with tighter financial conditions, reducing the marginal flow of deployable capital into crypto markets. Stablecoin circulation, now exceeding $310 billion, functions as a practical proxy for crypto-native liquidity. Reuters reports USDT circulation at $187 billion, reflecting institutional adoption and scale. When macro conditions tighten, consisting of real yields rising and the dollar strengthening, stablecoin supply growth tends to slow or risk appetite fades, reducing the dry powder available for Bitcoin purchases. The linkage isn't mechanical, but it's observable: Bitcoin performance correlates with periods of stablecoin expansion and loosening dollar liquidity, and underperforms when those conditions reverse. The "rates up, Bitcoin down" era is over. Here is the exact dashboard you need to trade the fallout. The clearest path to Bitcoin resilience is for the weather squeeze to fade quickly. If cold forecasts moderate, LNG demand normalizes, and the natural gas spike retraces, breakevens and real yields remain stable. In that scenario, the macro bite never happens, as this was positioning and weather, not a structural energy premium. Bitcoin's narrative remains insulated from the energy shock, and the move becomes irrelevant beyond a brief correlation blip. The more complex scenario involves the energy premium sticking. Europe and Asia remain cold, low storage keeps LNG bids elevated, and US exports remain high to meet global demand. Breakevens drift upward in response, but the critical variable becomes whether breakevens rise faster than nominal yields or whether the Fed reprices its path more aggressively. If breakevens outpace nominals, real yields fall, a configuration that can support Bitcoin by signaling looser real financial conditions. If the Fed path tightens and nominal yields rise faster, real yields climb, creating a headwind. The worst-case scenario for Bitcoin involves a broader inflation scare. Breakevens jump sharply, front-end rates reprice hawkish as markets price out cuts or price in hikes, the dollar strengthens, and risk assets wobble. That configuration matches the “Bitcoin as liquidity barometer” framing precisely: Bitcoin tends to struggle when real rates rise, and dollar liquidity tightens, as those conditions reduce speculative capital flows and increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. Bitcoin's sensitivity to real yields and dollar liquidity has intensified as institutional participation has grown and as crypto markets have become more tightly integrated with traditional macro flows. The stablecoin infrastructure that now channels hundreds of billions of dollars into crypto markets operates within dollar-denominated liquidity conditions, making crypto markets more reactive to Fed policy, real rates, and currency strength than during earlier cycles, when retail speculation dominated flows. Natural gas spiking 19% in a day doesn't guarantee Bitcoin will sell off, but it activates transmission channels that can reprice real yields and tighten liquidity. Whether those channels stay open depends on how long the energy premium persists, whether inflation expectations adjust, and how the Fed responds. For Bitcoin traders, the relevant question isn't whether natural gas matters in isolation, but whether the energy shock triggers the macro repricing that increasingly governs risk asset performance. The infrastructure for that transmission exists. The next few weeks will clarify whether it activates.

Title: Wall Street's latest gold rush has found its new target: your retirement

What do an employee at a dental imaging company, an English Premier League soccer player, and a saver with an account at BlackRock all have in common? They're all quietly connected to Wall Street's hottest investment class: private credit. The debt that most Americans have dealt with — from credit cards to mortgages — has been upfront: there are bills to pay, balances that are visible, and credit ratings that assess a borrower's creditworthiness. Private credit, or loans made to companies by private investor money gathered into a fund, is much less regulated and much more opaque. The exact terms of the loans, their price, and their ratings can be kept in the shadows and out of regulators' sight. Once a relative backwater in finance, private credit has grown into a $3 trillion industry that is increasingly intertwined with the economy. Small and midsize businesses are utilizing these loans to scale up, from manufacturing plants seeking to purchase new equipment to dental practices looking to expand. Meanwhile, private credit has become the hottest business for some of the finance industry's premier names, including Blackstone and Apollo. To proponents, like Apollo CEO Marc Rowan and Blue Owl co-CEO Mark Lipschultz, access to funding with less onerous requirements is helping American businesses thrive. To naysayers, including UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher and IMF Head Kristalina Georgieva, this explosion of less-transparent debt is unsustainable, and the dubious terms of many of these loans could lead to economic trouble. This fight has now reached a fever pitch as private credit prepares for a retail investor gold rush. There's already $80 billion in retail investor cash in private credit, but Deloitte projects that number will rise to $2.4 trillion by the start of the next decade, thanks to changing rules that will allow more everyday Americans to buy the assets. Depending on who you ask, putting private credit into regular Americans' retirement savings is the key to helping people achieve financial freedom or a recipe for disaster for the entire economy. At its most basic, private credit involves pooling money from investors to then lend to businesses. To facilitate this transaction, an investment firm launches a fund and goes around to people or groups with money — pension funds, ultrawealthy individuals, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and endowments — and gives them a sense of what sort of loans they want to make. Once enough investors agree to pony up, the fund then goes out and finds businesses that need a loan. It could be for hiring employees, building a new factory, or acquiring a competitor. In an ideal world, the loan enables the company to expand operations and revenue and repay the loan plus interest, which ultimately benefits the private credit fund and its own investors as a profit. Companies like these loans because they can be more flexible than bank loans, come together much more quickly, and can be more personalized. Private credit firms and the investors in their funds prefer these loans because the returns are more lucrative than public bonds, with interest rates charged to borrowers 1.5 to 3% higher. The modern private credit industry dates back to Michael Milken and the junk bond boom of the 1980s, but it really took off in the wake of post-2008 financial crisis banking regulations. New laws such as Dodd-Frank prompted banks to move away from risky loans, allowing lenders that didn't operate as banks, including private credit funds, to fill the gap. The idea was that only sophisticated institutional investors or fabulously wealthy individuals who could afford to risk losses would have their money on the line. McKinsey researchers estimated that the industry grew tenfold from 2008 to 2023, while Morgan Stanley analysts estimated that the industry expanded from $2 trillion in 2020 to $3 trillion by the beginning of 2025.

As private lending expands, there's an ever-increasing need for capital to fund it — and only so many billionaires and oil-rich nations to ask for money. Kevin Desai, PWC's US and Mexico head of deals, told me that competition for investor money is "at an all-time high." The next step, both regulatorily and logistically, is to open up the funds to private wealth advisors, who can provide access to the money held by America's well-to-do dentists, doctors, small business owners, and less flashy millionaires. And from there, the final step is to get these products out to anyone with a 401(k) or IRA. Why is a fairly esoteric and risky industry looking to the general public to fund its growth, especially since it will require tangling with a thicket of new regulations? To hear the private debt lenders tell it, the move is an evangelical calling. The industry claims that access to its outsize returns will bring wealth to the masses and even help alleviate concerns about the future of retirement. Rowan, Apollo's CEO, has said that countries like Australia, Israel, and Mexico that allow private assets in retirement accounts have had "40% to 50% better outcomes." But it's not so simple. For one, the push may not be as altruistic as the industry claims. Traditional sources of capital for private credit funds are already overallocated to the industry. And while some firms can rest on their laurels, the largest are now publicly traded, which means they face shareholder pressure to continue growing. That's why many private credit funds are willing to take the regulatory and legal risks to open themselves to the average American — the numbers are simply too juicy. The country has about $12 trillion invested in its 401(k)s, and Boston Consulting Group estimates that private wealth could have a $3 trillion stake by 2030. The main roadblock has never been the law — private assets can legally be part of a retirement fund — it's the risk of a lawsuit. American retirement laws give plaintiffs a range of ways they can sue the provider of their retirement plan for not acting as a "fiduciary" or legally-responsible steward of their clients' financial future. The higher fees associated with these private asset funds create a greater opportunity for future retirees to sue their retirement provider for charging excessive fees. After Trump's election, many of the industry's bosses made it clear that they were seeking "litigation relief" to fully move into 401(k) plans. This August, Trump issued an executive order to "democratize access to alternative assets for 401(k) investors" that supported the idea of making it harder to sue, and BlackRock CFO Martin Small told a conference in December that he expects to see real changes in the first quarter of 2026 from both regulatory agencies and Congress. "I have worked in this space my whole career in asset management, and I can tell you that we have seen more progress on this topic of private markets into 401(k) basically in the last year than we've seen in the last 20 years," Small said. For years, private asset funds — both on the equity and debt side — were thought of as the ultimate "smart money." But as the private debt industry eyes your retirement account, the cracks in this mythmaking are starting to show. At the core of the concerns about private debt is the very thing that makes them special — that they're private. The deal terms are opaque, and there's substantially less information about who is lending money to whom and the financial safety of those underlying businesses. Let's say you're lending to a pipe-manufacturing company that buys all of its materials from China. If this loan were public, the impact of tariffs would be immediately reflected in its value, with the price dropping substantially in the publicly traded bond market. But in private credit, the lack of real-time pricing could mean your seemingly high-performing portfolio is actually full of lemons, and you might not know that until you get a note that one of the loans in your portfolio is defaulting. Admittedly, the regular retirement investor isn't taking full advantage of the information available on their investments as it stands. The retirement process in America, whether the underlying asset is public or private, requires trusting that your employer will act as a good steward of your money. "You're hoping that your employer picks the right managers," Alex Blostein, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the large private equity and credit investors, says. The bigger concern is that the kinds of groups and industry watchdogs that do dig into these minutiae may also not have access to the information they need to properly assess risks. In the public markets, every bond offering or debt deal is closely scrutinized by huge rating agencies like Moody's and S&P, which assign publicly available grades. There are ratings in private credit deals, but not only are their ratings under the radar, but some private credit rating firms have attracted attention for the sheer number of ratings they produce per analyst. Egan Jones, which issued over 3,600 ratings on private debt deals in 2024, had only 20 analysts and a substantially higher analyst-to-rating ratio than its competitors. The eye-popping volume recently attracted the attention of the SEC, which is investigating its rating practices. Michael Dimler, a Senior Vice President of Private Corporate Credit at Morningstar, told me that when the firm reviews private credit deals, it receives the same confidential information that lenders do to generate its ratings, and there are "reliable channels of information" to keep investors in the know. In a recent paper, Morningstar DBRS explained how it uses the same policies, procedures, and methodologies for public and private credit ratings, and that the company receives information like "financial statements" and "credit agreements" to rate both public and private credit. This is particularly important for retail investors and everyday savers, as some market watchers worry that the industry will offload its worst private assets to unsophisticated retail investors. Their institutional investors and their own pocketbooks could reap a substantial payout by selling off bad assets at high prices, while retail investors will be left holding worthless assets. "A couple of bad actors could really spoil the party," Blostein says, noting that "some bad examples" could "create big reputational issues for the whole channel" even if most are "trying to do the best thing for their customers." Beyond the fundamental concerns with the private debt business, there are also growing worries that the asset class is not delivering the kind of mega-returns that justify the higher risks. As with credit ratings, actually comparing the public and private debt markets is harder than it sounds. While private credit has a strong case for outperforming its public market equivalents due to the higher interest rates, a recent study by business school academics at Johns Hopkins and UC Irvine argued that the industry's returns are "illusory" and that it fails to consistently beat the public markets. Industry executives and insiders have strongly disputed their findings, but it's a known problem that comparing the performance of different assets in the less standardized private credit market can be challenging. "The investors receive thousands of pages of PDFs, but it is very hard for them to aggregate and have an overview of what is going on and where the money goes," Oxford economist Ludovic Phallipou told the UK House of Lords last year. This presents "quite a mess," and he recommends more standardization of how information is presented. Just as owing money to someone else is a bit nerve-racking, so can relying on being paid back. This is especially true when questions about the borrower's financial stability begin to arise. Therein lies the real heartburn about private credit: What happens if the economy slows and a rash of these companies can't pay back their loans at once? Or a series of private credit funds come under stress? Goldman Sachs' Blostein tells me that private credit is unlikely to cause a market contagion. In layman's terms, you can't pull your money out of these funds whenever you feel like it, with "redemptions" usually restricted to 5% of the fund's total value per quarter. This prevents these funds from being forced to sell off their assets, which would drive down prices and cause a negative feedback loop. "The bank-run style contagion doesn't really exist here," Blostein says, explaining that it's hard to imagine funds blowing up the way, say, Silicon Valley Bank or Lehman Brothers did. Private crediteers also argue that the risk of the asset class causing issues for the financial system or the economy is overblown. For one thing, the industry is still less than a tenth of the size of the US corporate bond market, which is valued at $36 trillion. Advocates also point out that private credit funds are required to maintain a more protective cash reserve compared to the loans they make, compared to banks. While the big banks can lend out more than 10 times what they have in their coffers, the average leverage in private credit is around 1.4 times, said Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman. Responding to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's 2024 quote that "there could be hell to pay" if the private credit market starts to crack, Apollo CEO Rowan said that Dimon has it wrong. "Every dollar that moves out of the banking industry and into the investment marketplace makes the system safer and more resilient and less levered," Rowan said. But there are many other ways these funds are connected to the broader financial world. Institutional investors who provide the capital to launch private debt funds can actually borrow the money they put in, banking on high returns. Private credit funds can borrow money to make investments before investors are able to wire over their commitments or to help cash out investors earlier. These additional levels of leverage increase the potential blast zone for any private credit failures. And the source for many of these loans? Banks. So even if the mega-banks have exited the riskiest lending directly, they are still enmeshed with private investors. In a paper published earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston concluded that there is certainly risk of bank exposure to private credit, but that bank loans to the sector are largely secured and would be among the first to be repaid. This would blunt the broader financial impact of a failure in private credit, though the money would likely be lost in "severely adverse economic conditions." Michael Imerman, who co-authored the piece about private credit returns not being up to snuff, said he did "not want to cry wolf", but there's still a "non-zero" chance private credit could cause a crisis in ways that people aren't anticipating. After all, as a researcher who began studying big banks in 2007, he has seen "black swan" events before. "There's no way that all thousand loans or ten thousand loans will default at the same time. It's a consistent and reliable stream of income, let's add that to your retirement account," Immernam says, mimicking the pre-crash mentality. "What happened? They were wrong, all 10,000 loans defaulted at the same time, and retirement accounts took a giant hit." Beyond the possibility of a larger meltdown, some of the industry's biggest critics, such as Phalippou, are concerned about other issues in private credit, like stronger protections for investors. "I always thought it was quite an emergency, and now with retail in that space, I think it's a drama to not have strong investor protection," Phallipou told the UK Parliament. As for the companies being lent to, the biggest risk is that they may default. Already, some are taking on additional debt to pay off their initial loans or the interest, a process known as "extend and pretend." And if there's a wave of defaults, lenders are likely to become much more selective with who they lend to and increase what they charge to lend, making it even harder for companies to access debt without signing up for extremely unfavorable terms. "The only way to improve perception around all of these issues is more transparency," Blostein says. "And we would always argue for more clarity, more transparency, more data that will enable people to really think through all these issues." While the debate over broader risks rages on, private credit continues to grow. Even firms run by skeptics like JPMorgan are putting aside $50 billion to invest in private credit. And, soon enough, you will be part of the potential money supply. That could create a more stable private credit market, focused on consistent returns for retail customers and providing them with an opportunity to invest in the 87% of US companies with more than $100 million in revenue that are privately held. Or it could mean your retirement is going to be gambled on increasingly novel and risky credit structures that could come crashing down in the next crisis.

Business Insider is on the ground at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, and we want to take you along with us. We'll be updating our liveblog throughout the week with breaking news, insights from interviews and conversations, power-player sightings, and color from private events. From global growth to AI, talent, and the future of work, Davos is where the year's biggest ideas are debated, deals are struck, and the road map for the year ahead gets sketched out. Follow along here for real-time updates from Davos. We're wrapping up our live coverage of the second day of Davos 2026. Today, we sampled $13 hot chocolates from Meta, witnessed an awkward moment between top tech leaders, heard about attendees getting scammed by "fake VIP passes" for the USA House, and, of course, documented some of the best fashion of the day. We'll be back on Wednesday, focusing on President Donald Trump's appearance and the ongoing fallout from his threats against Greenland. At a White House press briefing on Tuesday, President Donald Trump remained coy on the issue of Greenland, though he signaled it would be a topic of discussion at Davos. "We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland. I'm leaving tonight, as you know. Davos," Trump told reporters during the nearly two-hour-long briefing. "I think things are going to work out pretty well."

"We have a lot of meetings scheduled on Greenland. I'm leaving tonight, as you know. Davos," Trump told reporters during the nearly two-hour-long briefing. "I think things are going to work out pretty well." Trump was also asked how far he was willing to go to acquire the territory, which is owned by Denmark. "You'll find out," Trump replied. Anthropic and Google DeepMind chiefs say they're seeing early signs of AI affecting junior-level hiring. Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, predicted this would be the year when AI could mean cutting back on entry-level jobs and internships. "I think there is some evidence, I can feel that ourselves," he said during a joint interview with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei at Davos on Tuesday.

"I think there is some evidence, I can feel that ourselves," he said during a joint interview with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei at Davos on Tuesday. Amodei agreed. "Now I think maybe we're starting to see just the little beginnings of it, in software and coding," he said, adding that Anthropic is thinking about how to deal with this change "in a sensible way." Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said on Tuesday that he understands why Trump wants Greenland. "I support the what: being able to project power in the Arctic," Tillis said at the "Path to Peace in Ukraine: By Might or by Accord?" panel. "Oh my goodness, anyone in NATO should understand that as a priority." Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said on Tuesday that he understands why Trump wants Greenland. "I support the what: being able to project power in the Arctic," Tillis said at the "Path to Peace in Ukraine: By Might or by Accord?" panel. "Oh my goodness, anyone in NATO should understand that as a priority." Russia and China's military drills in the Arctic show that "clearly we have to have a power projection platform and Greenland makes a lot of geographic sense," he said. But he said he doesn't agree with Trump's how. Greenland is a territory of Denmark, a NATO ally, and the US already has a military base on it. Tillis pointed out that, at the peak of US cooperation, the US had 17 military facilities there. He also rejected the idea that projecting US power from Greenland requires some financial transaction. He said that path doesn't even appeal to him as a fiscal conservative. "I think over time, hopefully we will get to the president to recognize that and have the policy that's commensurate with that," he said. A blue-and-white Boeing C-32A departed Joint Base Andrews a few hours ago and is now approaching Europe. Its call sign, SAM696, suggests it's carrying a high-ranking official but not the president. Another US government airplane landed in Switzerland at 6:40 a.m. CET, before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared in Davos. Argentina's President Javier Milei appeared to arrive in Zurich at 3:13 p.m. CET. His government's Boeing 757 jet, registered as "ARG-01," briefly stopped in the Canary Islands, per ADS-B Exchange data.

French President Emmanuel Macron was onstage today, after two state-owned Dassault private jets arrived from an air base near Paris around 9:30 a.m. CET. We've also seen airplanes owned by the governments or militaries of Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Czechia, Egypt, Israel, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, and Sweden. President Donald Trump is scheduled to speak tomorrow. Microsoft President Brad Smith said at a panel on AI and geopolitics that local resistance to data centers is the "big issues" for tech companies investing in AI right now. Smith listed a variety of concerns that people who live near data centers are raising, including whether electricity prices will rise, whether water pressure in their homes will be impacted by the centers' water use, and who will benefit most from new jobs.

Smith listed a variety of concerns that people who live near data centers are raising, including whether electricity prices will rise, whether water pressure in their homes will be impacted by the centers' water use, and who will benefit most from new jobs. "Those are completely legitimate questions, and I think it's incumbent on all of us in the industry in the United States to address them head-on and offer the kinds of assurances that people need," Smith said. Smith's comments come one week after Microsoft detailed a plan for "community-first AI infrastructure" that includes paying higher rates for the electricity their facilities consume. That followed a post from President Donald Trump calling on tech companies to "pay their own way" for data centers. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff on Tuesday again called out tech companies for abusing Section 230, this time with Google's president sitting just feet away. "The social media companies have not been held responsible for the damage they did," Benioff said at a World Economic Forum panel. The Salesforce CEO owns Time Magazine, which he said is responsible for what it publishes. "These tech companies are not," he said.

The Salesforce CEO owns Time Magazine, which he said is responsible for what it publishes. "These tech companies are not," he said. Benioff also criticized Character.AI after watching a "60 Minutes" documentary about the company's impact on children. It was "maybe the darkest thing I've ever seen with technology," Benioff said. He made similar statements about Section 230 and Character.AI earlier this month. Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat sat two seats down from Benioff on the panel. Her company runs one of the social media sites, YouTube, that benefits from Section 230. Google also paid $2.5 billion to license Character.AI's technology and hire its key talent in 2024. The panel's moderator said that Porat had a "right to reply." Porat said there were areas where regulation was needed, but the upside was significant. As a cancer survivor, Porat highlighted the potential to democratize early detection in oncology through AI. "I don't want to give up on those kinds of things," she said. Benioff responded, saying we can learn from what happened with social media. He referenced some governments banning social media for people under certain ages. "That's a big step," Benioff said. "That wasn't true 10 years ago." The biggest theme emerging from my conversations so far this week is that AI hasn't delivered the tangible productivity gains executives expected. The question everyone's trying to answer is: How do we fix that? One approach is an "AI or else" approach, shoving it down employees' throats (e.g., incorporating AI use in performance reviews). But at a Business Insider roundtable I moderated this morning, the chief people officers at many of the world's largest companies advised a gentler approach.

But at a Business Insider roundtable I moderated this morning, the chief people officers at many of the world's largest companies advised a gentler approach. Cisco, for example, found that when it mandated AI training, it not only failed to drive adoption but actually had a negative impact. What was more successful was "providing choice," said Francine Katsoudas, the chief people, policy, and purpose officer at Cisco — like when it gave its engineers access to half a dozen AI tools, so they themselves could decide which tools to use and how to use them. "I do believe that we have to work really, really hard to make AI a team sport." One of the most fun parts about being at Davos is walking along the main promenade to people-watch and try the free snacks and drinks that companies and foreign governments hand out. Since this is a snowy mountain town, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are popular. One of the most fun parts about being at Davos is walking along the main promenade to people-watch and try the free snacks and drinks that companies and foreign governments hand out. Since this is a snowy mountain town, coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are popular. One of the tastiest items I've had is the orange hot chocolate at Meta's house. To order, I had to scan a QR code, which took me to Meta-owned WhatsApp, where a disclaimer popped up. "Meta shares your commitment to the highest standards of ethical conduct and transparency," it said. "This hospitality is valued at USD $13." Luckily, our Business Insider policies allow me to accept free hot chocolate, and a minute later, a friendly barista served up the drink, topped with whipped cream, a marshmallow, and a wafer with the Meta logo. It was piping hot, not too sweet, and delicious. A recent warning out of Davos highlights that even the world's business elite can fall prey to online scams. Fake VIP passes for the USA House — America's privately funded celebration site at the World Economic Forum's event in Davos, Switzerland — have hit the market. In a statement on its website, the USA House warned those attending not to be duped. "We will not give access to people who purchased such packages," the statement reads. "Our sympathies to those who fell victim to these scams."

"No, it's not necessary," Lutnick told panel host Adam Tooze, an economic historian, when Tooze tried to steer the conversation back to the topic looming over Davos. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick doesn't want to talk about Greenland, as President Donald Trump's statements about the autonomous Danish territory roil global markets. "No, it's not necessary," Lutnick told panel host Adam Tooze, an economic historian, when Tooze tried to steer the conversation back to the topic looming over Davos. "I think America and the Western Hemisphere are vital to America, and I'm going to leave that to my national security people to address." Top economic officials in the UK and Canada, who joined Lutnick on the panel, sprinkled in reminders in their remarks that the White House should not forget its allies, though they offered no specific condemnation of Trump's repeated suggestions that the US may try to seize Greenland. "What I urge Howard and others in the administration just to think of is just how your allies can help you achieve your objectives," Rachel Reeves, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said. Later, during an open Q&A, Lutnick was pressed on how the US would respond if Europe imposed retaliatory tariffs should Trump follow through on his threat to impose tariffs on European countries for not supporting his views on Greenland. Lutnick said if Europe responds with tariffs of its own, the standoff will eventually end with a meeting between President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and Trump, as happened previously. "If we're going to have a kerfuffle, so be it," Lutnick said. "But we know how it's going to end." Davos often attracts an older crowd, but I had lunch with two young tech founders here, one of whom is not old enough to drink in the US "This is one of the few places in the world where I can have a drink and not feel so guilty about it," said Cameron Fink, the 20-year-old Dartmouth dropout who is cofounder and CEO of Aaru, which is building AI-driven software that it says can predict future events.

"I did meet one person younger than me, but they happened to be the child of the World Economic Forum delegate, so I don't know if that counts." Fink and his 21-year-old cofounder, Ned Koh, were dressed in suits. They dressed up to try to make them look older, lest they be confused for interns. To save money, they are not staying in Davos, but 30 minutes away by train. "The Davos accommodations are like $30,000, Fink said. "That doesn't exist in our founder budget." Ned used 390,000 United Airlines miles to travel here in business class, which he said was worth it because he spent the trip networking. "If you look at the people around you and you start to look at logos on backpacks, you'll see that like half of America's biggest CEOs are sitting next to you," said Koh. Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, described the US job market in three words to a Davos audience: "K-shaped, concentrated, and choppy." Consumer spending is high among wealthier Americans, but middle- and lower-income households are struggling to find work and pay bills. It's a gap that she expects will widen, especially as healthcare and hospitality are among the only fields showing real growth.

It's a gap that she expects will widen, especially as healthcare and hospitality are among the only fields showing real growth. Besides the gloomy jobs outlook, a group of top economists and bank leaders said Tuesday that the global economy is resilient. Potential AI and credit bubbles might be a risk to markets — though data centers are still a worthy investment. "We're not in a productivity bubble," Richardson, who was one of the panelists, said. "What AI has promised, it can deliver: higher standards of living, higher growth rates." She expects the US will need more specialized blue-collar workers to build data centers and stay competitive. "It's going to take an infrastructure that is able to keep up with the development, and right now, we don't have it."

Trump is dominating not only conversations in Davos, but also the narrative in the markets. Stocks across the board have plunged on Tuesday morning, with investors showing their anxiety about the Greenland fight. Major indexes on both sides of the Atlantic are down sharply, having previously largely ignored Trump's threats to take over Greenland.

The weather is sunny and (relatively) warm in Davos, but there's a definite chill in the air. Maybe it's the heightened security. Maybe it's the long lines already forming. Maybe it's that there are reportedly a lot more people here than there have been in a long time. Whatever the case, everyone seems to be on edge. Multiple attendees told me they were already feeling exhausted, as if we were halfway through the week, even though we're just getting started. President Donald Trump's ongoing threats against Europe over his desire to take over Greenland have been a big talking point. Speculation continues to swirl about his Wednesday address.

I've asked a lot of finance executives this week about AI's impact on the workplace. Specifically, how the tech's automation could suck up the need for junior roles. All of them stressed the importance of attracting critical, creative thinkers, since so much of the hard financial analysis can be done by the bots. That means they'd look for talent outside traditional finance tracks. Don't sweat it, Wharton folks. They're still interested in your types. Just don't be surprised if you're rubbing shoulders with an Art History major in your analyst class. Selling AI chips to China would be "like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea," according to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who described the idea as "crazy." Speaking to Bloomberg at Davos on Tuesday, Amodei said that Trump's decision to sell Nvidia AI chips to China would be a mistake that could have major national security implications.

"We are many years ahead of China in terms of our ability to make chips, so I think it would be a big mistake to ship these chips," said Amodei, who said that companies like Anthropic were building models that are "essentially cognition."

There were at least 157 yesterday, arriving from more than 40 different countries. The longest trip was made by one that belongs to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, according to JetSpy data. It flew for 14.5 hours from Hawaii. JetSpy also showed numerous companies' private jets arriving in the area, including those of Aramco, BlackRock, Google, and JPMorgan Chase. The most popular type was the Gulfstream G650, which typically costs over $65 million. Read full story Green "is my happy color," she said, saying bright colors help when "the world is so dark."

French President Emmanuel Macron channeled his inner "Top Gun" during a panel discussion with WEF cochair Larry Fink, sporting a pair of aviator sunglasses. In a special address, Macron criticized Trump's tariffs, calling them "fundamentally unacceptable." "Competition from the United States of America through trade agreements that undermine our export interests, demand maximum concessions, and openly aim to weaken and subordinate Europe, combined with an endless accumulation of new tariffs that are fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty," he said. While it isn't clear exactly why Macron sported sunglasses, he appeared in public last week with a swollen, red right eye, opening a speech at a French military base by saying: "Please pardon the unsightly appearance of my eye." He described his issue as "something completely harmless." The presence of senior figures from US politics is noticeable in Davos this year. Business Insider's Ben Bergman has spotted both Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and former House speaker and longtime Trump ally, Newt Gingrich, on the ground today. A reminder: Trump addresses Davos tomorrow at 2 p.m. local time. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said he believes people will eventually realize AI may demand "macroeconomic intervention." "If we look at just the disparities in wealth that we have now, if we look at it as a fraction of GDP, I believe we've kind of exceeded the Gilded Age already, and this is mostly without AI," he said.

"If we look at just the disparities in wealth that we have now, if we look at it as a fraction of GDP, I believe we've kind of exceeded the Gilded Age already, and this is mostly without AI," he said. However, asked about the California wealth tax, Amodei said the proposal was "poorly designed" and called for more "sober" thinking about tech's economic impact. Private jets belonging to Bill Gates and Michael Dell touched down at Zurich Airport around lunchtime, according to data from JetSpy. Gates' Gulfstream G650 came from Madrid, about two hours away. It was on the ground in the Spanish capital for 24 hours after arriving from California. The Microsoft cofounder is scheduled to speak about healthcare tomorrow.

A Gulfstream G700, which JetSpy lists as belonging to Dell, flew from Farnborough, near London. It had traversed the Atlantic Ocean on Sunday. Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest asset management firm, kicked off the World Economic Forum on Tuesday with a critique of capitalism. More wealth has been created since the fall of the Berlin Wall than at any other time in human history, but it has not translated into shared prosperity, said Fink, who was appointed as interim cochair of the World Economic Forum in August 2025, replacing founder Klaus Schwab. "In advanced economies, that wealth has accrued to a far narrower share of people than any healthy society can ultimately sustain," he said.

As traffic jams snarl the streets of Davos, conversations about the autonomous future of cars are getting a lot of airtime. Earlier, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was asked about the investment landscape around robotaxis, and said he doesn't think the investment market in autonomous vehicles is overheated. As traffic jams snarl the streets of Davos, conversations about the autonomous future of cars are getting a lot of airtime. Earlier, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi was asked about the investment landscape around robotaxis, and said he doesn't think the investment market in autonomous vehicles is overheated. However, he says the broader AI market — foundation models, hardware, semiconductors — has "heated up significantly," with "very aggressive assumptions of forward growth." Asked if Uber might invest in Waymo, Khosrowshahi said "no comment." "They have plenty of money," he said. "But we're investing across the ecosystem, and we're very bullish." Editor's note: This post has been updated to more accurately reflect Khosrowshahi's comments. With schedules full of back-to-back meetings and most shops on the promenade taken over by businesses, eating during the day can be tough. Some businesses set up grab-and-go food and drink stations. That's what Pinterest did, and this morning, sweet croissants were on the menu.

That's what Pinterest did, and this morning, sweet croissants were on the menu. I opted for the chocolate crush, but I was told the cinnamon apple glow was the most popular choice, with only two left when I got there a little after 11 a.m. And yes, it tasted as good as it looked. So when the CEO of Philip Morris International US travels, even for long trips, she takes a carry-on. Her trick: Pick a color for the week and coordinate outfits around that, with travel-well fabrics. For Davos this week, the color is black. Stephen Ehikian is CEO of C3 AI, but he's no stranger to the Trump administration.

I asked him about President Donald Trump's upcoming speech. He had this to say: "I'm hoping there's an expression of strength in numbers, and we're better together kind of story. Now, that said, I believe this idea that taking a strong 'America First' approach is good for this country. "I think it's setting a tone and a change of direction from where we've been the last 50 years. So, I think it's refreshing. I don't even want to anticipate what's going to happen tomorrow because I have no idea." Speaking earlier this morning, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he is skeptical about some companies claiming rapid AI transformation, and that getting it right comes down to culture.

Uber tried building customer service AI that followed its old policies, Khosrowshahi told the audience at Davos, but it was only "OK." That changed after the developers started from scratch with AI in mind. Companies are essentially rule systems, he said.

Davos attracts a real cross-section of the world's rich and powerful, ranging from investors and politicians to sporting legends. Soccer great and longtime UNICEF ambassador David Beckham was spotted recording a podcast this morning. At last year's Davos, Beckham was awarded the Crystal Award, which recognized his contributions to "advocating for children's rights, education and well-being." Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who spoke in a morning panel led by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, shared how he has always prepared for Davos meetings — and how that's changed with AI. He said his field team used to prep him for 50 or so meetings, according to a "particular workflow."

He said his field team used to prep him for 50 or so meetings, according to a "particular workflow." "Nothing had really changed since I joined in '92 to essentially even a few years back," he said about the year he joined the tech giant as an engineer. "Whereas now, I just go to Copilot and say, "Hey, I'm meeting Larry. Please give me a brief." He added that the briefs generated by Microsoft's AI assistant give him a comprehensive overview of the relationship between his firm and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's team. AI tools are also changing the traditional bottom-to-top flow of information, he said. "In fact, what I do is I take that and immediately share that back with all my colleagues across all the functions," he said. "Think about it. It's a complete inversion of how information is flowing in the organization." Robot drivers will ultimately outperform humans on safety, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said on Tuesday in Davos. "If you think about the world 20 years from now, your Uber is going to be driven largely not by a human being, but by a robot driver — a piece of software on top of a car," Khosrowshahi said, adding that vehicles are becoming increasingly sophisticated and more like "computers on wheels."

Khosrowshahi said autonomous systems have clear advantages over human drivers. "There's no doubt in my mind that the robot driver can be safer than a human driver," he said. Robot drivers don't get tired or distracted, don't text while driving, and can operate continuously while improving over time, he added. The key question, Khosrowshahi said, is what level of safety is "enough" for robot drivers — whether matching human performance is sufficient or whether autonomous vehicles should be held to a higher standard. In the longer term, he said, human driving could resemble horseback riding today, becoming a niche activity done for enjoyment. "There's no doubt that 10 years from now, there will be questions as to whether humans are safe enough," he said. Trump is expected to arrive in Davos on Wednesday. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants business leaders to take a breath and chill out about Greenland, that may not be in the cards.

Trump is expected to arrive in Davos on Wednesday. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants business leaders to take a breath and chill out about Greenland, that may not be in the cards. Trump posted on Truth Social on Thursday that he had "a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland." "I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security," Trump wrote. Trump on Sunday had sent messages to Norway's leader, saying the US requires "Complete and Total Control of Greenland." Greenland is a semi-autonomous Danish territory. Governments keep changing their rules on EVs, says BYD executive vice president Stella Li, and that sets carmakers back. Li said in a panel at Davos that when countries go "back and forth" on their EV policy, it creates a pattern that "will confuse manufacturers." In contrast, when governments give a "very clear line," automakers can focus on execution, Li said.

Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case? Calm down the hysteria, take a deep breath, this is where we were last year," Bessentt said. "I'm sure you would have asked me the same question if we were here on April 2nd. And you know what? It all worked out."

"I'm sure you would have asked me the same question if we were here on April 2nd. And you know what? It all worked out." When asked about what European business leaders should do, Bessent's take was to "sit back" and "relax." "What I am urging everyone here to do is sit back, take a deep breath, and let things play out," Bessent said. "I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all, for national security, for the US, and for Europe," he said. Anything you do within your company's digital ecosystem is likely being tracked, from the data you touch to the software programs you use. But AI agents, not so much. That's a real concern as we rely on them more and more, Raj Sharma, EY's global managing partner of growth and innovation, told me. "We have to build industrial-level security for AI agents in that particular area," he said. "That keeps me up at night," Sharma added. For Tim Walsh, the chair and CEO of KPMG US, it's the threat of quantum computing. While still a few years out, its power is undeniable. "Quantum breaks everything," Walsh said. "I mean, all encryption." Read full story "M&A is high on the agenda," said Sharon Marcil, North America chair at BCG. "We're hearing it from so many CEOs."

But it's also obvious that the world now places far less trust in us to help shape what comes next." Fink said the capitalism now faces a big test: Whether it can "evolve to turn more people into owners of growth, instead of spectators watching it happen." "And that kind of change is hard. Especially in a world of competing ideologies and assumptions about how the system should work," he said. Fink's remarks ground what is expected to be a monumental week, in which deals are made and new alliances are forged amid turmoil in the wider political sphere.

Title: Letters: The social media illusion can leave you feeling like your nice life isn’t enough

Influencers online can make you feel like your life doesn't measure up and that you are missing out. Stock image: Getty In my younger days, I aspired simply to be Liverpool FC’s Tommy Smith, crunching tackles on a wet and muddy Anfield pitch. Age soon nullified that ambition, but at least my reference points were real and achievable. Today, social media has removed those limits. TikTok and Instagram feed us a parade of influencers with designer kitchens, Mediterranean villas and endless leisure. These lifestyles feel normal and attainable, and quietly many ask: “Why isn’t my life like that?” In Ireland, with eye-watering rents, elusive mortgages and delayed independence, it is hardly surprising that a decent salary and modest flat can feel like failure. We’ve always seen aspirational images in ads or TV shows, but social media feels real – even when it represents the top few per cent of earners or carefully curated illusion. If this “financial dysmorphia” is taking hold, no amount of economic growth alone will make everyone feel successful. Perhaps the quieter remedies matter more: good public spaces, affordable transport, liveable towns and a culture that values contentment over conspicuous display. And sometimes, we might all benefit from putting the phone down and noticing the perfectly adequate lives we already lead. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran Road, Co Armagh Parents have a right to make decisions on behalf of their children concerning their moral upbringing. But what I don’t agree with is a parent’s decision to oblige their unsuspecting very young children to join a highly complex organisation like the Catholic Church. In free societies like we have here in Ireland, parents don’t oblige their children to join any political party soon after they are born. This is because, I believe, our political party leaders would then be treated for ever like dear father and mother figures and so they would very likely start to stay on running Ireland for way too long. But because children in Ireland are baptised at way too early an age, they soon learn, in an immature way, not to question how their church is run. And because of this infringement of their religious freedom, any real and practical change – sadly – happens within the Catholic Church at a much too slow and glacial pace. Sean O’Brien, Kilrush, Co Clare Eric Conway (‘Thank you, Mr Trump, for finally coming to the aid of Nigeria’s Christian people’, Irish Independent, letters, January 17) seems to be of the impression that Donald Trump was the deserved recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, Trump has further humiliated himself by parading the Nobel Peace Medal without the honour of earning or winning it. He does this while threatening to take control of Greenland, supposedly in the interest of American security, but more likely in order to enrich him and his billionaire benefactors while putting the existence of Nato in serious jeopardy. Moscow and Beijing can rejoice in the work that he is doing on their behalf as Trump is singlehandedly fracturing the alliances that have stood since the end of the Second World War. While Mr Conway wishes God’s blessing on Mr Trump, it may be of little benefit to this volatile, narcissistic character but then, God, it is said, works in strange ways. Jimmy O’Brien, Dukesmeadows, Co Kilkenny As a European country, Ireland is in a unique position. This gives the country a stronger role in the current Greenland “debate”. It’s not in Nato, so it can ignore Trump’s silly quest without breaking any arrangements. And more – why doesn’t Greenland just kick out the existing US forces from the island? Invite them back on your terms if and when they behave... In 1922 Ireland kicked out the most powerful force on the planet. I hope the current Greenland prime minister is talking with the Taoiseach on the path ahead. Gerard Walsh, Port Elgin, Ontario In the current game of high-stakes poker, Trump has the trump card. “Play ball with me on Greenland or fight Putin on your own.” Game, set and match... Pat O’Brien, Newmarket-on-Fergus, Co Clare I would imagine that Americans would say that they don’t want Venezuela, Greenland, Cuba, Mexico, etc. I feel they would far more likely be concerned with affordable healthcare and housing. They want good jobs. One wonders if the Trump administration is somewhat deaf to these needs. John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary A friend who, unlike the undersigned, is a keen gardener, tells me he is delighted to see the first shoots of snowdrops in his garden. Indeed when he has also seen daffodils, butterflies and bees, he will have seen all kinds of everything. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Kerry people and many others will be delighted at the remarkable success of Jessie Buckley, the actor. Her great-grandmother, Madge Clifford, was also an exceptional person. Just one of her significant contributions was her service as confidential secretary to Austin Stack, home affairs minister, when together they administered the Republican Courts and Police in 1921-22.

Title: Kevin Warsh soars ahead of Kevin Hassett in Polymarket, Kalshi odds on next Fed chair after Trump signal

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/19/2026 8:02:03 PM PST by SeekAndFind Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh soared ahead of National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett on prediction markets betting on the next Fed chair after President Trump on Friday hinted that Hassett might be out of the running. Trump did not reveal his final choice to replace Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, but said he would like to keep Hassett in his current role. “I see Kevin’s in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You were fantastic on television today,” the president said during remarks at the White House on Friday. “I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth.” The odds of Warsh clinching the nomination jumped to 60% on Polymarket as of Friday afternoon, while traders placed just a 17% chance that Hassett would land the job – following weeks in which markets placed better odds on Hassett. Current Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who has been considered a long shot, came in at 15%. Traders saw just a 6% chance that BlackRock exec Rick Rieder could win the role. Warsh also jumped to 59% odds on Kalshi, another prediction market. Hassett and Waller got 18% and 14% odds, respectively. Trump has not set a specific date to name his pick for the next chairman. Powell’s term at the helm expires in May, though he could choose to stay on the board through 2028. He has so far declined to comment on whether he will remain a Fed governor. On Sunday, Powell publicly shared that he’s under criminal investigation for allegedly lying during congressional testimony last summer — a stunning development that came after years of Trump blasting the chair for failing to lower interest rates quickly enough.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Based on his experience in financial crisis management, his understanding of Wall Street, his communicative skills demonstrated on Capitol Hill and his passion to reign in the $38 trillion debt and drive inflation lower, Kevin Warsh is squarely in the spotlight to be the next Fed Chair. 2 posted on 01/19/2026 8:06:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Just abolish the Fed and get it over with.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Based on his experience in financial crisis management, his understanding of Wall Street, his communicative skills demonstrated on Capitol Hill and his passion to reign in the $38 trillion debt and drive inflation lower, Kevin Warsh is squarely in the spotlight to be the next Fed Chair. 2 posted on 01/19/2026 8:06:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Just abolish the Fed and get it over with.

This is from a Financial Newsletter I subscribe to: ___________________________________ As of last week, Kevin Warsh emerged as the front-runner to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve. His potential selection is a significant point of discussion for financial markets due to his unique blend of Wall Street experience and hawkish economic views. Warsh was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President George W. Bush. He was sworn in on February 24, 2006, at the age of 35, making him the youngest person ever appointed to the Board of Governors in the history of the Federal Reserve. Bush nominated him on January 27, 2006, to fill the unexpired term previously held by Ben Bernanke, who had just become Fed Chair. At the time, his appointment was controversial due to his age and perceived lack of experience compared to typical Fed governors. However, he became a central figure during the 2008 financial crisis, serving as the Fed’s primary liaison to Wall Street and a key advisor to Chairman Bernanke. While appointed by Bush, Warsh continued to serve into the Barack Obama administration before resigning in March 2011. Warsh’s experience during that 2007-2009 financial crisis provides the best clues for how he might lead the Fed in 2026. While only in his late thirties during the crisis, Warsh held an outsized influence that surpassed many of his more senior colleagues. Prior to his public service, he was an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley in Mergers and Acquisitions. Because of his background at Morgan Stanley, he was the Fed’s primary point of contact for the CEOs of the major investment banks. When the system began to “freeze,” Warsh was the person on the phone with terrified bank executives, translating the chaos of the trading floor for the academic economists at the Fed. He was a key architect in the forced takeovers and bailouts of 2008. He helped negotiate JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns and was a central figure in the discussions surrounding the AIG bailout and the fateful decision to let Lehman Brothers fail. He spent a significant amount of time on Capitol Hill, acting as a salesman for the Fed’s emergency measures to skeptical Republican lawmakers, who were wary of government intervention. Although he initially supported the emergency measures (like cutting rates to zero), Warsh eventually became one of the first and most vocal critics of the Fed’s long-term reliance on “easy money.” In 2010, he publicly broke with Ben Bernanke in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, questioning the second round of Quantitative Easing (QE2). He worried that printing money to buy bonds would lead to long-term inflation and “market distortions.” He famously referred to Quantitative Easing as a “reverse Robin Hood” policy, arguing that it benefited wealthy asset holders (stock and real estate owners) while doing little for the average “Main Street” worker. He resigned from the Fed in 2011, seven years before his term was set to expire, largely because he disagreed with the direction of monetary policy and felt the Fed was becoming too entangled with political and fiscal goals. Historically, Warsh is known as an “inflation hawk.” He has famously stated that “inflation is a choice,” arguing that price levels are driven by the decisions of fiscal and monetary authorities rather than just external shocks. While traditionally hawkish, he recently expressed support for interest rate cuts combined with aggressive balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening). This “rate cuts + QT” approach is seen as a pragmatic compromise that aligns with current political desires for lower rates while maintaining long-term price stability. If Warsh is confirmed as Chair in May 2026, his past suggests a strategic reset. He has recently argued that the Fed has “strayed from its remit.” He would likely prioritize shrinking the Fed’s balance sheet more aggressively than Jerome Powell has. He prefers using market signals (like bond yields and commodity prices) to guide interest rates, rather than relying solely on the Fed’s internal economic models, which he believes often fail to predict inflation. Warsh has proposed a specific strategy called “Pragmatic Monetarism” to help manage this burden. His plan focuses on a dual-track approach: shrinking the Fed’s own balance sheet to lower the cost of the debt, rather than just the debt itself. Unlike some who want to raise the inflation target to 3%, Warsh remains a staunch advocate for a strict 2% (or lower) target, viewing price stability as the “North Star” for a healthy economy. Warsh argues that for the last 15 years, the Fed has practiced “fiscal dominance” — essentially keeping interest rates artificially low to make it easier for the government to borrow trillions. He wants to end the “printing press” era. He believes that by stopping the Fed’s massive purchase of government bonds, he can force a clearer separation between the Treasury (which spends) and the Fed (which manages money). This is his most distinctive proposal. He argues that the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet is actually keeping interest rates higher than they need to be. He reasons that if the Fed aggressively sells off its assets in the form of quantitative tightening, it “quiets the printing press.” Warsh believes that a smaller, more disciplined Fed balance sheet reduces inflation expectations so effectively that the Fed can then lower interest rates for households and businesses without causing inflation to spike. Lower interest rates, in turn, reduce the interest expense the government has to pay on that $38 trillion. His current activities include serving as the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in Economics at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. He is a lecturer and Dean’s Visiting Scholar, where he teaches and conducts research on economics and finance. He remains a member of the Board of Directors of UPS and Coupang. He is a partner at Duquesne Family Office LLC, working alongside billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller. He is a member of the Group of Thirty (G30), an international body of leading financiers and academics, and serves on the Panel of Economic Advisers for the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Based on his experience in financial crisis management, his understanding of Wall Street, his communicative skills demonstrated on Capitol Hill and his passion to reign in the $38 trillion debt and drive inflation lower, Kevin Warsh is squarely in the spotlight to be the next Fed Chair. 2 posted on 01/19/2026 8:06:09 PM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Just abolish the Fed and get it over with.

Title: Kevin Hart’s Blacked-Out Ford Looks Straight Out of the ’70s, and Now It Can Be Yours

Learn more By: Ethan Brehm Published: Jan 19, 2026 By: Ethan Brehm Published: Jan 19, 2026 Kevin Hart’s custom 2024 Ford Bronco is headed to auction later this month, and it’s not your typical celebrity restomod. Instead of taking a classic Bronco and modernizing it, Hart did the reverse, buying a brand-new sixth-generation model and having it restyled to look like it rolled off the line in 1971. Working with builder Vintage Modern, he stripped away the modern bodywork and replaced it with custom panels that channel the first-generation Bronco. The one-of-one build goes up for sale at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale auction with no reserve this week. For the exterior transformation, Hart and Vintage Modern swapped the factory panels for custom bodywork that mimics the ’60s- and ’70s-era Bronco, complete with the iconic round headlights, simple horizontal grille, narrow vertical taillights, and indelible orange side markers. Finished in Triple Black with matte accents, it’s paired with a removable soft top and BFGoodrich all-terrain rubber. Under the skin, though, it’s still very much a 2024 Bronco, featuring Ford’s 2.7-liter EcoBoost V6 pushing 330hp and 415lb.ft of torque through a 10-speed automatic. Fox Factory Racing suspension and Roush intake/exhaust round out the performance upgrades. Inside, there are hand-stitched Blackrock leather covers nearly every surface, while “Vintage” script hits the console and wheel. The digital driver display and center touchscreen stay put as well, while a Kenwood audio system handles the sound. All the contemporary safety gear (anti-lock brakes, airbags, crumple zones) remains intact. Ford’s decision to bring back the Bronco in 2021 marked the end of a 25-year absence. The sixth-generation model tapped into decades of pent-up demand for a legitimate Jeep Wrangler rival, offering removable doors and roof panels alongside serious off-road hardware like the HOSS suspension system and up to 11.6″ of ground clearance. Hart’s build takes advantage of that matured platform, using the mechanical stability of a fourth-year production model as the foundation for his retro transformation. Model: 2024 Ford Bronco (Custom) Engine: 2.7L EcoBoost V6 Power: 330 hp; 415 lb-ft torque Transmission: 10-speed automatic Suspension: Fox Factory Racing Intake/Exhaust: Roush Exterior: Triple Black with matte trim Interior: Hand-stitched Blackrock leather Audio: Kenwood system Tires: BFGoodrich all-terrain Edition: One-of-one This one-off 2024 Bronco build crosses the block at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale 2026 auction, running January 17-25, with no reserve. Standard high-trim Broncos can push six figures depending on spec, but Hart’s celebrity provenance and Vintage Modern’s craftsmanship will likely drive the hammer price well beyond that. Kevin Hart’s custom 2024 Ford Bronco is hitting the Barrett-Jackson auction block later this month, and it’s basically a brand-new truck that’s been restyled to look like a first-generation model from the early ’70s. Working with Vintage Modern, Hart kept all the modern performance and tech but swapped the exterior for that classic boxy look.

Title: The plunder of Venezuela is the dead end of history

By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory By Tarik Cyril Amar, a historian from Germany working at Koç University, Istanbul, on Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe, the history of World War II, the cultural Cold War, and the politics of memory As deplored in the Washington Post, Washington’s recent assault on Venezuela wasn’t just your usual US war of aggression/regime change operation but also served to facilitate a particular kind of insider trading. Or rather, betting: On the so-called ‘prediction’ platform Polymarket, a very well-informed investor wagered over $30,000 that Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro would be out of office by the last day of January and – lo and behold! – “walked away with more than $400,000 in profit.” That “prediction” was “timed with such pitch-perfect precision that it drew heavy media scrutiny” as it “bore the hallmarks of insider trading.” You. Don’t. Say. There’s cheating going on at the White House and among its hangers-on! Now, let’s be realistic: Real, existing capitalism – not the Friedrich von Hayek-Milton Friedman fan fiction that still dulls all too many minds – has always been ruthless. Its modern history of about half a millennium includes stupendous scientific, technological, and cultural change, as Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels acknowledged in their Communist Manifesto, parts of which read almost as a panegyric to the bourgeoisie and the capitalist world it made. But that world also began with the vicious impoverishment and exploitation of the masses, the plunder and devastation of whole continents and their original inhabitants, and a brisk international slave trade, vitiating and ending millions of lives. Marxists call this “primitive accumulation”; their master also used the term “original expropriation,” sardonically comparing its role in traditional political economy to man’s fall from divine grace in Christian mythology. After the establishment of first a traditional European great power empire under a radically new management dedicated to Communism in 1917 and then, one World War later, a whole Communist “second world” – centered in but not restricted to Eurasia – the capitalist regimes of the West slowly learned to tread a little more carefully, at least at home. Treating their populations to some reformist rhetoric, very moderate redistribution and unusually rational public spending, for a short moment in history the ruling – and owning – elites of countries such a West Germany and France almost looked as if in search of capitalism-with-a-human face. Even some American presidents weren’t ashamed to promise “progressive” things such as a “new deal” (Roosevelt) and a “great society” (Johnson). After the global neoliberal and right-libertarian surge and the end of most of that rival “second world” several decades ago, capitalism has become more brutally straightforward again everywhere. And not only in terms of the frank contempt its current elites – such as the real-estate billionaire who also runs the US and the BlackRock and Rothschild careerists who are in charge of Germany and France respectively – display for everyone not part of their exclusive, disdainful club. Plunder plain and simple was never gone from the repertory of capitalism, obviously. Just ask the Syrians what has happened to their oil, for instance. More than half a decade ago, in his first term, American buccaneer-in-chief Donald Trump, already had a moment of refreshing candor, openly acknowledging that the US military was in Syria (perfectly illegally under international law, of course) “to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have [in Syria] are taking the oil.” Still, what Washington’s beasts of prey are doing to Venezuela now is an especially glaring example of shamelessness, a fresh peak performance (for now) of American chutzpah. The Trumpists and their media are positively reveling in their own iniquity. The robbing of Venezuela’s resources – what is already taking place and the much bigger plunder gleefully expected for the future – is celebrated in public. And if there is dissent, then only about the profits to be had, their prospective scale and whether they are quite as certain as Trump. (Spoiler alert: not, obviously.) Take the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), for instance, one of the top party organs of the international predator class (next to the likes of The Economist, Financial Times, and Bloomberg). Between the kidnapping of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro – with the killing of over a hundred Venezuelans and Cubans, at least – and the escalating media campaign to prepare for another war of aggression against Iran, the newspaper was busy with assessing the economic impact of future US exploitation of Venezuela’s oil: in essence, will it lower the global oil price? And if so, what does that mean for other oil producers, those in OPEC, but also, crucially, in the US (complicated, actually, with many domestic American oil producers dreading a price drop), for Trump, his Republicans and their domestic standing (the midterms are threatening and affordability remains an issue), and last and probably least, for ordinary Americans? Thankfully, the WSJ has also artlessly drawn attention to a particularly cynical aspect of the Great Venezuelan Oil (and gold, and lithium, and more) Robbery. No, not the insider betting at Polymarket but what it called the “Donroe Trade,” with investors “racing to capitalize on President Trump’s ambitions to dominate the Western Hemisphere,” that is, in less ideological language, on the windfalls from imperialism. There has been a “sharp rally” in Venezuelan debt – a regime change bet already noticed last December – boosting “hedge funds and other investment firms.” And, as good investors are supposed to do, they are also already “eyeing debt in Colombia and Cuba” and preparing for opportunities in Mexico and Greenland, too. Regarding Venezuela again, one firm at least is planning exploratory trips to inspect the loot and is “keeping in touch” with the White House. Venezuelans may have mixed feelings about the same firm having a history of organizing such trips to Ukraine and Syria. And if nothing else makes money, there still is the potentially very lucrative niche of doing business with arbitration claims. In short, the vultures aren’t just circling, they are pouncing. And the good old Wall Street Journal, unsurprisingly, finds all of that quite normal and as it should be. Yet, read another flagship publication of real-existing capitalism, Bloomberg, and you’ll find news that should give Washington’s triumphant pirates of the Caribbean food for thought. Just as enough investors were swarming into the ‘Donroe Trade’ of booty, pillage, and big boisterous promises to merit a lengthy WSJ article, a different kind of boom was taking place centered on a different region of the world: Asia, including China. There, Bloomberg reported, tech and AI stocks were “on a tear.” And this was not just any surge for stocks from Asia. Rather, investors – very much including those from the US – were “betting their momentum and outperformance against US peers will last through” all of 2026. The simple fact that these hopes shape the market mood is more important than the details. Investors are optimistic about Asian semiconductor supply chains, earnings potentials, and cutting-edge technological progress, while feeling worried about American tech and AI stocks’ ability to sustain their “rally after years of outsized gains,” in short, a typical US bubble. In particular, Bloomberg notes, “enthusiasm over [China’s] tech prowess has only grown in the new year.” China – that is, the geopolitical competitor that Washington is most obsessed with, next to Russia. This is a snapshot of a telling moment in history-on-the-move, no more. But take a step back and consider this picture in the round: In Venezuela, the US has – once again – proven its supreme legal and moral nihilism, as well as its ability to brutally beat up much weaker countries. It has also made a special point of letting the world know that the scourging of Caracas is meant as a lesson to frighten Latin America in particular and all of us in general. That on its own may look like a sort of success, or as they say in Washington, “a win.” But in reality, as the American historian Alfred McCoy – certainly no friend of either Russia or China – has observed, America “is an empire in decline.” Its lashing-out and crudely undisguised, even proud pillaging fundamentally reflects weakness, not strength. In the words of Emmanuel Todd, the brilliant French intellectual who correctly predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, and more recently, the “defeat of the West,” America is no longer capable of re-industrializing. It has become too incompetent in actually producing things or training the engineers and workers that can produce those things, even if Trump’s policy of tariffs and protectionism looks as if it is about bringing manufacturing home. What this late-state US is good at is extremely uninhibited violence and “predation,” that is, plain robbery. Ironically, capitalists sense this long-term change with the same acuity they display for the fleeting opportunities to profit from the ransacking of Venezuela. Yet none of this makes a difference to the fact that Washington is losing its grip. It can still inflict great pain and cause terrible destruction, but it cannot offer a vision of international – or, for that matter, domestic – order that attracts anyone who isn’t corrupt, submissive by nature, or witless.

Title: What CFOs Need to Know About the NYSE’s Tokenization Platform

Highlights The New York Stock Exchange has announced plans to develop a regulated platform for trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities. Tokenized equities could cut settlement from T+2 to near-instant, reducing risk and freeing capital, but they clash with existing U.S. securities laws and custody concepts overseen by the SEC. Despite unresolved regulation and industry pushback, growing support from major institutions suggests tokenization may move from experiment to core market infrastructure, leading CFOs to balance innovation with compliance. The digital asset space first wanted to replace the financial system. Now, the blockchain ecosystem is lowering its gaze from that sky-high goal and seeking instead merely to eliminate legacy inefficiencies in payments and capital markets.

Δ And that goal got a shot in the arm on Monday (Jan. 19) with the announcement that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE), is developing a platform for the trading and on-chain settlement of tokenized securities, for which it will seek regulatory approvals. “For more than two centuries, the NYSE has transformed the way markets operate,” said Lynn Martin, president, NYSE Group, in a statement. “We are leading the industry toward fully on-chain solutions, grounded in the unmatched protections and high regulatory standards that position us to marry trust with state-of-the-art technology. Harnessing our expertise to reinvent market infrastructure is how we’ll meet and shape the demands of a digital future.” “Supporting tokenized securities is a pivotal step in ICE’s strategy to operate on-chain market infrastructure for trading, settlement, custody, and capital formation in the new era of global finance,” added Michael Blaugrund, vice president of strategic initiatives at ICE. For enterprise chief financial officers (CFOs) and treasury teams, tokenized equities represent both a strategic opportunity and a regulatory minefield. Unlike cryptocurrencies that function as native digital assets, tokenized equities are digital representations of traditional shares recorded on a blockchain, often with shareholder rights, dividends and governance linked to the underlying securities. But the broader question of how to harmonize centuries-old securities laws with decentralized technologies remains a defining, and as of yet unsolved, challenge for regulators, intermediaries and market participants alike. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue More here: Wall Street Moves On-Chain as Tokenization of US Stocks Goes Global At its essence, tokenization seeks to eliminate legacy inefficiencies in capital markets. Traditional settlement cycles, which are typically T+2 for U.S. equities, embed counterparty, operational and liquidity risks. By contrast, blockchain protocols promise near-instantaneous settlement, reducing counterparty exposure and shortening capital cycles. Tokenized equities, however, simply aren’t regulated by the U.S. At least, not yet. Last month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Trading and Markets Staff took a consequential, if incremental, step toward clarifying how traditional market intermediaries, specifically broker-dealers, should treat crypto asset securities. In the traditional securities world of equities, corporate bond, and registered funds, physical possession has a well-established meaning: either holding certificated securities or, more commonly today, maintaining accounts at centralized clearinghouses or custodians that satisfy regulatory “good control location” criteria. With tokenized securities residing on blockchain networks, however, the concept of physical possession is less tangible. Crypto asset “ownership” is typically defined by control over cryptographic private keys, and there is no centralized registry equivalent to the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) for many digital assets. This disconnect created regulatory uncertainty for broker-dealers that wish to carry tokenized securities on behalf of customers. Without clear interpretive guidance, intermediaries were left to extrapolate from existing frameworks, or to rely on outdated advisory statements that did not fully contemplate modern distributed ledger technology (DLT). PYMNTS covered Wednesday (Jan. 14) how the blockchain-based lender Figure has launched a way for companies to list their equity native on blockchain. The company claimed that its initiative differs from other tokenization efforts in that OPEN equities are blockchain registered, and not a tokenized version of DTCC securities. And we explored the tokenization topic over this past summer in an interview with Brett McLain, head of payments and blockchain at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken. “The tokenization of real-world assets [has] long been a holy grail for crypto … making those real-world assets more accessible globally to consumers,” McLain said. “We want to see that grow into other things like real estate and other tangible assets.” Even BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has gone on record alleging that all assets should be tokenized on a blockchain and tradable online, writing in his 2025 annual shareholder letter: “Every stock, every bond, every fund — every asset — can be tokenized.” See also: Regulators Rewrite How Blockchain Gets Built At the same time, the elephant in the room as it relates to tokenization of equities is the fact that there exists no federal policy framework in the U.S. regulating this emerging asset class. Tokenized equities were among the key reasons why cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase withdrew its support for the Senate Banking Committee’s draft of a market structure bill for digital assets, with the company’s CEO believing that the bill’s text included a “de facto ban” on tokenized equities. But the NYSE’s own decision to move forward with its tokenized securities initiative underscores a broader transformation: tokenization may soon shift from niche experiment to systemic feature of global capital markets, if regulatory approval allows. For CFOs, success will derive from balancing innovation with governance, shaping strategic initiatives that integrate tokenized equities without compromising compliance or market integrity. Global regulatory fragmentation also poses a challenge. While U.S. regulators pursue frameworks under the SEC’s aegis, other jurisdictions may implement divergent rules from permissive regimes to outright prohibitions on token trading, potentially forcing multinationals to adopt segmented strategies tailored to each jurisdiction’s legal environment.

Title: Multiple States Follow Texas in Launching Bitcoin Reserve Initiatives
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2026/01/19/multiple-states-follow-texas-in-launching-bitcoin-reserve-initiatives/
Time Published: 2026-01-19T18:06:33Z
Full Content:
Texas has become the first American state to acquire bitcoin for its public treasury, setting off a nationwide competition as other states rush to establish their own cryptocurrency strategic reserves. CNBC reports that Texas has made history by becoming the first state to purchase bitcoin as part of its public investment strategy, launching what experts are calling a “Reserve Race” among states seeking to position themselves at the forefront of digital asset adoption. The move comes as numerous states across different political alignments pursue legislation to bring cryptocurrencies onto their public balance sheets. The Texas crypto purchase involved approximately five million dollars invested in the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust, one of the largest bitcoin exchange-traded funds that has accumulated over seventy-two billion dollars in assets under management since its January 2024 launch. The state comptroller’s office executed the transaction on November 20, 2025, when bitcoin was trading at approximately ninety-one thousand three hundred thirty-six dollars per coin. With bitcoin trading above ninety-five thousand dollars as of recently, the investment has already shown modest gains. This purchase represents only half of the ten million dollars Texas has allocated for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. State officials have characterized this initial ETF investment as a placeholder measure while they develop the necessary security infrastructure and storage protocols for holding actual bitcoin directly. The legislative framework for the reserve was established through a 2024 law that authorized the state comptroller to hold cryptocurrency. New Hampshire actually preceded Texas in passing crypto strategic reserve legislation, enacting its law last May. The New Hampshire law grants the state treasurer authority to invest up to five percent of state funds in cryptocurrency ETFs, though the authorization also extends to precious metals including gold. Arizona has passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota all have cryptocurrency reserve bills at various stages of committee review and legislative consideration. The trend toward state-level cryptocurrency adoption is not strictly following partisan political lines, despite much of the legislation being primarily sponsored or co-sponsored by Republican lawmakers. The cryptocurrency industry emerged as a major political force during the 2024 election cycle, becoming the largest corporate donor and providing support to candidates from both major parties. The industry is already accumulating resources for the 2026 midterm elections. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, views the state-level initiatives primarily as signaling mechanisms at this stage. According to Marlowe, governors seeking to demonstrate openness to innovative business development in the digital economy find these cryptocurrency measures to be relatively low-cost and low-risk ways to communicate that message. This explains why political leaders across the ideological spectrum and throughout different geographic regions have taken concrete steps in this direction. In states taking more substantial steps, including Texas, Arizona, and Florida, Marlowe noted that acknowledging the growing political influence of cryptocurrency advocates has played a significant role in advancing these initiatives. Common elements across state cryptocurrency initiatives include authorizing state treasurers or other investment officials to allocate limited amounts of public funds to crypto investments and establishing governance structures necessary for managing cryptocurrency holdings. These governance frameworks often involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The funding sources for these reserves vary, with some states using cash while others utilize government-seized cryptocurrency, similar to the federal approach. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a strategic bitcoin reserve at the federal level, though the authorization was limited to seized cryptocurrency to demonstrate that taxpayers would bear no direct financial burden from the initiative. Texas’s emergence as the first state to fund a crypto reserve follows logically from its established position as a cryptocurrency hub, particularly in bitcoin mining operations. The state’s combination of affordable and flexible power infrastructure, along with a generally pro-cryptocurrency political environment, has positioned Texas as a significant player in both the national and global bitcoin mining market in recent years. Beyond strategic reserves, states are integrating cryptocurrency into core financial and budgeting functions. New Hampshire became the first state to approve a bitcoin-backed municipal bond issuance last November. The proposed one hundred million dollar issuance would represent the first time cryptocurrency serves as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. While the transaction has not yet occurred, plans call for completion this year. Read more at CNBC here.

Title: Inequality and unease are rising as elite Davos event opens with pro-business Trump set to attend

By JAMEY KEATEN DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — Corporate chiefs and government leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump swarm into Davos, Switzerland, this week, joining an elite annual meeting that promotes dialogue and economic progress — even as a domineering tone from Washington has upended the global order and billionaires have reaped trillions in new wealth as the poor lag behind. The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of “improving the state of the world,” and this year’s theme is “A spirit of dialogue.” One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees — or at them. Nearly 3,000 attendees from the interlinked worlds of business, advocacy and policy will tackle issues including the growing gap between rich and poor; AI’s impact on jobs; concerns about geo-economic conflict; tariffs that have rocked longstanding trade relationships; and an erosion of trust between communities and countries. “It’s really going to be a discussion at a very important moment … geopolitics is changing,” said Mirek Dušek, a forum managing director in charge of programming. “Some people think we’re in a transition. Some people think we’ve already entered a new era. But I think it’s undeniable that you are seeing a more competitive, more contested landscape.” Trump’s third visit to Davos as president comes as U.S. allies worry about his ambition to take over Greenland, Latin America is grappling with his efforts to reap Venezuela’s oil, and his hardball tactics toward Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have stirred concern among business leaders and lawmakers alike. Trump’s peace-making credentials also will be on the table: An announcement looms about his “ Board of Peace ” for Gaza, and he and his administration are expected to have bilateral meetings in the warren of side rooms at the Congress Center. The U.S. leader seems to revel in strolling through the Davos Congress Center and among executives who back his business-minded, money-making approach to politics. Critics will also be nearby: He’s blown hot and cold recently with Colombian President Gustavo Petro, an invitee; Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi of Iran, whose leaders face U.S. sanctions over their handling of recent protests, was set to speak but organizers on Monday canceled his appearance, saying “the tragic loss of civilian lives” means “it is not right” for the government to be represented. The two likeliest counterweights to Trump’s administration on the international scene — China and the European Union — get top billing on the first day: EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak Tuesday morning, right before Vice Premier He Lifeng, China’s “economic czar” — as Dušek put it. The forum will be without its founder, Klaus Schwab, who hosted the first event in Davos 55 years ago focusing on business, only to see it since balloon into a catchall extravaganza. He stepped down in April. New co-chairs Larry Fink, the head of investment firm BlackRock, and Andre Hoffman, vice chair of pharmaceuticals firm Roche, are in charge. This year will also mark the debut appearance of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, arguably the world’s most important tech leader today, among some 850 CEOs and chairs of global companies – along with celebrities like Hollywood actor and safe-water advocate Matt Damon. The future of AI, its impact on business and work, and the prospects for artificial general intelligence will be key themes. The presidents of Argentina, France, Indonesia, Syria and Ukraine will be among the dozens of national leaders on hand. Leading public-relations firm Edelman reports in its annual trust barometer – launched a quarter-century ago and this year surveying nearly 34,000 people in 28 countries – that trade and recession fears have climbed to an all-time high, optimism is falling especially in developed countries, and “grievance” last year has morphed into broader “insularity.” “People are retreating from dialogue and compromise, choosing the safety of the familiar over the perceived risk of change,” said CEO Richard Edelman. “We favor nationalism over global connection and individual gain over joint progress. Our mentality has shifted from ‘we’ to ‘me’.” The survey found that about two-thirds of respondents said their trust was concentrated toward CEOs of the companies that they work for, fellow citizens or neighbors, while nearly 70% believed institutional leaders — such as from business or government — deliberately mislead the public. Oxfam, the world-renowned advocacy group, issued a report which showed that billionaire wealth rose by more than 16% last year, three times faster than the past five-year average, to more than $18 trillion. It drew on Forbes magazine data on the world’s richest people. Oxfam said the $2.5 trillion rise in the wealth of billionaires last year would be enough to eradicate extreme poverty 26 times over. Their wealth has risen by more than four-fifths since 2020, while nearly half the world’s population lives in poverty, the group said. The Trump administration has led a “pro-billionaire agenda,” the group said, through actions such as slashing taxes for the wealthiest, fostering the growth of AI-related stocks that help rich investors get richer, and thwarting efforts to tax giant companies. The advocacy group wants more national efforts to reduce inequality, higher taxes on the ultra-rich to reduce their power, and greater limits on their ability to shape policy through lobbying. With such concerns filtering through to policymakers, Trump, who is leading the biggest-ever U.S. delegation and will have about a half-dozen Cabinet secretaries in tow, is expected to discuss housing and affordability in his Davos speech on Wednesday. As usual, protesters rallied over the weekend in and near Davos ahead of the event. Hundreds of marchers scaled an Alpine road up to the town on Saturday behind a banner in German that read “No Profit from War” and alongside a truck that bore a sign: World Economic Failure. Companies like Microsoft, India’s Tata Consultancy, social media titan TikTok and cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike joined governments from countries like Nigeria, Qatar, Ukraine and the United States — a USA House is making a debut this year — to set up shop on the Davos Promenade to promote their services, products and national economies. Davos storekeepers rent out their premises so that forum participants can have the prime real estate for the week. Critics have long accused the annual meeting of generating more rhetoric than results, and they see Trump’s return as sign of the disconnect between haves and have-nots. Some say Swiss leaders who support the event and flock to Davos too are adding to the problem. “It is worrying how Swiss politicians are courting warmongers and their profiteers in Davos,” said Mirjam Hostetmann, president of Switzerland’s Young Socialists, who have led protests against the event. “The WEF will never bring peace, but will only fuel escalation.” AP World Economic Forum: https://apnews.com/hub/world-economic-forum

The World Economic Forum, the think tank whose four-day annual meeting opens Tuesday, has a stated motto of "improving the state of the world," and this year's theme is "A spirit of dialogue." One question is whether Trump will speak with attendees - or at them.

Title: Here Lies the Liberal World Order: 1945-2025

Back in 1989, renowned political scientist Francis Fukuyama got a little bit over his skis, as they say, when he enthusiastically welcomed in a new (and emphatically final) geopolitical epoch, audaciously dubbed the “End of History.” To read this article in the following languages, click the Translate Website button below the author’s name. Русский, Español, 中文, Portugues, Français, عربي, Hebrew, Deutsch, Farsi, Italiano, 日本語, 한국어, Türkçe, Српски. And 40 more languages. From “The End of History?,” 1989: “The twentieth century saw the developed world descend into a paroxysm of ideological violence, as liberalism contended first with the remnants of absolutism, then bolshevism and fascism, and finally an updated Marxism that threatened to lead to the ultimate apocalypse of nuclear war. But the century that began full of self-confidence in the ultimate triumph of Western liberal democracy seems at its close to be returning full circle to where it started: not to an “end of ideology” or a convergence between capitalism and socialism, as earlier predicted, but to an unabashed victory of economic and political liberalism. The triumph of the West, of the Western idea, is evident first of all in the total exhaustion of viable systematic alternatives to Western liberalism. In the past decade, there have been unmistakable changes in the intellectual climate of the world’s two largest communist countries, and the beginnings of significant reform movements in both. But this phenomenon extends beyond high politics and it can be seen also in the ineluctable spread of consumerist Western culture in such diverse contexts as the peasants’ markets and color television sets now omnipresent throughout China, the cooperative restaurants and clothing stores opened in the past year in Moscow, the Beethoven piped into Japanese department stores, and the rock music enjoyed alike in Prague, Rangoon, and Tehran. What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history as such: that is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.” Liberalism today, liberalism tomorrow, liberalism forever! to paraphrase notorious Alabama segregationist George Wallace. In chronological context, it was an understandable misapprehension that afflicted Fukuyama and clouded his crystal ball; in 1989, getting high on the liberal order supply was easy. No serious ideological rivals to liberalism existed any longer at the international level; the liberal order, with the United States at the head, exercised global hegemony; everybody the world over wanted a pair of blue jeans and a Chevy Corvette and a hot blonde on their arm and all of the glorious excesses of liberal capitalism. Alas, the utopian “End of History,” ironically, didn’t last long; by 2026, universalist liberalism has now reached what very much looks like the end of the line a mere three and a half decades since Fukuyama declared it the “final form of human government.” So-called “international law,” which underpins the global liberal order, has always been heavier on the aspiration and lighter on the actual, existing in a nether-region between theory and practicality, applied and adhered to erratically and arbitrarily — with no consequences for those who violate it, provided they have the military power to thwart attempts at accountability. Lots of examples abound, but a prime one, which has received relatively little attention with the heavy media focus on Latin America and the Middle East, was Xi Jinping announcing in his New Year’s address that the forced “reunification” of Taiwan into the budding Sino Empire is “unstoppable” — a barely veiled flouting of the international powers that would threaten to oppose such a move militarily. (I predict China will pull the trigger on the kinetic invasion before the end of the year if it can’t submit Taiwan through economic or political pressure under threat of military action — the latter approach it would prefer for reasons of optics and because Taiwan is ethnically Chinese, likely tempering the bloodlust as the Chinese view the Taiwanese as their kin.) While China has long signaled its intent to reclaim Taiwan, which it lost in the middle of the last century as the last stronghold of the nationalists fighting the CCP, Xi would not have offered such direct talk just a year ago. Yet, inch by inch, as the liberal order loses its grip on geopolitics, with it goes the diplomatic imperative to couch rhetoric in terms in keeping with international law. In the same vein, Trump has more or less openly admitted that the political, economic and, military pressure applied to Venezuela, including the capture of its president, is about regional hegemony and natural resources: “We are going to have our very large United States oil companies go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken oil infrastructure and start making money for the country,” he said. The Western hemisphere “belongs to us,” the mantra has gone of late. (“Us” meaning, ostensibly, the United States and the citizens thereof, although I don’t feel it belongs to me as an American citizen quite as much as it will soon belong to Blackrock, Palantir, and Chevron.) In a way, the Venezuela rhetoric is much more honest than the obviously insincere 2003-era talk of delivering “democracy” to Iraq, Afghanistan, et al. Those countries were never going to adopt “democracy” even if the United States government insisted on it — which, despite the nonstop lip service, it didn’t anyway because it didn’t care much for constitutional republicanism at home, let alone abroad. Nonetheless, liberal etiquette required the lie to maintain the façade that the world runs on democratic values. So what will replace international liberalism? Something, probably, on the order of multipolar realism — again, much less idealistic yet much more honest in a world that hitherto has functioned on pretty lies. Via Independent Institute (emphasis added): “Realism is one of the prominent international relations theories for explaining the behavior of states. The core essence of realism is an attempt to explain “world politics as they really are, rather than describe how they ought to be,” presenting the world as a state of anarchy where nations, acting as unitary rational actors, compete with each other to maximize their power, “the only—variable of interest.” Realism is often juxtaposed with liberalism, the belief that the “national characteristics of individual States matter for their international relations” and that it is possible for different types of regimes to operate in different ways, such as Kant’s theory of democratic peace. Liberal “institutionalism,” the ideology on which diplomats in the West are brought up, is the belief that “international institutions facilitate cooperation and peace among countries.” The difference between these schools of thought can be understood through their perspectives on international institutions. While liberals assume that organizations like the United Nations are a genuine platform for international cooperation, realists assume that these institutions do very little to prevent states from pursuing their interests and can very often serve as a vector through which state interests are pursued.” * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Monsters of the Deep

Minneapolis, the sucking chest wound on America’s body politic, gets a break this week from Gawda’mighty, who is turning the heat down to subzero so that ICE-Watch nose-rings can hole-up in their Soros-paid motels, play League of Legends with their DoorDashed Chick-fil-A nuggets, and rest up for the next inning of their motley revolution. ICE itself might even have to lay off its daily round-up of rapists, cut-throats, and child-molesters, to wait out the cold-snap. Meanwhile, things elsewhere roughen up a little. For instance: Davos, Switzerland, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) holds its annual jamboree of vampire squids. Klaus Schwab is out, by the way. He skulked off in a malodorous cloud of embezzlement and sexual irregularities, to be replaced by Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, the hedge fund that owns everything in the USA and wants more. Larry Fink is living proof of the banality of evil, an early pioneer of mortgage-backed securities, which nearly blew up the global banking system in 2008-09, after which he pioneered the wholesale purchasing of foreclosed houses by hedge funds. Neat trick. Cornered the market on all the inventory, so, now, nobody under age-fifty in America can afford to buy a house — but you can rent one from BlackRock! Larry Fink landed as interim head of the WEF largely because BlackRock has been espousing Klaus Schwab’s ideas about “Stakeholder Capitalism,” which allows global corporations to pretend that they have beneficent “societal purpose” while they go about ass-raping the common folk of Western Civ. Climate change and green new deals top that agenda, along with diversity, equity, and inclusion and additional bullshit about “environment, social, and governance factors” (ESG) in its global strategies portfolio — meaning, mandates for exactly the kind of policies that are destroying Europe’s economies, de-industrialization foremost.

This blog is sponsored this week by Vaulted, an online mobile web app for investing in allocated and deliverable physical gold. To learn more visit: Vaulted.com Among the invited speakers at Davos this year: one US President Donald Trump. He is going to kill them with kindness, a tongue-bath of Trumpian compliments — you are the greatest. . . beautiful leaders like the world has never seen before — while he artfully inserts a stiletto in the WEF’s liver. You might not even know that the org is a walking corpse until a few weeks after the Davos meeting shuts down. But Mr. Trump is going to terminate its influence and send a message that the era of globalist shenanigans is over. The president can point to two demonstration projects. First, the USA’s acquisition of Greenland one way or another, either ownership or some leasing agreement or revised treaty arrangement. You can be sure that the EU does not like that — big bully America picking on cuddly little Denmark, “the world’s happiest country.” But since they are happily oblivious to Greenland’s strategic importance (vis-a-vis China’s nefarious ambitions there) it is up to America to prepare the game-board. The art of the deal, of course, is making it fait accompli before the targeted property-owner has even entered the discussion. How that works will be a painful discovery for the walking dead Davosanistas. The second demo will be how the recent arrest of Nicolás Maduro leads to revelations of the globalist conspiracy to interfere in elections here, there, and everywhere. Señor Maduro sold his Smartmatic system to all comers, and you can bet that the plea bargain talks are already underway in Brooklyn (if not already concluded). Yes, it is our old friend, the Kraken, which is a related species of giant squid to the vampire variety convened in Davos. This election fraud business is really consequential. It redounds to the criminality of the Democratic Party that had the impudence to jam an enfeebled marionette, “Joe Biden,” into the Oval Office, allowing a treasonous cabal of nihilists to nearly wreck the country. The massive evidence of that crime was clumsily suppressed by the cabal and its allies in the news business. But it is surfacing again, now with Señor Maduro’s imprimatur, and it will turn into a force five storm off the coast of Florida as grand juries in Fort Pierce and Fort Lauderdale were empaneled a week ago to consider the myriad lawless operations mounted against Mr. Trump since 2015, including election fraud. The lawless are going to be rounded up, from Raffensperger in Georgia, to Katie Hobbs in Arizona, to Jocelyn Benson in Michigan, to Jena Griswold in Colorado, to dozens of other officials who were in on the big vote switcheroo of Nov. 3, 2020. And when the revelations finally come, it will be too much for the foot-dragging villains in the US Senate to continue resisting — they will have to pass the SAVE Act or some legislation like it that requires voter ID, one election day, and paper ballots counted by humans, not machines. It remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party goes extinct because of its exposed, widespread criminality, or because it simply can’t win an election without massive ballot fraud.

Gallery 17 — Paintings from the 2025 Season. Have a look! (Click here!) A call for unity and grace from the mountains high, to the wave crashed coasts: "The person down the street who votes differently than you is not your enemy. They are your neighbor. They worry about the same things you worry about. They want their kids to be safe and their bills to be paid and their country to be a place worth living in. They have been manipulated just like you have been manipulated, fed a different flavor of the same poison, sorted into a different tribe by the same algorithm, pointed at you as the enemy by the same people who point you at them. The working class Republican and the working class Democrat have more in common with each other than either of them has with the billionaire class that funds both parties. You share the same struggles. You face the same rigged systems. You are being crushed by the same economic forces that have transferred more wealth upward in the last fifty years than at any point in human history. And instead of uniting against the people doing this to you, you are screaming at each other on the internet about pronouns and flags and whatever fresh outrage the algorithm served up this morning. This is exactly what they want. A nation at war with itself cannot resist a takeover. A people consumed by mutual hatred will accept any authority that promises to protect them from the manufactured enemy. Every empire that fell was divided before it was conquered. Every free people who lost their freedom were set against each other first. The red versus blue war is not real. It is a show put on by people who own both teams. It is professional wrestling and you think it is a real fight. The wrestlers go backstage after the match and laugh together while you are still screaming at the guy in the other section who was rooting for the wrong character. This Is Our Country Not Theirs This nation belongs to the people who live here and work here and raise families here and will be buried here. It does not belong to billionaires who hold citizenship in three countries and will flee to their bunkers the moment things get bad. It does not belong to tech oligarchs who view democracy as an obstacle to efficiency. It does not belong to foreign interests who have purchased so much influence that they might as well be writing our laws themselves. We have to stop letting them divide us. We have to start seeing each other as fellow Americans again instead of enemy combatants in a culture war that was manufactured to keep us weak. We have to remember that the person screaming at us online is also a victim of the same manipulation, and maybe if we stopped screaming back and started talking, we might realize we have been fighting the wrong enemy this entire time. Turn off the television. It is not informing you. It is programming you. Question everything, including the sources you trust, especially the sources you trust. Talk to people who disagree with you and do it without trying to win. Listen to why they believe what they believe. You might discover that the monster you have been told to hate is actually just another person trying to make sense of a confusing world with imperfect information, exactly like you. Remember who you are. You are an American. Your ancestors came to this land or were brought to this land or were already on this land, and regardless of how they got here, they built something together that was supposed to be different from the old world’s tyrannies and aristocracies. That project is not finished. Every generation has to fight to keep it alive against the forces that want to drag us back to a world where a handful of rulers own everything and everyone else serves at their pleasure. Stop letting them divide you. Your enemies are not your neighbors. Your enemies are the people who profit from your division and are building machines to replace you the moment you are no longer useful. Start acting like it before it is too late". —The Wise Wolf "We must learn to live together as brothers, or we will perish together as fools."
