Valerie Urbain, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear, commented: "2024 was a year of record financial performance, underpinned by our increasingly diversified business model and driven by strong business income and sustained interest income. Our strategy and new management structure puts clients at the centre of our plans, and we continue to make progress against our key objectives. In 2024, we grew our funds business and European presence through the announced acquisition of Inversis in Spain. We also continue to support market adoption of digital assets by attracting new issuances on our D-SI platform while participating in important projects with industry partners to drive innovation across European post-trade. Our core activities continue to thrive. We have reached record levels in settlement and safekeeping activities, with assets under custody closing the year over the €40 trillion mark. The outstanding of Euroclear's Collateral Highway is now close to €2 trillion, while the funds depot also hit a new high of 3.6 trillion." Business performance The key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period. FY 2023 FY 2024 YoY evolution 3-year CAGR Assets under custody €37.7 trillion €40.7 trillion +8 % +3 % Number of transactions 299 million 331 million +10 % +4 % Turnover €1,072 trillion €1,162 trillion +8 % +5 % Fund assets under custody €3.1 trillion €3.6 trillion +16 % +4 % Collateral Highway €1.67 trillion €1.9 trillion +15 % +1 % Underlying cash deposits (full year average) €23.7 billion €22.8 billion -4 % +3 % Euroclear's assets under custody reached a record €40.7 trillion, growing for the ninth quarter in a row, thanks to solid stock exchange performances and robust results in fixed income. Settlement volumes hit a new high due to sustained activity throughout the year. Boosted by the ETF activity, combined with the rise in equity markets, fund assets under custody reached the record level of €3.6 trillion. The Collateral Highway's outstanding continues to increase and is now close to its prior peak level. Business milestones Advancing the funds business Over the past years, Euroclear's funds offering has evolved rapidly thanks to acquisitions such as MFEX in 2021 and Goji in 2023. In 2024, major clients in Asia, Europe and the US, including Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat Luxembourg (Spuerkeess), Blackrock, China Construction Bank (Asia), DBS Bank or ODDO BHF have selected Euroclear FundsPlace for the onboarding of their investment funds. Euroclear provides them with a one-stop-shop solution for fund distribution and execution services via its extensive network, allowing their clients to have access to more than 250,000 funds. In 2024, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in IZNES, a pan-European funds marketplace based on blockchain technology. This partnership complements Euroclear's funds services in the French market and beyond as it continues to play an active role in the development of innovative funds distribution models. In July 2024, Euroclear announced the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis, a leading provider of global investment technology solutions and outsourced financial services with the intention to become the full owner of the Spanish company by end 2027. By acquiring Inversis, Euroclear aims to accelerate the delivery of its funds strategy and increase its pan-European coverage thanks to Inversis' significant presence on the Spanish market. In Asia, Euroclear acquired a strategic stake in Marketnode, a Singapore-based digital market infrastructure operator. By joining forces with Marketnode, Euroclear aims to participate in the setup of a key market infrastructure in Asia-Pacific designed to simplify the management of fund flows and reduce settlement times by using DLT technology. Reshaping traditional financial services Euroclear has an important role to play in bridging the gap between digital asset securities and the conventional financial landscape. In 2024, Euroclear made significant progress to become a digital, data-enabled Financial Market Infrastructure by welcoming the Digital Native Note (DNN) issued by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on its Digital Securities Issuance (D-SI) platform. This marks the first of such digital issuance in USD for Euroclear and the first by an Asia-based issuer on its platform. Euroclear is also actively engaged in exploring the full potential of digital assets and participates in various DLT projects with market partners. Alongside Digital Asset and The World Gold Council, it successfully completed a groundbreaking pilot to tokenise gold, Gilts and Eurobonds for collateral management. With the support of Paris Europlace, Euroclear worked with a group of French banks around its D-SI platform and Banque de France's DL3S platform for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to issue the first Digitally Native Note (DNN) under French law and settled it in CBDC. Streamlined management structure Following the appointment of Valérie Urbain as CEO of the group, Euroclear redesigned the structure and composition of its top management team to accelerate strategy execution. A new, expanded Executive Committee composed of eight members ensures the representation of all the group's constituents in all key strategic decisions and a stronger focus on clients, business operations and people – both in Europe and internationally. Launch of the Euroclear Foundation to amplify social impact Euroclear aims to make a significant positive social impact in the locations where it operates. By establishing the Euroclear Foundation, Euroclear will seek to improve lives and support the next generation by working to eliminate pressing social and environmental issues. The Euroclear Foundation builds on the company's existing initiatives aimed at increasing its social impact. These include a group-wide volunteering programme, long-term community partnerships and a Matching Gift programme to match employee donations. Russian sanctions impacts Financial impacts of the Russian assets Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore, well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business. As a result of the sanctions, blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of December 2024, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €212 billion, of which €183 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets. In line with Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In 2024, interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €6.9 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax, these earnings generated €1.7 billion tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such, future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment. Effective 15 February 2024, the EU Council adopted a Regulation requiring Central Securities Depositories (CSDs) holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia with a total value of more than €1 million to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These CSDs, such as Euroclear Bank, should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities, should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders). In May 2024, the European Commission has adopted a new regulation about a windfall contribution applicable to CSDs holding Russian Central Bank assets with a total value of more than €1 million. The profits generated by the reinvestment of these sanctioned amounts dating from 15 February 2024 onwards are required to be contributed to the European Fund for Ukraine. After retention of a 10% share of the windfall contribution to comply with capital and risk management requirements, Euroclear made a first payment of approx. €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024. A second payment is expected to take place in March 2025 and should amount to approx. €2 billion. Issued on 16 December 2024, the 15th EU sanctions package against Russia included a loss recovery mechanism which allows for the release of cash balances held by European CSDs under certain conditions. This derogation will enable CSDs to request competent authorities to unfreeze cash balances and use them to meet their legal obligations with their clients. Euroclear continues to act prudently and to strengthen its capital by retaining the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal, financial, and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients, while complying with its obligations. As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures, Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order, Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books, by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear Bank and Euroclear Holding are the two group issuing entities. The full year 2024 summary income statements and financial positions for both entities are shown below. The drop in FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the booking of the windfall contribution related to the Central Bank of Russia's (CBR) assets dating from 15 February 2024. The evolution of FY2024 figures compared to FY2023 reflects the increase in intragroup dividend. Euroclear group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

Title: South Dublin soccer club blaming council policy shift for sidelining 20-year clubhouse campaign
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2025/02/04/south-dublin-soccer-club-blaming-council-policy-shift-for-sidelining-20-year-clubhouse-campaign/
Time Published: 2025-02-05T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
A 20-year campaign by a football club in south Co Dublin to get itself a new clubhouse is set to rumble on after it deferred its latest bid for planning permission having been told by local council officials it would not be successful. It is two decades since what is now Sallynoggin Pearse first approached Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council intending to replace its old and deteriorating clubhouse, its officials say. At the time, the local authority said its preference was to relocate the club around the corner from Pearse Park to Sallynoggin Park where they would be given access to a new facility which was then in the planning stage. Planning permission was subsequently obtained in 2007 but the project never went ahead and the then Pearse Rovers stayed where they were. By 2018 relocating the club became a priority when its existing clubhouse was vandalised. After the council initially said again it would build a new clubhouse in Sallynoggin Park if the club gave up its legal claim to a pitch a local land owner had allowed them to start using almost 50 years earlier, a deal was eventually agreed based on the club funding construction and the council proving the long term lease required to secure grants and loans once the project was in train. Since then, club chairman Richie Cummins says the club has deferred making of planning applications three times at the council’s suggestion. And it was told at a meeting in November the local authority would not now be honouring its commitment to the long-term lease. “The pre-planning stuff was all positive,” he says. “We are meeting the criteria for mixed-use facilities, not-for-profit groups sharing the facilities with sports groups. We’re ticking all the boxes. There is no issue with the building, no issue with the location of the building. So, we’re at a loss as to what the big issue is here.” Sallynoggin Pearse, the product of a 2010 merger between Pearse Rovers, where Paul McGrath played as a teenager (the hope is to name the clubhouse in his honour), and Sallynoggin Celtic, is a relatively small club. It has just two adult men’s teams, although Cummins makes the point it used to be much bigger and could grow again if it had more certainty over its future facilities. What it has done, however, is form a partnership with Granada FC, which has 90 teams and 1,500 young players. It hopes to use the new clubhouse along with a boxing club and kick-boxing club. Dublin Fire Brigade sports club are interested, a local gardening group would like to use it, and there is talk of a dancing club too. “It’s not just football,” says Cummins. “There’d be other groups using it which is important. The crime prevention officer from Dún Laoghaire said our current building (a 40ft shipping container) was vandalised and the previous building was vandalised because of not being used enough. But the council have used it as another excuse not to support us, saying we are looking for a community centre rather than a sports facility. We have never used that term but we do want something that is of benefit to the community.” He gives a vivid account of dealing with council officialdom, with everything — people, policies, allocated plots of land and pitch allocations — shifting over time. At one point, he and fellow club committee members Shane O’Brien and Paul Bishop say it was suggested they get a solicitor’s letter written to inject urgency into the council’s position — only for the official who had suggested it to stop engaging because they had “gone legal”. The council’s current offer is a vandal proof prefab which, the club was told, would cost more than €200,000 but contain just two dressingrooms and no showers. “Are you really expecting teenage girls to share that with either teenage boys or men?,” asks Granada chairman Ciarán Kane, who says wider frustration with the council over facilities and pitches in particular, has prompted clubs across the area to set aside their rivalries to co-ordinate their campaign for improvements. The lack of joined-up thinking, he says, is also evident in his own club’s home facility in Blackrock which, he says, they are delighted to have but which they have been told they should not make available to community groups during weekdays when it is underutilised. Sallynoggin Pearse might settle for that but instead find themselves frustrated by a shift in council policy which, says Cummins, involves a move away from granting long-term leases to clubs. He cites a recent example of that happening to another club. “We’re not asking them for a penny,” he says. “Just that they honour the commitment they gave us when we gave up our claim to a pitch they wanted. They are creating a situation here where nobody can trust them.” The club has, he says, widespread support among councillors and local TD Richard Boyd Barrett describes the council’s treatment of the club as “shameful” and “inexplicable”. “You would think they would be encouraging projects like this but instead they are putting obstacles in their way. It’s hard to understand, but it’s not unique, I’m not exaggerating when I say I am inundated with clubs in the area raising issues over facilities, pitches and particularly all-weather pitches,” said the People Before Profit–Solidarity TD. Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council did not respond to requests for comment. Emmet Malone is Work Correspondent at The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Dublin 8 build-to-rent scheme readies €80m sale

Strong interest is expected in the upcoming forward purchase sale of 18 Newmarket Square, one of the few build-to-rent developments expected to come to market this year. It’s understood the development of more than 130 apartments in the Liberties in Dublin 8, which is still under construction, will be brought to the market by CBRE in the first quarter of this year at an asking price of about €80 million. 18 Newmarket Square, which is expected to complete around September of this year, was developed by Revelate Capital, an Irish specialist private equity real estate business, along with Valpre Capital, a London-based private equity real estate investment firm and a UBS-owned real estate platform, Aventicum Real Estate. It is located around a 10-minute walk from St Stephen’s Green and amenities are expected to include a co-working lounge, communal rooftop gardens and a landscaped courtyard, as well as about 500sq m of retail space. The Liberties development is not the only deal of scale coming to the market this year; the sale of a large city centre asset is also due to be announced, with an asking price expected to be in the region of €180 million. Last year residential transactions remained low, at about €466 million – the largest deal was the €150 million sale of the Point Campus student accommodation by German asset manager DWS. It was acquired by US fund Greystar. Developers say issues such as the rent cap, which is up for review at the end of the year, is a factor in the lack of new private rented sector developments. Other residential developments expected to complete this year include Marlet’s Claremont development of more than 500 units in Howth, north Dublin, and Lioncor’s development at Alta Verde in Blackrock, in the south of the city.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Reuters) -Blackrock plans to hire nearly 1,200 people to expand its two support hubs in India, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The world's largest asset manager wants to build out its artificial intelligence capabilities in India with the expansion, the report added. The iHubs, as the centers are known, are in the country's financial hub Mumbai and Gurugram, which is near the national capital New Delhi. The new hires will increase total headcount to roughly 3,500 in the two cities, and include more engineers and data experts, according to the report. Blackrock is also inheriting a so-called global capabilities center in India's IT hub Bengaluru, through its proposed deal to acquire data provider Preqin, Bloomberg reported. That center will have roughly 1,500 staff members. Blackrock did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Title: This quiet college hamlet has been named named the next boomtown in America
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/real-estate/this-is-the-biggest-boomtown-in-america/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T21:44:24Z
Full Content:
A town just 15 miles west of Boston has officially been named Massachusetts’ biggest boomtown, proving that rapid growth and prosperity aren’t just reserved for the state’s major cities. Wellesley, best known for its prestigious women’s liberal arts college Wellesley College, has emerged as the Bay State’s fastest-growing community, with residents raking in an average income of at least $110,000. The town’s rapid ascent to the top was confirmed by a recent ranking from GoBankingRates, which analyzed economic expansion, population growth and housing market trends. This designation marks a shift in the state’s economic landscape, as Worcester, a central Massachusetts city, held the title just two years ago. So what’s behind Wellesley’s meteoric rise? The town’s upward trajectory didn’t happen overnight. Wellesley has long been a haven for affluence, with stately homes and meticulously landscaped properties dotting its tree-lined streets. By 1880, the town was already flourishing, introducing its first newspaper, bank and telephone service as its population surged. Local leaders ensured that progress remained steady, embracing modern conveniences early on. “The citizens of the town of Wellesley, both collectively and individually, are constantly endeavoring to obtain for their town, their homes and themselves all that is best from Nature and Art,” an article from 1906 declared. Even before the turn of the 20th century, Wellesley boasted a thriving railroad network, Massachusetts’ first golf course, a robust water system and a slew of town improvement initiatives. By the 1920s, it had already solidified its status as one of Greater Boston’s premier suburban enclaves. Wellesley’s population has steadily increased, growing 3.4% since 2014 to reach 29,862 residents. Housing demand has followed suit — occupied housing units have risen by 4%, while owner-occupied homes have seen a 6.1% uptick. But the real jaw-dropper is the town’s per-capita income, which has skyrocketed by 35.8%, now sitting at a minimum of $111,690. This economic boom has been largely fueled by Wellesley’s exceptional public school system, consistently ranked among the top 10 in Massachusetts. Families flock to the town for its educational excellence, as well as its proximity to elite private schools Of course, no discussion of Wellesley’s success is complete without mentioning Wellesley College, a globally recognized institution that has produced some of the most influential women in history. For nearly 150 years, the school has educated trailblazers across politics, media, finance and science. “Pioneering scientists, environmental revolutionaries, US secretaries of state, civil rights activists, investment trailblazers, network news producers and genre-defying activists” have all walked its halls, according to the college’s website. Among its most distinguished alumni are Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton, Diane Sawyer and BlackRock co-founder — and business-world titan — Susan Wagner. Others, like Winifred Edgerton Merrill — the first woman in the US to earn a PhD in mathematics — and Eleanor Raymond, the architect behind the nation’s first solar-powered home, have made history in their respective fields. With prosperity comes exclusivity, and Wellesley’s real estate market reflects its elite status. As of January, the median home price in town stood at a staggering $1.97 million, according to Building A Better Wellesley. Despite its modern wealth, the town’s character has remained largely unchanged since the early 20th century. A quote from over a century ago still rings true today: “Fine old trees line the roads; handsome buildings have been erected for the public schools; even the railroad stations are objects of beauty … Wellesley, a residential village with no manufacturing, has long been noted for its pure water and invigorating air.” Advertisement

Title: Shayne Bolton’s arrival in Ireland squad could give UK press a fit of the vapours
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/04/shayne-boltons-arrival-in-ireland-squad-could-give-uk-press-a-fit-of-the-vapours/

Readers of UK Sunday papers might have thought this week that it was a case of right-back-at-ya from Irish rugby. The pithy observation of Sunday Times rugby correspondent Stephen Jones that Ireland “thrived on the needle-sharp incisiveness of Jamison Gibson-Park at scrumhalf, James Lowe on the wing, Mack Hansen on the other wing, Bundee Aki in midfield – and they were also well served by the odd Irish-born player” was met with this week’s announcement that Connacht’s Shayne Bolton and Munster’s Tom Ahern were to come in to the Irish squad. The truth is that the remark and the pair’s arrival into the Irish camp was a coincidence. But it has played out sweetly as Bolton, coming in for the injured Hansen, is an Irish-qualified player who was born in Pretoria, South Africa. It is not Bolton’s first breath of the thin air of a national squad. He was included by Simon Easterby in last year’s Emerging Ireland squad, only for an injury in the 33rd minute of Connacht’s opening URC game against Munster in Thomond Park to force him out of that tour. Irish-qualified through his grandmother, Bolton has been with Connacht since 2021 and last March signed a contract that would keep him in Galway for two more years until 2026. In November, Connacht coach Pete Wilkins spoke of the qualities that have made him a favourite in Dexcom Stadium. [ Shayne Bolton’s journey from South Africa can see him flourish with ConnachtOpens in new window ] “We’re delighted with the progress Shayne has made this season, and he is rightly establishing himself in the team as a fast and powerful option on the wing,” he said. “I am excited about his potential for further development over the next two years and he is another great example of the type of player that our supporters are so excited to watch and get behind.” Wilkins might have added that lightning pace also comes with the 24-year-old. Far from being a rangy winger, Bolton arrives compact at about 100kg and strong enough to also play in the centre. He joins that subset of players in the Irish squad that can seamlessly move around positions, as Garry Ringrose did last weekend against England. Ringrose switched from 13 to the wing when Hansen went off in the first half and reverted to the outside centre when the Australian-born winger returned. The move will probably excite a lot of people and even if it is only for a few days, it will be seen as an opportunity for Bolton to pick up the mood and character of life in the Irish camp. He was contacted initially in South Africa by Andy Friend, who was then the Connacht head coach. Friend knew the then 20-year-old was Irish qualified and that the pursuit of his dream to play professional rugby was greater than his desire to stay in college. In an interview in this paper last year, Bolton described how he left South Africa for the first time to travel alone to a country he didn’t know much about. It was during the Covid pandemic of 2020, and the aeroplane was ghostly empty. He had a row of seats to himself and everyone on board was wearing a protective mask, so there were zero conversations. When he arrived, the warm Irish welcome was quarantine for 14 days in a hotel in Dublin because he was arriving from a red-listed country. At the time countries were listed as green, amber or red, with different safety protocols around each colour. The youngest of five children, Bolton was offered bursaries and scholarships but because his parents did not want to send him away to boarding school, he went to one close to where he lived. He played age-grade rugby for the Bulls at under-16 and under-18 and was in the Cheetahs academy for two years. However, he was denied an extension with the Bloemfontein franchise, although continued to play for the University of the Free State in the Varsity Cup. [ Connacht sign Irish-qualified South African prodigy Shayne BoltonOpens in new window ] In hindsight, timing was good, and it was when he was playing college rugby that the phone call arrived from Friend. “I’m very close to my gran,” he said in November. “She lives close by to my parents in South Africa, and I saw her every Sunday or every second Sunday, and I was always aware that my family comes from here. Her parents died when she was young in a car crash, so she was sent to England for a couple of years and then to Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where she spent most of her life.” Gran is Noreen Stapleton, who originally came from the Dublin suburb of Blackrock. She can be proud that her grandson has already been charming people with his Irish accent. “We plucked him out of a backwater in South Africa and saw him as a project,” Wilkins told RTÉ. “It was a bit of experimentation, trying him as that power winger on the right wing and he’s just thrived on it, getting his hands on the ball and a bit more space around him. “So, there’s more to come from him. I think there’s incredible explosiveness and just a real confidence about him when he’s got the ball in hand.” Given this week, prophetic words.

Title: 'New toys' are back on the menu at Apollo as it looks to M&A to grow
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/apollo-marc-rowan-acquisition-plans-argo-lending-4q-earnings-call-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-04T18:11:18Z
Full Content:
One of Marc Rowan's favorite refrains as CEO of Apollo has been "no new toys." So central has been this philosophy of focusing on execution instead of growing through M&A or new initiatives that it was the theme of the firm's 2023 holiday video. That time has now passed, Rowan suggested on the firm's 2024 year-end earnings call. Pointing to the firm's acquisition last month of Argo Infrastructure Partners, a $6 billion assets-under-management firm with a track record of infrastructure investments, Rowan said the firm plans to acquire companies that stand to help expand Apollo's lending capabilities. "You should expect us to continue to do modest M&A along the same lines where we are quite focused on increasing our capacity to originate," Rowan said. Rowan's comments come amid a brightening picture for deals across the economy, stirred by the perception of a more business-friendly federal government and improving economic picture. At the end of last year, Apollo rolled out a five-year plan to double its private credit assets under management to $1.2 trillion. Rowan took care to say that the firm's dealmaking ambitions are "modest." He pointed to BlackRock's 2024 acquisitions in private credit and other alternative asset managers as an example of a broader convergence of public and private markets — a key Apollo theme. BlackRock plans to buy private-credit firm HPS Investment Partners and private-market data platform Preqin for $12 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, and has already purchased investors Global Infrastructure Partners for $12.5 billion. Apollo's acquisitions, by contrast, will be "small-scale" said Rowan, saying they will help the firm create more products for large public asset managers, like BlackRock, to access the private markets. Apollo's private credit ambitions have so far been fueled by its insurance arm, Athene, with Apollo using Athene's balance sheet to fund its lending needs. When asked about the possibility that some large insurance assets may soon come up for sale, Rowan responded by saying the firm isn't going to just grow for growth's sake. "For us, growth is not just about growing the assets," Rowan said, adding that the firm already had to capital to lend a record $70 billion-plus last year. Instead, the firm wants to grow where it can lend, with Argo as a "prototype." "We are focused on expanding capabilities that can be immediately accretive buying something that in and of itself does not fit with our franchise," Rowan said. Apollo now has access to more than 20 individuals with experience investing in infrastructure, and those individuals now have much more capital to tap into and many more ways to invest. Jump to

In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) stands against the other low risk high growth stocks. In the past few days, the reintroduction of tariffs by the US government has been a significant factor influencing market dynamics. A 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% levy on Chinese imports, has heightened concerns about potential trade wars. These measures have led to increased market volatility, as investors assess the implications for global supply chains and corporate earnings. According to a report by news agency Reuters, based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs, hedge funds have been reducing their exposure to US equities, marking the fifth consecutive week of net selling. This trend indicates a defensive posture, with funds anticipating potential economic slowdowns resulting from the new tariffs. Conversely, retail investors have shown resilience, injecting significant capital into the market, possibly betting on a resolution to trade tensions.

Meanwhile, another report by Reuters, based on a survey carried out by investment bank Barclays, reveals that investors are shifting away from traditional hedge fund strategies that rely on broad market movements due to concerns over market volatility in 2025. The Barclays survey of 325 hedge fund investors managing nearly $9 trillion found they want hedge funds to reduce beta exposure to as low as 5% or even zero. The report highlights that traditional hedge fund approaches like long/short stock picking, credit, and activism are losing favor. Instead, investors prefer funds using algorithmic trading and merger-arbitrage strategies.

Bengaluru: Godrej Properties Ltd will look at profitable growth, expansion through land acquisitions, and build scale through higher market share, said a top company executive. The Mumbai-based developer has achieved 71% of its 2024-25 sales guidance of ₹27,000 crore on the back of strong housing demand and sales. In FY24, the company clocked ₹22,500 crore of sales bookings, making it the highest selling developer. “We will meet the sales guidance in the fourth quarter, which is said to be the strongest quarter in real estate. We have a number of launches coming up in multiple cities including Hyderabad, Noida, Pune, Gurugram. There are also two luxury projects in Mumbai which will be launched,” Pirojsha Godrej, executive chairperson, Godrej Properties, said in an interview. On Tuesday, the company reported a 152.23% rise in net profit to ₹158.20 crore for the October-December quarter, compared to ₹62.72 crore a year earlier. Revenue jumped 193.2% to ₹968.88 crore during the same period. “We are the largest residential developer in the country today, but we have a modest single-digit market share in the property markets we operate in. In FY24, we just about touched 10% market share in NCR, which is possibly our largest market. So, there is huge room for growth for Godrej Properties,” Godrej said. The three-month period through December was the sixth consecutive quarter when Godrej Properties clocked over ₹5,000 crore in sales bookings, the company said, underlying the sectoral tailwinds for India's residential real estate sector. In FY25 so far, the company has added projects of future sales value of over ₹23,000 crore, surprassing its ₹20,000 crore annual guidance. In December, Godrej Properties raised ₹6,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, including Singapore sovereign wealth firm GIC, Blackrock, and SBI Pension, through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) as it looks to expand business amid strong demand for residential plots and apartments. "This capital allows us to further increase the pace of growth. We need to continue executing well, keep acquiring land and launching projects, and have a stronger presence across the cities we are present in, to gain market share," Godrej said. Around 80-90% of its group housing projects will be focused on the key cities it operates in, which includes Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Delhi-National Capital Region, Pune, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Godrej Properties will opportunistically look at markets such as Kolkata and Ahmedabad. For plotted development projects, “we are happy to go to the top 20 or more cities”, Godrej said. After clocking around ₹73,000 crore of residential sales bookings in FY24, a milestone for India’s real estate sector, the top four publicly listed developers—Godrej Properties, DLF Ltd, Macrotech Developers Ltd and Prestige Group--are collectively targeting nearly ₹88,000 crore of sales in FY25.

Title: Dunnes substituted as defendant in case in place of Margaret Heffernan

Dunnes Stores boss Margaret Heffernan, has been removed as a defendant and replaced with a company name in High Court proceedings brought by a man who claims building work has interfered with his property in Blackrock, Co Dublin. Derek O’Shaughnessy, with an address at the Morning Star Hotel, Dublin, claims he owns the property at Redgate 1 and 2, Annaville Avenue. He has claimed Ms Heffernan and others interfered with his property rights including by the building of a car park for Dunnes. The alleged interference began, he says, when scaffolding was allegedly unlawfully erected around his Annaville Avenue property from June 25th-July 21st, 2022. [ Dunnes Stores chief executive seeks strike-out of man’s claims of property interferenceOpens in new window ] He also claims a scaffolding firm unlawfully evicted him from his residence with the aid of gardaí and that work on demolishing his former home was carried out without appropriate permission from the council. On Tuesday Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed Ms Heffernan’s name could be removed as a defendant in the case and substituted with Dunnes Stores Better Value Unlimited Company. He also agreed five named gardaí from Blackrock and Dundrum stations could be replaced as defendants by the Garda Commissioner. He claims the gardaí wrongfully assisted in evicting him from what was his home. Last month, Mr O’Shaughnessy was granted interim High Court orders preventing Thomas Corcoran, of scaffolding firm Blackhorse Scaffolding; Frank Curran, chief executive of Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council; the five gardaí; and Ms Heffernan from interfering with his property. All defendants deny his claims. He had applied to Mr Justice Brian Cregan for the orders on an ex-parte basis, which meant only he was in court on that day. Mr O’Shaughnessy, who is representing himself before the court, returned before Mr Justice Cregan on Tuesday when he said he was “trying to get at the truth” in bringing proceedings. He said his home had been “bulldozed to a shell” and that Mr Corcoran, who is a scaffolder, was claiming ownership without any proof. Lawyers for Mr Curran, the gardaí and Ms Heffernan said Mr O’Shaughnessy had brought proceedings against the incorrect defendants and they were seeking that they be amended. Ms Heffernan’s counsel, Martin Hayden SC, said his client also wanted the entire case struck out against his client as the pleadings showed no cause of action. He also said his client had “no involvement, good, bad or indifferent with the property”. As well as agreeing to the change of name for Ms Heffernan and the gardaí, Mr O’Shaughnessy agreed that Mr Curran’s name as a defendant could be replaced with Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Co Council. The judge gave directions for exchange of affidavits between the defendants and Mr O’Shaughnessy and said the case could come back in March.

Title: How Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) Drive Up the Cost of Health Care
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/pharmacy-benefit-managers-drive-up-cost-healthcare/5878884
Time Published: 2025-02-04T15:42:01Z
Full Content:
Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) evolved from simple claims processors into powerful health care intermediaries that control drug pricing and access through their relationships with insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers. PBMs engage in “spread pricing” — charging insurers more than they reimburse pharmacies and pocketing the difference — while also steering patients toward higher-cost medications through “rebate pumping” arrangements with drug manufacturers The current health care system, influenced by PBMs, underemphasizes preventive care while promoting long-term drug dependency, as ongoing prescription management generates more reliable revenue than prevention or cures Independent pharmacies and rural hospitals struggle financially under PBM practices, facing delayed reimbursements, strict audit requirements, and complex negotiation terms that often force them to either close or sell to larger chains Three major investment firms — BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street (the “Big Three”) — have significant financial stakes across PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance companies, creating a web of interconnected financial interests Solutions include eliminating safe harbor rebate rules, expanding cash-pay health care models, separating PBM services from insurance companies, and implementing stricter regulations to improve pricing transparency * In the featured video, independent journalist Tucker Carlson interviews Brigham Buhler — founder and CEO of Ways2Well, a preventative care and health optimization platform — about how the health insurance industry works to keep us in poor health. Buhler’s career in health care spans over 25 years, during which he gained significant insights into the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The rising cost of health care in the United States has become a heavy burden for many families who struggle to pay for essential services. Patients often end up navigating a maze of insurance requirements, denials, and opaque billing practices without understanding why their treatments cost so much. Pharmaceutical prices add another layer of difficulty, with insurers and other entities setting guidelines that determine access. Pharmacy Benefit Managers, or PBMs, occupy a powerful place in this ecosystem. Initially created to simplify payments and negotiate prices, they have grown into influential brokers controlling which drugs are covered and how they are priced. Critics argue that these corporations operate behind the scenes, orchestrating deals that maximize their profits while pushing more expenses onto patients. In other words, PBMs engage in hidden collaborations and pricing manipulations that fuel a system that is more concerned with corporate gain than with patient well-being. By shedding light on the complex financial incentives at play, Buhler helps us understand why each step of seeking medical care — from preventive screenings to essential prescriptions — feels increasingly draining on both wallets and morale. He reveals an elaborate structure where individuals are funneled into long-term drug usage while basic preventative care is overlooked. Instead of ensuring affordability, PBMs exploit hidden markups and secret rebates to inflate insurance bills and keep people locked in chronic illness. For decades, researchers have warned that chronic disease often begins with lifestyle factors. A diet loaded with chemicals, refined sugars, and addictive formulas paves the way for obesity, metabolic issues, and diabetes. The logical solution would be preventive care, yet the system consistently underfunds or blocks such efforts. Instead, the patient, already in poor health, is nudged into a cycle of drugs. In short, insurance companies profit from setting premiums and reimbursements that don’t address the root causes. PBMs connect drug manufacturers with insurance plans and pharmacies. By deciding which medications get favorable placement on insurance formularies, they have substantial power to shape treatment pathways. They operate as the “middlemen,” determining reimbursement rates and adding costs that might not be obvious to consumers. Critics argue that each link in this chain — from the chemistry of our fast-food culture to the mechanics of corporate insurance contracts — feeds long-term drug dependency. People hope doctors will rescue them with thoughtful interventions, yet many find themselves steered into prescriptions rather than genuine solutions. The net effect is a growing population locked into care that does little to uproot their actual problems. Pharmacy Benefit Managers began as logistical helpers for insurance claims, intended to ease administrative burdens and secure group discounts on medications. In those early days, patients often benefited from lower prices and streamlined services, confident that PBMs were working on their behalf to rein in drug spending. Over time, PBMs took a more pivotal role by merging with major insurers, pharmacies, and even drug companies. This expansion gave them the power to decide which medications appear on covered lists and how high co-pays would be set. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, often called the “Big Three,” poured investments into many PBMs, drug manufacturers, and insurance firms, linking them financially. Regulatory agencies did little to keep up. Safe harbor laws, originally designed to allow certain discount arrangements, opened a door to hidden deals that few outsiders could track. Even government officials sometimes admit that they lack the tools or data to parse how PBMs arrive at final medication costs or distributions. This vacuum fosters multiple avenues for manipulative pricing. While PBMs publicly champion themselves as experts in cost reduction, many inside observers contend that the real focus is leveraging secret rebates and inflated prices. The result is an enigma for consumers and health providers, who see rising expenses but cannot pinpoint exactly where the money goes. Without greater transparency, the underlying profit mechanisms of PBMs remain locked away behind bureaucratic layers. A key accusation involves “spread” pricing, where PBMs charge insurers a higher rate than they reimburse pharmacies, quietly pocketing the difference. Though advertised as normal operations, this method can inflate costs at every transaction. One high-profile investigation in Ohio’s Medicaid system revealed how drastically these discrepancies boosted PBM revenues, convincing state officials that alternative approaches were more cost-effective. A second alleged tactic is “rebate pumping.” PBMs decide which drugs get priority coverage, sometimes favoring those with generous rebates from manufacturers. While patients believe they are following insurance rules, they might be guided toward medications that offer bigger profits for the PBM, even if more affordable or clinically superior options exist. This hidden arrangement undermines genuine market competition. Formulary manipulation can steer entire populations toward high-cost drugs. When PBMs place lower-cost medications in less accessible tiers or require complicated approvals, patients rarely realize they’ve been nudged into pricier choices. Over time, these directed behaviors funnel billions into the PBM’s revenue stream. Smaller drug makers, unable to provide large rebates, struggle to compete. There is also the “deny, delay, depose” approach: denying coverage, delaying approvals, and deposing providers to wear down patients who challenge any claim refusal. The bureaucracy can be exhausting, compelling many people to simply accept PBM-dictated medications or give up on certain procedures. On top of this, forced mail-order mandates reduce local pharmacy competition. Large PBMs often own chain pharmacies or mail services, ensuring yet another revenue channel. By dictating that some prescriptions must be filled through a mail-order affiliate, they tighten their hold on supply routes. Collectively, all of these maneuvers burden the sick while generating steady corporate windfalls. Small, independent pharmacies are the first to feel the weight of these arrangements. They operate on narrow margins, often waiting extended periods for reimbursement. Regular audits can penalize them if co-pays or deductibles aren’t strictly collected. Many find the financial strain overwhelming and convert to cash-only practices or sell to bigger chains aligned with PBMs. Hospitals, especially those in rural or underserved areas, also struggle. Heavy dependence on insurer contracts means they must accept the terms PBMs set, even if that means late or partial payments. The complexity of negotiations can leave hospitals uncertain of actual reimbursement amounts for surgeries and treatments. Over time, these uncertainties hamper hiring efforts, infrastructure updates, and overall quality of care. Patients shoulder the brunt of it. Co-pays and deductibles, often determined by PBMs in tandem with insurance companies, can skyrocket. A single major procedure might leave someone battling endless paperwork, fighting denials, or searching for a distant “in-network” specialist. Over time, chronic disease management grows more expensive, sometimes to the point where even standard treatments become a risky financial gamble. Though high costs might be justified as byproducts of progress, critics point out that patients who need life-extending therapies can be denied based on invisible profit motivations. These denials or lengthy pre-authorization demands can dangerously delay critical interventions. Overall, the system keeps many people in a perpetual state of fear, worried about the next surprise bill or approval hurdle. The troubling notion is that PBMs profit when people remain in long-term treatment. Managing diabetes, heart disease, or recurring infections, for example, yields continual revenue from drug sales, hospital stays, and follow-up visits. If earlier screenings or lifestyle guidance could prevent these conditions, insurers and PBMs would lose a recurring income stream. Thus, the system subtly discourages prevention. Preventive care often gets labeled as “non-essential.” Insurance companies may only cover minimal checkups or simplified blood panels rather than the deep investigative screenings that might detect cancer cells or metabolic shifts. Doctors who push for thorough evaluations can face audits or claim denials. This approach effectively steers clinicians away from digging into root causes and keeps them dispensing short-term fixes instead. Chemotherapy, obesity medications, and specialized therapies offer further insight. PBMs choose which oncology drugs or weight-loss injections land on the top tier of coverage, frequently guided by favorable rebate structures. For instance, prescribing an expensive cancer drug is more attractive to PBMs than promoting cost-effective solutions or advanced screenings. By focusing on maximum reimbursement rather than clinical optimization, PBMs foster a system that prizes medication adherence over true health. Even potential cures or preventative interventions fade in importance compared to the reliable flow of payments from chronic prescriptions. One of the biggest shields for PBMs lies in corporate media’s dependence on pharmaceutical advertising. Huge budgets flow from big pharma and PBMs into television networks, newspapers, and digital platforms. Investigative reporters who try to expose PBM tactics might find their stories curtailed. Advertisers dislike unfavorable coverage and influence editorial choices that help them maintain their revenue streams. Lobbying piles on another layer of insulation. PBMs, insurers, and drug manufacturers invest massively in shaping legislation. They aim to preserve safe harbor laws and defend the complexity of rebate arrangements. Officials, short on time and expertise, often accept industry talking points that claim PBMs deliver broad discounts. Meanwhile, advanced data remain hidden under confidentiality clauses, preventing thorough oversight. Alternative or cost-effective providers become immediate targets for negative coverage or red tape. Compounding pharmacies, which customize medications more cheaply, face extra scrutiny and high-profile condemnation if any recall occurs. At the same time, preventive clinics that promote advanced blood tests and deeper lifestyle assessments are dismissed as “non-traditional,” leading many patients to doubt their credibility. Without a major shift in how media and lobbying are handled, PBMs will likely continue operating in the shadows, benefiting from the current structure. Even well-intentioned legislators who propose reforms may confront a lobbying wall that distorts or dilutes their efforts. As long as the press echoes PBM-friendly narratives, the public remains unaware of the mechanics that inflate drug costs and stifle real medical innovation. Some argue that the fastest route to PBM accountability is legislative reform. Eliminating safe harbor rebate rules could force full disclosure of every cent collected from manufacturers. If the public saw how big the discrepancy was between list prices and actual reimbursements, the outcry might pressure policymakers to demand fairer pricing structures. Others propose expanding the cash-pay model so that pharmacies and clinics can sidestep PBM-dictated reimbursements. Direct primary care clinics, which ask for a monthly membership rather than rely on insurance, show promise. Patients pay transparent fees, sidestepping the labyrinth of co-pays, claim denials, and lengthy authorization steps. Critics say it may limit coverage for catastrophic events, but supporters argue it fosters clearer, more compassionate medical relationships. Another idea is to separate PBM services from insurance altogether. Insurers could be barred from owning or partnering with PBMs, avoiding the vertical integration that squeezes out independent competitors. If drug costs were set in an open marketplace, free from hidden rebates, local pharmacies might compete on actual prices, improving affordability for the average consumer. Finally, bold political will is essential. Some leaders talk about dismantling PBMs, a move that could reorder the entire pharmaceutical ecosystem. Opponents decry it as radical, but the current system is unsustainable. If enough people demand an end to covert backroom deals, PBMs could be dethroned from their gatekeeping position, placing health care decisions back into the hands of doctors and patients. The PBM conversation intersects with a larger reality: a culture of processed foods and tobacco-inspired marketing that has ravaged public health. By engineering addictive flavors and packaging, corporations profit from driving individuals toward chronic ailments like diabetes. PBMs then profit further from long-term prescription management. This chain of enticements traps many in endless cycles of medication. Preventive medicine would disrupt this pattern, but PBMs have little reason to champion comprehensive screenings. If fewer people develop metabolic disease, the volume of prescription-based revenue drops, undermining the financial base of PBM operations. In short, more robust screenings, especially for heart disease and early-stage cancer, would save lives but erode corporate balance sheets. The good news is that many patients are now starting to rebel and opt for things like direct-pay blood tests, customized diets, and health care providers who embrace functional principles — all of which weaken the PBM chokehold. By proactively caring for your body, you reduce the likelihood of becoming a chronic customer for expensive prescriptions. The goal, in essence, is to break the cycle that pairs hidden market incentives with manufactured disease. PBMs exert a profound influence on who gets what medication and at what cost, yet much of their work is veiled from public view. As explained by Buhler, this system, anchored in concealed rebates, inflated average wholesale prices, and manipulative formulary structures, is responsible for skyrocketing health care costs. Patients feel the sting through insurance premiums, high deductibles, and arbitrary claim denials. By peeling back the layers, we see a troubling alliance between PBMs, major insurers, and media outlets — a web that thrives on keeping Americans in long-term prescription cycles. Though reforms have been proposed, progress is stalled by extensive lobbying and carefully crafted narratives that depict PBMs as cost-saving heroes. Still, a rising movement demands real transparency and policy changes that might reset the playing field. Shifting the balance of power involves both political and individual actions. For example, we need to urge lawmakers to abolish secret rebate loopholes and consider stricter regulation of PBMs. On a personal level, you can also explore direct-pay health care models, improve your knowledge about preventive medicine, and support local pharmacies that sidestep the PBM structure. As noted in the featured interview, a failure to confront these issues leaves us with ever-increasing premiums, minimal improvements in chronic disease outcomes — and minimal trust in the institutions supposed to protect public health. But if genuine policy efforts and grassroots initiatives merge, we can begin to reclaim control. The prospects for cheaper drugs, renewed primary care, and a greater focus on prevention could then become more than just a distant hope. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin Price On The Brink: Failure To Hold This Level May Trigger Crash To $74,000

Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are experiencing renewed selling pressure as escalating trade tensions between the United States and China lead to fresh tariffs on both sides. The largest cryptocurrency dropped to as low as $91,000 on Monday, while major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) also faced losses. The most recent installment of tariffs comes after the US enacted a 10% tax on all items from China, leading China to respond with its own tariffs on certain US imports, such as oil and liquefied natural gas, starting February 10. In another development, China has launched an inquiry into Google LLC over supposed antitrust infringements, intensifying the tension between the two economic giants. This market turbulence has wiped out the benefits from a short relief rally on Monday, which occurred after the Trump administration decided to postpone tariffs on Mexico and Canada for a month. The weekend’s initial declaration of US tariffs had already triggered a steep drop in cryptocurrency prices. Investor trust in riskier assets has been notably affected, as US investors pulled a net $235 million from a set of 12 Bitcoin-centric exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday. Moreover, open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group Inc.’s derivatives market decreased by 4%, reflecting a more cautious attitude among institutional investors. President Donald Trump, recognized for his pro-crypto position, has unintentionally brought more uncertainty to digital asset markets. Although cryptocurrencies experienced a rise following Trump’s election, the market now faces a difficult landscape marked by geopolitical strife and regulatory obstacles. As of this writing, Bitcoin was trading at $98,970, about 13% shy of its all-time high. Meanwhile, US ETFs investing in Ethereum witnessed record trading volumes on Monday, with significant liquidation of leveraged positions rattled by ongoing trade uncertainties. The iShares Ethereum Trust, led by BlackRock, accounted for nearly half of the $1.5 billion in trading volume among a group of nine ETFs. ETH plummeted by as much as 27% on Monday, leading to over $600 million in liquidations within perpetual futures markets, according to Bloomberg data. Analyzing current price trends, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified $92,180 as a critical support level for Bitcoin, based on MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) pricing bands. If this support level fails, the next target could be $74,400. Despite the recent price correction, Bitcoin traders are still enjoying a profit margin of 3.36%. Historically, local bottoms have formed when profit margins drop below -12%, suggesting that Bitcoin could have further downside potential before reaching a true bottom. Additionally, the MVRV Momentum indicator has remained in negative territory since the beginning of the year, signaling ongoing market weakness.

Title: Income Investors Will End Up Loving DeepSeek

HONG KONG, CHINA - JANUARY 28: In this photo illustration, the DeepSeek logo is seen on a phone in ... [+] front of a flag of China (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) Here’s my take on the DeepSeek selloff we saw last week: It’s a buying opportunity, especially for income investors. (I wrote a bit about this in last Thursday’s article. Since the market has rebounded a bit since, we’re going to talk about it more today. A preview? It’s not too late to buy the dip.) Why do income investors hold an edge here? Because they have a chance to buy Nvidia (NVDA) and other AI stocks, including some private-equity firms few people have access to, through closed-end funds. Tapping the selloff this way gives us two key benefits: The two funds in question—the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST) and BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ) are the two funds we’re focusing on here. They work well when bought as a pair because they have different mandates: BST focuses more on the big caps of the tech world, holding stocks like Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia. BSTZ holds some of those, as well, but also has smaller companies and private-equity firms focused on growth. That lends itself to more upside, but also more volatility—something BST, with its larger cap focus, helps us address. To really get at the opportunity we’re looking to tap into here, let’s talk a bit more about DeepSeek and what it means for AI and the tech sector more generally. Essentially, DeepSeek, which originated in China, was allegedly developed and trained for only $6 million. It’s now being offered as an open-source model essentially for free. With a cost of $0 for this AI tech, the reasoning goes, there’s no reason to spend billions on AI from companies like OpenAI or others whose stocks soared on the tech last year. Those include Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, all of which tanked on Monday, with NVIDIA, maker of the chips that underpin AI, falling 17%. Then, on Tuesday, the market erased much of its losses. Nvidia has more room to recover, though there could be short-term choppiness as investors debate what all this means. So, what should we make of this whole situation? Perhaps the biggest takeaway is that AI is critical to the stock market, and even a whiff of things going amiss could cause a reflexive selloff. The word “reflexive” here is key, because the selloff really didn’t make much sense. Free AI tools lower capital expenditure from businesses paying AI providers like OpenAI. That’s obviously bad for OpenAI and possibly Microsoft, which has invested almost $14 billion into OpenAI. Of course, that $14 billion is less than one-half of one percent of Microsoft’s market cap, so it’s really not that big of a blow. Maybe it’s bad for Alphabet? That doesn’t make much sense, either, as Alphabet has been giving away many of its AI tools to ensure people keep using Google services, like search. So it isn’t really a direct competitor to DeepSeek. And Nvidia? That stock’s selloff was the most egregious, and not because it was the biggest. Thing is, free AI tools mean people will use more AI. And since lower prices increase demand for a product, the more AI demand there is, the more demand there will be for Nvidia chips in the long run. DeepSeek’s new chatbot should’ve caused Nvidia shares to rise, not fall. Still, these stocks fell because this was a new story, and new stories create fear, which causes panic selling. Which is why we saw investors buy Nvidia shortly after. It’s not too late to join them—and as mentioned, BST and BSTZ are great avenues to take here. Especially when, in the case of Nvidia, we were in this same situation just six months ago. Back in July 2024, fears that both then-President Joe Biden and Donald Trump would impose controls on Nvidia selling chips to China caused the stock to fall 12% that month, with almost all of the drop coming in a little more than a week (shown below). July Tech Dip Other big tech names—like Alphabet (in orange) and Microsoft (in blue), as well as the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund ETF (VGT), a reasonable proxy (in purple)—were dragged down alongside NVIDIA. Anyone who bought that dip did well, as all of these stocks have recovered since, and helped drive tech (again measured by VGT, in purple) to outperform the S&P 500, even after last week’s selloff. Tech Rallies That’s likely why some investors pounced on the DeepSeek–driven selloff. Which brings us back to BST and BSTZ, and the opportunity they give us to “lock in” a selloff that hasn’t yet fully recovered. Post-selloff, both BST and BSTZ now trade at unusually large discounts to net asset value (5.4% for BST and 10.2% for BSTZ). And those discounts are near their widest since the last tech selloff six months ago. So not only are we getting NVIDIA (the largest holding in both of these funds) at a discount thanks to the selloff, but we’re buying these funds when their own discounts are particularly wide. We can see by comparing the tech sector’s performance to BSTZ’s since its discount widened to 12% in August 2024 to now, even after the recent selloff. BSTZ Outperforms BST? Similarly, buying BST when its discount widened to its largest point in mid-August last year and holding to the time I’m writing this also resulted in outperformance, although a tad less than BSTZ’s, since BST focuses more on large caps. And the kicker: Buying these funds and holding while waiting for similar outperformance gets us an 8% yield with BST and 12.7% from BSTZ, for that 10.4% average payout. It goes to show that buying oversold CEFs, collecting their dividends as they recover, then selling when the market fully rebounds is a proven way to build your net worth while maximizing your income and diversifying, too.

Title: U.S. Bitcoin Reserve May Be Coming, But States Are Winning the Race

Almost half of the state governments in the U.S. are either on a path toward putting some of their money into crypto or already have, and much of a suddenly booming interest in tying their financial futures to the digital-assets markets has come after U.S. President Donald Trump showed support for a national stockpile of digit assets. In the surge of crypto legislative or financial efforts at the state level, 21 states are investing or looking into investing — generally in the industry's leading token, bitcoin (BTC), and sometimes also in less volatile stablecoins that are designed to match the value of the U.S. dollar, according to a CoinDesk analysis. With states such as Arizona, Pennsylvania, Utah and Texas already digging into legislation to open public funds to buy cryptocurrencies, such initiatives may outpace the effort in Congress targeting a so-called Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Sixteen state legislatures are looking at bills to either establish digital assets stockpiles or to allow their state retirement funds to be partially invested in crypto, most of them introduced in recent weeks. Officials in another three states are engaged in serious discussions about joining in, and the money managers for two states — Michigan and Wisconsin — have already dipped parts of their public employees' retirement portfolios into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If the states begin pouring portions of their public funds into bitcoin and other digital assets, it would potentially lock down billions of dollars of the tokens for extended periods, boosting the value of the assets still openly circulating. Another effect: The states are potentially setting up millions of people to have personal stakes in the health of the crypto sector — whether they want to or not. In several of the proposals, governments are looking to follow in the footsteps of Michigan and Wisconsin in pushing parts of their retirement funds and state pension investments into digital assets. Retired school teachers, law enforcement officers and other public employees will watch some of their financial security become dependent on the fluctuations of the crypto markets. Other pieces of legislation would instruct state treasurers to spend as much as 10% of their public funds on a strategic reserve, with some specifying that qualifying digital assets must have at least a $500 billion market cap, leaving only bitcoin currently meeting the mark. Arizona and Utah are building a lead after getting their efforts passed by legislative committees, but other states weighing some version of a crypto bill also include Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. Others, such as Alabama, Florida and Kentucky are considering proposals from state officials or on the verge of pursuing legislation. The states interested in digital assets reserves are predominantly Republican-majority in their politics, and the reasons the lawmakers say they're backing the bills include investment diversity and embracing technological innovation. The amount put away by the states could eventually be overshadowed by the U.S. government's own reserve, if that effort comes to pass. President Trump, in his wider executive order on U.S. crypto policy, called for his administration to "evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile." The order suggested it may be built from government seizures of crypto in criminal cases. The idea had initially been pitched by Senator Cynthia Lummis, the Wyoming Republican who devotes much of her political bandwidth to supporting crypto and was named as the first chair of the Senate Banking Committee's digital assets subcommittee. Her bill to set up a U.S. reserve calls for the country to obtain about $20 billion worth of the tokens in the first year and to get another 200,000 in each of the next four years, until the U.S. is eventually holding a million bitcoin. While Lummis' pitch has called it a "Strategic Bitcoin Reserve," it's not — like the petroleum reserve — designed for deployment when economic conditions warrant it. It's structured more as a long-term investment, requiring the U.S. to hold the assets for at least 20 years. That would be almost 5% of the eventual, finite supply of global bitcoin going untouched for at least two decades. Combined with whatever the states seek to stockpile, U.S. governments would secure a significant percentage of the asset, in addition to the towering reserves held by the U.S. ETF issuers such as BlackRock and Grayscale and corporate investors led by MicroStrategy. The states' interest in bitcoin potentially lands Satoshi Nakamoto's ultimate exercise of financial outsiders firmly in the realm of the insiders, adding the asset to the core functions of government. The Bitcoin white paper meant to establish a system of transactions outside of the need of financial-firm intermediaries or government oversight. States setting up bitcoin funds managed in part by new laws could become some of the most stable of the industry's institutional investors. And naming bitcoin as a "strategic reserve" puts the digital tokens on par with gold and oil as economic mainstays, despite the very different nature of cryptocurrencies and their practical weaknesses as an inflation hedge. From the perspective of their citizens or public employees, states that grab crypto stakes will come away with two potential outcomes: Millions of people will enjoy more comfortable and well-funded retirements or public services; or millions of people will watch a crypto crash eat into the safety net they're counting on. It could be "disastrous for tens of millions of retirees if government officials gambled with state pension funds to buy bitcoin or crypto," said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a Washington-based advocacy group that's critical of the dangers of digital assets. He called the idea of a government bitcoin stockpile "a brazen attempt by a handful of crypto billionaires and their political allies to take money out of Main Street taxpayers’ pockets to create artificial demand for a highly volatile product that suffers from boom-bust cycles, is full of fraudulent trading and pricing in unregulated markets, and has no socially legitimate use, but is loved by criminals." Wagers on the prediction site Polymarket have put the odds of one of the states beginning to set aside bitcoin reserves before the end of this month at 11%, and the chances of the U.S. setting up such a reserve this year at the national level are at 45%. It may already be a trend that governments around the world can't ignore. "We anticipate more nation-states, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and government treasuries will look to establish strategic positions in bitcoin," Fidelity Digital Assets researchers predicted in a look-ahead report for 2025. "Facing challenges such as debilitating inflation, currency debasement, and increasingly crushing fiscal deficits, not making any bitcoin allocation could become more of a risk to nations than making one."

Title: Vanguard dilutes diversity guidelines for US board proxy voting

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. The updated policies exclude a recommendation that boards “at a minimum, represent diversity of personal characteristics, inclusive of at least diversity in gender, race, and ethnicity.” Vanguard’s updated U.S. proxy voting policy places an emphasis on complying with “relevant market-specific governance frameworks” and market-specific norms. The exclusion of recommendations comes as President Donald Trump has looked to reverse his predecessor’s legacy on diversity, equity and inclusion at the federal level and ordered agencies to put pressure on private sector DEI efforts. Vanguard still retains language in both its 2025 global proxy voting policy and U.S. regional policy that states its funds look for company boards “to be fit for purpose by reflecting sufficient breadth of skills, experience, perspective, and personal characteristics (such as age, gender, and/or race/ethnicity) resulting in cognitive diversity,” to enable effective and independent oversight. “The updates to the 2025 proxy voting policies do not represent significant year-over-year changes — they are a standard part of Vanguard’s annual review process, and reflect the evolving regulatory landscape across local markets,” Spero said. Vanguard’s 2025 global and U.S. proxy voting guidelines on board composition say that to assess how well-suited companies’ board composition is, its managed funds “seek fulsome disclosure of a board’s process for building, assessing, and maintaining an effective board well-suited to supporting the company’s strategy, long-term performance, and shareholder returns.” Those disclosures should include each board member’s “range of skills, background and experience” and their alignment with company strategy, the policies say. The changes were first reported by Reuters on Friday. Vanguard’s 2024 U.S. proxy voting policy is no longer available on its site, following the update, but has been preserved by web archive, the Wayback Machine. The updated voting policy is in effect as of Feb. 1. The policy changes come amid a broader retreat from public ESG and DEI commitments and falling support for environmental and social shareholder proposals. Vanguard supported zero environmental and social proposals in the 2024 proxy season, as BlackRock and State Street also supported fewer environmental and social proposals and overall support for related proposals fell to 16.2%, according to Diligent Market Intelligence. Vanguard also defended its decision to back ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods for re-election in 2024, after state finance officials publicly opposed him and his director slate for the energy giant’s lawsuit against a pair of activist investors. This proxy season will be the first under CEO Salim Ramji, after Tim Buckley retired in 2024. Once Ramji officially took the reins, over 8,000 individual Vanguard clients wrote to the investment firm’s top executive, urging him to put climate risk “at the forefront” of Vanguard’s investment management strategies.

Title: Trump signs order creating first-ever US sovereign wealth fund —and TikTok could be its first purchase

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/04/2025 5:07:08 AM PST by V_TWIN WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order Monday to create a sovereign US wealth fund — saying that TikTok may become one of its first acquisitions. A sovereign wealth fund is an investment fund owned and operated by a government. The world’s largest and wealthiest such funds are owned by China and resource-rich countries like Norway and Middle Eastern emirates. It was not immediately specified how the US endowment — the creation of which was first reported last month by The Post’s Charles Gasparino — would be capitalized, but Trump previously floated using tariff proceeds. It’s unclear if adding a stake in TikTok would require up-front investment, or if Beijing would offload it without charge to avoid a looming 10% levy that Trump announced Friday. “It’s a very exciting event. We’re going to have a sovereign wealth fund, which we’ve never had,” Trump said in the Oval Office — as News Corp founder Rupert Murdoch and Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison sat nearby.

Is it a coincidence that the Crypto and AI czar is giving a major speech today? I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking :) BAD IDEA. “President Trump signed an executive order Monday to create a sovereign US wealth fund — saying that TikTok may become one of its first acquisitions” So tax payer money will be used to buy a private company. Not sure I like an official government slush fund. I agree. On this side of eternity, bad idea. On the other side, maybe not so bad. In the past election, TikTok was an absolute hotbed of support for Trump, especially for black men that defected from the democrats. Hard to imagine that would have been allowed if the US government owned it. This is the first bad idea of his. No thanks to government or big tech taking it over. That would ruin it.

Title: Six entities to make foray into soaring MF biz

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Six new asset management companies (AMCs) are set to enter the fast-growing mutual fund (MF) industry this year and the asset under management (AUM) of MFs growing 32 per cent to ₹66.93 lakh crore in December 2024 against ₹52.74 lakh crore in December 2023. The market regulator has already given ‘in-principle’ approval to Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International and Cosmea Financial Holdings, and final approval to Angel One and Unifi Capital. The market regulator initially grants in-principal approval after reviewing the application and assessing the applicants’ basic eligibility. After this, the applicant is allowed to start MF business by setting up the infrastructure and hire the core team. The regulator inspects the progress of the companies after six months and issues the final licence if the applicant meets all the criteria. Unifi, in fact, has filed a draft paper with SEBI for its maiden fund - Unifi Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund . In the past few months, SEBI has issued several partial and final approvals for the new MF players (applicants) to widen the MF reach and attract investors from smaller towns.AlphaGrep Securities, Ask Investment Managers and Monarch Networth Capital have also filed applications that are under consideration with SEBI. In 2023, five new AMCs entered the MF industry, but three of them entered through acquisitions. Vivek Sharma, Head of Investment, Estee Advisors, said while the MF industry has seen a tremendous growth, much of it was from equity schemes. The number of debt schemes has grown to 317 last year from 314 at the end of 2023. In contrast, equity schemes saw a significant net addition of 70 new funds. AMFI had proposed a Debt-Linked Savings Schemes to the Finance Ministry, but there was no mention of it in the Finance Minister’s speech, he said. Currently, the total expense ratio (TER) for debt funds ranges from 0.8 per cent for AUM above ₹50,000 crore and a maximum of 2 per cent for the first ₹500 crore. Providing incentives will definitely improve adoption of debt products, but higher TER means a lower return for investors, he added. Puneet Sharma, CEO and Fund Manager, Whitespace Alpha, said while more fund houses create an illusion of expanded choices, most of them will be equity-focused, particularly targeting small-cap, mid-cap and thematic segments. With too many equity funds chasing a limited set of investment opportunities, especially in small- and mid-cap stocks, liquidity constraints and valuation risks will increase, he added.

Posted on 02/04/2025 4:58:32 AM PST by marcusmaximus The Kremlin on Tuesday called US President Donald Trump's plans to exchange Ukrainian rare earth minerals for further military aid a “commercial proposal.” -snip- “Well, probably, if we call a spade a spade, this is an offer to buy aid, that is, not to continue to provide it on a gratuitous or other basis, but to provide it on a commercial basis,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow. “It is better, of course, not to provide assistance at all and thereby contribute to the end of the conflict,” Peskov further said. He said that the essence of Trump's ideas regarding a settlement in Ukraine are unclear, but that it is obvious US arms supplies to Kyiv will continue as none have declared otherwise. He went on to say the new US administration has not yet made any decisions on the possibility of returning Russian diplomatic property seized by Washington, stressing that Moscow will take reciprocal measures should Poland try to seize such property.

He said that the essence of Trump's ideas regarding a settlement in Ukraine are unclear, but that it is obvious US arms supplies to Kyiv will continue as none have declared otherwise.

Bitcoin could see unprecedented capital inflows ranging from $150 billion to $500 billion as US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday mandating the creation of a new sovereign wealth fund. The initiative—which did not explicitly reference BTC during its announcement—will be helmed jointly by US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. The US sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is expected to be created within the next 12 months. Although official details remain sparse, market observers note that both Lutnick and Bessent have been vocal supporters of Bitcoin, prompting speculation that the nascent fund could include digital assets. Well-known BTC advocate Florian Bruce-Boye offered a sweeping outlook via X, suggesting the upcoming US sovereign wealth fund is destined to become “the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world in the long term.” He stated: “The USA will create a sovereign wealth fund. It is set to become the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world in the long term. That would be $2 trillion dollars. That is as big as BTC itself. With H. Lutnick and S. Bessent at the helm, it is highly likely that Bitcoin will be included in this sovereign wealth fund.” Bruce-Boye pointed to the personal investment profiles of both Lutnick and Bessent, emphasizing their favorable views on Bitcoin. According to his statements, Lutnick “has hundreds of millions in BTC and, according to his own statements, buys every dip,” while Bessent “sees Bitcoin as a freedom technology.” Drawing further parallels, Bruce-Boye highlighted how Norway’s $1.8 trillion fund and Saudi Arabia’s $1 trillion fund could add “another 1.5 times the market capitalization of Bitcoin” if they follow suit. He referenced a recent comment from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who mentioned a sovereign wealth fund seeking guidance on whether to invest “2% or 5%” in BTC. Bruce-Boye concluded by quantifying the possible capital flow: “3% of $4.8 trillion dollars is $150 billion. At current prices, that’s around 1.5 million BTC… And that’s only if the three largest build up a small position. Anyone who has not yet ‘studied’ Bitcoin should do so as soon as possible.” Echoing a similar optimism, Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer posted: “The US Sovereign Wealth Fund should reach $5T AUM pretty quickly. For context, Norway’s fund holds $2T, and they have a population of 6M people. 10% allocation to Bitcoin makes sense, so that’s about $500B buying over the next couple of years. Bullish.” Fahrer’s estimate pushes the potential inflow even higher, implying that if the US fund does indeed adopt a strategic BTC allocation, it could trigger a multi-year wave of institutional demand. Jeff Walton, digital capitalist and founder of True North, underscored the significance of Howard Lutnick’s leadership in a separate X post. Lutnick, who serves as both the US Secretary of Commerce and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, is known for his substantial personal position in BTC. Walton wrote: A couple of fun details about Howard and Cantor Fitzgerald: 1. Howard owns “hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin, and it’s going to be Billions” 2. Cantor Fitzgerald owns a 5% stake in Tether, and manages Tether’s treasury assets 3. Cantor is launching a $2 Billion Bitcoin financing lending business, that would use Bitcoin as collateral for USD loans. 4. “We will build the best platform for financing Bitcoin” 5. “We are Cantor Fitzgerald, and we will support Bitcoin” For now, the global BTC market watches and waits, aware that even a modest allocation from the incoming US sovereign wealth fund could reshape the landscape —and possibly herald a new wave of institutional participation worldwide. At press time, BTC traded at $99,450. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: Are Trump and his supporters ready for a fight to the death?

(Article byÂ Paul Craig Roberts republished from PaulCraigRoberts.org) In an article in the current issue of theÂ City Journal, âCounterrevolution Blueprint,â Christopher F. Rufo, describes the extent to which the US government is in the hands of the enemy.Â Â In the 2020 presidential electionÂ employees of the Justice (sic) Department, gave 86 percent of their political contributions to Democrats. Labor Department employees gave 88 percent to Democrats. Health and Human Services 92 percent, and Education Department employees gave 97 percent.Â Â Rufo reports that these one-sided political donations are mirrored by tech companies and universities, bastions of left-wing ideologies and activism.Â To give you an idea of just how bad the situation is, the Treasury Department, the task of which is economic policy, financing the debt and raising revenue, during the Obama regime added a new bureaucracy, âThe office for Minority and Women Inclusion,â that is totally outside the Treasuryâs responsibilities.Â Â This office continued under Trumpâs first term, Rufo reports, and proselytized âcritical race theory as an operating ideology, hiring consultants to conduct training programs teaching Treasury employees that America is a nation of systemic racism with a 400-year history of racial terrorismâ that continues today.Â During the Biden regime another activist left-wing bureaucracy was created in the Treasury, an Equity Hub with a Counselor for Racial Equity. Janet Yellen, the Jewish Secretary of the Treasury, and Kamala Harris, the black Vice President, quickly announced a $8.7 billion fund for lending only to minority-owned businesses, a blatantly discriminatory policy in violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 14th Amendment.Â Â You can imagine how many âminority-ownedâ firms were quickly created Â so that âdeservingâ people could be made millionaires by the US taxpayers.Â Â And you can rest assured that neither Yellen nor Harris were held accountable for violating law and the Constitution. Not even this was enough. The Treasury forced federal contractors to implement DEI and monitored tax returns to make sure that tax-exempt donations to charities were racially balanced. Rufo describes the efforts of Nixon, Reagan, and Trump 1 to get the bureaucracy in compliance with the Presidentâs policy.Â Â All failed.Â Â Nevertheless, Rufo has hope for Trump 2, and he sets out the necessary elements for taking back the Presidentâs and the peopleâs power from a hostile civil service that is united against American values and are substituting the values of cultural marxism in their place. Rufo makes it clear that if Trump 2 fails, âthe American experiment will come to an end: bureaucratic rule will devour the constitutional order.â I certainly agree, having made many of these points myself.Â Â The question is:Â Â How realistic is it that Trump and a few appointees can subdue millions of people whose far-left ideology is guiding the US government and who not only despise Trumpâs view of America but also hate Trump personally.Â Â It is impossible for Trump to achieve unity with ideologues supported by the Democrat Party who are totally opposed to his view of America. The competence and objectivity of the civil service, long under liberal attack, was finished off when the Clinton regime pushed the white male senior civil service into early retirement in order to âmake roomâ for blacks and females. It was part of âaffirmative action.â The DEI legions have been growing for decades.Â Â They are firm in their belief that white heterosexuals are racist, and they intend to finish the process started with discriminatory âaffirmative actionâ to make normal white Americans second class citizens in law and position. Insouciant whites have enabled their own suppression by turning over positions of power to their enemies.Â Â It remains to be seen whether this was a fatal mistake that has doomed a merit-based color-blind society. Where among critical race theorists and denouncers of Western â which means white â Civilization is there good will to which Trump can appeal? Democrat judges and a number of insouciant Republican ones will act to block Trumpâs efforts. Trump has to be prepared to ride roughshod over them, their rulings be damned, just as they have ridden roughshod over the American people for decades.Â Â Trump cannot accept the rulings as anything but weaponized judicial statements no different than the weaponized law used against him, the January 6 protesters, and the right-to-life protesters. Karl Marx said that good will was not an operative principle because each class acted only in its own interest.Â Â So what mediates between classes?Â Â Marx said that violence was the only effective force in history.Â Â Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and Pol Pot relied on violence. Formerly I disputed this view of the efficacy of violence, but just as we did not deal with Hitler based on good will, we cannot rely on goodwill when dealing with internal enemies who intend to destroy America with open borders and legal privileges based on race, gender, and sexual preference. As I am convinced that good will has played a role in effecting reforms, today perhaps I would modify Marxâs claim. I would substitute âeffectiveâ in place of âonly.â Â Violence is an effective force in history. It seems that real change is impossible without it as the American Revolution exemplifies.Â Today the clash is no longer between economic classes based on material interest.Â Â The clash is ideological. The America-is-evil forces are intent on replacing a color-blind merit-based society with a society based on race, gender, and sexual preferenceÂ privilege. It is an ideological struggle like the one Lenin and Mao launched on Russian and Chinese societies.Â Â It is truly a fight to the death. If Trump loses, America loses as Rufo said.

Title: Analysis-Europe's AI bulls pin hopes on 'Jevons Paradox' after DeepSeek rout

For premium support please call: For premium support please call: By Lucy Raitano LONDON (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence bulls in Europe are dusting off a 160-year-old economic theory to explain why the boom in the sector's stocks may have further to run, despite the emergence of China's cheap AI model DeepSeek. Tech stocks worldwide plunged on Jan. 27 after the launch of DeepSeek - apparently costing a fraction of rival AI models and requiring less sophisticated chips - raised questions over the West's huge investments in chipmakers and data centres. At the heart of the selloff was U.S. advanced chipmaker and AI poster-child Nvidia, which lost 17% of its value, or close to $600 billion, in the largest one-day drop in market capitalisation for any company on record. Since then, tech stocks have rebounded, with European markets hitting new highs, and a 19th century economic theory is suddenly on everyone's lips: the Jevons Paradox. Named after English economist William Stanley Jevons, it posits that when a resource becomes more efficient to use, demand can increase - rather than decrease - as the price to use the resource drops. "I hadn’t discussed it until Monday (last week), and then suddenly it’s everywhere," said Helen Jewell, Chief Investment Officer at BlackRock Fundamental Equities, EMEA. "This paradox highlights one of the uncertainties at the moment," said Jewell, flagging that a key question for European stock-pickers is whether data centres and their suppliers will be less in demand. "One of the big question marks from (last) Monday’s news is how much energy is going to be needed for the AI revolution?" The selloff hit direct and indirect AI plays alike. Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML, and sector peers ASMI and BE Semi all fell 7%-12% on Jan. 27, before recouping losses later in the week, as did Siemens Energy, which provides hardware for AI infrastructure. "Jevons Paradox strikes again!" Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said in a post on X. "As AI gets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket, turning it into a commodity we just can't get enough of." THE NEW BUZZWORD On Friday, Tomasz Godziek, portfolio manager of the Tech Disruptors fund at J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, said lower AI costs could exemplify the Jevons Paradox. "Ultimately, this could fuel a new wave of AI investment, creating fresh opportunities, particularly in software and inference technologies," Godziek said. Portfolio managers at Thematics Asset Management, an affiliate of Natixis IM, cited Jevons Paradox as one reason they believe demand for AI chips may remain healthy. Mark Hawtin, head of the Liontrust global equities team, also said his investment thesis on AI was reinforced by the news on Jan. 27, flagging the paradox. "Everyone has become an expert on Jevons Paradox," said Aviva Investors portfolio manager Kunal Kothari, who manages a UK equity income fund with around 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in assets. "The falling cost of improved productivity through GenAI will likely benefit companies in the UK market generally, as they will predominantly be consumers of these technologies," he added, pointing to data and software names like RELX, LSEG, Experian and Sage as likely beneficiaries. DATA CENTRE NEEDS IN FOCUS The need for data centres and the vast amounts of power required to run them has driven a lot of AI investing in Europe already, given that there aren't any homegrown rivals to the likes of Nvidia, whose shares have rocketed by about 200% in under two years. "There is an implicit assumption that the adoption and usage of AI would require increasingly more chips, and more data centre capacity and power consumption," said Kasper Elmgreen, CIO of fixed income and equities at Nordea Asset Management. "What DeepSeek has done is to question what is required from that route and what can be delivered by making much better software." Not everyone is convinced of the new rationale, including Jordan Rochester, head of FICC strategy at Mizuho EMEA. "Whilst many Nvidia optimists pointed to Jevons Paradox to help them sleep better at night ... it was less convincing in the short term after what has been a meteoric rise in Nvidia shares," he wrote in a note.

Title: Should you withdraw your money from poorly performing property funds, or wait it out?

Their investments may be dropping in value but many investors in Irish property funds are finding themselves stuck as restrictions on cashing in their investments remain in place. It’s a far cry from the heady days of the Celtic Tiger, when commercial property funds were the best-performing asset class – outperforming even Irish equities. While property funds struggled in the aftermath of the financial crisis, they turned it around but the environment has become challenging once more. After a buoyant 2015, when Irish Life’s fund returned almost 20 per cent, it has been in the red for four of the last five years. Similarly, both Zurich Life and New Ireland’s funds had negative returns in the year to January 6th, with Aviva’s fund the only one of the four in the black – with a return of just 0.2 per cent. Suzie Nolan, head of property with Aviva, says the life and pensions company’s property fund is facing “similar challenges evident in the wider Irish property market”. These include economic threats such as inflation as well as geopolitical uncertainty. The move towards working from home, and its consequent impact on demand for office space, as well as the ever-increasing requirement for landlords to provide more sustainable space have also had an impact. Funds started restricting withdrawals back in spring 2023, as a sharp change in direction on interest rates at the European Central Bank saw a surge in the number looking to withdraw their money. They feared increased funding costs could lead to project writedowns that could push down the valuation of such funds. It is not unusual for property funds to stop access to withdrawals, though that doesn’t mean investors are any happier to find themselves locked in at an inopportune time in the cycle. They typically carry warnings, like that of Zurich Life: “If you invest in this fund, there may be extended periods when you do not have any access to your money. “This means you could be waiting for a significant period of time before you are able to encash your investment,” Zurich Life says. And that is precisely the case at the moment. Irish Life has had a six-month waiting period on withdrawals since March 2023, while Zurich Life has now stopped investments both in – and out – of its fund. A spokesman says that “no inflows are permitted into the Zurich Property Fund, and a waiting period applies for withdrawals or switches out. The fund is reviewed on a regular basis and the restrictions for inflows and outflows may change in the future”. This means that the fund is shrinking, down from about €33 million in March 2023 to about €18 million as of August this year. Aviva introduced a moratorium of up to six months back in November 2023, due to “net outflows” from the fund and, according to a spokeswoman, this still applies. The holdings of the fund, which merged with the Friends First Irish Commercial Property fund back in May 2022, include: Blackrock Village Centre and Zurich House, both in Blackrock in south Dublin; the Globe retail park in Naas, Co Kildare; and 18 Lower Leeson Street, Dublin 2, which is currently available for letting. Typically, a fund will introduce a notice period to give fund managers time to make any property sales needed to pay future withdrawals. Often, funds will move to restrict withdrawals if cash reserves decline. Normally property funds keep a buffer of about 10 to 15 per cent of assets in cash to meet the demand for withdrawals. This time around, however, most of the funds are cash rich. New Ireland, for example, has 23.4 per cent in cash; Zurich Life has more than a quarter of its assets in cash, according to its most recent report; and Aviva has 12.2 per cent. New Ireland, which had a restriction, is one of the few funds with no restrictions. A spokesman says the New Ireland Property Fund is open to new investment, and there are no restrictions on withdrawals and switches. So should investors apply to withdraw their funds or wait it out? Well, the issue here can be that, depending on the fund, the request will be processed only at the end of the deferral period and at the unit price of the fund at that time – ie the unit price after the six-month deferral, not the unit price at the time the instruction was given. As a result, you are taking a gamble on where the price will go. You might also be faced with an early encashment penalty, so check the small print before making a decision. Many funds have also changed how they are being priced. New Ireland’s fund, for example, is priced on a disposal basis, “which ensures that policyholders exiting the fund pay their fair share of property acquisition costs” the spokesman says. This has been the case since 2020. This can happen when more money is going out of the fund than coming in, and is a strategy used to contain losses. At a time of growth, when a fund is expanding and purchasing assets, it will usually be priced on an acquisition basis. Moving to a disposal basis can be bad news for investors, especially in a market downturn; when New Ireland made the change it cut the unit price of the fund by as much as almost 8 per cent. Given an overall office vacancy rate in Dublin of about 16 per cent – up from about 5 per over the last five years – the city now has one of Europe’s highest rates. This is also reflected in the property funds. Irish Life’s vacancy rate is less than 10 per cent, while New Ireland’s is 9.7 per cent and Aviva’s is 8.4 per cent (which includes 3 per cent of strategic vacancy for redevelopment purposes). Funds also have run into difficulty when trying to offload properties. Irish Life acquired 1 Harbourmaster Place, KPMG’s current headquarters in the IFSC, back in 2015 for €50 million. It put it back on the market in 2020 for €54 million but it failed to sell. Now KPMG is set to move to Hibernia Reit’s development in Harcourt Square, and the lease on 1 Harbourmaster is due up in 2026. Despite the challenges however, fund managers remain upbeat about the future. State Street Global Advisors, which manages New Ireland’s fund, expects a bump in transactions as interest rates fall, which will lead to a “closer alignment of buy and sell side pricing expectations” – in other words more competitive prices. It also expects vacancy rates to fall in the office sector. “Despite offices generally being out of favour with investors in recent years, there are now signs that interest in the sector is turning” Aviva’s Nolan expects more stability in valuations this year, “with the possibility of some upward movements in certain subsectors, such as retail parks, as new rental evidence becomes available”. And she expects more economic opportunities to come through in 2025, such as the reducing cost of debt and a widening of the spread between bond rates and property yields, “both of which should be an impetus for further investment in the property sector”, she says. Aviva itself expects to be busy, with projects including the redevelopment of a site in Dundalk to deliver a primary care centre for the Health Service Executive expected to start this year, alongside other “value-add initiatives”, such as further letting activity and the rolling out of additional sustainability programmes.

Title: Bitcoin Recovers Above $100,000 After This Weekend’s Sharp Drop

Bitcoin prices climbed back above $100,000 today. (Photo illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) Bitcoin bounced back on Monday, February 3, rising above $100,000 once again after falling to nearly $90,000 over the weekend. The world’s most valuable digital currency reached roughly $102,600 close to 5 p.m. EST, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. At this point, the cryptocurrency was up more than 10% from the recent low of close to $91,000 it attained on Sunday, February 2, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView show. When explaining the digital asset’s latest price movements, analysts cited several factors, including the recent tariff announcements, supply-demand dynamics and also the impact of speculative bets being liquidated. One market observer who weighed in on these developments is the the TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O. “Over the weekend President Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China,” she noted via email. “Since this was announced on 2/1/2025, Saturday, this caused a lot of fear for crypto traders on how this could impact traditional markets.” “Many, including Blackrock have indicated that Bitcoin is an ideal asset during volatile times of economic uncertainty, similar to Gold,” she emphasized. The analyst also emphasized sharp changes in leveraged positions, citing data provided by crypto analytics platform CoinGlass. “According to CoinGlass most traders took a long position and out of the historic $2.2B liquidations, ~$1.5B longs were liquidated while gold hit an all-time high,” Wendy noted. “This indicates Bitcoin traders, may have anticipated that Bitcoin would continue with bullish price action as uncertain economic conditions could have occurred Monday due to Trumps tariffs (similar to gold)." "However, the 25% tariffs placed on Mexican imports has been paused for the next 30 days which could indicate less volatility,” she stated, emphasizing today’s announcement that President Donald Trump was postponing tariffs on Mexico until early next month. Markets also found out today that Trump planned to pause the Canadian tariffs he announced over the weekend after speaking with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Certain analysts who offered input for this article made today’s increase in bitcoin prices seem predictable given existing market conditions. “Bitcoin’s recovery to $100K and above is no surprise—it’s simple supply and demand,” Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan Bitcoin, said via emailed comments. “Institutions, sovereign wealth funds, and everyday people are realizing fiat’s inevitable decline and moving into the best money ever invented,” he added. “Weak hands sold in the recent dip, but strong holders stepped in, stacking harder,” Klippsten stated. “Meanwhile, global uncertainty is driving more people to opt out of failing fiat. This is just the beginning.” Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, also weighed in. “Today’s rebound was simply a recovery from the absurd drop yesterday,” he stated through email. “In most cases, the correlation with certain fiat markets works against Bitcoin; yesterday, had US equities markets been open, it would have worked very much in favor of BTC,” Enneking emphasized. “The drop on Sunday hit ridiculous proportions because there was nothing to slow it down and fear totally dominated greed; the drop only slowed once Asia markets had opened and had totally reversed several hours after US markets had done the same,” he stated. “So, billions of long positions wiped out and another data point created for folks who are considering investing in the crypto ecosystem,” Enneking concluded. Alex Lin, cofounder and general partner at venture capital firm Reforge, also weighed in, highlighting the strong interest of cryptocurrency buyers. “BTC’s rebound above $100,000 after its weekend lows points to a significant supply squeeze,” he wrote through emailed comments. “Over the past few days, retail investors capitulated due to fears sparked by Trump’s trade war headlines. However, large players and institutions took advantage of the dip to accumulate, as shown by the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index, which indicated strong buyer demand with a noticeable premium,” Lin stated. “This activity underscores BTC’s resilience and suggests potential bullish momentum, especially as confidence in the broader market outlook remains strong,” he added.

Title: Searching For Yield in All of The Safe Places
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/02/searching-for-yield-in-all-of-the-safe-places/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T01:51:49Z

What kind of investor are you? Do you want yield, safety, yield with a reasonable risk, or total return? I created a ranking system to combine Risk, Yield, Return, Quality, Trend, and Tax-Efficiency factors into an overall rating. I used yield divided by Ulcer Index which measures the depth and duration of drawdowns to limit the number of categories that I evaluate. My favorites may not be the same as yours. Table #1 shows how I rank the categories. I will be discussing each Lipper Category in the order of the “Overall” column. Approximately 10% of my bond investments are in six of the eight categories but the bulk of my bond investments are in bond ladders and core bonds along with diversification into global and international income categories. Table #1: Performance of Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I extracted all mutual funds and exchanged traded funds using the MFO Premium Fund Screener and Lipper global dataset. What Table #2 tells us is that global high-yield and short high-yield categories don’t have as many funds or assets under management, and investors should invest with caution. Loan participation funds are interesting because they have a lower percentage of assets rated below investment grade, a small effective duration, and a high yield. High-yield categories have the highest 30d yields and the lowest-rated quality assets. Core plus bond funds have a longer duration and have performed poorly with rising rates. Table #2: Metrics for Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Table #3 is based on the history of nearly 400 mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. The top four categories have current yields of about 6% or more, full cycle returns of 4% to 7%, and drawdowns during severe market downturns of 13% to 20%. If investing in these categories go in with eyes wide open. By comparison, during the Dotcom Full Cycle from September 2000 to October 2007, the S&P 500 had an annualized return of around 2.0% The bottom four categories have lower yields and lower risk. Core plus bond funds performed relatively well during the financial crisis. I have invested in multi-sector funds as a middle-of-the-road option. Table #3: Performance of Lipper Categories with High Yields Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I selected one fund, most interesting to me as a moderately conservative investor, from each of the eight Lipper Categories covered in the article. Table #4 is packed with useful information about risk (MFO Risk, MaxDD %, Bear Markets), risk-adjusted return (MFO Rating), returns (APR, Full Cycle), trends (Fund Flow, EMA), quality (Quality, Junk), and expenses (ER, FMR), and yield. Last month, I bought Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a lower-risk fund with a 30d yield of 6.0% and Franklin Senior Loan Fund ETF (FLBL) with a 30d yield of 7.2% but a little more risk. I bought Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX) with a 30d yield of 5.2%. It has about 21% in equity and is higher risk and higher potential reward. The funds are loosely sorted with the safest to the left and riskier to the right in Table #4. For a future article, I have screened high-yielding funds rated with an MFO Risk of “Very Conservative” and Great Owl First Trust Enhanced Short Maturity ETF (FTSM), Vanguard Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB), and Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (AAA) are among the fourteen on the list. Table #4: Author’s Select High Performing Funds Per Lipper Category (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. The steady profile and low volatility can be observed in Figure #2 below for First Trust Enhanced Short Maturity ETF (FTSM), Vanguard Ultra-Short Bond ETF (VUSB), Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA), and to a lesser extent Franklin Senior Loan Fund ETF (FLBL). As longer-term yields start to stabilize, I expect JPMorgan Income ETF (JPIE), Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX), and American Century Diversified Corporate Bond ETF (KORP) to start to perform better. Note that some of these funds have averaged a respectable return of 7% to 13% over the past two years. Figure #2: Author’s Select High Performing Funds Per Lipper Category Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Loan Participation Funds: Funds that invest primarily in participation interests in collateralized senior corporate loans that have floating or variable rates. Loan participation funds are a diverse group that can make returns of 5% to 8% during rising or falling rates. They can have positive returns during a mild recession, but some may lose 20% or much more during a severe financial crisis. Percent Junk Plus Not Rated is a fairly good indicator of performance during a severe downturn in bond prices as shown in Figure #3. For this reason, I bought more of Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) than I did of Franklin Senior Loan ETF (FLBL). Figure #3: 2022 Returns Versus Percent Junk Plus Not Rated Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Most of the loan participation funds that I selected for Table #5 have lower risk and volatility; however, BlackRock Floating Rate Income Portfolio (BFRAX) had a drawdown of 19.6% during the financial crisis compared to Fidelity Floating Rate High Income (FFRHX) which had a drawdown of 8.4%. Table #5: High Performing Loan Participations Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) is one of my favorites because of its low drawdown and volatility which can be observed in Figure #4. It invests in higher-quality assets. Figure #4: High Performing Loan Participations Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from domestic fixed-income securities, with dollar-weighted average maturities of less than three years, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. Short high-yield funds have a lower risk compared to most other categories in this article with decent returns compared to other short-term bond funds. I bought Fidelity Short Duration High Income (FSAHX) because it has a lower percentage of “Junk” rated bonds and a lower drawdown. Of the ETFs, I favor Xtrackers Short Duration High Yield Bond ETF (SHYL). Table #6: High Performing Short High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. I focus on performance over the last year or two because the Federal Reserve has stopped raising rates, but check how the fund performed during the latest downturn. While Fidelity Short Duration High Income (FSAHX) has underperformed recently, it had a lower drawdown during the COVID recession. Figure #5: High Performing Short High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Global High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from both domestic and foreign fixed-income securities, have no quality or maturity restrictions, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. The global high-yield category does not have many quality funds, but I identify Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) and AB Short Duration High Yield ETF (SYFI) as high performers with respectable yields, but moderately large drawdowns. Table #7: High Performing Global High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Of the two funds, I favor Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (PGHY) for its risk-adjusted performance. Figure #6: High Performing Global High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification High Yield: Funds that aim at high (relative) current yield from domestic fixed-income securities, have no quality or maturity restrictions, and tend to invest in lower-grade debt issues. Of the ETFs, I like iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (SHYG) and expect it to perform better during falling rates or a market downturn with less volatility. I bought modest amounts of Fidelity Capital & Income (FAGIX) and Fidelity High Income (SPHIX) for diversification within the high-yield category. Table #8: High Performing High Yield Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #7 shows the diverse range of performance of high-yield funds due in part to hedging, duration, percent junk, and owning equity. Figure #7: High Performing High Yield Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short Investment Grade Debt: Funds that invest primarily in investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with dollar-weighted average maturities of less than three years. Columbia Threadneedle Investments wrote As Interest Rates Rise, Investors May Look To Floating-Rate Funds explaining that while floating-rate bonds do well when rates are stable or rising, they tend to underperform when rates are falling. I favor Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor ETF (FLDR) for its high yield and low volatility. Table #9: High Performing Short Investment Grade Debt Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #8: High Performing Short Investment Grade Debt Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Multi-Sector Income: Funds that seek current income by allocating assets among several different fixed-income securities sectors (with no more than 65% in any one sector except for defensive purposes), including U.S. government and foreign governments, with a significant portion of assets in securities rated below investment-grade. Exchange-traded funds are relatively new to the Multi-Sector Income category and of the two, I prefer JP Morgan Income ETF (JPIE). I purchased modest amounts of both the Vanguard Multi-Sector Income Bond (VMSAX) and Fidelity Strategic Income (FADMX) for Traditional IRAs. Table #10: High Performing Multi-Sector Income Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #9: High Performing Multi-Sector Income Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt: Funds that invest primarily in investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with dollar-weighted average maturities of one to five years. I favor Great Owl First Trust Short Maturity ETF (FTSM) for its low volatility and drawdown. I own Fidelity Intermediate Bond (FTHRX) but traded a modest portion for other bond funds discussed in this article. Table #11: High Performing Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #10: High Performing Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Lipper U.S. Mutual Fund Classification Core Plus Bond Funds: Funds that invest at least 65% in domestic investment-grade debt issues (rated in the top four grades) with any remaining investment in non-benchmark sectors such as high-yield, global, and emerging market debt. These funds maintain dollar-weighted average maturities of five to ten years. This is my least favorite category as its total return has been hampered as rates rose because of its longer duration, but I will continue to monitor it throughout the year. It is a category that I may want to own in the future as longer-term rates stabilize. The standout core plus bond fund is the Great Owl American Century Diversified Corporate Bond ETF (KORP). Table #12: High Performing Core Plus Bond Funds (2.5 Year Metrics) Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Figure #11 shows the one-year trends on core plus funds have been strong but the recent three-month trends are waving red flags. I will continue to monitor. Figure #11: High Performing Core Plus Bond Funds Source: Author Using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. To prepare for 2025, I invested in high-yielding funds with low to moderate risk. These are the low-hanging fruit. There is plenty of opportunity to increase yields along with higher risk by investing in different funds within the same categories. It is possible to find funds with higher yields in other Lipper Categories. They usually have an Aggressive or Very Aggressive MFO Risk Rank, usually accompanied by below-average risk-adjusted performance as measured by MFO Rank, and often with very high expenses.

Title: Real-World Asset Tokens Lead Crypto Rebound as Tokenization Narrative Gathers Steam

Cryptocurrencies in the real-world asset (RWA) sector led the recovery of the broader digital asset market from the overnight bloodbath, underscoring the strength of the tokenization investment narrative. Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokenized asset platform Ondo Finance's governance token was 16% higher on the day, surging almost 40% from the overnight lows. The protocol today unveiled Ondo Nexus, an instant minting and redemption service for tokenized Treasury issuers. The company behind the protocol is holding a summit in New York later this week with several traditional finance heavyweights including BlackRock, Franklin Templeton participating. The native token of MANTRA (OM), layer-1 blockchain designed for tokenized assets focusing on the Middle East market, rebounded 30% from Monday's bottom and was up 16% on the day. The network last month announced a billion-dollar asset tokenization partnership with Dubai property conglomerate DAMAC Group encompassing real estate and data center investments. The native token of Chintai (CHEX), a tokenization platform regulated and licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, advanced 27% during the same period. The protocol laid out plans late January to enter the U.S. market and pursue securities licensing in the country. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) rebounded above $101,000 from the overnight lows and was 4% higher in a 24-hour period. The broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index consisting of large-cap tokens lagged with a 2% gain. Sophisticated investors often analyze the fastest horses recovering from capitulation lows to identify underlying strength in the broader market. RWA tokenization is a red-hot sector that aims to bring traditional financial assets like bonds, commodities and real estate on blockchain rails. with increasing participation from global banks and governments fueling the momentum. The RWA sector saw a 200% expansion to $7.3 billion in total value locked (TVL) last year, with government securities protocols leading the growth, crypto trading firm Wintermute noted. Recently, various influential leaders in the financial world touted tokenized RWAs as the next frontier of financial innovation with a potential to become a multitrillion-dollar market this decade. Larry Fink, CEO of asset management behemoth BlackRock, urged U.S. regulators and policymakers to create rules for tokenized securities, envisioning that bonds and stocks will be traded on blockchain rails in the future. He was joined by Robinhood co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev last week, who proposed rule changes to unlock tokenized private equities to retail investors, currently limited to accredited investors and wealthy individuals. UPDATE (Feb. 3, 21:10 UTC): Adds RWA sector expansion data from Wintermute. Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

Title: From JPMorgan to BlackRock: The 15 financial firms that file the most H-1B immigrant work visas
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/financial-companies-sponsor-h1b-visas-jpmorgan-goldman-sachs-blackrock-trump-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-02-03T19:53:26Z
Full Content:
As President Donald Trump follows through on his campaign promises to crack down on immigration, questions remain about what might happen to skilled workers who come to the US on H-1B visas. Trump targeted the H-1B visa program in his first term when he signed the "Buy American, Hire American" executive order to rein in potential abuses. Ahead of the second term, however, he told the New York Post that he "always liked the visas," which US companies use to hire foreign workers with specialized skills, often in science and technology. "I've been a believer in H-1B," he told the Post in December. "I have used it many times. It's a great program." Still, the program's future remains very much up in the air: Last week, two Republican senators introduced a joint resolution to strike down a Biden-era rule allowing such visas to be automatically extended for 540 days, instead of 180 days. As such, Business Insider has run the numbers to find out which US financial services companies stand to be affected the most if these visas are tamped down again. BI used data from the Department of Labor and US Citizenship and Immigration data to analyze which financial giants file the most H-1B requests. The data covered the 2024 government fiscal year (the fourth quarter of 2023 through the third quarter of 2024) and was collected from applications submitted by businesses that wish to sponsor a skilled worker's visa. We found that some of the largest banks, credit card companies, and asset managers are among the most active sponsors of these visas, including JPMorgan and BlackRock. While many of the filings seek tech and software workers, some firms have used them to hire investment bankers or investment professionals. Of course, not all filings lead to a hire and some filings may actually be for the same hire, as firms will refile to reflect amendments or to extend an existing visa. Still, the publicly available data provides a good indication of the H-1B visa demand among major companies. The firms listed either did not respond to a request for comment or declined to comment on the record. Check out which financial firms are sponsoring the most H-1B visas, including the types of roles they are looking to fill: Total certified H-1B filings: 1,990 Total employees worldwide: 317,233 as of the end of 2024 Types of filings: More than 1,500 filings are for workers with "software" in their title. The firm also hired for roles like a vice president of investment banking, an executive director of liquidity risk management, and a managing director of client fraud prevention.

The company has also hired some divisional COO and CFOs through the program, as well as managing directors in areas like banking and financial crime control. Total certified H-1B filings: 1,058 Total employees worldwide: 239,000 Types of filings: Many of the filings are for tech roles, such as software engineering, application development, and information technology roles.

The filings range from the associate level up to managing director. Total certified H-1B filings: 609 Total employees worldwide: Approximately 85,000, per its corporate website Types of filings: Most of Barclay's filings are for tech roles, but the company has also hired for director roles in global markets, equity derivatives structuring, and a credit desk quant role. Total certified H-1B filings: 587 Total employees worldwide: 31,600, according to a December 4 report Types of filings: The vast majority of filings are for tech roles, including a senior machine learning engineer and a variety of software engineers. Other filings include a senior M&A manager and a senior finance manager. Total certified H-1B filings: 575 Total employees worldwide: 74,000, per a 2024 press release Types of filings: Nearly a third of AmEx's filings are for manager roles, and the vast majority of those are in the tech and data science sectors of the business. The company has also filed for director roles in investment management and marketing analytics. Total certified H-1B filings: 500 Total employees worldwide: 213,193, as of the end of 2024 Types of filings: Similar to others on the list, most of Bank of America's H-1B filings are for tech roles, but the company has also hired a credit senior officer in a director role, an associate general counsel, and a VP who works with financial derivatives. Total certified H-1B filings: 453 Total employees worldwide: 220,167, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 Types of filings: Nearly 300 of Wells Fargo's filings are for roles with software in the title, but the firm had also filed for roles including a construction management director and a lead securities trader. Total certified H-1B filings: 447 Total employees worldwide: 33,400 employees at the end of 2023, per an annual report Types of filings: Mastercard has made 220 H-1B filings for roles with software in the title, while another 64 include the word "product" in the name. Other filings include roles such as a vice president of marketing, strategy, and operations, and a commercial counsel role. Total certified H-1B filings: 429 Total employees worldwide: 32,100, as of the end of the third quarter of 2024 Types of filing: More than 80% of roles have software in the name, though the company has also filed for director roles in business strategy, market risk management, and treasury capital markets. Total certified H-1B filings: 354 Total employees worldwide: More than 20,000 globally Types of filings: The vast majority of BlackRock's H-1B filings only note the role level.

The move reduces fees on 87 different funds, and 168 total share classes of those funds. The average fee cut is 20% per share class. Vanguard said this is its biggest fee cut ever and will save investors about $350 million this year, based on current asset levels. "We're proud to build on Vanguard's legacy of lowering the costs of investing—which we have done more than 2,000 times since our founding—by announcing our largest ever set of expense ratio reductions. Lower costs enable investors to keep more of their returns, and those savings compound over time," Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji said in a press release. The list of cuts includes actively managed and index-based products, with many of the funds representing billions of dollars. Stocks, bonds and commodities products are all included in the reductions. Some of the funds on the Vanguard list include: Fund fees for mutual funds and ETFs are assessed as an annual percentage of total assets under management for the share class. The fee cuts to VEGBX and some other actively managed bond funds is notable because active fixed income is emerging as a growth area for the exchange-traded fund industry. The booming popularity of ETFs, which can be purchased more easily than many mutual funds, is often cited as a key factor in driving down management fees for stock funds in recent decades. Vanguard said its actively managed fixed income funds and ETFs have a weighted average expense ratio of 0.10% versus an industry average of 0.53%. Vanguard has long been a leader in lowering fees among asset managers, a tradition dating back to its founder, Jack Bogle. Monday's announcement is a sign that the trend could continue under Ramji, who took over as CEO in 2024 and previously worked at rival BlackRock. The fee cuts come less than a month after Vanguard agreed to pay more than $100 million to settle charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to disclosures around some of its retirement products.

Title: Why more retirement-age Americans keep working
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/personal-finance/retirement-age-americans-keep-working-rcna190469
Time Published: 2025-02-03T17:31:15Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time When it came time for Diane Wetherington to consider retirement, reality quickly set in. The 72-year-old debated devoting her time to crafting and doting over her grandkids and even gave full-time retirement a try. But she soon realized her Social Security checks, which were smaller than her peers’ due to time she spent out of the workforce while raising children, wouldn’t be enough to cover travel or rising insurance costs on top of basic needs. Now, the Central Florida resident works part time as a remote contracting agent in local government. While she sometimes has to miss out on plans with fully retired friends, she said, continuing to work has kept her budget sound and her mind active. “It’s just getting very hard to make ends meet,” Wetherington said. “The way the world is right now, everything’s going up, up, up.” Wetherington is part of a growing body of Americans staying in the workforce past 65, once a traditional marker for retirement. This trend has buoyed the national labor market after years defined by pandemic-induced worker shortages and high quitting rates. It’s also changed the financial outlook for those who remain employed in some capacity, whether for personal satisfaction or monetary need. This trend should be more apparent than ever in 2025, when more Americans are expected to turn 65 than in any past year, according to a widely read study from the Alliance for Lifetime Income. It dubbed a multiyear period in the late 2020s as the “Peak 65 zone.” The number of employed Americans 65 and older ballooned more than 33% between 2015 and 2024, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. By comparison, the labor force for all workers 16 or older has increased less than 9% during the same time period. That growth has meant workers ages 65 and older accounted for 7% of the total workforce in 2024. That share is up from around 5.7% a decade ago. “It’s really hard for many employers in many sectors to fill key workforce needs right now,” said Jim Malatras, strategy chief at FedCap, a nonprofit that helps train and place people in jobs. Tapping this age group “can help build key capacity where it’s desperately needed.” While the swelling number of workers in this age bracket — more than 11 million in 2024 — has gained attention in recent years, the reasons for this outsized growth date back decades. Chief among the drivers is the fact that America’s population is aging, according to Laura Quinby, an associate director at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. But structural shifts in the retirement system have also encouraged working later in life, Quinby said. The transition in the private sector from employer-funded pensions to 401(k)s and other defined-contribution plans created a need for many workers to remain employed longer. Social Security reforms in the 1980s pushed the program’s “full retirement age” from 65 to 67. “People really do use the Social Security full retirement age as an anchor in terms of when they should retire and claim benefits,” Quinby said. “That shift triggered a trend in people working longer.” Longer life spans have pushed a growing chorus of voices to call for the age of retirement to move back even further, especially as financial uncertainties swirl around Social Security. BlackRock Chair Larry Fink, for instance, said in an annual letter that it’s “a bit crazy” that the expectation of retiring at 65 “originates from the time of the Ottoman Empire.” Yet there are vastly different reasons and experiences for people of retirement age to continue working in some capacity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School’s Retirement Equity Lab. Some do retire, and some continue to work in jobs that they love out of passion alone. But she said about two-thirds of those still working do it “because they have to.” They can be in jobs with high physical or mental requirements, she said, but they see few alternatives, given that their Social Security checks can’t sustain them. “I call it the tale of two retirements,” Ghilarducci said. Employers of all kinds have tried to win and retain this growing base of talent. Booking.com parent Booking Holdings offers 10 days off annually for so-called grandparent leave, which is separate from time offered to new parents and other paid days off. Grocery store chain Wegmans has a section of its part-time jobs page specifically targeted to seniors, advertising the opportunity to stay active and earn income during retirement. Retirement-age workers can be seen working in gift shops or greeting restaurant guests for Xanterra, a travel company that owns properties in and around national parks. The company has a program called Helping Hands, which allows Xanterra to staff up during the peak tourist season by offering gigs that typically last a month and a half with 30-hour workweeks. “The retirement community, or that older workforce, is really an integral part of our overall workforce planning strategy,” said Shannon Dierenbach, Xanterra’s human resources chief. “They certainly bring a level of expertise, wisdom, life skills, perspective that really enhances the overall experience.” Despite these anecdotes, advocates say a pervasive culture of ageism has continued to hurt these Americans in the workforce. “They’re like vintage cars to us,” said FedCap’s Malatras. “They’re built to last, they’re full of value, but they’re treated often like high-mileage Pintos, and they don’t really have an opportunity to serve anymore.” Employers hoping to better advertise to this community should look at job descriptions and pictures on their jobs pages to ensure there aren’t any subtle signs they favor younger applicants, according to Heather Tinsley-Fix, senior advisor for employer engagement at AARP. She often encourages employers looking for older workers to sign AARP’s pledge, in which businesses commit to measures supporting age equality. Removing college degree requirements can also help gain the attention of this pool, she said, given that a smaller share completed higher education compared with younger generations. Working from home is a key component of flexibility that these older workers may need, Tinsley-Fix said. Part of Tinsley-Fix’s argument for employers is the impending “tsunami” of retirements expected within the next decade. If companies don’t tap into groups they previously overlooked, she warned, they’ll struggle to stay at full staffing, as not enough people enter the workforce each year to replace those who left. Her pitch isn’t all doom-and-gloom, however. Tinsley-Fix said there’s a silver lining: These workers tend to excel at soft skills and can provide mentorship to younger staffers. At Xanterra’s sites, for example, retirement-age workers interact particularly well with customers and stay calm under pressure, Dierenbach said. “People talk about all kinds of spillover dividends from having older workers on their teams,” Tinsley-Fix said. “They really benefit from having those folks.” Those who remain employed do so for a variety of reasons. Multiple workers from this age group told CNBC that no matter the initial rationale — whether financial needs or personal preference — that got them to stay or return to the workforce, they’ve benefited physically and mentally. “It was the best thing that ever happened to me,” said Shari Nelson, who began working for nonprofit Vantage Aging through its government-supported job placement program and was hired to stay on after completing it. The Ohio resident, who works part-time, said the paycheck allows her the financial security to be the kind of grandmother past generations in her family have been. Nelson’s role was previously full-time, but Vantage broke it up into two positions with fewer hours to better accommodate older workers. Nonprofits were the most popular industry for workers in this age bracket at the end of 2024, with more than 1 out of every 12 in the sector, according to data from payroll platform Gusto. Among the small businesses using Gusto, the firm found the share of workers 65 or older has surged more than 50% since January 2019. Government is another popular area, according to Gusto. That’s where Florida resident Anne Sallee, who was once a public official, found herself after she decided a full retirement wasn’t for her. Sallee, who had a long career as a paralegal and now works as an economic development coordinator, said the return to in-person office work was a “shock” after more than a decade away. However, she said the personal benefits of having deadlines and a routine, as well as a passion for the role, keep her coming back. “I don’t enjoy not having things I have to do,” Sallee said. “I never envisioned the ‘sit on the beach with your feet up and a cocktail’ kind of lifestyle.” Still, Sallee said she’s taken some liberties that she may not have early in her career or when starting a new position. For instance, the 68-year-old avoids working overtime and takes a three-week vacation annually. “If that ever becomes a problem,” she said of her yearly stretch of time off, “the vacation will take priority.” © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Texas Stock Exchange Raises $161 Million, Sees 2026 Trading Start

TXSE Group Inc., parent company of the proposed Texas Stock Exchange, closed its initial fundraising round at $161 million and said the TXSE has filed for registration as a bourse with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. If the registration is granted, trading would start in early 2026, the company said in a statement Friday. It had previously said trading would begin by the end of this year. The exchange – whose backers include BlackRock Inc. and Citadel Securities – is still targeting its first listings for next year. The upstart TXSE is seeking to join a handful of smaller bourses that are trying to bite off market share from the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, which dominate US public-equity trading. The challengers are battling for a piece of a shrinking pie: Listings have declined precipitously since the 1990s as the rise of private equity has made it easier for companies to avoid the costs of going public for longer. Additionally, the majority of US stock trades is now consistently occurring outside of public exchanges. The proposed Texas bourse says it wants to lower the cost of going public while “revitalizing competition for listings and enhancing trading in the US capital markets,” TXSE Chief Executive Officer James Lee said in the statement. The company was able to boost its capital raise by about $40 million since it disclosed in June that it had brought in $120 million. Other investors include Charles Schwab Corp. and Michael Dell’s family investment office. In addition to equities, the Dallas-based bourse plans to host auctions and sell exchange-traded products and data. It’s still looking for a space to house its permanent headquarters, which will contain offices, a conference center and a television studio complete with an opening bell. Topics Texas

Title: Betrayed by Green Capitalism, Here’s How We Can Build a Livable Future
URL: https://inthesetimes.com/article/green-capitalism-climate-framework-failure-rooted-networks-better-future
Time Published: 2025-02-03T16:00:00Z

In one way of measuring it, the mainstream framework to address the climate crisis has been a huge success. Promoting green energy, electric vehicles, conservation zones, carbon credits, carbon capture, and other new technologies has made billions of dollars for companies like Tesla, Google, NextEra Energy, British Petroleum, Saudi Aramco, Tongwei Solar, McKinsey & Company, and BlackRock. Governments have gained power through increased interventions in economic planning, and authoritarian regimes from China and India to Canada and the U.S. now have a new justification to carry out land theft against Indigenous and rural populations. And millions more NGO directors, aid workers, diplomats, accountants, entrepreneurs, engineers, academics, and scientists get a hand-out in the form of high salary employment managing the crisis. Where the mainstream climate framework has been less successful: Doing anything to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions driving the climate crisis. Nor has the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledged the reasons for this failure or presented a plan based in reality. Here are some truths the mainstream climate framework downplays, ignores, or covers up: There are tremendous short-term benefits to legitimizing the failed climate framework: jobs, money, attention, power, the comforting belief that those in charge are going to keep us safe. Likewise, there are immense obstacles to developing realistic alternatives: Lack of rewards, marginalization and silencing, state and corporate repression. The result is a sort of self-reinforcing confirmation bias. People aren’t exposed to the gaping holes in the official framework or to examples of the kind of changes we actually need, alternatives remain easy to marginalize as ​“fringe,” and the failed framework maintains its fatal monopoly. Our survival depends on escaping the dead-end cataclysm of the official response. But, we can’t enact solutions we’re unable to imagine — so let’s start imagining a real solution. It won’t be an easy exercise: We’ll have to jettison the entire institutional complex that has caused and is managing the problem. We’ll also have to envision change occurring through a completely different paradigm than the one we’re brought up believing in. There isn’t really an alternative, since the official framework doesn’t constitute a viable plan. And everything we do toward an ecological revolution makes our own lives better, makes our own ecosystem more resilient, and increases everyone’s chances for collective survival. (Editor’s Note: For more discussion of the research and reasoning behind these arguments, read the companion piece here.) A paradigm and a practice that could successfully confront the ecological crisis is one based on what I would call rooted networks. Rooted networks are ecosystemic and interdependent. They allow for everyone to define their own needs, to build their own relationships with their specific habitat, and to share resources and feedback throughout their habitat and across the entire system. The basic operating principles of rooted networks are: This paradigm allows each of us to maximize our potential for action and our unique knowledge, and to amplify both through relationships of mutual aid. Rather than small groups of experts and owners imposing blueprints on a disempowered society and muted landscape, we would all increase our connectivity to our neighbors and the land, understand their needs and their history, and build from there. Can you already hear that voice in your head braying out that such an approach is naïve? It’s strange how that’s the orthodox position in our politics. In the fields of urban science and computer science, AI or machine learning, neuroscience, encyclopedias, comparative cognition, the study of mycelial networks and ecosystems and other complex systems, the social organization of insects with large population groups, the data is practically endless: Decentralized networks have a high capacity for communication, learning, and innovation; they often have a sophisticated capacity for self-organization; and they tend to be more resilient in adverse circumstances where centralized, hierarchical systems are likely to catastrophically collapse. There are also countless examples of decentralized, complex, resilient societies throughout human history, continuing into the present. These include the hundreds of interlaced peoples of Zomia—the southeast Asian highlands— who are surrounded but still unconquered by some of the strongest and longest lasting states in history; the Amazigh of northern Africa; the Mayan peoples of the Yucatan Peninsula and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; the Mapuche of the Andes and the Pacific coast; the four hundred Indigenous peoples of the Amazon. These are societies who have defeated empires and colonizers, who have survived and adapted to earlier collapses, or who overthrew their own ruling classes. They are peoples who find abundance and safety in ecosystems where states only see desert, who have cultivated the richest rain forests on the planet, and who even in the 20th and 21st centuries have launched major rebellions against oppression. Their traditional social structures provide them with decentralized networks and federations that are a major source of their resilience. An important strategy of colonialism has been to erase these histories and destroy or marginalize these cultures so we have to depend on those in power, believing hierarchies to be natural, believing states to be inevitable. But the truth of the matter is that decentralized networks are practical, they’re intelligent, and they work. The first few years after an ecological revolution will be hard, despite the intelligence and resilience of rooted networks, though many benefits will appear immediately. And we’ll avoid the worst of the suffering that lies ahead should we stick with the mainstream climate framework. The top priorities are food, housing, and healthcare for everybody. Capitalist property laws, car- and airplane-based transportation systems, industrial mono-cropping, and borders are threats to our health, so we abolish, destroy, or transform them. Climate refugees and unhoused people seize mansions and vacation homes, and the rest of us support them because universal housing is more important than the property titles of the rich. With climate disasters like wildfires and hurricanes, everyone’s homes are at risk, so empathy comes easier to most of us. We distribute all the food we find in supermarkets and warehouses, then turn lawns, golf courses, parking lots, and highways into orchards, gardens, forests, meadows, and wetlands. As we transition away from industrial mono-cropping, we gain some breathing room by harvesting fields that are already planted, planting the next seasons’ seed stores, and eating the livestock bred to satisfy the machinery of capitalist meat production. Without money, wages are no longer an incentive. The acceptance and goodwill of one’s neighbors isn’t just a mental health benefit: It becomes the basis for our survival, motivating us to learn cooperative practices. Workers in high pollution industries — once the bosses have no more power and there’s no rent to pay — will decide to protect their own water supplies, their own neighbors and families. They’ll cap oil and gas wells and phase out nuclear power plants on the safest timeline. The communities that inhabit affected watersheds will decide whether and how to dismantle hydroelectric dams. Fossil fuel emissions will begin declining immediately, reaching zero within a few years. As energy supplies diminish, priority will be given to healthcare facilities, food production facilities, factories that produce necessary tools and resources, and for seasonal heating or cooling in regions with extreme temperatures. Medical research will continue around the world, with the material support of regional community networks rather than the pharmaceutical industry. Those historically abused or silenced by the medical industry will be able to assert their own experiences, knowledge, and needs. Together, we will generate an informed prediction of the most frequent health problems that are likely to affect us over the coming years despite improved diets, healthier lifestyles, and drastic reductions in environmental toxins. This will help determine which high-tech production facilities for drugs and equipment are still necessary, and what resources they need to continue operation. Global networks will carry out similar assessments in other vital sectors like housing, travel, transport, communication, and food. Communities across the world will scrap and recycle unnecessary machinery and capitalism’s abundant trash, shut down or repurpose the factories, and build towards the material autonomy of every regional network of communities. The general organizational principles are these: Especially in the first few years of the revolution, one of the key activities is to shift resources globally to undo the forced dependence and vulnerability caused by colonialism. No country should ever have been turned into a plantation or mining pit for global capitalism, and no revolution will be complete if it forgets about the legacies of colonialism. Using cargo ships, airplanes, and remaining fuel reserves, a global network of former shipping industry workers, revolutionaries, community organizers, and engineers transport whatever is required for historically colonized regions to attain regional self-sufficiency, producing the tools they need for whatever technological culture they choose, so long as it does not damage the health and freedom of others. After about twelve years of major upheavals, life has settled into a much more comforting pattern. Communities source the vast majority of their food locally. Coastal communities might travel farther for food, when fishing, but they’re using sustainable, ancestral techniques: no trawling, drift nets, purse-seine nets, or dynamite. Food self-sufficiency means that if anything impedes the movement of food across a continent, the situation is uncomfortable for a season or two, but no one’s survival is threatened. And, if some disaster wreaks havoc on a community’s fields, herds, or orchards, they can use the relationships and infrastructure linking them to other communities to get their food from elsewhere. Nearly all the fruit and nut trees we planted in the early years are providing us with abundant harvests for a small amount of labor every year. The trees provide habitat and nourishment for other species in our ecosystem. The yearly piles of pruned branches provide an additional carbon-neutral fuel source. Together with companion planting and ecological grazing, we’re regenerating the soil and nourishing ourselves with the healthiest diets possible. In the first years, every community identified the least polluted land in their area for planting orchards, gardens, and pastures. Moderately polluted lands are reforested and the trees harvested there are used as building material. The most polluted lands can be slowly recovered with bioremediation and other techniques. Every community tends to wetlands, estuaries, meadows, and forests along its margins. In these spaces, we hunt species like deer that rely on us for a healthy rate of predation. We practice regenerative grazing with goats, sheep, chickens, cows, and llamas, reducing the intensity of wildfires and re-fertilizing soil. We collect medicinal herbs and harvest building materials like clay or wood, always in a respectful way, attentive to our impact, focused on helping our ecosystems grow stronger. On abandoned urban blocks, people tend to the jungles sprouting from the empty structures. Fungal networks, trees, insects, and hardy grasses are breaking down the concrete or asphalt covering the earth, slowly remediating the toxins, and turning a wasteland into a vibrant habitat. Housing patterns shift considerably. Most people prefer to adapt and repurpose what is in front of them, though thousands of idealistic, innovative communes also spring up on depleted agricultural land or in abandoned strip malls. Cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants generally shrink by about half in the first dozen years, whereas rural populations double or triple. A huge amount of work has to go into scrapping or renovating the wretched housing stock left over from capitalism. The new standard is for structures to last a hundred years or more without major repairs, to use techniques like passive solar and good air circulation for self-heating and self-cooling, and to have efficient, small-scale energy production built into the very design of our towns and neighborhoods. In cities, the best housing blocks are taken over and improved, while other blocks are used for workshops, factories, storage, or knocked down and gradually converted into habitat and, if the soil allows, gardens and orchards. In the countryside, people reform existing large structures or build new ones to create multiple houses, workshops, barns, and storage places clustered together. These clusters share walls and heat. They facilitate communal cooking on a larger scale and simplify the logistics for things like clean water, water remediation, composting, methane harvesting from compost and livestock, and efficient electricity generation. Ultimately, the divide between urban and rural has eroded, as nearly a quarter of the world’s population moves seasonally between rural villages and city neighborhoods, according to weather or labor-intensive agricultural activities like a harvest. Most villages and urban neighborhoods exist in pairs, with a declared bond and a circulation of inhabitants between a specific city block and a village that might be 50-100 miles away. People moving between the sites a couple times a year gain perspective and experience, and their mixed loyalties facilitate mutual aid and prevent the historical domination of urban centers over agricultural zones. Nomadic peoples, from Travellers to Bedouin, have made a huge comeback, aided by the abolition of borders and nation-states. So too have some of the major biomes worst impacted by capitalism. The commercial ​“forests” that took up land, depleted soil, and fueled wildfires from Canada to Chile have been transformed into real forests again, complex ecosystems that give life to thousands of species and provide a range of renewable resources to human communities. Likewise, the Great Plains and similar ecosystems from Siberia to the Serengeti are freed from the depravities of a capitalist market, whether in the form of industrial-scale beef and dairy production, gas and oil extraction or colonial conservationism and eco-tourism. On the Great Plains, for example, once dominant cattle ranchers, with no more industrial market to sell to and few protections against poachers and fence cutters, have either turned to smaller scale, intensive grazing practices that helped restore the prairies, or they moved out. Indigenous peoples and trusted friends and accomplices they invited along recovered most of their lands and are helping restore them by dismantling dams and pipelines and adapting traditional technologies, food cultures, and spirituality. Desertification has slowed significantly, and by the end of the century it’s predicted there will be at least four million wild bison, roaming free again. The abolition of borders and the recovery of large biomes have made a critical difference in one adaptive response that everyone should have access to for survival: migration. Humans living in regions that mining companies have turned into wastelands or that militaries have filled with depleted uranium need support as they leave their homes behind. And whoever migrates needs a warm welcome, some place to put down roots again. Ecosystems also migrate, and some species and habitats have to migrate rapidly away from the tropics or to higher elevations. A revolutionary response to the ecological crisis does much to mitigate the harm and turbulence, but the climate is already changing thanks to the last two hundred years of capitalist greed. Borders, highways, and the biodiversity deserts of asphalted cities, the lawns and parking lots of suburbia, were all huge impediments to migration. Now, attentive, ecologically-minded human communities aid migration — the migration of fellow humans, of other species, and of entire ecosystems. With universal healthcare and housing, an immediate decrease of toxins in our air, water, and food, and the recovery of Indigenous or locally-adapted food cultures, our health and happiness improve dramatically. Social decentralization and the abolition of borders allow us much greater resilience to the disasters caused by capitalism. With the end of fossil fuel production, commercial forestry, cement production, and capitalist food production, greenhouse gas emissions flip from the catastrophic levels permitted by the mainstream climate framework and move into negative numbers. Within about a decade, hundreds of millions of new trees and soil recovery across all the billions of acres of agricultural land on the planet has absorbed significant quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere. Energy production has hit net zero, with the shift towards clean-burning biofuels, mostly passive wind and solar, and maintenance of about half of the pre-existing hydroelectric infrastructure. Catastrophic floods and wildfires which release huge amounts of methane and carbon — and are usually left off the emissions balance sheets — decline sharply or are eliminated. And without states, the frequency and intensity of warfare, and its massive and uncounted carbon emissions, diminishes drastically. Coming back to the depressing reality of 2025: the IPCC is pushing for the global economy to reach net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. They also have a perfect track record of failure and no realistic methodology for reaching their target. The approach I’m describing here can effectively do better than net zero. It even has the possibility to quickly remove enough CO2 and methane from the atmosphere to stop the cascade of tipping points that capitalism has already begun to trigger, a cascade that would lock in 3-5ºC of warming and cause death, extinction, and suffering on an unprecedented scale. This approach benefits from being complex and intersectional. It improves quality of life, universalizes access to quality healthcare and housing, and takes major steps to heal the enduring legacies of white supremacy and colonialism. The mainstream approach, on the contrary, exacerbates many preexisting inequalities and rewards the corporations and institutions responsible for the disaster. No matter when we adopt a realistic response to the ecological crisis, it will be better for our own lives, for future generations, and for all life on this planet. It removes the filters that prevent us from seeing the problem. It empowers us to take action for our shared survival. And it gives us greater resilience to adapt and overcome.
