Election 2024 coverage presented by Lazard (LAZ), a 175-year old global financial services and asset management company, is the latest among traditional financial players jumping on the asset tokenization trend, planning to create tokenized funds with Bitfinex Securities and SkyBridge Invest. The tokenized funds will be set up and issued under Kazakhstan's financial services law, under regulatory oversight of Astana Financial Services Authority (AFSA), where SkyBridge and Bitfinex are licensed to operate. Bitfinex Securities is responsible for the tokenization process, while SkyBridge will act as broker and manager of the tokenized fund. The products will be available to retail users, but with certain geographic limitations, and available to be purchased with Tether's stablecoin (USDT). Representatives of the companies involved signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) toward creating the tokenized funds on Friday in Lugano, Switzerland at a side event during the Plan B conference. The vehicle will offer exposure in a "fund of funds" structure to various existing Lazard-managed funds focused on global equities and emerging market equities, which have been available only to professional investors and institutions before, Matthias Kruse, managing director at Lazard, told CoinDesk. "We are a B2B [business-to-business] investment firm, and this is a good way for us to service retail investors," Kruse said. Kruse also touted tokenization as a process that improves efficiency, liquidity and helps lower operational costs. Tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) is a rapidly growing sector in the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance that involves placing assets such as bonds, credit and funds on blockchain rails. Participants do so in pursuit of faster settlements and increased efficiency compared to traditional financial plumbing. The tokenization trend came to the forefront this year with global banks and asset managers, including BlackRock, HSBC starting offering tokenized products. The RWA market is poised to become a multi-trillion dollar market over the coming years, according to McKinsey, BCG, 21Shares and Bernstein. Lazard's asset management business has $245 billion of assets under management (AUM). SkyBridge Invest is a Kazakhstan-based investment services firm, different from SkyBridge Capital of veteran Wall Street hedge funder Anthony Scaramucci. Bitfinex Securities is a licensed trading venue in El Salvador and Kazakhstan. Bitfinex Securities is the tokenization platform arm of crypto trading venue Bitfinex. Edited by Stephen Alpher.

Title: Microsoft Board says no to Bitcoin: What’s behind the decision?

Microsoft’s board evaluates Bitcoin, but advises against adopting this strategy now. Microsoft’s upcoming shareholder meeting on the 10th of December is set to capture significant attention. A notable proposal for the tech giant to explore Bitcoin [BTC] investments will be a part of the meeting’s agenda. According to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microsoft’s board and shareholders will address several key issues at the meeting. These include the suggestion to adopt BTC as a hedge against inflation and broader economic shifts. However, Microsoft’s board has advised a vote against this proposal, stating that the company has already given careful consideration to such strategies, according to the filing. As outlined in a company statement opposing the proposal, Microsoft emphasized its stance against Bitcoin investment. “Past evaluations have included Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies among the options considered, and Microsoft continues to monitor trends and developments related to cryptocurrencies to inform future decision making.” This proposal, initiated by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), pointed to MicroStrategy’s notable Bitcoin investment approach, which it claims has outperformed Microsoft’s stock by over 300% in the past year despite the smaller scale of MicroStrategy’s operations. The NCPPR also highlighted the growing trend of institutional and corporate interest in BTC. This included through spot Bitcoin ETFs, and argued that, although Bitcoin remains volatile, it could act as a potential hedge against inflation and declining corporate bond yields. ”At minimum, companies should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 1% of its assets in Bitcoin.” BTC institutional holdings has grown remarkably, with top players like Satoshi Nakamoto, Binance, BlackRock, Grayscale, and MicroStrategy all steadily increasing their stakes in the leading cryptocurrency. Hence, the race to secure Bitcoin has intensified to the point where BTC ETFs are nearing the total holdings attributed to Nakamoto, as highlighted by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. In fact, MicroStrategy’s prominent Bitcoin acquisition strategy has further inspired entities such as Japan’s Metaplanet. The organization recently raised 10 billion Yen through a fresh stock issuance as part of its 11th series of Stock Acquisition Rights. Tesla’s Q3 report also underscored its role as the fourth-largest BTC holder among U.S.-listed firms, trailing MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Riot Platforms. Moreover, SpaceX’s 8,285 BTC—valued at roughly $560 million—cements its position as the seventh-largest private Bitcoin holder. As of the 25th of October, BTC was trading at $67,576.65, showing a 1.02% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. In contrast, Microsoft (MSFT) shares saw minimal movement, closing at $424.7 on the 24th of October with a slight uptick of 0.03%, per Google Finance. By the 25th of October, MSFT shares had inched up further to $424.73, marking a modest 0.13% rise.

Title: ‘Money in Exchange for Silence’: Behind Neom’s Green Image, Western Firms Cash in on Saudi Commitment to Oil

Lambert here: Strong original reporting from DeSmog. Every so often, Saudi propaganda for Neom comes across my feed, and it’s obviously a grandiose real estate development signaling some sort of horrid end state; the very last thing the Saudi people need is an indoor ski resort. But I didn’t realize how grandiose. Ka-ching ka-ching. By Adam M. Lowenstein, a freelance journalist and writer covering the climate crisis, capitalism, and corporate power. A former Capitol Hill aide and U.S. Senate speechwriter, his work has also appeared in The Atlantic, The Guardian, The American Prospect, The Lever, and other publications. Originally published at DeSmog. The video opens with the voice of a child. “Since the beginning, we’ve changed things,” she says. “It’s in our genes. It’s what makes us human.” The viewer zooms through stages in human development — agriculture, science, air travel, space flight. A dramatic musical score rises steadily in volume. “Now, we have a chance to change everything,” the narrator intones, as the camera comes to rest on a blank canvas. After a beat, water explodes across the screen, soaking the frame. “Let’s change water,” she says, “so it flows forever. Energy, so it powers our lives sustainably.” From climate change and food security to aging and mobility, the video proceeds topic by topic, issuing an inspiring call to action — one seen more than 22 million times on YouTube, and by countless others on massive screens in New York City’s Times Square. “This is where we can change it all,” the narrator intones. “Neom,” she concludes, is “made to change.” “Neom” is the brainchild and flagship construction project of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the ruler-in-waiting and de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. Designed hand-in-hand with elite Western consulting firms McKinsey & Company, Oliver Wyman, and Boston Consulting Group (BCG), and named for a combination of “neo” and “mustaqbal” — the Greek and Arabic words for “new” and “future” — Neom is portrayed as a futuristic, emissions-free utopia in the country’s northwest Tabuk province, which sits along the coast of the Red Sea. The mega-development is chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed and owned by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia’s $900 billion sovereign wealth fund, which the crown prince also chairs. As the “made to change” video suggests, Neom’s promotional efforts often consist of fanciful digital renderings of luxurious resorts and futuristic cityscapes replete with lush greenery, vibrant natural wonders, and promises of ecological and environmental preservation. “Sustainability is a very big theme in everything that we do,” Rayan Fayez, Neom’s deputy CEO, told an audience in Rio de Janeiro in June. Fayez was addressing an event organized by the Future Investment Initiative (FII) Institute, a PIF-led nonprofit that convenes investors and global power players in cities around the world. Some of America’s wealthiest investors and chief executives will be speaking at this year’s flagship FII gathering known as “Davos in the Desert” — which will take place in the Saudi capital of Riyadh from October 29-31 — including Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google; Stephen Schwarzman, the head of the private equity giant Blackstone; and Larry Fink, CEO of the asset manager BlackRock. The FII Institute counts Neom as a “strategic partner.” Paradoxically for a project cloaked in green branding, Neom — or at least the idea of Neom — has emerged as an important asset in the Saudi government’s campaign to preserve global demand for fossil fuels. “Mohammed bin Salman wants to be part of this … global concern with the climate,” said Madawi Al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics (LSE) Middle East Centre. “But also, let’s not forget that the [Saudi] economy is based on oil, and this is one of the most polluting industries that you can imagine. … The whole country’s based on an oil company. They have to show that they’re diversifying, investing in other things.” This dilemma has made Neom a core plank in Crown Prince Mohammed’s plan for the future of Saudi Arabia. Known as “Vision 2030,” the McKinsey–conceived roadmap ostensibly charts a course for the country to open itself to the world — primarily through tourism and foreign investment — while reducing its dependence on oil. Key to this transformation is an aggressive rebrand of the kingdom as a leader in the global fight against climate change. It is a delicate challenge to portray the world’s largest oil exporter — and a documented opponent of global climate action, particularly at UN climate talks — as a champion of sustainability. But it is not a challenge that the Saudi government is attempting alone. DeSmog found that at least two-dozen communications firms mentioned in this story — including agencies specializing in PR, consulting, advertising, and video and graphic design — have together earned tens of millions of dollars helping Crown Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government develop and sell the idea of Neom. To build up a picture of these companies’ activities, DeSmog reviewed hundreds of internal company documents; industry award submissions and press releases; social media posts and case studies published by staff and executives at Neom and many of the individual firms; as well as thousands of pages of documents filed with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). (The Foreign Agents Registration Act requires American companies who advocate or lobby for foreign governments to disclose information about those activities, as well as the names of the employees involved in them, to the DOJ.) If Neom’s marketing materials are to be believed, the city will soon offer a globally integrated, carbon-free home for billions of dollars’ worth of investor capital and millions of people from around the world, thanks to engineering and urban development marvels like The Line, a 170-kilometer-long, 500-meter-tall city “powered by 100 percent clean energy,” and Trojena, a mountainous region that promises to deploy cloud seeding to create an outdoor ski resort in the desert. The Line provides “a blueprint for how people and planet can co-exist in harmony,” says a Neom press release distributed by Chicago-headquartered Edelman, one of the largest PR agencies in the world. Trojena, which is scheduled to host the Asian Winter Games in 2029, “confirms our commitment to be part of the global effort to protect the environment,” Crown Prince Mohammed says in another release, this one distributed by the New York City-based communications firm Teneo. In fact, all of Neom’s regions and projects “will be aligned in their respect for the environment and achieving balance, because Neom’s ambitious vision seeks to shape the future in which living and working are integrated in a sustainable way,” Teneo’s release says. Edelman distributed this press release and graphic in early 2021 as part of its promotion of The Line. Edelman included the image with a Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filing to the U.S. Department of Justice. Experts told DeSmog that whether or not Neom is ever built, the reward for the Saudi government of involving so many prestigious firms goes beyond branding the country as green and legitimizing the crown prince’s hold on power. The scale of Western entanglement creates a financial dependence on Saudi largesse that makes it more difficult for these firms to disengage from Saudi Arabia — or for business leaders and government officials to speak out publicly — because of the Saudi state’s human rights abuses, its repression of civil and political liberties, or its efforts to obstruct global climate negotiations. Following the October 2018 abduction and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi — an operation that Crown Prince Mohammed “approved,” according to a U.S. intelligence assessment — Western elites’ shunning of the kingdom ultimately proved as fleeting as their governments’ promises to isolate the crown prince. But the outcry, while short-lived, nonetheless served as a wake-up call for the crown prince and his allies, experts said, particularly as the government has faced criticism over allegations of forcibly evicting residents of the Tabuk province to make space for Neom. “What they want is to create a substantial Western interest and personnel in Saudi Arabia in order to make Saudi Arabia defended by Western interests, should Saudi Arabia need that,” said LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed. “If you have a big population of Westerners in a country … then it becomes like a satellite state that has to be protected because Western interests are really intertwined with the local economy, and you can’t just abandon your people.” The crown prince is “thinking about alternative ways of keeping Western interests alive in Saudi Arabia,” Al-Rasheed said. “These projects, these consultancy firms, the PR companies are all meant to create that bondage — an alternative to just one commodity, and that is oil.” I. A ‘Golden Cash Cow’: Elite Agencies Capitalize on Neom According to the documents reviewed by DeSmog, the list of firms that have signed contracts with Neom includes some of the world’s biggest marketing, advertising, and communications conglomerates and their subsidiaries, such as: Independent agencies, such as Edelman, Teneo, KARV (formerly KARV Communications), Ruder Finn, and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck have together won millions of dollars’ worth of additional work for Neom, as have countless smaller creative agencies, many headquartered in New York City and London. This list of companies working to shape Neom’s image, which is not comprehensive, omits many of the lobbying and public affairs firms that work to shape the Saudis’ reputation in Washington, DC and other capitals. It also omits the 23 architecture studios shaping the city’s actual construction, according to a tally compiled by the architecture publication Dezeen. Other U.S.-based companies, including FleishmanHillard and Prosek Partners, have been hired by the FII Institute, which frequently promotes Neom at its events. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of the PIF and the chairman of the board of Saudi Aramco, the country’s state-run oil giant, also serves as chairman of the FII Institute. (There is no indication that FleishmanHillard, which is part of Omnicom, or Prosek Partners have worked for Neom directly.) The FII Institute is run by Richard Attias, a former Publicis Groupe executive and longtime producer of the World Economic Forum (WEF), an annual gathering for global elites in Davos, Switzerland. These days Attias, who has close ties to the Saudi royal family, and his communications firm, Richard Attias & Associates, are largely known for hosting the FII’s “Davos in the Desert” in Riyadh. (The crown prince publicly launched Neom at the gathering in 2017.) Beyond the FII, however, Attias and his company have also done significant work for Neom, including organizing “Discover Neom” tours to solicit foreign investment in cities ranging from Boston and Miami to Berlin, Paris, and Seoul, according to news reports and social media posts. The PR agency KARV’s work for Neom, which remains ongoing, is also run through Attias’s company. A spokesperson for the office of Richard Attias told DeSmog in an email that Richard Attias & Associates “is a global strategic communications and events firm that works with more than 50 clients worldwide annually, including Neom. We have provided events services for the Discover Neom Roadshows from 2022 to 2023, and communications advisory since 2023.” The FII Institute, the spokesperson said, “counts more than 30 international and regional entities as strategic partners, and Neom is indeed one of them.” * * * DeSmog’s findings suggest that many PR and consulting companies have anchored themselves in the lucrative ecosystem of Neom and the Saudi government, in part by capitalizing on Crown Prince Mohammed’s desire to be perceived as taking action on climate change. Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the nonprofit DAWN (Democracy for the Arab World Now), a Washington, DC-based nonprofit that was co-founded by Jamal Khashoggi, said the Saudi government is willing to spend vast amounts of money for purported Western expertise with little oversight. Put simply, Neom contracts are a “golden cash cow,” Whitson said. (One Neom-focused job opening in London, which was posted by a Publicis subsidiary, appealed to potential applicants by describing Neom as a client offering “unlimited content budgets.”) In conversations with DeSmog, a former employee of a sustainability-focused subsidiary of one of the world’s biggest communications conglomerates described witnessing an aggressive, even desperate, push to win a contract with Neom. The pitch, which eventually involved some of the conglomerate’s most senior executives, was for work to promote one of Neom’s widely touted environmental projects. The advertising agency’s history of working with clients seeking to advance their climate and environmental goals formed a key part of its appeal. The former employee, who requested to share their story anonymously for fear of professional repercussions, expressed concerns to executives within the agency that Neom could be largely a greenwashing exercise for a government funded by, and committed to, oil extraction. The former employee also cautioned that the firm, by doing this work for Neom, could contribute to sanitizing the Saudi government’s human rights record. When this employee shared their concerns internally, they were told that the agency’s participation in the pitch was vital because the agency had such a strong reputation for sustainability. After escalating concerns to more senior executives throughout the company, the former employee came to believe that they had been silenced and excluded from the project. Eventually, the employee chose to leave the company after concluding that their position was no longer tenable — and that their concerns about sustainability and human rights, despite featuring prominently in the company’s code of conduct, would continue to be ignored. As this employee’s experience suggests, for the Western creatives and communicators cashing in on Neom contracts, whether Neom’s flagship projects are actually green — or whether they are even ever likely to exist — appears to be of secondary importance to the task of portraying them that way. For these companies, “why not get in on the action? It’s easy money, with more to come,” said DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson. II. ‘A Blank Canvas’: Crafting a Convenient Narrative In response to a series of detailed questions, as well as requests for an interview and comments for this story, a spokesperson for Neom emailed a statement to DeSmog: “The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2060. Neom is supporting that goal by investing in emerging green technologies, including hydrogen production at scale, such as the world’s largest hydrogen plant … We are also committed to making our developments net zero emission zones upon completion, as we continue to focus on leveraging 100 percent renewable energy sources with sun and wind being abundant in this region of Saudi Arabia. In the construction phase of our developments, we are focused on decarbonizing, with the integration of circular economy principles including the use of carbon capture and utilization technology in our cement manufacturing plants. “Sustainability is deeply woven into Neom’s ethos, values, business practices, and operations. One of our core commitments is to preserve 95 percent of Neom for nature. We are also regreening and rewilding native landscapes as part of our Neom Nature Reserve. Five native species have already been reintroduced to two native habitat zones, and more than three million trees, shrubs, and grasses have been planted across 750 hectares as part of our program to restore extensive natural habitats with 100 million native plants.” In addition to Neom, as part of this investigation DeSmog contacted the firms mentioned in the story to request interviews and comments about their work for Neom. DeSmog also submitted a comment request to the Saudi embassy in Washington, DC. Most firms either declined to comment or did not respond. The embassy also did not respond. In order to work for the Saudi government, many companies agree to aggressive confidentiality and nondisclosure terms. Earlier this year, for instance, McKinsey, Teneo, M. Klein & Company, and BCG defied a subpoena from the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which was examining the Saudi government’s efforts to influence U.S. policy through tactics such as “sportswashing,” telling senators that Saudi officials would not allow them to discuss their work. “It’s simply staggering to me that American companies are not only willing to accept this claim, allowing the Saudi government to determine what is permitted to provide this subcommittee, but also that they would use it to justify their refusal to comply with a duly-issued congressional subpoena,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, the chairman of the subcommittee, said in a prepared statement for a February hearing with executives of the four firms. Despite these strident nondisclosure terms, however, some companies have been more vocal about their work for Neom on their websites and on social media. “From introducing a new model for urban sustainability powered by 100 percent renewable energy to creating hyper-connected communities centered around nature, not roads — [Neom’s] ‘living laboratories’ will embrace technology and innovation at scale to enhance liveability and answer some of humanity’s most urgent challenges,” McCann Enterprise wrote in a case study about its role in Neom’s “made to change” video. “Designed to inspire, it offers a tantalizing glimpse of what the future could look like.” Slides from The Story of NEOM, an internal document created for Neom by McCann Worldgroup. “Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do,” the presentation stated. McCann Enterprise is part of the global network McCann Worldgroup, which itself is the creator of a 168-slide presentation titled “THE STORY OF NEOM.” This internal document, which was obtained by DeSmog, features detailed overviews of Neom’s regions and provides promotional language and graphics that have appeared repeatedly across Neom’s website, social media activity, videos, and other materials. The words “sustainable” and “sustainability” together appear 58 times throughout the document. McCann Worldgroup declined to comment. “Sustainability is at the heart of everything we do,” the presentation states — a message McCann Enterprise has carried forth in much of its work for Neom. In the case study about the “made to change” video (part of what the agency called a “spectacular” campaign), McCann Enterprise described Neom as “a place designed to concentrate and accelerate the human drive for progress.” The city, the company said, is “a blank canvas for a new era of sustainable living.” “The creative idea from McCann London positions Neom as a change-maker that will inspire the world as it reimagines a healthier, more responsible, efficient, sustainable, and balanced way of life, starting from a blank canvas,” echoes a LinkedIn post by Joy Films, a production company that worked on the “made to change” video and has been involved in promoting numerous Neom projects. The “blank canvas” narrative is one that the Saudi government has promoted eagerly. “Since we have [an] empty place, and we want to have a place for 10 million people, then let’s think from scratch,” Crown Prince Mohammed said in a 2023 documentary about The Line on Discovery UK. The “blank canvas” in Neom’s “made to change” video. “Now, we have a chance to change everything,” says the narrator, as water explodes across the screen and drenches the canvas. But the Tabuk province in northwest Saudi Arabia, where pieces of Neom are slowly being built, was neither blank nor empty before it was claimed for the city’s construction. The land’s longtime residents include members of the Huwaitat tribe, who the Saudi government began forcibly evicting at the beginning of 2020, according to a report from the international nonprofit ALQST for Human Rights. The tribal community, whose members had lived for centuries in what Western creative agencies repeatedly portray as empty, “was terrorized into submission,” DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson told DeSmog. “[We] haven’t heard a peep from them since.” ALQST has documented that at least 15 Huwaitat people who opposed being displaced for Neom’s “blank canvas” have been sentenced “to prison terms of between 15 and 50 years.” Another five have been sentenced to death. In 2020 Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti, a prominent Huwaitat protestor, was killed by Saudi special forces in his home. Earlier this year a former Saudi intelligence official told the BBC that the government had “licensed the use of lethal force against whoever stayed in their home.” The forced eviction of the Huwaitat tribe and the death of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti have not captured global attention in the same way as the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. But these developments have nevertheless been widely reported in the media and publicized by human rights advocates. In May 2023, a group of independent experts appointed by the UN warned that three members of the Huwaitat tribe were facing “imminent execution” for opposing their eviction for The Line. “We urge all companies involved, including foreign investors, to ensure that they are not causing or contributing to, and are not directly linked to, serious human rights abuses,” the UN experts wrote. A handful of companies have proven willing to walk away from Saudi contracts. In July 2018, Gladstone Place Partners, an independent New York City-based communications firm, signed a nearly $200,000 agreement to promote Neom in U.S. markets and introduce the city’s CEO to Fortune magazine and other “top-tier media.” Gladstone terminated the contract shortly after Khashoggi’s disappearance. More recently, Malcolm Aw, the CEO of the renewable energy firm Solar Water, told Business Insider that he scrapped a $100 million contract with Neom to build solar-powered water desalination plants in the city after learning of the government’s aggressive eviction of the Huwaitat people. But rather than walking away, most Western companies doing business with Neom appear to have chosen the more lucrative path of looking the other way, a pattern that appears likely to continue. “Spreading such large amounts of capital … through such a broad spectrum of elite American companies precludes that kind of blowback from happening again,” said DAWN’s Sarah Leah Whitson, referring to the global backlash that followed Khashoggi’s murder in 2018. In fact, the Saudi government’s explicit commitment to extracting fossil fuels and obstructing global climate diplomacy, as well as its human rights abuses, ongoing political repression, and intolerance of dissent — such as decades-long prison terms for social media posts critical of Neom or the government itself — seem only to have created more demand for elite reputation cleansing. One PR industry award framed that challenge as an opportunity: “The global sentiment around Neom … was one rooted in cynicism and confusion rather than excitement.” III. ‘What is Neom?’: A Sprawling Web of Contracts In 2023, the year after it painted Neom as “made to change,” McCann Enterprise returned for another piece of work, this time to present Google searchers, YouTube streamers, and social media scrollers with the question of “what is Neom?” — and then align their answers with a Neom-approved narrative. As it had during the “made to change” campaign, the London agency teamed up with Monks, a “digital operating brand” of S4Capital, an advertising and marketing company founded by Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and former head of the global conglomerate WPP. (Neom is “one of the most visionary, ambitious, thrilling, and motivating projects I have ever seen,” Sir Martin wrote of “made to change.”) Monks referred DeSmog to its statement on modern slavery and its code of conduct. Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder and former head of the global conglomerate WPP, posted to his LinkedIn account in December 2021 that Neom was “one of the most visionary, ambitious, thrilling, and motivating projects I have ever seen.” Additional contributors to the new campaign included Google; Mathematic, a Paris-headquartered design studio that had also worked on videos for Trojena; Whisper, a UK-based production company; and Starcom, Leo Burnett, and Saatchi & Saatchi – all subsidiaries of the French holding group Publicis. Whisper and McCann Enterprise had previously collaborated on videos for Tonomus, Neom’s so-called “hyperconnected cognitive city,” which both Edelman and the DC lobbying shop Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck have also helped promote. “What is Neom?” featured a particularly close partnership between Neom and Google Creative Works, an operation within the tech giant that helps companies monetize Google users’ data and attention. According to a February 2024 case study written by a former Neom marketing executive and published by Google, “what is Neom?” sought to use detailed tracking and targeting of browsing behavior by Google search and YouTube users to change how viewers thought about Neom. The campaign’s entry point was a series of “15-second teaser video ads” on YouTube and other platforms. If viewers engaged with the teaser videos, they were then “automatically shown” a longer video that “used simple, conversational language to demystify the complexity of the Neom project, which was critical to the campaign’s storytelling element,” the case study said. Many of the videos emphasized Neom’s environmental claims. Neom is “an entirely new model for sustainable living,” stated one video. “Call it what you want, but it’s a place that’s going to change the way we live on this planet,” said another. Parts of two industry award submissions by Monks (top) and McCann Enterprise (bottom) for their work on the “What Is Neom?” campaign. Creating the campaign involved “an incredibly fast turnaround shoot that spanned the globe,” said one Whisper employee in an interview published on LinkedIn. “A real feat of impressive logistics delivered by the team!” For McCann Enterprise’s part, the “what is Neom?” videos involved a team of at least 14 employees, according to a celebratory LinkedIn post by the company’s chief creative officer. “Exaggerated and negative commentary overwhelms the media and online landscape, drowning out credible information about many topics including Neom,” McCann Enterprise wrote in a separate case study. “We needed to bring the truth to the front page. And today’s front page is the Google results page.” According to McCann Enterprise, for the 2023 project it hired Ipsos, a survey firm, in part to track Neom’s “brand health.” In May, a few months after “what is Neom?” launched, some journalists opened their inboxes to find that they were being asked to fill out an “Ipsos Survey for Neom.” The request came from KARV, the independent PR agency based in New York City. (It is unclear whether the Ipsos survey distributed by KARV is the same one referenced in the McCann Enterprise case study.) Earlier that year, KARV had signed a $980,000 contract to provide “Neom leadership” with “strategic communications and media relations,” including “strategic positioning counsel” and “messaging and editorial support,” via Richard Attias & Associates. This wasn’t KARV’s first time doing business with the Saudi government. In February 2019, barely four months after Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance, KARV head Andrew Frank personally signed a contract with the PIF. Crown Prince Mohammed’s position as chair of the investment fund means it is effectively controlled by him. The PIF “is just MBS [Mohammed bin Salman] himself,” Abdullah Alaoudh, the senior director for countering authoritarianism at the DC-based Middle East Democracy Center, told DeSmog. “I don’t know why they call it [a] sovereign wealth fund. It’s just MBS’s wealth fund, basically.” (KARV’s work for the PIF would eventually bring in more than $3 million.) A portion of KARV Communications’ contract with the Public Investment Fund. KARV’s CEO personally signed the contract in February 2019, barely four months after journalist Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul by Saudi government agents. In a statement emailed to DeSmog, a KARV spokesperson said, “KARV works in conjunction with Richard Attias & Associates in providing strategic communications, messaging, and media relations support to Neom as it aims to address the world’s greatest challenges through advancements in healthcare, education, economic opportunity, and sustainability.” * * * Among the numerous projects that “what is Neom?” sought to introduce to the world was Trojena, Neom’s ski resort and one of its most heavily promoted endeavors. In fact, another arm of McCann Worldgroup had already been involved in Trojena: In early 2022, around the same time that McCann Enterprise was portraying Neom as “made to change,” the U.S.-based McCann New York had been gearing up to help launch the mountain resort. Trojena, according to the “STORY OF NEOM” internal branding document created by McCann Worldgroup and obtained by DeSmog, will house “The Vault,” a “folding village” and “vertical city inside of a mountain with its own microclimate,” as well as “the first outdoor ski resort in Saudi Arabia” with “30 km of planned ski slopes.” Slides about Trojena from McCann Worldgroup’s internal branding document, The Story of Neom. To bring this implausible-sounding concept to life, McCann New York worked with Joy Films — which was also involved in the “made to change” and “what is Neom?” campaigns — to create a video portraying a group of skiers and snowboarders racing uphill in the snow, through an avalanche, before shooting into the sky under the slogan, “journey to new heights.” The video has racked up more than 17 million views on YouTube, though experts cautioned that these numbers are to be interpreted with some skepticism, given the Saudi government’s record of using bots and troll farms to boost social media numbers and harass critics. Neom also took the companies’ work beyond social media. With the help of Pixel Artworks, a UK-based “immersive experience” company, Neom splashed the agencies’ Trojena imagery across huge moving billboards in Riyadh, Times Square, and London’s Piccadilly Circus. On LinkedIn, Neom touted its massive Times Square billboards promoting Trojena in this April 13, 2022 post. A wide array of firms, including Teneo, McCann New York, Pixel Artworks, Joy Films, Squint/Opera, and KARV, are among the firms that have been paid by Neom to promote Trojena. This campaign put Neom’s commitment to sustainability front and center. Sometimes the message was implicit: Winter sports, by definition, require water and cold temperatures. Other times, the agencies were more direct. “Trojena will redefine mountain tourism for the world by creating a place based on the principles of ecotourism, highlighting our efforts to preserve nature and enhance the community’s quality of life,” read one unattributed quote included in a case study published by Squint/Opera, a UK-based creative shop owned by the U.S. agency Journey. The same quote was also attributed to Crown Prince Mohammed in a press release — distributed by Teneo — that accompanied Trojena’s launch. The release also quoted Nadhmi Al-Nasr, Neom’s CEO, describing Trojena as “a major contribution to achieving Neom’s long-term ambitions by adhering to the principles of sustainability.” Pixel Artworks, Joy Films, and Squint/Opera have each won other contracts with Neom. All three, for instance, have promoted The Line; Pixel Artworks says its video about the hypothetical horizontal city has generated more than 157 million YouTube views. And many continue to generate revenue from Neom. In March, Joy Films posted a video on Instagram about its ongoing work for Elanan, Neom’s “unique wellness retreat embedded in nature.” (KARV and Teneo have also promoted Elanan.) Whether projects like Elanan, Trojena, and The Line actually come to life or remain in the digital realm of slide decks and social media promises, the image of Neom — and the sprawling, interconnected web of contracts that helps create that image — serves an important function for the Saudi government. “I think what happened with Neom is that there’s so much money at stake that … what it managed to do is to buy people’s silence, including companies and states,” Lina Alhathloul, the head of monitoring and advocacy for ALQST, told DeSmog. Alhathloul’s sister, Loujain, an activist for women’s rights in Saudi Arabia, was jailed by the government for more than three years and is still banned from leaving the country. “Everyone [is] accepting Saudi money in exchange for silence,” Lina Alhathloul said. IV. ‘Hydrocarbons…for Many, Many Decades to Come’: A Kingdom Committed to Oil In January 2024, Neom invited investors, politicians, corporate executives, and other attendees of the World Economic Forum in Davos to drop by “Neom House,” a pop-up space branded with Neom’s logo and emblazoned with environmental imagery. Some of the building’s walls appeared to be covered in greenery. A nearly floor-to-ceiling graphic described Neom as “redefining the circular economy” and “powered by 100 percent clean energy.” Interactive screens showed visitors how Neom would “redefine livability, business, and conservation,” Neom later said. A look inside “Neom house” at the World Economic Forum in 2024. Source: Neom’s YouTube channel. Throughout the week, Neom House, which was designed in part by the same Pixel Artworks that had done work for Trojena and The Line, hosted a series of conversations about the city’s progress and potential. Many of these events seemed designed to create the image of a government leading the fight for global climate action. (Among those touting the promise of Neom to investors was Eric Cantor, the former majority leader of the U.S. House of Representatives.) Despite the green imagery and messaging surrounding the events, some officials who spoke at Neom House offered a different take on the government’s climate agenda. During a discussion about “mitigation through proactive action,” Adel Al-Jubeir, the Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs — and, since 2022, the country’s climate envoy — told the audience, “We want to be a realistic partner, and we want the world to be realistic,” employing a common rhetorical tactic of Saudi officials to caricature calls for the phase-out of fossil fuels as naïve or a “fantasy.” “We are saying that hydrocarbons will be the main source of energy for the world for many, many decades to come,” Al-Jubeir said. Flanked by a banner reading “Redefining Life for People and Planet,” Saudi climate envoy Adel Al-Jubeir (left) told Neom deputy CEO Rayan Fayez (right) that the Saudi government believed in “hydrocarbons… for many, many decades to come,” at a talk held in “NEOM house” during the 2024 World Economic Forum. Source: Neom’s YouTube channel. Saudi Arabia is the biggest exporter of oil in the world. Nearly two-thirds of government revenues stem from oil. Saudi Aramco, the state-run oil giant valued at around $2 trillion, is one of the world’s most valuable and most profitable companies. The kingdom controls around 82 percent of Aramco; the PIF, which owns Neom, also owns around 16 percent of Aramco — a stake worth around $160 billion. (McCann Worldgroup, Hill & Knowlton, Publicis, BCW, IPG, Mathematic, and FleishmanHillard are among the Western advertising and PR firms named in this story that have also worked for Aramco. The oil giant has also spent millions of dollars on sponsored content deals with the in-house creative studios of Western media outlets, including the New York Times, Financial Times and Reuters, in recent years, according to previous reporting by DeSmog and Drilled). “We’re trying to redefine how businesses coexist with nature,” Rayan Fayez, Neom’s deputy CEO, told Richard Attias at a 2023 FII Institute event. “Everything that we’re doing today at Neom has nature and environment at the core.” Yet the city’s construction is funded by oil sales, and the government’s entire operating model — including its investments in Neom and the crown prince’s other “giga-projects,” such as Diriyah, a $63 billion tourism development that will supposedly boast 38 hotels, and Jeddah Central, a waterfront project for which the Saudi government has also faced criticism for forcibly evicting local residents — depends on continuing to sell as much oil as possible, for as long as possible. “The crown prince [is] worried about all this talk about climate change and renewable energy — all of that creates tension in his mind because Saudi Arabia depends on selling oil,” LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed told DeSmog. “If oil becomes the ‘bad’ energy, then he’s stuck.” That’s why, even as Saudi policymakers work to reduce the kingdom’s own reliance on fossil fuels — an aim Neom might in fact support if its solar energy, desalination, “green” hydrogen, and other renewable energy projects come to fruition — the kingdom continues to work diligently to obstruct efforts that could reduce global demand for oil. In a 2008 paper, Cambridge University scholar Joanna Depledge summed up the Saudi government’s approach to international climate negotiations as “striving for no.” Thanks to its negotiators’ savvy tactics, including sowing disagreements among different countries, challenging established science about climate change, promoting false solutions to the crisis, and leveraging procedural rules and objections to stall discussions, “Saudi Arabia has been extremely successful in diverting the agenda and debates of the climate change government away from those issues it opposes, and towards those it supports,” Depledge argued. More than 15 years later, Depledge told DeSmog that what she wrote in that 2008 paper “nearly all still applies.” The Saudi government “has a thirty-year record of obstruction and delay, protecting its national oil and gas sector, and seeking to ensure UN climate talks achieve as little as possible, as slowly as possible,” Depledge and two co-authors wrote in 2023. “From Saudi Arabia’s perspective, ambitious global climate action is … more of a threat than climate change itself.” Last year the nonprofit Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) revealed the existence of a Saudi government effort, known as the Oil Demand Sustainability Program, which “aims to boost oil consumption across Asia and Africa, with the ultimate goal of protecting Saudi oil revenues from efforts to phase out fossil fuels,” CCR’s Lawrence Carter and Tom Costello wrote. At last year’s UN climate summit, meanwhile, Saudi negotiators “flatly opposed any language in a deal that would even mention fossil fuels,” the New York Times reported. (Saudi Arabia is reportedly one of a group of oil-dependent countries already working to make sure the upcoming UN summit in Azerbaijan does not call for a global phaseout of fossil fuels, according to the Financial Times.) While Saudi Arabia is far from the only country committed to obstructing and delaying climate action, its efforts have proven particularly successful and, as Depledge and her co-authors noted, provided cover for the United States other nations that benefit from continued fossil fuel production but would rather not be seen as spoilers. Then there’s the environmental impact of Neom itself. Despite the rhetoric and imagery pushed by the city and its Western consultants, experts and observers are skeptical that many of Neom’s projects can match their green hype. The Line, for instance, “will require a truly colossal quantity of materials, with emissions likely much higher than those produced in building a typical city,” predicted Philip Oldfield, a professor of architecture at the University of New South Wales in an opinion piece in the New York Times. In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Neom was building multiple gas power plants “to power the region until greener energy is sourced.” “Trojena is a ski resort with fake snow. ‘Preserve the environment’ when you need to create new snow? It’s just not credible,” ALQST’s Lina Alhathloul told DeSmog. “The Line actually cuts the environment and removes all [of] the nature and all of the animals. It removes it completely.” Trojena and The Line are “the two most famous projects in Neom,” Alhathloul said, and “the two main projects are clearly not green.” V. ‘A Model for Sustainable Living’: Cashing in on the Idea of Neom While Western companies have been eager partners in portraying Trojena, The Line, and other Neom endeavors as green, many have proven equally adept at transforming their work for Neom into contracts with other parts of the Saudi government. In 2020, the independent agency Ruder Finn agreed to a $1.7 million deal to promote Neom’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs, including by creating videos that “tell the story of CSR and its impact on the beneficiaries and the local community.” In the contract, Ruder Finn described itself as “a women-owned business with a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion.” Members of the LGBTQ community routinely face repression by the Saudi government. Lina Alhathloul’s sister, Loujain, remains one of numerous women’s rights activists in detention. “Saudi Arabia’s own record on women’s rights is abysmal,” Amnesty International’s Sherine Tadros told the Guardian. (Ruder Finn declined to comment.) Portions of Ruder Finn’s 2020 contract with Neom. A few years after wrapping up its work for Neom, Ruder Finn notified the DOJ that the firm had signed a contract with the country’s defense ministry to provide “strategic counsel, media relations, media monitoring, and content strategy and creation.” Kathy Bloomgarden, Ruder Finn’s CEO, personally registered with the DOJ to work on both contracts. Edelman, another independent firm that also began working for Neom in 2020, followed a similar path. According to DOJ filings, the company’s first contract with Neom, signed in November 2020, was expected to generate $75,000 a month for three months — a small sum for a firm that would bring in $840 million in revenue that year. Since then, however, Edelman has signed at least a dozen additional contracts and contract extensions with Neom and the Saudi government. Together these projects appear likely to generate more than $10.8 million for the firm, according to DeSmog’s analysis. As with Ruder Finn, Edelman’s work for Neom appears to have opened the door to work for other Saudi government agencies — and involved the firm’s most senior executive. In July 2022, Richard Edelman, Edelman’s CEO, hosted an invitation-only breakfast for Joseph Bradley, the head of Tonomus, one of Neom’s flagship projects. A few months later Richard Edelman registered with the DOJ as a foreign agent representing the Saudi culture ministry. The following year Richard Edelman hosted another “roundtable breakfast,” this time as part of the firm’s work promoting a “sustainable tourism” initiative for the Saudi tourism ministry. A July 8, 2022 invitation to a breakfast hosted by Richard Edelman for the CEO of Tonomous, one of Neom’s flagship projects. Edelman included the email in a FARA filing to the Justice Department. In response to a request for comment, Edelman referred DeSmog to its human rights policy and its public report on “citizenship.” In May 2023, Neom Green Hydrogen Company — a joint venture between Neom, Air Products, and ACWA Power, which itself is partly owned by the Saudi PIF — announced an $8.4 billion investment valuation for a “green” hydrogen plant located in Oxagon, a floating industrial development “powered by renewable energy.” (Edelman, Teneo, and Landor have also promoted Oxagon.) Hill & Knowlton, a U.S.-based firm, appears to have won industry awards for its work for Neom Green Hydrogen Company, including a campaign titled “Pioneering a green hydrogen future,” which won an industry award for “Best Campaign Demonstrating Environmental Initiatives.” Hill & Knowlton is listed as a media contact in an Air Products filing with the U.S. government. Earlier this year Hill & Knowlton merged with BCW to form Burson, which itself is part of London-headquarted WPP, one of the world’s largest communications conglomerates. According to federal filings, ASDA’A BCW, a subsidiary of BCW, signed its first contract with the Saudi government in January 2017, before linking up with Neom in the spring of 2020 for $390,000 worth of work. Burson is not the only WPP subsidiary to work for Neom. Landor (formerly Landor & Fitch) “worked through 24-hour shifts” to create Neom’s “brand idea and narrative,” according to a case study written by the company. Landor has been supporting Neom “since 2017,” one executive said last year, and has “many more Neom projects in the pipeline.” Landor Global posted to X on Nov. 18, 2021 about Oxagon, Neom’s floating industrial development “powered by renewable energy.” Edelman, Teneo, and Hill & Knowlton are among the other firms that have been paid to promote Oxagon. VI. ‘You Want to Maintain That Image’: Perception Is Reality The web of Western agencies’ involvement with the Saudi government can appear endless, likely with stronger and more numerous connections than will ever become public. Even so, one firm stands out for its success cashing in on the idea of Neom. According to federal filings with the DOJ, the strategy consulting firm Teneo began its work for Neom in May 2019, barely eight months after Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. In an agreement worth more than $2 million, Teneo agreed to provide the city with messaging, communications, crisis response, and executive coaching. Both the contract and Teneo’s DOJ filings noted that Douglas Band, a former close aide to former U.S. president Bill Clinton and then president and co-founder of Teneo, would be personally involved in the work. (Band left the company in 2020.) Teneo’s early efforts were evidently to the Saudi government’s liking. Teneo agreed to another contract with Neom with an “effective date” of November 1, 2019 — shortly after many media outlets and human rights groups had marked the one-year anniversary of Khashoggi’s assassination at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, and only weeks after Turkey’s government revealed transcripts of the journalist’s struggle with the Saudi hit squad sent to intercept him. (The assassins flew to and from Istanbul on planes owned by the PIF.) “You’ll suffocate me” were Khashoggi’s final words before his death. Excerpts from Teneo’s first contract with Neom. Teneo signed the contract in May 2019, barely eight months after Saudi government agents murdered Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul in October 2018. In its federal filings about the $900,000 agreement, Teneo said it would “manage the Neom Communications Department” and “provide leadership of the department as well as staff resources to ensure the foreign principal’s corporate messages and positioning are effectively communicated.” The company’s responsibilities included preparing “a Crisis Preparedness capability for Neom,” according to the contract. Teneo signed two additional contracts with Neom in 2020, bringing in an additional $1.2 million. In August 2021, Teneo’s work for the Saudi government expanded beyond Neom when the firm agreed to work for the PIF. The same month Teneo signed another $3.3 million contract with Neom. Since 2022, Teneo has signed at least nine additional contracts and contract extensions with Neom, the PIF, and another entity created in part by the PIF (and 80 percent owned by it) that, in Teneo’s words, exists “to offer guidance and resourcing to support businesses and industry in the MENA [Middle East and North Africa] region as they play their part in the global transition to net zero.” All together, Teneo’s work for the kingdom appears to have been worth more than $30 million so far. “We are also establishing a model for sustainable living around the world,” said Al-Nasr, the Neom CEO, in a press release distributed by Teneo. * * * From Teneo to McCann to Google to Edelman, the web of prestigious and influential Western companies doing business with Neom and the Saudi government is vast and deeply interconnected — and impossible to map in full. This opacity stems from a powerful combination of aggressive nondisclosure agreements, strident corporate obfuscation, and an overwhelming torrent of marketing and PR imagery that blurs the boundary between what is real, and what exists only in digital simulations and science fiction-style YouTube videos. For both the Saudi government and its Western contractors, the distinction between the real and the imaginary appears irrelevant: The image of Neom as a sustainable city of the future is ultimately what matters. What is inescapably real, however, is the amount of money involved, and the growing demand among autocratic oil-producers for help revamping their reputations and selling a green image to domestic audiences and throughout Western capitals. This lucrative ecosystem extends well beyond the borders of Neom: In April, Teneo won a $4.2 million contract with the authoritarian government of Azerbaijan to handle communications for next month’s COP29 UN climate conference. “The whole point of this kind of dictatorship is [to] make believe that everything is so rosy and great,” said LSE’s Madawi Al-Rasheed. “And if you’re targeting partners such as the West — companies, global businesses, banks — then you don’t want them to hear about the bad side of the country. You want to maintain that image.” Additional reporting by TJ Jordan Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. I find it odd that people don’t question the narrative to Neom, particularly the people who try to point out the impossible aspects of the project, and that it might be a cover for something else like the Glomar Explorer was. I became more suspicious of this when I read a piece, in defense of the project, that stressed the project was possible because it was being built in “modular” form so the parts were not dependent on the whole. So you have different and discrete parts, with work going on underground, that will exist even if nobody ever moves in. If Saudi Arabia were working on it’s own nuclear program, or if they were putting some underground missile silos in place, the more outlandish the proposals the more it works to divert from what is going on – just as Glomar was aided by being linked to the “crazy” or “innovative” Howard Hughes. I don’t know if we have become so trained to fear being labeled a “conspiracy theorist” that we no longer admit governments do things in secret. The public was told about Glomar because of a break-in at some offices – contractors working on their part can be clueless to the whole project and real intent. I have never worried about the CT label, as I remind myself that Class is the main conspiracy. Something worth theorising about and even observing, perhaps judging! Patrick Boyle does a rather good takedown of the sheer nonsense of the projected project, though the gruesome monarchy’s (and its little helpers) activities are no laughing matter.

Title: Big Tech goes nuclear: Amazon's pitch to use power plants shows the crucial role the energy source plays for AI

Happy Friday! Looking for a new way to jumpstart your mornings? (Besides reading this newsletter, of course.) Retired Navy SEAL Jocko Willink shared his daily routine that keeps the now-business owner focused. Speaking of new, we've got a cool tool for you to play around with: AI-powered search. We're using generative AI to help easily find all of our great stories. Check it out on our homepage. In today's big story, inside Amazon's internal pitch for turning to nuclear power to meet its growing energy needs. What's on deck: But first, let's power up. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. What's bigger than tech's ambitious plans for generative AI? The amount of energy needed to power it. That's led Big Tech to consider nuclear power to address its skyrocketing energy requirements. Business Insider's Eugene Kim has a report on how Amazon navigates its nuclear ambitions. In a signal of how serious Amazon is about going nuclear, the company pitched the energy source to CEO Andy Jassy this June, according to a company document he obtained. Since then, Amazon has led a $500 million financing round for a company developing modular nuclear reactors. It also agreed to purchase power from Talen Energy's nuclear-powered data center in March. And it's not alone. Microsoft and Google have invested in the sector, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman backed a nuclear reactor startup. The stakes are high for tech players to get energy. Eugene previously reported on how Amazon's dreams of building a data center empire face the realities of electricity, water, and labor constraints. Should those data center efforts continue to struggle, companies' big bets on generative AI could also falter. A tech-nuclear relationship is mutually beneficial. Tech companies need cost-efficient, reliable energy sources that won't increase their carbon footprint, writes BI's Hasan Chowdhury. Nuclear power ticks that box better than other clean energy options like solar or wind. Nuclear power, meanwhile, is an industry in desperate need of some love, BI's Daniel Geiger and Ellen Thomas previously reported. With at least one commercial nuclear plant closing every year since 2013, the sector has welcomed the interest. "We're seeing customers approach us at a rate that we haven't seen in my history with this industry," Jim Burke, CEO of nuclear owner Vistra, said back in March. Naturally, there are skeptics. A byproduct of nuclear power is radioactive waste. The transportation and storage of that remains a hot-button issue. High-profile incidents involving power plants like Chernobyl and Fukushima also drew criticism and stoked fears around the globe. Big Tech hasn't shied away from it. In September, Microsoft cut a deal with Constellation Energy to get power from part of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, home to the worst commercial nuclear accident in US history.

Title: Bitcoin Soars Towards $68K Amid Microsoft’s BTC Investment SEC Filing

Microsoft is preparing for a critical shareholder meeting on December 10, during which the future of Bitcoin as a potential investment will be a heated topic. At present, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $68,115, which represents an increase of approximately 1.22%. The rise in interest aligns with constant debates around the cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge, which some Microsoft investors find appealing. Microsoft revealed in a recent application to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that it will propose evaluating Bitcoin investment during the forthcoming conference. The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) says that Bitcoin has done better than traditional investments and could be a good way to protect against inflation. JUST IN: Per an SEC filing, Microsoft will have a proposed board resolution for an “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin”. The board is recommending that shareholders vote AGAINST the proposal. pic.twitter.com/0WveygitH9 — TFTC (@TFTC21) October 24, 2024 Microsoft’s board, on the other hand, wants shareholders to vote against this plan because the company has already looked at a wide range of investable assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to a spokesperson for the company: This emphasizes the careful strategy that Microsoft has adopted as far as the management of its corporate treasury is concerned as well as for the benefit of enhancing the shareholders value for the long term. The board is of the opinion that the requested public appraisal is unnecessary, as they already monitor trends and developments in the cryptocurrency sector. Microsoft’s major shareholders include a number of major institutional investors, such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These organizations own a large percentage of the company and have considerable power to affect its policy direction. Although some shareholders are advocating for Bitcoin investments, others may be more in line with the board’s cautious stance. It is important to note that BlackRock has been actively increasing its Bitcoin holdings through its ETFs. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has registered inflows to the tune of over $317 million in a 24-hour timeframe, according to recent reports. This trend implies that there is an increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin, despite Microsoft’s reluctance to implement comparable measures. As the December conference gets ready, the debate about Bitcoin’s importance in Microsoft’s investment plan gets more intense. The NCPPR argues that businesses should commit at least 1% of their whole assets to Bitcoin to help to reduce inflation risks. Despite this project, Microsoft insists that its present corporate treasury distribution policies are sufficient. Bitcoin has experienced a nearly twofold increase in value in the past year and has recorded a remarkable 414% increase over the past five years. Although Microsoft may not be completely prepared to invest in cryptocurrency investments at this time, the increasing interest from institutional investors such as BlackRock suggests that the discourse surrounding Bitcoin is far from over. Microsoft’s upcoming shareholder meeting will be the focus of all attention, and it is uncertain whether the tech giant will alter its position on cryptocurrencies or maintain its commitment to stability in its investment strategy.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Now, as Wall Street giant JPMorgan issues a huge bitcoin price prediction, the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) have each published papers "attacking" bitcoin—branded a "declaration of war." Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has helped the bitcoin price boom this year with plans for ... [+] drastic interest rate cuts. The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis has published a paper this week arguing bitcoin and similar assets could be taxed or banned to help governments maintain deficits. "A legal prohibition against bitcoin can restore unique implementation of permanent primary deficits, and so can a tax on bitcoin," the paper's authors wrote, adding bitcoin creates a "balanced budget trap" that highlights spending shortfalls. The Fed has "joined the European Central Bank in its attack on bitcoin," said VanEck's head of digital asset research Matthew Sigel, writing in an X thread that the paper "fantasizes about 'legal prohibition' and extra taxes on bitcoin to ensure government debt remains the 'only risk-free security.'" The bitcoin price has surged along with the price of gold this year as investors bet higher interest rates combined with a huge increase in deficits will create a feedback loop, forcing governments to print more money. U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures that sent inflation spiraling out of control and forced the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a historical clip. Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days—potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge—and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024. The Fed's paper follows a report from the ECB that argues “the existence of bitcoin impoverishes both non-holders and latecomers," describing it as a "zero-sum game" in which bitcoin buyers "increase their real wealth and consumption" at the expense of others. "The ECB claims that early bitcoin adopters steal economic value from latecomers," bitcoin analyst Tuur Demeester posted to X, calling the paper "a true declaration of war" and adding he "strongly believes authorities will use this luddite argument to enact harsh taxes or bans." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged higher this year, climbing amid a perfect storm of Federal Reserve ... [+] interest rate cuts, BlackRock-led Wall Street adoption and Donald Trump's embrace of bitcoin and crypto. The ECB paper warns that continued bitcoin price appreciation could divide society and calls for government action that would "prevent bitcoin prices from rising or to see bitcoin disappear altogether." "Non-holders should recognize that bitcoin’s rise is fueled by wealth redistribution at their expense," ECB senior management adviser and report author Jürgen Schaaf posted to X. "There are compelling reasons to advocate for policies that curb bitcoin's growth or even eliminate it." Earlier this month, Italy's government said it was considering raising the capital gains tax on bitcoin to 42% from 26% while just this week in Denmark politicians proposed taxing unrealized bitcoin and crypto gains.

Title: Jim Cramer On Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA): ‘Tim Wentworth Is Really An Excellent CEO’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) stands against other stock picks by Jim Cramer. On Monday, Jim Cramer of Mad Money took a closer look at the market’s recent movements, reassuring investors that rising bond yields shouldn’t cause excessive worry. He noted that bond yields have surged significantly since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, a trend that might seem counterintuitive. Cramer acknowledged that bonds were behind Monday’s “ugly action in the big caps”. The Dow fell by 344 points, the S&P slipped by 0.18%, while the Nasdaq managed a slight gain of 0.27%. Cramer emphasized that while bonds play a crucial role, they aren’t the sole factor influencing the market’s performance, despite what some may claim. He expressed his frustration with those who panic at the sight of rising interest rates, suggesting that such reactions are misguided. Cramer pointed out that the stock market has experienced a remarkable rally. “The stock market has had a fabulous run, even as bond yields have crept up almost the entire time. They love to ignore that glaring fact, the bears. Every day is groundhog day for them. They see interest rates go up higher, so they panic themselves and they are trying to panic us.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer on Taiwan Semiconductor, Netflix, and Other Stocks and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In Cramer proceeded to break down the arguments typically made by bond bears, who often use long-term interest rates as a weapon against the Fed. He criticized their simplistic approach, where rising rates are blamed on the Federal Reserve while falling rates somehow earn them credit. According to him, the Fed’s recent decision to cut rates by 50 basis points was necessary. “… Here’s the simple truth, did the Fed need to do a double rate cut moving 50 basis points and not 25? Yes. Yes, they had to do it if they wanted to be sure that the proverbial plane didn’t crash.” He firmly stated that Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is simply fulfilling his duties responsibly, and those who continuously express skepticism will ultimately be proven wrong. Addressing the notion that a rate cut would trigger inflation, Cramer pointed out that the bond market’s reaction suggests that the initial cut has already sparked fears of inflation resurgence. He challenged the idea that the effects of a rate cut are immediate, asserting that higher loan rates, particularly for 30-year mortgages, can actually have an anti-inflationary effect, contrary to what some might believe. He highlighted that the most pressing concern in the inflation landscape remains housing. Cramer also tackled the prevailing belief among bears that stock prices cannot rise if interest rates increase. He dismissed this idea as arbitrary, asserting that we are far from a situation where higher rates would definitively damage the bull market. “We are nowhere near the point where the bull can be slain by higher, longer rates… Stocks have soared with bond yields at these levels before; in fact, they’ve soared with the 30-year at 5%, they’ve soared with the 30-year at 6%, so let’s stop it with the jeremiads.” Ultimately, he argued that such fears merely drive investors away from solid companies that are performing well. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 13 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the lightning round of his episodes of Mad Money on October 18 and 21. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 When Cramer was questioned about Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA), he said: “The good news… is that Tim Wentworth is really an excellent CEO. The bad news is you’re up against Amazon… But I’m a believer in Tim. I really hope it works. But that is a one tough spot he’s got himself in.” Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) is a well-known name in the retail pharmacy industry, operating over 12,500 locations across the United States, Europe, and Latin America. The company’s diverse portfolio features well-known brands such as Walgreens, Boots, Duane Reade, the No7 Beauty Company, and Benavides in Mexico. In recent times, the company has faced increasing competition from tech-driven retailers like Walmart and Amazon, which are making significant inroads into the pharmacy sector. These competitors not only offer extensive loyalty programs, such as Walmart+ and Amazon Prime but also provide the convenience of delivering a broad range of items alongside prescriptions. Such a capability may give them an edge in the online marketplace, challenging traditional pharmacy models like Walgreens. During its latest earnings call, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) management provided insights into the company’s future direction, highlighting a plan to close 1,200 underperforming stores. The decision shows that there is an awareness of the need to adapt and modernize in a rapidly changing retail environment. Tim Wentworth emphasized that out of over 8,000 stores, approximately 6,000 are currently profitable, which supports the belief in a retail pharmacy-led model that remains relevant to consumers. The initiative to close less productive locations is expected to reduce fixed costs and free up resources for reinvestment in the remaining stores over the coming years. Overall, WBA ranks 8th on our list of latest stock picks by Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of WBA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WBA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Jim Cramer Says e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) ‘Will Come Back Faster’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled, Jim Cramer’s Latest Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (NYSE:ELF) stands against other stock picks by Jim Cramer. On Monday, Jim Cramer of Mad Money took a closer look at the market’s recent movements, reassuring investors that rising bond yields shouldn’t cause excessive worry. He noted that bond yields have surged significantly since the Federal Reserve cut rates last month, a trend that might seem counterintuitive. Cramer acknowledged that bonds were behind Monday’s “ugly action in the big caps”. The Dow fell by 344 points, the S&P slipped by 0.18%, while the Nasdaq managed a slight gain of 0.27%. Cramer emphasized that while bonds play a crucial role, they aren’t the sole factor influencing the market’s performance, despite what some may claim. He expressed his frustration with those who panic at the sight of rising interest rates, suggesting that such reactions are misguided. Cramer pointed out that the stock market has experienced a remarkable rally. “The stock market has had a fabulous run, even as bond yields have crept up almost the entire time. They love to ignore that glaring fact, the bears. Every day is groundhog day for them. They see interest rates go up higher, so they panic themselves and they are trying to panic us.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer on Taiwan Semiconductor, Netflix, and Other Stocks and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In Cramer proceeded to break down the arguments typically made by bond bears, who often use long-term interest rates as a weapon against the Fed. He criticized their simplistic approach, where rising rates are blamed on the Federal Reserve while falling rates somehow earn them credit. According to him, the Fed’s recent decision to cut rates by 50 basis points was necessary. “… Here’s the simple truth, did the Fed need to do a double rate cut moving 50 basis points and not 25? Yes. Yes, they had to do it if they wanted to be sure that the proverbial plane didn’t crash.” He firmly stated that Jerome Powell, the Fed Chair, is simply fulfilling his duties responsibly, and those who continuously express skepticism will ultimately be proven wrong. Addressing the notion that a rate cut would trigger inflation, Cramer pointed out that the bond market’s reaction suggests that the initial cut has already sparked fears of inflation resurgence. He challenged the idea that the effects of a rate cut are immediate, asserting that higher loan rates, particularly for 30-year mortgages, can actually have an anti-inflationary effect, contrary to what some might believe. He highlighted that the most pressing concern in the inflation landscape remains housing. Cramer also tackled the prevailing belief among bears that stock prices cannot rise if interest rates increase. He dismissed this idea as arbitrary, asserting that we are far from a situation where higher rates would definitively damage the bull market. “We are nowhere near the point where the bull can be slain by higher, longer rates… Stocks have soared with bond yields at these levels before; in fact, they’ve soared with the 30-year at 5%, they’ve soared with the 30-year at 6%, so let’s stop it with the jeremiads.” Ultimately, he argued that such fears merely drive investors away from solid companies that are performing well.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40 Cramer called e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.’s (NYSE:ELF) situation complicated but also guessed that it would return faster than others in the group. Here’s what he had to say: “Well, remember, this is a very tough situation because all of cosmetics are in a downturn that is so staggering that it caught everybody by surprise, especially Fabrizio Freda at Estee Lauder. I think Estee Lauder is not as good as E.l.f, but I recognize that this group is in the doldrums. I don’t want to make a single call on a group decline. I do think that when they come back, this one will come back faster than all of them.” e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) is a big name in the cosmetics industry and provides a diverse range of cosmetic and skin care products offered under several brand names, including e.l.f. Cosmetics, e.l.f. Skin, Well People, Naturium, and Keys Soulcare. The company has recently reported significant growth, marking a strong beginning to the fiscal year. Tarang Amin, e.l.f. Beauty’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer highlighted that the company achieved 50% net sales growth in the first quarter, along with an increase of 260 basis points in market share. The achievement signifies the 22nd consecutive quarter of growth in both sales and market share, positioning the company among a select group of high-growth consumer companies. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) generated revenue of $324.5 million, a substantial 50% increase compared to the same period the previous year. Non-U.S. markets contributed significantly to this growth, accounting for 16% of total net sales, with net sales from these markets soaring by 91% year-over-year. The company’s updated outlook for fiscal 2025 expects a year-over-year increase in net sales of 25% to 27%, an upward revision from the earlier expectation of 20% to 22%. Overall, ELF ranks 7th on our list of latest stock picks by Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of ELF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs see $380 net inflow in 2 days with BlackRock leading the charge

IBIT dominates Bitcoin ETF inflows with $482 million 2-day surge. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) showed mixed activity over the past two days, following a net outflow of $79.1 million on Oct. 22 that ended a seven-day inflow streak totaling over $2.4 billion since Oct. 14. On Oct. 23, ETFs registered a net inflow of $192.4 million. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led with $317.5 million in new investments, while ARK’s Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw significant outflows of $99 million. Bitwise’s BITB also recorded an outflow of $25.2 million. The following day, Oct. 24, ETFs continued to attract capital with a net inflow of $188 million. IBIT maintained its strong performance, bringing in an additional $165.5 million. Bitwise’s BITB reversed its previous day’s outflow by gaining $29.6 million. However, Grayscale’s BTC fund experienced a minor outflow of $7.1 million. The sustained inflows into IBIT highlight its prominent role in offering traditional investment exposure to Bitcoin. President of the ETF Store, Nate Geraci, pointed out BlackRock’s performance on Oct. 24 alone “would easily put IBIT in top 10% of all launches in 2024 (out of 575+ ETFs).” Conversely, the outflows from ARKB suggest possible profit-taking or shifts in investment strategies.

Title: Michael Saylor Backpedals On Controversial Bitcoin Statement After Backlash
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-backpedals-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-10-25T04:00:24Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with journalist Madison Reidy, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, ignited significant controversy within the Bitcoin community over his remarks on custody and regulation. Addressing concerns about the risks of large amounts of BTC being held by third-party custodians and major institutions, Saylor argued against self-custody and downplayed fears of increased seizure or confiscation. Saylor posited that BTC is more secure when held by regulated public entities such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan Chase, rather than by unregulated private holders. He stated, “I think it’s the opposite. I think that when Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure.” The backlash from the BTC community was swift and intense, as Bitcoinist reported. Even Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin labeled Saylor’s statement as “batshit insane,” reflecting the strong disapproval from prominent figures in the crypto space. Facing mounting criticism, Saylor appears to have softened his stance. Via X, he clarified: “I support self-custody for those willing & able, the right to self-custody for all, and freedom to choose the form of custody & custodian for individuals & institutions globally. #Bitcoin benefits from all forms of investment by all types of entities, and should welcome everyone.” Gabor Gurbacs, founder of PointsVille and a strategist at Tether, commented that Saylor’s adjusted stance “shouldn’t be a controversial position” and considered it “just common sense.” However, not all were convinced by Saylor’s clarification. Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser expressed concerns that the importance of self-custody—a defining aspect of BTC’s value proposition—was not adequately communicated. He highlighted the high risks associated with having others custody one’s Bitcoin and noted that self-custody and the separation of state and money are key characteristics that define it. “To be clear, El Salvador is opening up Bitcoin banks attached with caveats clearly stating that self-custody—and the separation of state & money—are key characteristics that define Bitcoin. Bitcoin is transforming money & the concept of the nation state too; as it’s been understood for 300 years,” he added. Industry analyst James Van Straten speculated that MicroStrategy is positioning itself as a BTC bank, aligning with predictions made by Hal Finney back in 2010. While advocating for self-custody, Van Straten acknowledged that institutional involvement and ease of access, such as through ETFs, are significant drivers of BTC adoption. “Saylor is playing a completely different game than the average pleb. Depending on the next US administration, he has to position himself carefully. I would argue it’s even more stupid to position himself as a crypto-anarchist. If he deems yield is necessary, then it is. Got the first four years right,” Van Straten writes via X. Joe Burnett from Unchained offered a succinct take: “Incredibly based.” Conversely, Joel Valenzuela, involved in business development and marketing for Dash, remarked on X: “Capitulation. But you showed your true colors.” At press time, BTC traded at $67,700. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Title: It’s Still the Economy, Stupid Globalists!
URL: https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2024/10/it_s_still_the_economy_stupid_globalists.html
Time Published: 2024-10-25T04:00:00Z

A paradigm shift occurs when there is a radical change in thinking from an accepted point of view to a new one. Changes in social consciousness are not easy. Institutions defend orthodoxy with all their assorted powers, while new ideas receive support only from iconoclasts who are often dismissed as kooks or disparaged as domestic enemies. Prevailing opinion is like a heavy boulder sitting in the valley between several steep hills. For a novel idea to succeed, its proponents must push that boulder up the slope until it reaches the top of a neighboring peak. Two observations follow from this analogy: (1) when moving the heavy boulder of conventional wisdom in a new direction, the gravity of traditional consensus works to roll it right back into the valley where it originally rested, and (2) once the boulder is finally pushed up a hill with the force of sufficient evidence and popular support, it will quickly roll down the other side and rest in a new valley of conventional wisdom. Changing human minds, in other words, is a punishing exercise until you reach a tipping point, when social change occurs rapidly. We are right now in the midst of one of these phenomenal paradigm shifts. Americans are “awakening” to the idea that the federal government does not have their best interests at heart. They are pushing back against mass illegal immigration. They are resisting government surveillance and censorship. They are questioning economic regulations that have weakened private property rights while giving a small number of corporations and financial elites almost total control over commerce, the food supply, and the monetary system. During the half-century Cold War, Americans often turned a blind eye toward questionable military strategies, Intelligence Community actions, and economic policies because a pervasive “us vs. them” attitude kept the country united against common communist enemies. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the expansion of Western business interests into communist China, this us/them dynamic began to fade away. As companies in the United States replaced domestic workers with foreign workers — and eventually Chinese slave labor — Americans realized that the distinctions between so-called “authoritarian” States and so-called “democratic” States were not as stark as they had once seemed. The offshoring of good manufacturing and industrial jobs in the United States to countries that had been considered competitors, adversaries, or even enemies softened the ground for the paradigm shift we see today. In the ’92 presidential contest, independent candidate Ross Perot warned that the North American Free Trade Agreement would move jobs and money to Mexico and leave Americans worse off. George Bush and Bill Clinton disagreed, and Republicans and Democrats argued that NAFTA would both discourage illegal immigration (by providing jobs south of the American border) and increase household wealth (by decreasing the cost of consumer goods). Prices for many products did go down, because that’s what happens when the cost of labor goes from $13/hour (when made in America) to $1/hour (when made in Mexico or Central America). However beneficial such price decreases in essential household items might have been, there was a tremendous cost — the destruction of blue-collar towns across the United States. Ross Perot’s entirely rational prediction came true, and the “giant sucking sound” of jobs and money going south ultimately made Americans poorer. As a cherry on top of the toxic NAFTA sundae, rampant illegal immigration continued unabated largely because the U.S. welfare system remains an attractive nuisance that draws foreign nationals who prefer America’s generous handouts to the blue-collar jobs in their own countries. This hollowing out of the American middle class continued every time Republicans and Democrats inked another “free trade deal” that made it easier for American companies to invest in slave labor overseas. As the cost of such deals became more widely apparent, the “ruling class” in D.C. became more inventive with its justifications. Bill Clinton opened up trade with communist China not because American companies could make a bundle from a workforce willing to work for subsistence wages, but rather because the introduction of Western commerce to China would be the camel’s nose under the communist tent. Globalization, in other words, was sold as a peaceful foreign policy that would make our adversaries more like us while avoiding military conflict and nuclear bluster. If blue jeans and the Beatles could collapse the Iron Curtain, then McDonald’s “Golden Arches” diplomacy would democratize communist China. At least that’s the hogwash Americans heard, as they watched their jobs move to the other side of the world. The costs for such foreign policy pipe dreams have been immense. Over three decades of “free trade deals,” Americans have lost millions of jobs, household savings have disappeared, the wealth gap between the top 1% and everyone else has significantly widened, drug- and alcohol-related deaths have skyrocketed, property theft and violent crime rates have steadily risen, and towns across the country have become rusted monuments to apathy and neglect. What did American workers get in exchange for so many lost jobs sent overseas? Nothing good. Once-important domestic companies have become multinational behemoths devoid of any sense of national allegiance. Moreover, as these companies have exponentially increased their wealth and global reach, they have also exponentially increased their influence over the foreign and domestic policy decisions of the U.S. government. (BlackRock, for example, set up shop in the Biden White House, and the corporate press mostly hid this inconvenient truth from the public.) China, a third-world nation three decades ago that could not feed its own citizens and seemed near collapse, has become a regional powerhouse with global reach. America, on the other hand, has crippled its own industrial and manufacturing self-sufficiency. In fact, it depends on China for critical pharmaceuticals, electronics components, metals, and finished products. “Golden Arches” diplomacy failed to democratize communist China. Instead, the U.S. government embraced the mass surveillance and censorship of its totalitarian adversary. Finally, a combination of catastrophically expensive “green energy” policies, profligate government spending, and economically unsound central bank money printing has set the United States down an untenable path toward runaway inflation, dollar destabilization, and financial ruin. Globalization, in other words, has left Americans poorer, more miserable, less optimistic about the future, and dangerously disconnected from their government. At the same time, their geopolitical enemies have never been more emboldened. That’s a gargantuan price tag for no reward. The more that the U.S. government struggles to maintain its status as a global superpower with a witches’ brew of money-printing, welfare spending, and mass illegal immigration (the last ingredient being used as both a deflationary pressure on wages as well as a cynical tactic to distract Americans with cultural conflict and political strife), the more it resembles a Potemkin village incapable of withstanding scrutiny. Americans look at all they have lost over the last thirty years, and they wonder how the people running the federal government could be both spectacularly incompetent and magnificently malicious. Imaginary pronouns, forcing men into women’s sports, and hyperventilating about COVID and “climate change” can distract the American people for only so long. Eventually, a vocal leader comes along and finds America’s globalist boulder stuck in a deep ravine. No doubt that boulder has many notes attached from sage voices such as Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan all saying, “Tried to move this up the hill, but it kept falling back down.” But if enough Americans join together, President Trump might have just enough strength to heave the boulder to the other side. “Make America Great Again” is a rallying cry for Americans to lift the country up despite the weight of Deep State opposition. The hilltop lies ahead. Keep pushing with all your might. Image: N509FZ via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0. A paradigm shift occurs when there is a radical change in thinking from an accepted point of view to a new one. Changes in social consciousness are not easy. Institutions defend orthodoxy with all their assorted powers, while new ideas receive support only from iconoclasts who are often dismissed as kooks or disparaged as domestic enemies. Prevailing opinion is like a heavy boulder sitting in the valley between several steep hills. For a novel idea to succeed, its proponents must push that boulder up the slope until it reaches the top of a neighboring peak. Two observations follow from this analogy: (1) when moving the heavy boulder of conventional wisdom in a new direction, the gravity of traditional consensus works to roll it right back into the valley where it originally rested, and (2) once the boulder is finally pushed up a hill with the force of sufficient evidence and popular support, it will quickly roll down the other side and rest in a new valley of conventional wisdom. Changing human minds, in other words, is a punishing exercise until you reach a tipping point, when social change occurs rapidly. We are right now in the midst of one of these phenomenal paradigm shifts. Americans are “awakening” to the idea that the federal government does not have their best interests at heart. They are pushing back against mass illegal immigration. They are resisting government surveillance and censorship. They are questioning economic regulations that have weakened private property rights while giving a small number of corporations and financial elites almost total control over commerce, the food supply, and the monetary system. During the half-century Cold War, Americans often turned a blind eye toward questionable military strategies, Intelligence Community actions, and economic policies because a pervasive “us vs. them” attitude kept the country united against common communist enemies. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the reunification of Germany, and the expansion of Western business interests into communist China, this us/them dynamic began to fade away. As companies in the United States replaced domestic workers with foreign workers — and eventually Chinese slave labor — Americans realized that the distinctions between so-called “authoritarian” States and so-called “democratic” States were not as stark as they had once seemed. The offshoring of good manufacturing and industrial jobs in the United States to countries that had been considered competitors, adversaries, or even enemies softened the ground for the paradigm shift we see today. In the ’92 presidential contest, independent candidate Ross Perot warned that the North American Free Trade Agreement would move jobs and money to Mexico and leave Americans worse off. George Bush and Bill Clinton disagreed, and Republicans and Democrats argued that NAFTA would both discourage illegal immigration (by providing jobs south of the American border) and increase household wealth (by decreasing the cost of consumer goods). Prices for many products did go down, because that’s what happens when the cost of labor goes from $13/hour (when made in America) to $1/hour (when made in Mexico or Central America). However beneficial such price decreases in essential household items might have been, there was a tremendous cost — the destruction of blue-collar towns across the United States. Ross Perot’s entirely rational prediction came true, and the “giant sucking sound” of jobs and money going south ultimately made Americans poorer. As a cherry on top of the toxic NAFTA sundae, rampant illegal immigration continued unabated largely because the U.S. welfare system remains an attractive nuisance that draws foreign nationals who prefer America’s generous handouts to the blue-collar jobs in their own countries. This hollowing out of the American middle class continued every time Republicans and Democrats inked another “free trade deal” that made it easier for American companies to invest in slave labor overseas. As the cost of such deals became more widely apparent, the “ruling class” in D.C. became more inventive with its justifications. Bill Clinton opened up trade with communist China not because American companies could make a bundle from a workforce willing to work for subsistence wages, but rather because the introduction of Western commerce to China would be the camel’s nose under the communist tent. Globalization, in other words, was sold as a peaceful foreign policy that would make our adversaries more like us while avoiding military conflict and nuclear bluster. If blue jeans and the Beatles could collapse the Iron Curtain, then McDonald’s “Golden Arches” diplomacy would democratize communist China. At least that’s the hogwash Americans heard, as they watched their jobs move to the other side of the world. The costs for such foreign policy pipe dreams have been immense.

Title: Joe Duffy’s Liveline can sound unmoored when not anchored by weighty subjects

Full Content:
As if the prospect of the clocks going back this weekend wasn’t enough of a jolt, Joe Duffy confuses matters further on Monday when he decides to push time in the opposite direction. “Everyone in Ireland, we’re all going forward 12 minutes,” he declares on Liveline (RTÉ Radio 1, weekdays), apparently proclaiming the kind of unilateral temporal adjustment usually reserved for Renaissance-era popes. Cue a fanfare of barely audible clanging bells. Anyone worried about the host’s sanity can relax, however. In his exaggeratedly jokey manner, Duffy is merely facilitating Bob, a caller who demonstrates the hourly chimes of his vintage clock by moving its hands forward, though the resulting peals lose their impact over the phone. It’s part of a meandering conversation prompted by the imminent move to winter time; it was sparked by another caller, Eithne, who for many years refused to change the clocks in her house. “I felt I was gaining an extra hour of daylight,” she says, taunting those listeners about to lose an hour of their life to the aimless chat that ensues. Quixotic attempts to make time stand still notwithstanding, Duffy’s focus is otherwise firmly fixed on the past, as he mines guests for the fond reminiscences about old Ireland that increasingly dominate slow days on Liveline. So Tom remembers gauging the passage of his work day in the 1960s by listening out for the Angelus – “Very few people had watches in those days,” he says – while Jimmy recounts how entire parishes voted against changing the clocks a century ago. It’s all harmless enough, and occasionally even entertaining. “Are you an expert in time?” Duffy asks Jimmy. “Indeed I’m not, only killing it,” comes the reply, in an impishly immaculate vernacular. But the segment has no point other than filling airtime, underlining how unmoored Liveline can sound when not anchored by weighty subjects. But when the host dons his consumer-affairs hat, proceedings really tip into caricature, as Duffy talks to callers outraged at high prices for food. Among them are Mary, who’s incredulous at being charged €9.80 for two sausage rolls at a hospital canteen, and Keith, who’s annoyed that he was asked to pay an additional €2.35 after ordering breakfast from the “extras” section of the menu at a Dublin Airport cafe. One doesn’t have to be in favour of endemic price-gouging in airports and hospitals, nor be unsympathetic to the irritation felt by captive customers, to wonder whether gripes over such small sums merit coverage on the national airwaves. Even the host seems slightly nonplussed at the irritation at times – “Is the clue in the word ‘extra’?” he gently inquires about Keith’s complaint – but he allows his callers to vent anyway. Duffy may not be able to control time, but when he’s dealing with material like this, 20 minutes can seem like an eternity. Looking back at times gone by doesn’t always have to involve a veil of gauzy nostalgia. For 14 years now Myles Dungan has brought intelligence and accessibility to episodes from the past on The History Show (RTÉ Radio 1, Sunday). And while Dungan, a historian in his own right, is adept at handling big historical events, such as the momentous independence struggles commemorated during Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries, he can also imbue niche areas with wider interest – an important skill for any broadcaster. Dungan’s interview with the University College Dublin academic Phyllis Gaffney is a case in point. Gaffney has just published a history of language teaching in Victorian Ireland, a subject that might be charitably viewed as specialist, but the discussion that follows is wide-ranging and unexpectedly fascinating. Among the themes covered are the francophone origins of Blackrock College, the traditional dominance of the classics in British universities – a legacy that has continued down to Boris Johnson, Dungan notes – and how the innovative foreign-language education of 19th-century Ireland has given way to monolinguism as English becomes globally ubiquitous. It’s an object lesson in transforming potentially arid topics into lively radio. Even still, the nation’s long fight for freedom, that evergreen golden oldie of Irish popular history, also features in the show. Ian Kenneally reports on how the Civil War killing of a Westmeath anti-Treaty IRA man by Free State forces inspired both a modern song and an old ballad, the latter so sentimentally partisan in its republican mythmaking that even the Wolfe Tones might regard it as a tad one-sided. Dungan also talks to the Australian author Thomas Keneally about the controversial Irish patriot John Mitchel, the subject of his latest historical novel, Fanatic Heart. As well as being proud of his Irish roots, the Booker-winning writer is a genuine literary A-lister, so his presence on the show represents a coup. But it’s no backslapping encounter. [ Unholy row – An Irishman’s Diary on John Mitchel and Archbishop John HughesOpens in new window ] Instead Dungan and Keneally robustly dissect the troubling life of Mitchel, the exiled Young Irelander firebrand who escaped from Tasmania to the United States, where he became an ardent defender of slavery, siding with the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Asked by the host why he chose to write about a figure “long outed as a white supremacist”, Keneally grapples with Mitchel’s vile prejudice, influenced by prevailing racist theories and his revulsion at US capitalism, while unequivocally condemning it: he describes slavery as “absolute human obscenity”. It’s a stimulating joust, with Dungan repeatedly asking about Mitchel’s damaged legacy, while Keneally tries to understand his subject’s contrarian nature and extreme temperament. The author also offers self-deprecating asides on how racist Victorian phrenologists would have viewed his own heritage. “I’ve got a weird head from north Cork,” he chuckles. “I’ve got a criminal skull.” Still, by the end, Mitchel’s reputation is so tarnished that Dungan is surely right to wonder if so many GAA clubs should still bear his name. It’s history at its most compelling, though it wouldn’t make you want to turn back time. Sign up to the Irish Times books newsletter for features, podcasts and more © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Is Microsoft about to jump on the bitcoin train? Microsoft will give shareholders a vote on investing in itcoin on December 10, 2024, with the board recommending against the motion.

To the MOOOOOON? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Bitcoin has had a pretty good year so far, so good in fact that Microsoft itself is now considering investing in the cryptocurrency. For those who don't know, bitcoin is an industry-leading cryptocurrency whose "scarcity" is artificially perpetuated by processing-heavy math calculations. Dubbed crypto "mining," the practice uses GPUs like those supplied by NVIDIA to perform increasingly complex calculations, in exchange for fragments of a bitcoin token. Those bitcoins are then exchanged and traded as you might otherwise trade gold or other investable commodities, verified by a blockchain. A notable difference is that the market for bitcoin trading is always online, 24/7, and has been the subject of various controversies. RELATED: How to mine crypto and earn passive income Cryptocurrencies are often exploited by criminals to avoid the same kinds of scrutiny that traditional currencies face, and they also require vast amounts of processing power, which has led to criticism over their contributions to climate change and carbon emissions. Bitcoin is increasingly mined using renewable energy, however, and improvements in the regulatory environment have also made it easier to track criminals that exploit the currency for their own ends. Indeed, many of those regulatory improvements over the past year have led to a boost in confidence in the currency over the past year. It hit a new high of $73,000 per coin earlier in the year and has maintained a steady rate ever since. Bitcoin has outperformed various other similar assets too, and is often seen as a safe haven "off the grid" digital investment that can potentially avoid similar pitfalls faced by other assets, although bitcoin seems to generally react similarly in line with traditional stocks when volatility occurs. In any case, the confidence boost seems to have landed well at Microsoft, which plans to give its investors a vote on whether or not the company itself should start investing in the currency, per a new SEC filing. JUST IN: Per an SEC filing, Microsoft will have a proposed board resolution for an "Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin".The board is recommending that shareholders vote AGAINST the proposal. pic.twitter.com/0WveygitH9October 24, 2024 Reportedly, Microsoft's board of directors is investing that shareholders vote against the proposal, and it's not hard to see why. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. Tesla lost over $100 million playing around with the currency in 2022, although it still maintains mountains of assets in the currency. Elon Musk's car firm recently moved $750 million of its cryptocurrency assets into private wallets, which has some fearing a big sell-off may be around the corner. The overall market seems to be generally optimistic, however, with bitcoin almost hitting its spring highs again through October 2024. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. It's not entirely surprising that Microsoft may seek to invest in bitcoin. For all its volatility, it has remained a strong performer over time, and will probably only get stronger as technology improves, regulatory oversight improves, and nation-state politicians actually educate themselves on what it actually is. I don't hold any myself, but like many, I sure as hell wish I bought in early when it first arrived on the scene back in the day. It would be unlikely to do much for Microsoft's so-called climate pledge credentials, though. Microsoft's board of directors is advising shareholders not to vote in favor of the investment, which will likely sport enough influence to prevent the motion from going through. Microsoft wouldn't be the first traditional company to jump on the bitcoin train, though. Beyond Tesla itself, companies like BlackRock, Square, and various others have bitcoin holdings. Nation states like the United States and Germany have also massive bitcoin holdings, owing in part to legal forfeitures from law enforcement activities. Germany in particular sold billions of dollars worth of its crypto holdings over the past year, much of which was seized from criminals and the like. As usual, if you plan to invest in Bitcoin or, well, anything, be sure you're only investing as much as you'd be willing to lose, and speak to a qualified financial advisor!

Title: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Supports Crypto Self-Custody After Backlash on Earlier Remarks

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. MicroStrategy founder and chairman Michael Saylor recently posted that he supports self-custody. Saylor believes individuals and institutions globally should be free to choose the form of custodian and custody for their assets. These comments followed his earlier remarks endorsing regulated custody, which faced criticism from crypto community members, including Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin. The issue of centralization and custody has become one of the most debatable topics as crypto gets more woven into traditional finance. Many believe self-custody promotes security and decentralization, giving users greater control of their assets. In a post on X, staunch Bitcoin proponent Michael Saylor expressed his view regarding crypto self-custody. Saylor said he supports self-custody for anyone willing and able. I support self-custody for those willing & able, the right to self-custody for all, and freedom to choose the form of custody & custodian for individuals & institutions globally. #Bitcoin benefits from all forms of investment by all types of entities, and should welcome everyone. — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) October 23, 2024 He also mentioned that he supports “the right self-custody for all.” The MicroStrategy founder believes people should be free to choose the type of custody and custodian they want. “I support self-custody for those willing and able, the right self-custody for all, and freedom to choose the form of custody and custodian for individuals and institutions globally,” Saylor wrote in his X post. These remarks come after Saylor’s initial comment regarding crypto custody in a recent interview. During a chat with Madison Ready, a senior correspondent at NZ Herald, Saylor said holding Bitcoin through regulated entities like Fidelity and BlackRock was best. He believed this was a safer option with less risk of loss and volatility. Saylor said only “paranoid crypto anarchists” worry that this option could result in increased government control and centralization. He dismissed such concerns, saying they were exaggerated. Saylor’s remarks sparked criticism from notable community figureheads, including Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin condemned Saylor’s viewpoint, describing it as insane. According to the Ethereum co-founder, Saylor advocated for a “regulatory capture approach to protecting crypto.” I probably did more than most to spread the "mountain man" trope (btw I consider those remarks of mine outdated; snarks and AA changed the tradeoff space completely), and I'll happily say that I think @saylor's comments are batshit insane.

Meanwhile, Buterin’s remarks responded to a comment by Jameson Lopp, co-founder and CTO of Casa. Lopp asserted that self-custody is more than being “a paranoid mountain man.” According to Lopp, self-custody is vital for maintaining decentralization, preserving governance participation, enhancing network security, and fostering innovation. He also believes it will help scale the crypto networks without relying on third parties. Another notable Bitcoin proponent, Max Kieser, also criticized Saylor’s remarks. Kieser described Saylor’s viewpoint as an attack on self-custody. He said it reflects a backward tendency to favor the centralized banking legacy and defects that crypto is trying to correct. To address his previous remarks, Saylor said that Bitcoin benefits from various investments from various entities. So, it should welcome everyone. He believes it shouldn’t be lopsided; everyone should be free to choose what form of custody they want to embrace. The talks about self-custody became prominent as traditional bitcoin-based investment products like spot BTC ETFs gained more popularity. Since their launch in January, the 12 US spot bitcoin ETFs have received inflows exceeding $20 million. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described this as the most challenging milestone in the ETF landscape. Your email address will not be published.

Trading in Gift Nifty indicates a flat opening on Friday and another dull day for domestic markets. Amid mixed global cues, domestic benchmarks are expected to remain range-bound while action will be on the broader markets, said analysts. Stock-specific action will continue based on Q2-FY25 performance, they added. Dr Lal Pathlabs’ (DLPL) Q2-FY25 margins expanded by 110bps y-o-y on the back of improving contribution from Swasthfit and better margin performance at Suburban (about 600 bps q-o-q). Sample volume growth (+8.6 per cent y-o-y), however, remained soft owing to lower incidence of monsoon-related illnesses (except West region) and a higher base. Broadly, TVS Motor has reported bottom-line in line with estimates in Q2FY25 led by of sustenance of EBITDA margin at above 11 per cent level. Revenues increased by 13.3 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,228 crore (Vs estimate of ₹9,538 crore) on the back of 14.3 per cent y-o-y increase in volumes as ASPs declined by 0.9 per cent y-o-y.

We retain our BUY rating and TP unchanged at Rs1,230 on Krystal Integrated Services (KIS), a rising leader in the Integrated Facilities Management Services (IFMS). The company’s quarterly performance aligns with our estimates and sets a strong foundation for future growth, also supported by new contract wins in H1FY25. These wins, along with Krystal’s expansion into promising verticals like MEP services, robotics, and AI-driven technical solutions, are poised to drive sustainable growth. The strategic partnership with Vishnu Prasad Research Centre to commercialize solid waste management technology further strengthens its competitive edge and coupled with growing demand in the catering business is a perfect recipe for solid growth. With reduced working capital days and a stable revenue mix, Krystal is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising opportunity in the IFMS services. Valued at 16x Sept 26e EPS to arrive at TP of Rs1,230.

Manav Modi, Senior Analyst, Commodity Research, MOFSL Gold prices steadied but were headed for a weekly gain, driven by safe-haven demand due to escalating geopolitical concerns. Israel’s military said yesterday it killed a Hamas commander who took part in the Oct. 7, 2023, assault on southern Israel and also worked for the U.N. aid agency in the Gaza Strip. Uncertainty is also high ahead of U.S. Election Day on Nov. 5, with polls showing a tight race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. New applications for U.S. unemployment aid unexpectedly fell last week, but the number of people collecting benefits in mid-October was the highest in nearly three years, indicating it was becoming harder for those losing jobs to land new positions.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has called jobs the most pressing global issue. She has also urged the World Bank to collaborate with countries to identify high-priority skilling sectors that generate employment. She was making intervention at the plenary lunch during the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank while speaking on the topic ‘How Should the World Bank Shape Its Future Strategic Direction and Help Clients Create More Jobs to Keep Pace with Evolving Megatrends.’” She emphasised that jobs are the most pressing global issue, given the continued economic headwinds and rapid technological change that are redefining the skills required for youth to enter the job market,” a social media post of Finance Ministry quoting Sitharaman said. Trading in Gift Nifty indicates a flat opening on Friday and another dull day for domestic markets. Amid mixed global cues, domestic benchmarks are expected to remain range-bound while action will be on the broader markets, said analysts. Stock-specific action will continue based on Q2-FY25 performance, they added. Dr Lal Pathlabs’ (DLPL) Q2-FY25 margins expanded by 110bps y-o-y on the back of improving contribution from Swasthfit and better margin performance at Suburban (about 600 bps q-o-q). Sample volume growth (+8.6 per cent y-o-y), however, remained soft owing to lower incidence of monsoon-related illnesses (except West region) and a higher base. Broadly, TVS Motor has reported bottom-line in line with estimates in Q2FY25 led by of sustenance of EBITDA margin at above 11 per cent level. Revenues increased by 13.3 per cent y-o-y to ₹9,228 crore (Vs estimate of ₹9,538 crore) on the back of 14.3 per cent y-o-y increase in volumes as ASPs declined by 0.9 per cent y-o-y. Coforge (₹7,699): The stock bounced off the 50-day moving average (DMA) this week and broke out of the resistance at ₹7,500. But note that ₹7,700 is a potential resistance. We retain our BUY rating and TP unchanged at Rs1,230 on Krystal Integrated Services (KIS), a rising leader in the Integrated Facilities Management Services (IFMS). The company’s quarterly performance aligns with our estimates and sets a strong foundation for future growth, also supported by new contract wins in H1FY25. These wins, along with Krystal’s expansion into promising verticals like MEP services, robotics, and AI-driven technical solutions, are poised to drive sustainable growth. The strategic partnership with Vishnu Prasad Research Centre to commercialize solid waste management technology further strengthens its competitive edge and coupled with growing demand in the catering business is a perfect recipe for solid growth. With reduced working capital days and a stable revenue mix, Krystal is well-positioned to capitalize on the rising opportunity in the IFMS services.

Qatar's Nebras Power’s plan to acquire up to 49% stake in Aditya Birla Group’s renewable energy business for around $400 million has been put on hold due to “valuation mismatch", according to two people aware of the development. The other bidders that participated in the sale process for Aditya Birla Renewables Ltd were Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo) and BlackRock’ Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP). Mint earlier reported that Aditya Birla Group had hired Standard Chartered to sell up to 49% stake in the group’s renewable energy business to raise around $400 million. On 18 December, Moneycontrol reported that the conglomerate was in advanced negotiations with Nebras Power to scale up its renewable resources business housed under Grasim Industries. India targets to more than double its green energy capacity from the current level to 500 gigawatts by 2030, drawing interest from the world’s biggest institutional and corporate investors. Also read | India's renewable energy boom stunted by regulatory ambiguity over sales accords “But the Indian market faces a particular challenge because returns are at the lower end, whereas execution risks are relatively higher," said Vinay Rustagi, senior director, global head of renewables, Crisil Ltd. “The utility scale auctions have always been intensely competitive, and the C&I (commercial and industrial) market has moved in the same direction as more players have moved in. Moreover, global return expectations have moved up in response to key macroeconomic factors." Spokespersons for Aditya Birla Group, Standard Chartered and Global Infrastructure Partners declined to comment. Queries emailed to the spokespersons of Nebras Power, and AIMCo on Monday remained unanswered. Aditya Birla Renewables plans to more than double its installed renewable energy capacity to 4.5 GW by FY26 through utility and commercial and industrial (C&I) projects. The investment portfolio of Doha-headquartered Nebras Power, owned by Qatar Electricity Water Company, includes an installed capacity of 6.79 GW. AIMCo, which manages $168.9 billion worth of assets, has an infrastructure and renewable global portfolio of $20 billion. BlackRock Inc. recently acquired GIP that has around $170 billion of assets.

Thailand’s energy firm Banpu Public Company Ltd recently joined the fray with former US vice-president Al Gore-headed Generation Investment Management’s Just Climate LLP, and Singapore’s CapitaLand Investment Ltd to acquire Eversource Capital-backed Radiance Renewables Pvt. Ltd in a deal having an enterprise value of around $325 million. A host of Australian superannuation funds such as AustralianSuper, UniSuper and Hostplus, among others, are also eyeing investment in domestic renewable energy space. India has an installed renewable energy capacity of 210 GW, including 90.76 GW of solar and 47.36 GW of wind power. States such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have taken the lead in setting up green energy projects with an installed capacity of 29.98 GW, 29.52 GW, 23.70 GW, and 22.37 GW, respectively. In addition, the government is focusing on promoting local manufacturing, with around 10 GW of installed cell production and 60 GW of module manufacturing capacity. The country’s renewable energy sector has seen an investment of ₹8.5 trillion between 2014 and 2023. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: The next phase of digital asset growth in Thailand
URL: https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2890003/the-next-phase-of-digital-asset-growth-in-thailand
Time Published: 2024-10-24T22:26:00Z
Full Content:
In a progressive move to adapt to the evolving landscape of digital assets, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Thailand has proposed new regulations aimed at expanding the scope for mutual and private funds to invest in digital assets. This strategic step reflects global trends and brings an opportunity for broader acceptance and maturity in Thailand's cryptocurrency market. The proposed regulations are open for public consultation and have the potential to usher in a new era of adoption and legitimacy for digital assets, including Bitcoin and other digital assets. This regulatory move is a vital step in the maturation of Thailand's cryptocurrency landscape. By allowing more institutional funds to participate, the SEC is enabling a diverse range of investment strategies and helping digital assets gain broader acceptance in the mainstream. This is not just about legitimising Bitcoin -- it's about creating a more mature ecosystem where traditional finance and digital assets coexist. The institutional participation is likely to accelerate technological advancements and expand adoption of blockchain technologies in Thailand. With global trends pointing towards increased corporate adoption of blockchain, as seen with firms like BlackRock and Fidelity, this could pave the way for Thai financial institutions to similarly expand their portfolios and exposure to digital assets, positioning Thailand as a regional digital asset hub. One anticipated impact of the new capital flows from institutions is that they will create higher liquidity and more stable price points in the crypto market. The involvement of institutional capital typically requires clearer regulatory frameworks, which will enhance investor protections and market standardisation. This is critical for fostering innovation while ensuring market stability. Like traditional financial powerhouses, Thai institutions may begin to adopt digital assets as part of their portfolios, which will not only increase financial inclusion but also boost the country's competitiveness and prosperity in financial technologies. For Thai investors, particularly those in mutual or private funds, the new policies offer significant advantages. These funds will now have access to emerging asset classes such as Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), allowing investors to diversify their portfolios more easily. Historically, digital assets like Bitcoin have demonstrated substantial growth, albeit with high volatility. However, when managed within diversified portfolios, they can provide strong risk-adjusted returns and act as a hedge against traditional market fluctuations. By allowing professional fund managers to oversee these assets, investors who may not have the expertise or risk tolerance for direct investment in cryptocurrencies can still benefit from the growth of digital assets. Furthermore, the structured and regulated environment created by these policies will ensure that investors can access digital assets in a safer, more transparent manner, offering long-term growth potential in Thailand's digital economy. Beyond the current policy proposal, the SEC is also considering new regulations for other crypto activities. Binance TH believes that effective regulation will be key to bringing greater clarity and stability to the market, while also fostering innovation. The industry calls for forward-looking regulation with enough flexibility to accommodate emerging sectors like blockchain technology. With such policies in place, we can expect the pace of digital asset adoption to accelerate in the coming years, touching all aspects of the financial industry. Another major trend we witnessed is the convergence of traditional and digital assets markets. One example of this is the tokenisation of real world assets (RWA), where more traditional financial institutions like banks are exploring the possibilities of converting traditional assets such as bonds, real estate or equities into digital assets that can be traded on blockchain networks. Tokenisation brings 24/7 trading, increased liquidity, and cross-border accessibility, which could reshape traditional financial markets and make investment opportunities more inclusive. Looking ahead, Binance TH expects that digital assets will continue to disrupt the financial landscape by streamlining processes, reducing costs and expanding access. As the lines between traditional finance and digital assets blur, we can anticipate an increasingly dynamic and transparent ecosystem where both sectors complement each other. The SEC's regulatory updates ensure that Thailand can continue its progression as a digital asset hub, providing a secure and dynamic ecosystem for all participants. For Binance TH, these regulatory shifts align with our mission to foster innovation and transparency in the digital asset space. Our goal is to support the development of a robust and compliant ecosystem that empowers both retail and institutional investors. By working closely with regulators, Binance TH remains committed to shaping the future of digital finance in Thailand, setting the stage for long-term growth and industry leadership. Nirun Fuwattananukul is the chief executive of Binance TH.

Title: The Green New Scam Is Dying

Time Published: 2024-10-24T22:02:57Z

By James Rickards Posted October 24, 2024 It’s no secret that the vast majority of the so-called elites are advocates of climate alarmism and are taken in by the Green New Scam. Whether this preference is based on ignorance of the science, ideological zeal, a willful desire to hurt American growth or simple greed because of their investments in Green New Scam infrastructure varies case by case. The typical upper-income supporter of the climate cult including academics, media figures and celebrities is probably ignorant of the fact that there is no evidence that CO2 emissions cause climate change and that the real causes are solar cycles, volcanoes, ocean currents and atmospheric moisture not caused by humans. The historical record actually demonstrates that warming periods produce higher CO2 levels — not the other way around. CO2 doesn’t cause warming. It’s caused by natural warming. In other words, climate alarmists have causation completely backward. Climate alarmism is based almost entirely on computer models, which depend on the inputs the modelers themselves build into them. A model is only as good as the inputs and assumptions programmed into it. Virtually every one of these models has overestimated warming, sometimes by orders of magnitude, because it’s based on faulty assumptions that overestimate the impact of CO2 on climate. In other words, it’s junk science. But they keep relying on these models because their political agenda requires it. There’s no doubt that a fair number of neo-Marxists embrace the climate scam because they know it damages U.S. industry, raises costs to U.S. consumers and helps to undermine the U.S. economy. Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of communism, anti-capitalistic collectivists admitted that they needed to promote the climate agenda because the only way to combat global warming is through collective action. It requires a coordinated global effort that limits national sovereignty. The neo-Marxists are impervious to evidence; they just want to hurt America and wasting money on windmills instead of building new refineries is a good way to do it. That leaves the greed crowd. They’re early investors in windmills, solar modules, lithium car batteries, EVs, charging stations, carbon credits and other infrastructure of the climate scam. They stand to make billions of dollars off the narrative with help from extravagant government subsidies. They don’t really care if it all collapses in the end (which it will) as long as they get rich at taxpayer expense in the meantime. All of this behavior is clear as far as it goes. What is not clear is the extent to which the Green New Scammers are doing this with your money. The best example is multibillionaire Larry Fink, who runs the giant BlackRock investment fund. Fink has been aggressive in promoting the climate scam along with racial quotas, DEI and defunding police. He’s entitled to his opinions. But is he entitled to pursue his radical agenda with pension fund money from conservative states and institutions? Fortunately, a backlash has begun against Fink and his fellow wokesters. More state pension fund managers are beginning to pull their funds from BlackRock and other investment managers that pursue far-left policies not in the best interests of their beneficiaries. This backlash may not change Larry Fink’s lifestyle. But over time, it might change the world for the better. A major part of the climate agenda includes electric vehicles (EVs). I’ve been warning for years that EVs aren’t feasible as a transportation solution for more than relatively few Americans and that they are little more than glorified golf carts despite the $70,000-and-up price tags. In the first place, EVs don’t cut carbon emissions. The car itself does not have emissions, but it’s charged with electricity from power plants that do. The batteries are made with poisonous chemicals and metals including lithium, cobalt, copper and nickel that come from mining operations that use enormous amounts of water and electricity to extract the needed materials. It takes thousands of tons of ore to extract enough critical minerals to make one battery. EVs don’t take a charge in extreme cold, and the batteries can’t hold a charge. Travel range is grossly overstated for many reasons, including the fact that EV car heaters drain the batteries (with internal-combustion engines, ICEs, the engine makes heat which can easily be directed into the car to keep passengers comfortable with no additional energy required). Resale values of EVs are close to zero because buyers of used EVs have to shell out $25,000 or more for new batteries after the vehicle is about seven years old. The list of drawbacks goes on. Most Americans have resisted EVs because they understand the disadvantages. But many Americans were drawn to the false promise of emission-free transportation and other ridiculous claims by the Green New Scammers. Now even the most committed EV buyers are waking up. A fairly recent survey by consulting firm McKinsey and Co. shows that 29% of EV owners in nine major economies want to return to ICE vehicles. When the sample is narrowed to just the U.S., 46% of those surveyed want to return to ICEs. The McKinsey officials who conducted the survey claimed to be “surprised” by those results. That probably says something about the fact that McKinsey experts were just as deluded about EVs as the buyers surveyed. When breaking down the results, 45% say EVs are too expensive, 33% say they have charging concerns and 29% are concerned about the limited driving range. The truth is that the EV was invented in 1837 and reached the peak of its popularity in 1910 just before the mass production of internal-combustion cars by Henry Ford. The American public got it right when they flocked to the Model T. It sounds like they’re getting it right again after a brief infatuation with the false promise of the EV. The bottom line is that the Green New Scam is falling apart. It can’t happen soon enough.

Title: Bernstein Analysts Foresee Bitcoin’s Massive Price Eruption To $200,000 By 2025-End — And That’s Being ‘Conservative’

Although Bitcoin (BTC)’s price has plunged recently, analysts at brokerage firm Bernstein still believe the world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency has more gas left in the tank. They anticipate BTC hitting $200,000 over the next year or more. Bernstein has provided an ultra-bullish prediction for Bitcoin. In an Oct. 23 research note to clients, Bernstein’s Gautam Chhugani, Mahika Sapra, and Sanskar Chindalia predicted that BTC could soar to as high as $200,000 in the next year or so as the crypto enters a new institutional era. “With accelerating institutional adoption, we expect Bitcoin to triple from here to attain a cycle-high price of $200,000 by 2025 end,” the report read. “We are being conservative,” they posited, citing the record U.S. national debt levels. With the government’s debt crossing the $35 trillion level, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an increasingly appealing store of value. Bitcoin recently broke through the $69,000 level for the first time in almost three months before dropping to as little as $65,160. The largest cryptocurrency has since rebounded above $67,000 today, adding under 2% in the past 24 hours. BTC touched its current all-time high of just above $73,730 in March. Bernstein strategists had previously forecasted that Bitcoin could hit $150,000 in 2025 due to the unprecedented demand for the U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They reiterated in Wednesday’s report that demand for these investment vehicles will propel the price of the crypto higher. The optimistic long-term outlook of Bitcoin is getting a boost as institutions increasingly embrace the premier crypto. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, is now offering traditional investors exposure to Bitcoin via the spot ETFs. According to Bernstein, Wall Street could replace Satoshi as the top Bitcoin wallet by the end of this year. As the 10 spot BTC ETFs continue accumulating inflows, Bernstein suggested that the activity is setting the stage for Bitcoin’s price breakout phase. “We are on the verge of a new cycle,” Chhugani, Sapra, and Chindalia wrote. For the investors not interested in BTC ETFs, the analysts recommend shares in MicroStrategy, the world’s largest publicly traded corporate holder of Bitcoin and Robinhood, which is continuing to broaden its crypto services, as alternatives for indirect exposure. Bernstein’s prognostication is obviously not bulletproof. However, amid the skyrocketing national debt of the United States and institutional adoption, Bitcoin hitting $200,000 by 2025 seems increasingly likely.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 7 Best E-commerce Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against the other e-commerce stocks to buy according to hedge funds. E-commerce is growing faster than expected and as new avenues of selling online open up, companies are bound to keep up with trends and innovative strategies. According to a report by Forbes, the e-commerce industry is expected to grow to a valuation of $7.9 trillion by 2027 from $6.3 trillion in 2024. In 2027, 23% of retail purchases are expected to be made online, up from 20.1% in 2024. In the United States, low-income households, with a yearly income of $50,000 or less, happened to spend the most on online spending compared to other groups. On October 17, Reuters reported that retail sales in September increased, as gas prices fell, allowing consumers to spend elsewhere. Overall, the average consumer in the United States spent mostly on clothing, health and personal care stores, and miscellaneous items. Amid rising consumer confidence and spending, the Atlanta Fed raised its GDP estimates for Q3 to 3.4%, up from a previous guidance of 3.2%. Overall, retail sales grew by 0.4% last month. READ ALSO: 8 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 8 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5 to Buy Chinese e-commerce stocks have been on the rise, despite uncertain macro-economic conditions in the country. As the Chinese government attempts to stimulate the economy, these companies may perform better than expected, meaning other global e-commerce stocks will have to ramp up their investments in sustainable growth strategies. On October 21, Reuters reported that the world’s largest luxury brands in France and Italy reported a decline in quarterly sales as the growing second-hand and grey market for luxury goods in China continues to expand, and demand for luxury brands falls. The second-hand luxury goods market is estimated to be valued at $57 billion, fueled by platforms such as DeWu, where used luxury products are sold at discounted prices. Reuters estimates that DeWu reported a 19% increase across its 48 brands during Q2 2024. Since China makes up 25% of the revenues in the retail sector, consumers shifting to local platforms may cause a hit to global commerce and retail companies. On October 9, Reuters reported that amid fierce market competition online shopping has been increasing in Europe and other parts of the world. The online shopping market in Europe is expected to reach EUR 958 billion in 2024, up from EUR 887 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 8%, or 5% in inflation-adjusted terms. However, e-commerce experts in Europe share concerns over the growing popularity of cheap e-commerce platforms, especially Temu, increasing competition for local brands. On the flip side, Temu states that it believes in supporting local brands and has invited local merchants in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain to join the platform. The e-commerce industry is rapidly changing and growing, thanks to technology, macroeconomic conditions, and geopolitics. Despite the turmoil, some stocks continue to outperform others. That said, let’s take a look at the 7 best e-commerce stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Our Methodology To compile the list of the 7 best e-commerce stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we looked at holdings of e-commerce ETFs and screened for Internet Retail companies on the Finviz stock screener. We sorted our screen by market cap and looked at the 20 largest e-commerce companies. We picked stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:WMT) is one of the biggest retail companies in the world that operates retail outlets, wholesale units, and e-commerce sites in more than 19 countries serving over 255 million customers every week. Walmart entered the e-commerce space in 2000 and reported $100 billion in e-commerce sales in the fiscal year 2024, up from $73 billion in FY 2022. Walmart’s e-commerce footprint is increasing, as evidenced by a 21% growth in its e-commerce segment overall during the fiscal second quarter of 2025. Total revenue, on the other hand, increased by 4.8% to reach $169.3 billion. In addition to that, the company is on track to add a staggering $130 billion in sales if it achieves its 4% sales growth target over the next five years. The company’s journey to customer-centric innovation is accelerating. In FQ1 2025, the company launched a generative AI-powered product search tool and a data analytics platform allowing customers to shop more effectively and receive intuitive product recommendations. On October 9, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) launched its strategy to accelerate adaptive retailing.

For the fiscal year 2025, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) expects net sales to increase by 3.75% to 4.75%, revised from its previous guidance of 3% to 4%. Overall WMT ranks 2nd among the 7 best e-commerce stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of WMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Photo by CardMapr.nl on Unsplash Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84 MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) is an online marketplace headquartered in Uruguay. The company was founded in 1999 and is on track to become the largest e-commerce company in Latin America. Today, MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) is present in 18 countries and has over 65 million buyers and 12 million sellers. MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) is one of the largest e-commerce companies in Latin America and reported gross merchandise value worth $45 billion in 2023. The company has grown its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 28% between 2016 and 2023. During the second quarter of 2024, the company generated $12.6 billion in gross merchandise value, up by 20%, and sold nearly 421 million items, up by 29% year-over-year. Unique active buyers reached 56.6 million during the second quarter of 2024, up from 47.6 million in the second quarter of 2023, the fastest growth since the second quarter of 2021. Brazil contributed most to this trend, with a growth rate of 22% year-over-year. MercadoLibre’s (NASDAQ:MELI) e-commerce infrastructure is stringent, allowing it to facilitate faster deliveries. In 2023, MercadoLibre delivered 1.38 billion items, and 76% of them were delivered within 48 hours in the last quarter of 2023. Overall, MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) has grown its revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 28% between 2016 and 2023. Its consistent performance and growing customer base are its economic moat. To align with its expansion strategy, the company expects penetration to increase in growth markets such as Latin America, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Lakehouse Capital’s Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI) in its May 2024 investor letter: "The Fund’s largest position, Buenos Aires based e-commerce leader MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), reported a robust result that once again came in ahead of analyst expectations. Net revenue grew 30% year-on-year in U.S. dollar terms to US$4.0 billion while operating margins came in at 12.0%, providing a healthy balance of growth and profitability. Its marketplace business proved resilient, with strength in Brazil and Mexico more than enough to offset weakness in Argentina, which contacted by roughly a third due to weak macroeconomic conditions exacerbated by the 50%-plus devaluation of the Argentine Peso in December 2023. Whilst the economic situation in Argentia remains severe, we are comfortable with the risk as not only has management proved very adept at handling the challenges to date, but post the devaluation, the risk is meaningfully reduced as Argentina now only contributes 13% of the company’s total operating income. Overall, gross merchandise value still grew at 20% year-on-year to $11.4 billion and we continue to see significant opportunities ahead given the relatively nascent penetration of e-commerce in the region." Overall MELI ranks 5th among the 7 best e-commerce stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential MELI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MELI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Worst Performing Dow Stocks Year-to-Date. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Merck (NYSE:MRK) stands against other worst performing Dow stocks year-to-date. After the disastrous performance of 2022, the market has recovered better than expected and is on a growth trajectory. According to BlackRock’s Q4 2024 Equity Market Outlook, despite concerns about the economy, fundamentals have kept stocks resilient. Opportunities are seen in large-cap stocks, which may outperform both mega and small caps. Volatility is viewed as normal and can create buying opportunities, especially when driven by market sentiment rather than fundamentals. Historically, market corrections of 10% or more are common but long-term investors have still enjoyed solid returns. The report states that elections and Fed rate cuts may also impact the market, with rate cuts typically benefiting large-cap and high-quality stocks. Healthcare and consumer staples sectors have traditionally performed well after rate cuts, while cyclical sectors may improve as the economy recovers. Finally, it mentioned that technology, which is usually a laggard in rate-cutting cycles, looks well-positioned this time due to innovations like AI. Long-term patience is essential in navigating volatility, as the market has proven resilient over decades through various crises. READ ALSO: 8 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 10 Worst Performing Blue Chip Stocks in 2024 In a CNBC interview, chief strategist and economist of Solus Alternative Asset, Dan Greenhaus discussed stock market volatility, with mega-cap earnings and the upcoming election contributing to potential fluctuations. He mentioned that the market is already experiencing some volatility, as reflected in the elevated VIX. Despite this, he highlighted that the economy is still growing, albeit at a slower pace, and earnings are rising, which is creating a generally favorable environment for equities. Greenhaus also addressed concerns about market valuations and noted that while current multiples are high historically, determining what constitutes “rich” valuation levels can be difficult without hindsight. Lastly, Greenhaus referenced a trading strategy of “buying high and selling higher,” suggesting that investors should remain engaged in the market even during record highs. Our Methodology For this article, we checked the year-to-date performance of all the Dow components and selected 10 stocks out of 30, that had the worst share price performance on a year-to-date basis on October 21. We listed the stocks in descending order of their share price performance. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of 912 elite hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a person's hand holding a bottle of pharmaceuticals. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 96 Share Price Performance Year-to-Date: -6.09% Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is an international healthcare company that offers advanced health solutions through prescription drugs, vaccines, biological therapies, and animal health products. The company emphasizes research and development, aiming to address various health conditions, such as cancer, infections, and cardiovascular diseases. It takes the 4th spot on our list of worst performing Dow stocks. One of the main reasons for Merck’s (NYSE:MRK) declining performance has been concerns about Keytruda’s U.S. patent expiring in 2028, which have led to lower stock prices. Moreover, the company stock was performing relatively well before its Q2 earnings (still slightly below the broader market). The stock declined significantly after it cuts its earnings forecasts for 2024. While the company posted strong earnings, beating the revenue and EPS estimates, it narrowed its non-GAAP EPS to the range of $7.94 and $8.04, compared to the prior $8.53 to $8.65 per share. Between July 29 and 31, the company stock dropped nearly 11.5%. However, Merck (NYSE:MRK) is still a strong company and it is strengthening its pipeline significantly. The company’s significant achievements include the successful launch of WINREVAIR, a new treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, and the FDA approval of CAPVAXIVE, the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically for adults. While the acquisition of EyeBio is one of the reasons for its narrowed earnings forecasts, the impact seems to be a one-time thing according to the company management and improves the company’s ophthalmology portfolio for the future. The company’s management believes that its pipeline is ready for substantial growth, with a potential for launching as many new drugs in the next five years as in the previous decade. Oakmark Equity and Income Fund stated the following regarding Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) is a global pharmaceutical firm with leading oncology, vaccine and animal health franchises. Premier products in Merck’s portfolio include Keytruda, Gardasil, Winrevair and Bravecto. Outsized contributor Keytruda is an immuno-oncology drug that treats several cancers and tumors. Keytruda is an astounding clinical and commercial success that is on track to become one of the best-selling prescription drugs to date. Investor angst surrounding Keytruda’s pending U.S. patent expiration in 2028 presented a chance to buy shares at a discounted valuation. We believe opportunities to extend Keytruda’s duration through life cycle management are underappreciated. More importantly, discounted cash flows from products already on market cover today’s entire stock price, meaning there is minimal value ascribed to a promising pipeline with strong sales potential. We believe Merck is led by a capable management team that looks to reinvest these cash flows in an accretive manner.” Overall, MRK ranks 4th on our list of worst performing Dow stocks year-to-date. While we acknowledge the potential of MRK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MRK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A team of trainers and athletes displaying a wide range of athletic and casual footwear. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66 Share Price Performance Year-to-Date: -23.53% NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) designs, develops, and markets athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, and accessories. It stands as the leading global seller in this sector. The company operates through both direct sales through NIKE-owned stores and digital platforms and wholesale channels that include independent distributors and licensees across numerous countries. Most of its products are manufactured by independent contractors outside the U.S. Some of NIKE’s (NYSE:NKE) main issues include intense competition, declining earnings and revenue, and a weak revenue forecast for fiscal Q2. In fiscal Q1 2025, while the company beat the earnings estimates by $0.18 after reporting an EPS of $0.70, they were down 26% year-over-year. The revenue missed the estimates by $50 million and declined by 10%. The results met the company’s expectations but showed lower-than-anticipated unit sales, especially in NIKE Digital and partner stores in Greater China. The company is intentionally reducing its reliance on classic footwear franchises, leading to a decline in revenue from these products. As the company shifts its product portfolio, it expects continued challenges in the short term, especially in its lifestyle and Jordan brand sectors. NIKE (NYSE:NKE) expects that Q2 revenues will also decline, with projected gross margins impacted by higher promotional activity and supply chain challenges. Moreover, the company has been seeing quite a neutral sentiment from analysts for the near term as well. The latest Hold ratings were given by Piper Sandler and UBS on October 11 and 15, respectively. The price targets of $80 and $82 also show a slight downside to the company stock as of October 18. Coho Partners stated the following regarding NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “While we believe each of those companies is performing in line with or better than our expectations and that the moves lower are unjustified, both CVS and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) reported disappointing performance in recent results. For Nike, the company reported mixed fourth quarter Fiscal 2024 results and weak Fiscal 2025 guidance, reflecting top line pressure from lifestyle product slowing, lower digital sales and increased macro headwinds in international markets. To manage through the decline in sports footwear and apparel demand, the senior leadership team is focused on cutting costs and reinvesting in marketing and innovation to drive sales. The company is starting to see green shoots for performance product innovation and has historically emerged stronger from these downturns due to benefits from a leading market position and scale.” Overall, NKE ranks 3rd on our list of worst performing Dow stocks year-to-date. While we acknowledge the potential of NKE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: BlackRock Introduces Three iShares ETFs to Customize Exposure to U.S. Large Caps

The new ETFs add to the iShares Build ETF line-up to expand granular access to U.S. companies UC Investments (University of California) committed as an early investor of the iShares Nasdaq Top 30 Stocks ETF (QTOP) NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The increasing prominence of mega-cap stocks in recent years underscores the critical need for investors to modernize the way they capture growth of some of the world's most well-known companies. Today, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) announced the launch of three new ETFs to empower investors with simple solutions to express more granular views on the largest companies listed in the U.S. The new ETFs are part of the iShares Build ETFs “ a new toolkit to provide investors with portfolio building blocks to customize their U.S. market cap exposure with the convenience and flexibility of an ETF. The iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (NYSE:TOPT), iShares Nasdaq Top 30 Stocks ETF (Nasdaq:QTOP), and iShares Nasdaq-100 ex-Top 30 ETF (Nasdaq:QNXT) “ join established ETFs, iShares MSCI USA Equal Weighted ETF (EUSA) and iShares S&P 100 ETF (OEF), to broaden easy access to manage U.S. equity exposure. The iShares Build ETFs help investors harness the power of growth and innovation within the largest U.S. companies in a precise way, said Rachel Aguirre, U.S. Head of iShares Products at BlackRock. Now is the time for investors to rethink their market exposure and how they can aim to capitalize on the growth potential of these companies. The beauty of these ETFs is that they can be used by investors looking for more targeted exposure to mega caps or those looking to broaden their exposure to large, well-known companies, added Rachel Aguirre.

Title: Tucker Carlson Tells Rally 'Daddy' Trump Will Spank America For Being 'Bad Little Girl'

It’s no longer terribly surprising when Donald Trump says completely weird, inappropriate things in public, even when they’re surprisingly terrible things. It’s also not surprising that his supporters are willing to overlook his habitual admiration for Hitler and other dictators. He’s quirky, no big deal. But at a Trump rally hosted by Turning Point USA rally in Duluth, Georgia, Wednesday, former Fox News creep Tucker Carlson managed to out-weird the Great Man himself. In a disturbing metaphor, Carlson compared Trump to a “Dad” who needed to severely and painfully discipline a rebellious underaged girl by giving her a “vigorous spanking” because she was such a naughty “bad little girl,” VOMIT. Worse, the crowd loved it and chanted “DADDY’S HOME!” when Trump took the stage, because they’re all a bunch of weirdos who want to see their enemies punished and humiliated. Also, aren’t these the people who are freaked out about George Soros and Hillary Clinton’s nonexistent child trafficking ring? Weird fantasies about spanking little girls is fine though, as long as it’s Daddy. We don’t kink shame, but for fuckssake, keep the roleplay in the bedroom, not in the spotlight of a presidential campaign where nobody can say the safeword and make it stop. Wonkette is is a big fan of human bondage and other Somerset Maugham classics, as long as it’s consensual. Support us with a paid sub-scription if you can. Here, for those of you who may feel you need chastisement, is the weird freaky video (if you click “play” that’s consent, OK?) In the video, Carlson railed disjointedly about how Kamala Harris is completely incompetent, and claimed that if she wins the 2024 election, well that is automatically a crime because she has no right to “lecture” you, and “It’s too much! We can’t allow that! It’s an offense against the truth, against reality, and against Justice itself!” Then it was time for the weird daddy stuff, where he said when Trump returns to office, all the people who have ruined America will get their comeuppance, because he’s the daddy and we need to be set straight. Nothing fascist about saying the Great Leader is the stern national parent, heavens no! The Left’s misbehavior mustn’t be tolerated a moment longer, because “if you allow it, you will encourage more of it. If you allow people to get away with things that are completely over the top and outrageous …” Here we thought maybe he was talking about letting people try to overturn an election without facing legal accountability, but no, he was talking about all us troublemaking children in the USA: “If you allow your 2-year-old to smear the contents of his diapers on the wall of your living room and you do nothing about it, if you allow your 14-year-old to light a joint at the breakfast table, if you allow your hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter to slam the door of her bedroom and give you the finger, you’re gonna get more of it and those kids are going to wind up in rehab! “It’s not good for you and it’s not good for them. No, there has to be a point at which Dad comes home.” (enthusiastic applause) And then, the spankings will begin, and we do wish to remind you again that this is not from a sleazy porn fantasy, it is Serious Political Thought, in which Trump is like both Dad and the Old Testament version of the Almighty chastising his wayward children. “Yeah, that's right! Dad comes home. And he's pissed! Dad is pissed! He’s not vengeful. He loves his children, disobedient as they may be, he loves them because they’re his children. They live in his house. But he’s very disappointed in their behavior and he’s going to have to let them know. “‘Get to your room right now and think about what you did!’ And when Dad gets home, you know what he says? “You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now. And no, it’s not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it’s not. I’m not going to lie. This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this. You’re getting a vigorous spanking because you’ve been a bad girl.” Just a very normal, not at all creepy explanation of how a loving father should correct the behavior of a “hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter” who is also America. If it helps, Carlson insisted Daddy wouldn’t spank his underaged daughter in a spirit of hate or vengeance, because it’s simply justice and it must be done, OK? If you think anything he said sounds skeevy, that just proves you’re the degenerate. We simply need to stop the “party of weak men and unhappy women” from destroying America. Nothing against Harris or Tim Walz or even Pete Buttigieg (hey, why him we wonder), these people are all interchangeable, “and they need to have limits set for them.” Oh, it gets worse. When Trump came to the stage, the crowd shouted “Daddy’s Home” and “Daddy Don,” and that too is just about as wholesome and normal as it gets. For the sake of due diligence, we skim-watched Carlson’s full 20-minute introduction, especially the minutes leading up to this clip, to see what specific “crimes” Carlson said we had all committed. Guess what! It took a very dark, antisemitic turn! This is also not terribly new for Carlson, but with all the weirdly pervy stuff, it seems to have been overlooked by virtually all the outlets that reported on the spanking stuff. At first it seemed like the same Culture Wars/White Grievance shtick that Carlson has always pushed, although he framed it as a wonderful thing that these days, rightwing Trump supporters, the only true Americans, have shut themselves into a bubble, because it’s the real reality, and everyone in media and politics and nonTrump America is denying reality. But along the way, he insisted that “almost every single person” on MSNBC has “a personal life so grotesquely weird [that] if you knew the details, you’d call for their arrest.” (We knew that Rachel Maddow does catch-and-release fly fishing and Chris Hayes loves his e-bike, but wow!) Carlson explained that such horrible freaks can’t be allowed to define the terms of the national conversation, no way. He also was mad about immigration and called it the greatest crime in US history, then explained that Real America is a very nice, tolerant place that, because it’s so decent and tolerant, has “put up with this crap for too long” from “people who never built anything in their lives” who tear down statues and “spit on the graves of your ancestors, and (((who on earth could he be talking about)))? It’s unjust, he said, for the “majority” to “reward the most parasitic, useless, violent, nasty, aggressive people in your country. You can’t make them the richest. It’s just wrong!” Gosh, he never said the bad guys had hooked noses, so maybe it wasn’t an antisemitic dogwhistle. But then, Carlson named only example those America-destroying parasites who actually run the country instead of its hardworking honest decent smartest talented majority: Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock. He happened to be the one usurper whose name came to Carlson out of the blue. So yeah, the name of a Jewish investment banker just happened to immediately precede the clip above, right before “Kamala Harris.” We appear to be the only source calling attention to it, because the weird kinky pedo overtones certainly are more sensational. But it’s right there, 12 minutes into the full video. All perfectly normal and not Nazi, you degenerates, how dare you say such a thing the end.

Landlord Marc Godart has been hit with fines of more than €25,000 arising from failing to register tenancies and knowingly giving false reasons to tenants for why they had to leave their apartments. The latest list of sanctions and court orders published by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB) includes seven entries for the Godart company, Green Label Property Investments Ltd, in relation to six apartments at Reuben House, Reuben Street, Dublin 8. Last year The Irish Times reported how tenants had been evicted from the apartments on the basis that the owner wanted to sell, only for the apartments then to be advertised for short-term letting on Airbnb. On Tuesday, another company owned by Mr Godart, Reuben Street Hot Desks Ltd, was fined €1,500 in the District Court for the short-term letting of the same apartments without the required planning permission over the year to April, despite having been instructed to desist. The company was also ordered to pay costs of €3,601 in the case, which was taken by Dublin City Council. The latest list of sanctions published by the RTB shows that Green Label Property Investments, a company that holds property on behalf of Mr Godart’s business, was hit with monetary sanctions ranging from €500 to €13,000. It is the first time the RTB has imposed sanctions on Mr Godart’s business, though tenants have brought successful complaints against him to the RTB and received monetary awards. The latest sanctions and court orders published by the RTB include cases where landlords were sanctioned for failing to comply with the rent pressure zone laws that control rents in designated areas. Landlord Anuj Katyal, of Amstelveen, the Netherlands, was given a monetary sanction of €15,000 for failing to comply with rent pressure zone requirements in respect of a property at Liffey Place, Liffey Valley Park, Lucan, Co Dublin. Landlord William Byrne, of Blackrock, Dublin, was sanctioned €5,000 in respect of an apartment on Bachelors Walk, Dublin 1. Landlords Thang Viet Dam and Ngoc Minh Nguyen, of Clonee, Dublin 15, were sanctioned a total of €22,434 in relation to two tenancies, at Premier Square, Finglas Road, Dublin 11, and Ongar Village, Dublin 15; and Michael and Claire O’Donoghue, of Clonpet, Co Tipperary, €4,608, in respect of an apartment at Cois Luachra, Dooradoyle, Co Limerick. Eamon Dunphy, of Tramore, Co Waterford, was sanctioned €4,000 in respect of a tenancy at Bracken Grove, Old Tramore Road, Kilcohan, Waterford; Anna Sweeney, of Dublin 4, €2,000, in respect of a tenancy at Loreto Road, Maryland, Dublin 8; and George and Joanne Murphy, of Tullow, Co Carlow, €2,500, in respect of a tenancy at College Gardens, Carlow. Landlord Pat Deasy, Dublin Pike, Co Cork, got a monetary sanction of €6,500 in respect of a tenancy at Ardross Estate, Pouladuff Road, Cork, while Cloncose Ltd, of Terenure, Dublin 6W, got a sanction of €7,000, in respect of a tenancy at Brookfield Green, Kimmage, Dublin 12. Cloncose, a property investment company, reported a pretax profit of €445,649 in 2023, according to its most recent set of accounts. It is owned by David Jones, Templeogue Road, Dublin 6. Landlord Orla Conlon, of West Yorkshire, England, was sanctioned €4,500 in respect of a tenancy at Kelly’s Bay Promenade, Skerries, Co Dublin; Kevin Curley, Skerries, Co Dublin, €2,116, in respect of Kelly’s Bay Heights, Skerries, and Bernadette Malone, of Foxrock, Dublin 18, €2,688, in respect of Griffin Glenpark, Lucan, Co Dublin. Synergy Facility Services Ltd were given a €5,000 sanction for giving an incorrect reason for terminating a tenancy at an apartment in the Beacon South Quarter, Dublin 18, while landlord Stacey Tivnan, of Kilcolgan, Galway, was given a monetary sanction of €2,400 for failing to offer a tenancy back in Newtown, Grange, Co Sligo.

Title: A contested election that leads to weeks of uncertainty is a risk being overlooked by markets
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-presidential-election-trump-harris-outlook-volatility-stock-sell-off-2024-10

Investors are dismissing the risk of a disputed US election, BlackRock Investment Institute head Jean Boivin told Bloomberg TV on Thursday. "For us, the main thing to watch is really more the contested election scenario that could be weeks of very disrupting legal battles," he said. Boivin added: "I don't think that's in the price and that's where if you want to prepare for some scenario where you need to react, I think that's one of those scenarios that could be bad for markets." The possibility is not far-fetched, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris locked in a razor-close contest. Recent battleground state polling shows a race too close to call with the election less than two weeks away. Overall, he considers it a "fool's errand" to try and trade on what happens come November. However, that hasn't stopped investors from trying: recent weeks have seen the so-called "Trump trade" rise on the prospect that the Republican candidate will win, as suggested by betting markets. Other market strategists have echoed in recent weeks Boivin's concern over what an election dispute would mean for markets. According to Morgan Stanley, delayed results have historically triggered short-term volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index — also known as the stock market's fear gauge — spiked 40% during the 2020 election. The measure only eased when a winner was officially declared days later. In another example, Stifel's chief Washington policy strategist Brian Gardner noted that the equity market sold off during the 2000 election dispute between George W. Bush and Al Gore. The S&P 500 fell approximately 5% between Election Day and December 13th, when the Supreme Court ended the legal challenges. However, Gardner points out that macroeconomic backdrops might play a hidden role in these scenarios. In 2000, stocks were steering through the dot-com bubble's rupture. Meanwhile, stocks rose during Trump's election dispute in 2020, likely due to signs that the COVID-19 pandemic was ending. "The main takeaway for investors is that the dominant economic and market conditions at the time drove the financial markets rather than political events," he wrote on Tuesday. As of now, current macroeconomic strength has shifted outlooks on the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting path, leading the bond market through a steep sell-off.

Title: Tucker Carlson Reveals He Has Daddy Kink in Weirdest Trump Speech Ever

Time Published: 2024-10-24T14:40:06Z

Speaking at a rally on Wednesday night, Tucker Carlson likened Donald Trump to “daddy” and described him coming home angrily to give a “bad little girl” a “vigorous spanking.” Carlson delivered the disturbing speech at a Turning Point Action rally in Duluth, Georgia, alongside his fellow MAGA acolytes Charlie Kirk, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and others, as well as Donald Trump himself. In his address, Carlson went on a manic rant encouraging his audience, whom he described as “an incredibly gentle and tolerant majority,” to fight back against those whom he sees as “parasitic, useless, violent, nasty, aggressive people,” like Kamala Harris, protesters who tore down Confederate statues, and weirdly, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. But that was the least strange part of his speech. Carlson then launched into a Freudian soliloquy by listing made-up scenarios of parents being too permissive, as a metaphor for how he sees America. If you allow a baby to smear poop on the walls or a “14-year-old to light a joint at the breakfast table,” or, he continued, “if you allow your hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter to slam the door of her bedroom and give you the finger, you’re going to get more of it. Tucker Carlson’s vision of a Trump presidency is that “dad comes home” and says to America,“You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking, right now. … It’s going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me.”pic.twitter.com/fh25KmyYmG “There has to be a point at which dad comes home. Yeah, that’s right. Dad comes home. And he’s pissed. Dad is pissed,” said Carlson. “He’s not vengeful. He loves his children. Disobedient as they may be, he loves them. Because they’re his children. They live in his house. But he’s very disappointed in their behavior. And he’s going to have to let them know.” The crowd of thousands went wild for his comparison, chanting “Daddy’s home” as Trump took the stage. Talk about weird. And Carlson, again, didn’t stop there. “When dad gets home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl, and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now. And no, it’s not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it’s not. I’m not going to lie. It’s going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this.’” Carlson’s speech at the Turning Point rally is not out of the ordinary when it comes to the way MAGA talks about children and women as something you own and can punish. Just last month, Trump creepily promised he will be women’s “protector.” Meanwhile, in states like Missouri and Oklahoma, Republicans have supported corporal punishment in schools, as part of a long evangelical and right-wing obsession with hitting their kids. This also isn’t the first time that the right has talked about spanking on the main stage. In 2016, Chris Christie threatened Hillary Clinton, promising to “beat her rear end,” and Senator Ted Cruz asked voters to give Clinton “a spanking.” But invoking the image of Trump as “daddy” or as a punishing God and having that message embraced by the frenetic crowd, who also cheered that “Christ is King,” is enough to make any normal person squirm. Donald Trump made up a fictional war with France Wednesday, and then claimed to have stopped it. During a speech in Duluth, Georgia, Trump—who previously touted himself a “wartime president” but now lies about how peaceful and safe his time in office was—was bragging about his record when he falsely claimed he really had prevented an international conflict. “You have no idea what I did in the White House. I stopped wars … with France!” Trump said. “France, you know the France story? They were gonna charge us, think of this, 25 percent to all Ameri—I have to protect American companies, whether we like ’em or not. Some of ’em I didn’t even like. You know Google is treating us much better, did you notice that? What happened to Google? They’re treating us much better. “They say McDonald’s was one of the most viewed things that they’ve ever had,” Trump cheered. Trump: "You have no idea what I did in the White House. I stopped wars with France."His brain then flits to Google and McDonald's. All of this in about 30 seconds. pic.twitter.com/yxgYlycUCM While there was obviously no threat of war with France, it’s possible that Trump was referring to a trade skirmish with France from his time in office. Paris passed a digital services tax on large tech companies, including Google, Facebook, and Amazon, in 2019. In response, Trump threatened to place tariffs of up to 100 percent on French goods, such as champagne and luxury bags. Undeterred, France ordered the tech companies to pay up in 2020. After Joe Biden entered the White House in 2021, he suspended Trump’s plan for retaliatory tariffs against France. So the “war” Trump stopped wasn’t a war, it was a trade fight. And he didn’t even stop it. If anything, he escalated it. But this might explain his incoherent weave from France to Google and back to his favorite subject: himself. A former model is alleging that Donald Trump groped her in 1993 in a “twisted game” between him and Jeffrey Epstein, The Guardian reports. Stacey Williams first met Trump in 1992 after being introduced to him by Epstein at a Christmas party. The model dated Epstein for a few months after that. The groping incident occurred in the winter or spring of 1993, when Williams and Epstein were on a walk and he suggested they stop by Trump Tower to visit the real estate mogul. Shortly after they arrived, Williams said that Trump pulled her toward him and started groping her, putting his hands “all over my breasts,” her waist, and her buttocks. She said that she froze, feeling “deeply confused,” and believed she saw Epstein and Trump smiling at each other. After the incident, she left Trump Tower with Epstein, and she felt that he was angry at her. “Jeffrey and I left, and he didn’t look at me or speak to me, and I felt this seething rage around me, and when we got down to the sidewalk, he looked at me and just berated me, and said: ‘Why did you let him do that?’” Williams said on a “Survivors for Kamala” Zoom call Monday, which included actress Ashley Judd and law professor Anita Hill, among others. While Williams has shared the story in parts on social media before, she gave specific details on the call. “He made me feel so disgusting, and I remember being so utterly confused,” Williams added, saying the incident appeared to be part of some “twisted game.” “I felt shame and disgust and as we went our separate ways, I felt this sensation of revisiting it, while the hands were all over me. And I had this horrible pit in my stomach that it was somehow orchestrated. I felt like a piece of meat,” Williams told The Guardian in an interview. The two broke up shortly after that. Williams said she had no idea about Epstein’s pattern of sexual abuse and pedophilia. Williams said that she later received, through her agent, a special postcard from Trump in 1993 showing an aerial view of his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, including a handwritten note in his trademark black marker. It read “Stacey—Your home away from home. Love Donald.” Trump’s campaign denied the allegations in a statement, with his press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying, “These accusations, made by a former activist for Barack Obama and announced on a Harris campaign call two weeks before the election, are unequivocally false. It’s obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign.” But it fits a pattern of behavior for Trump, an associate of Epstein for many years. At least 26 other women have accused the former president and convicted felon of sexual assault or misconduct. Plus, he was found to have sexually abused writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s in a civil trial last year. With the election in just a few weeks, Trump’s predatory behavior will matter to many of the voters he needs to return to the White House. Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie has called for the United States to stop funding Israel, as it targets civilian infrastructure in Lebanon. Massie posted a video on X Wednesday that showed an Israeli missile strike leveling an apartment building in Beirut, Lebanon. “If Israel insists on destroying civilian targets in Lebanon, let them buy and build their own weapons. American taxpayers should not be funding this,” the Republican lawmaker wrote. The U.S. has spent at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since it began its catastrophic military campaign in Gaza after the massacre on October 7. Massie, a far-right Republican, has been outspoken against America’s unwavering support of Israel’s unchecked military activity in the Middle East, challenging the notion that opposing to pro-Israel policies is a position held solely by those on the far left. Massie boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to Congress in July, calling it a “war rally.” He openly criticized the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on attack ads trying to unseat him. He also voted against censuring Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib over her comments criticizing Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians. Israel carried out a series of air strikes Sunday that targeted branches of the Al Qard Al Hassan association, a financial association that Israel claims is helping Hezbollah fund its activities, according to the BBC. The strikes against nonmilitary targets hit civilian areas in Beirut, as well as south and east Lebanon. Israel has killed at least 1,800 people in Lebanon in the past five weeks, since expanding military operations there. In the year since launching its military campaign in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 41,000 people and injured more than 96,700, according to ABC News. This week, the Israeli government began a campaign to empty out (ethnically cleanse) northern Gaza, reportedly cutting off supplies and targeting homes, shelters, schools, and hospitals with airstrikes, displacing thousands of civilians. In just a handful of hours, Donald Trump’s MAGA allies have gone from arguing that his recent comments about Hitler were misconstrued to just outright claiming that the whole story was completely made up. During an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Florida Representative Mike Waltz completely rejected the evidence of his eyes and ears, claiming that the Republican presidential nominee’s comments praising Hitler and expecting undying loyalty from his top commanders were phony. “It doesn’t make sense to me. I find the timing suspicious,” Waltz said. “And it just completely is divorced from the man that I’ve come to know in Donald Trump, and how he’s dealt with Gold Star families, how he has been caring, how he’s been compassionate,” Waltz continued, referring to the military status given to families who have lost a loved one during their military service. Rep. Mike Waltz on CNN suggests John Kelly is lying about Trump praising Hitler pic.twitter.com/jotsK0PhCC The far-right revision comes after Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, retired military General John Kelly, told The Atlantic that his ex-boss fit the description of a fascist. Kelly recalled a disturbing exchange he had with the former president while he was still in office, in which Trump expressed frustration over a perceived lack of loyalty from the military. “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,” Trump said in a private conversation in the White House, according to two sources that spoke anonymously with The Atlantic. “People who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders.” Another time, while in a frustrated discussion with Kelly, Trump reportedly asked, “Why can’t you be like the German generals?” forgetting that Hitler’s top generals had themselves defied him and made several attempts toward the end of World War II to kill him. Kelly, trying to correct the president, informed him that German generals “tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off.” Kelly recounted that when Trump had raised the matter of “German generals,” he responded by asking, “Do you mean Bismarck’s generals?” “I mean, I knew he didn’t know who Bismarck was, or about the Franco-Prussian War. I said, ‘Do you mean the kaiser’s generals? Surely you can’t mean Hitler’s generals?’” Kelly told The Atlantic. “And he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, Hitler’s generals.’ I explained to him that Rommel had to commit suicide after taking part in a plot against Hitler.” But Trump did not know who Rommel was, either. It’s at least the second time this month that Waltz has rejected the reality of Trump’s rhetoric. Last week, Waltz refused to acknowledge that direct quotes from Trump’s “enemy from within” comments were actually what he said. “I don’t think that’s what he said, John,” Waltz told CNN host John Berman, before pointing to civil unrest and mass protests during 2020. “I think that’s completely appropriate, the National Guard was rolled out then.… We cannot have, nor should we have, riots in the streets, business owners threatened, and Americans feeling unsafe.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, tried to pay a Washington Post reporter a hefty $500,000 to kill a profile she was writing on the Silicon Valley billionaire. The reporter didn’t respond to the offer, and the Post published its profile of Shanahan Wednesday morning, where the attempted bribe was revealed. Shanahan made the offer in June, texting one of her associates who was contacted by the Post that she would “pay your friend,” referring to the reporter, “half a million dollars to be a whistleblower” and name the sources for the story. In making the offer, Shanahan claimed that the sources were spreading false information about her. Shanahan would not respond to multiple requests from the Post beginning in April to sit for an interview, and ultimately the newspaper sent her a list of questions. Shanahan answered that she didn’t agree with some of the Post’s reporting but didn’t provide answers to any of the questions. The Post’s story details Shanahan’s evolution from a Democrat to a MAGA star praised by the likes of Tucker Carlson. “I’m so sorry you feel it is appropriate to do this for political motivations,” Shanahan told the Post. “It’s a very sad state our country is in.” Kennedy drew headlines when he announced Shanahan as his running mate in March. Many suspected that he chose her due to her wealth and the fact that she was Google co-founder Sergey Brin’s ex-wife. Later revelations showed that she has extreme views on in vitro fertilization and that she shares Kennedy’s opposition to vaccines, using the example of her autistic daughter as proof of their danger. In August, she and Kennedy dropped their independent presidential campaign and endorsed Donald Trump, spearheading a “Make America Healthy Again” initiative to back the former president. Such a wealthy benefactor supporting Trump signals that she might be involved in his administration if he wins the election, and doesn’t bode well for public health in America, either. The fact that she tried to bribe a reporter means she shares the former president’s lack of ethics. Donald Trump’s supporters are angry over an article that isn’t even real—and they keep spreading it online. At issue is an image circulating online appearing to be a screenshot of an article from The Atlantic with the headline “Trump Is Literally Hitler,” distorting an article published Tuesday with the headline “Trump: ‘I Need the Kind of Generals That Hitler Had.’” The Atlantic published a press release Wednesday refuting the existence of an article with the headline reading “Trump Is Literally Hitler,” after MAGA fans wouldn’t stop sharing it on social media, including Trump’s wealthiest fan, X CEO Elon Musk, who got hit with the Community Notes feature on the platform he owns. Utah Senator Mike Lee also shared the screenshot before deleting it later. Several other right-wing influencers jumped on too. The screenshot appears to have been a creation of X user Indian_Bronson, who admitted it was a fake in a follow-up post. As the election draws closer, it’s not surprising that fake news is being shared and picking up steam on social media. It’s not the first time that Musk has shared false information that supports his political views either, and it’s probably not the last. In this case, X’s Community Notes feature and The Atlantic caught the screenshot, but not before it got millions of views. In the next two weeks, how bad will the misinformation be, and will it be corrected quickly enough? A new Trumpian super PAC has hit the market—just in time for its donor details to remain secret until after the November election. The America First Action Fund was organized on October 18, just late enough in the game to skirt donor disclosures until after Election Day, independent journalist Roger Sollenberger reported Wednesday. The move will prevent any transparency around exactly which individuals are fueling Trump’s campaign this late in election season. The freshly minted super PAC is tied to two separate dark money groups by way of its treasurer, Ashley Hayek, a 2020 Trump campaign staffer who also serves as the executive director of America First Works and the chief engagement officer of the America First Policy Institute. That latter group, like the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, is one of several in the running to offer staff picks and transition roadmaps for a potential second term under Donald Trump. But as a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit, America First Policy Institute can’t formally support a candidate for office. Instead, it’s been quietly focused on driving some of Trump’s chief policy goals, including deregulating the federal government. America First Policy Institute received Trump’s blessing even before it was founded in 2021, reported Politico. “For three and a half years, AFPI has focused on personnel and policy. It was formed by and is teeming with senior staffers from the first Trump Administration whose goal is to be ready on day one,” Kellyanne Conway, the former Trump adviser who chairs AFPI’s Center for the American Child, told Politico in August. “Linda McMahon, Brooke Rollins and the team have planned with precision and executed with put-your-head-down type humility.” Hit dogs holler. Marjorie Taylor Greene is spinning out about Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledging comments from John Kelly that Donald Trump is a Hitler-loving fascist. Harris responded Wednesday to two damning reports from The New York Times and The Atlantic, in which Trump’s former chief of staff recalled Trump’s praise of Hitler and his desire to have generals like the Nazi leader did. After Harris dared bring up Kelly’s remarks, Greene accused Harris of trying to get Trump killed. “Vice President Kamala Harris is desperate, dangerous, and lying about President Trump,” the Georgia representative wrote on X. Vice President Kamala Harris is desperate, dangerous, and lying about President Trump.Kamala Harris just compared him to Hitler.She is going to get him killed. pic.twitter.com/Y25V2Ul5AK You would think that Harris had just told Democrats to “stand back and stand by,” based on Greene’s description of the vice president’s spontaneous address. But Harris’s comments were simple and without dramatization. “It is deeply troubling and incredibly dangerous that Donald Trump would invoke Adolf Hitler, the man who is responsible for the deaths of six million Jews and hundreds of thousands of Americans,” said Harris in her address, responding to Kelly’s allegations. “Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guardrails against his propensities and his actions.” In the Times interview Tuesday, Kelly called Trump a “fascist” who would regularly praise Hitler and other dictators. Also on Tuesday, The Atlantic reported that two sources confirmed the Republican candidate declared, near the end of his term, “I need the kind of generals that Hitler had.” Greene will speak with Trump at a rally in Duluth, Georgia, Wednesday night alongside Charlie Kirk, Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and more in the nightmare lineup. At the campaign event, expect more whining about the attacks on her favorite president. Republicans are struggling to defend the report of Donald Trump’s wild comment pining for “the kind of generals that Hitler had”—and in some cases, they’re not defending it at all. New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu said Wednesday that a casual appreciation for Hitler’s Nazi regime was “par for the course” for the Republican presidential nominee. During an interview with CNN, Sununu was asked whether Trump’s alleged statement was a deal-breaker for the Republican governor. “No,” Sununu said, explaining that in the end, “it’s all about results.” Independent voters, he said, don’t care for “ultraliberal extremism” and just “need a cultural change coming out of Washington.” “Look, we’ve heard a lot of extreme things about Donald Trump from Donald Trump. It’s kind of par for the course. It’s really, unfortunately, uh with a guy like that, it’s kind of baked into the vote at this point,” Sununu said. Sununu showed just how quick he, and likely other Republicans too, have been to accept Trump’s extremist tendencies. But, as Sununu explained moments later, he was only doing it because it’s what everyone else was doing. CNN’s Kate Bolduan then asked Sununu whether he was OK with supporting a candidate who former chief John Kelly said fit “into the general definition of fascist” and “certainly prefers the dictator approach” to governing. “That is something you are supporting, is that something you are OK with?” Bolduan asked. “No, look I don’t think anyone should be OK with statements like that, of course,” Sununu said. “And if there’s ever anyone you don’t want any sort of comparison to, it’s Hitler and all of that sort of thing. “As we’ve discussed before, it’s not just what Chris Sununu is going for. I think most of America is gonna go this way,” he continued. So, while Sununu can acknowledge that Hitler is bad, it’s only from an optics standpoint. If everyone else is OK with it, it’s better to just get on board!

NEXT | When does Diablo 3 Season 33 start? Shadows move with the Shades of... The War Within patch 11.0.5 rolled out this week, and while I’ve been enjoying the anniversary the launch has been a bit rocky. The game is certainly playable, but there are more than a few bugs, and the anniversary Blackrock Depths raid is tuned such that you need a group geared better than what it drops to easily clear it. (Plus there’s not a single piece of gear inside that has mastery, if that happens to be your thing.) It’s a little less fun than expected. So perhaps patch 11.0.5 troubles are why the World of Warcraft servers went down for an off-schedule maintenance this morning from 7am – 8am pacific — but The War Within servers are now back online. Servers are stable, but no word on what (if anything) changed during the maintenance. We’ll keep our eyes open for any more news, but for now I’m off to adventure in Khaz Algar.

Title: Analyst Raises Microsoft (MSFT) Price Target On Increasing IT Spending

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks in Q4. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other top trending AI stocks in Q4. As LLMs continue to hog data from the open internet for training, publishers are growing concerned about their intellectual property and compensation. In a latest development, The New York Times issued a cease and desist letter to Perplexity to stop using its data for training without permission. Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management, while talking about this news on CNBC, said that these developments could prove “horrendous” for LLMs in the short term. “The short-term economics for these large language models is horrendous, and so, I think it changes from bad to worse in the short term. I just want to put some quick context around those numbers. Right now, OpenAI pays NewsCorp about $50 million. They’re going to do about $4 billion in revenue this year and $11 billion next year, so, I mean, it’s measurable.” However, Munster thinks in the long term, these licensing deals would not impact major LLM companies negatively given the ROI they’d be enjoying. READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In The analyst also made a prediction about Perplexity. He believes the company would be acquired because it’s competing with a lot of “big guns.” He quoted Oracle’s Larry Ellison who said that it takes about $100 billion to be a “proprietary” large language model. “So, you look at the $6 billion at OpenAI, and you need to be raising in chunks of billions, not millions. Understand that it’s a big raise for a private company that’s moving quickly, but they’re going to get acquired. They’re just up against too many other big guns here to try to get to those coveted four or five spots of the LLM landscape.” For this article we picked 10 AI stocks trending based on latest news. With each company we have mentioned its hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Radu Bercan / Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 279 KeyBanc’s third-quarter 2024 survey of value-added resellers (VARs) has noted a rise in IT budget expectations. “For 2024, IT budgets saw a slight growth in expectations, but the bigger shift was in 2025, where budgets are now expected to grow by 4.4%, up from 3.2% just 90 days ago,” said KeyBanc analysts, led by Jackson Ader, in a detailed report to investors. Based on this survey, the firm gave bullish ratings to several stocks, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft’s target was increased to $505 from $490. DA Davidson recently downgraded the stock, with analyst Gil Luria saying the company’s advantages in the cloud and code generation sectors have diminished, making it difficult for Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to maintain its previous performance. He highlighted that Amazon Web Services is now nearly matching Azure in cloud growth, while Google Cloud is also gaining momentum. Luria downgraded Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) from Buy to Neutral, maintaining a $475 price target. He pointed out that Amazon and Google have made significant strides in integrating custom silicon into their data centers, putting Microsoft at a disadvantage. This reliance on NVIDIA (NVDA) for technology means Microsoft is effectively transferring wealth from its shareholders to NVIDIA’s, according to Luria. Following a year of margin expansion, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) is now projecting a decline in operating margins due to increased data center capital expenditures rising from 12% to 21% of revenue. This increase outpaces that of Amazon and Google, largely due to Microsoft’s dependence on NVIDIA. Luria said that if Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to overinvest at the current rate, margins could drop by at least 1 percentage point cumulatively, potentially necessitating layoffs of around 10,000 employees each year to maintain margins. The analyst also thinks Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) has lost much of its edge with GitHub Copilot, as Amazon and GitLab (GTLB) have caught up in capabilities. The concerns voiced by the analyst are not unfounded. Microsoft is also losing its edge in open-source models as enterprises shift toward cost-effective, transparent open-source solutions like Meta’s Llama 3.1. Generation Investment Management Global Equity Strategy stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Generative AI’s hunger for power has increased disproportionately with its intelligence. According to one estimate, OpenAI’s GPT-4 required 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity to train, much more than the 1.3 GWh needed for GPT-3.3 And then AI requires even more power when it is put to use (so called ‘inference’). Some of the latest trends worry us. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) appears to be slipping in its ESG goals, with its greenhouse gas emissions rising again last year, as it invests in becoming a big player in AI. It is struggling in particular to curb its Scope 3 emissions in the capital goods category – nowhere more so than in the activity associated with the construction of data centres: both the embedded carbon in construction materials like steel and cement, as well as the emissions from the manufacturing of hardware components such as semiconductors, servers and racks. Google’s emissions have risen by close to 50% in the past five years. Overall, MSFT ranks 1st on our list of top trending AI stocks in Q4. While we acknowledge the potential of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
