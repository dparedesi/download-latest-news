Since its inception early last year, Bitcoin Spot ETFs have become a crucial part of its market dynamics. During inception, several spot BTC ETFs were launched, but BlackRock’s IBIT has turned out to be quite successful, which currently stands as the biggest BTC spot exchange product. While Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to record inflows, BlackRock’s BTC ETF, IBIT, is witnessing substantial growth compared to other products. Presently, the product appears to be leading the charge with a surge to new levels, surpassing other funds. In a post on the X platform, The Kobeissi Letter, a leading commentary on the global capital market, announced that the Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has hit a new milestone in terms of assets under management. The assets under management have surged to a value of $76 billion, highlighting the quickening rate of institutional acceptance in the cryptocurrency industry. According to the Kobeissi Letter, total assets have tripled over the past 200 trading days, as per ZeroHedge. This fresh milestone by IBIT cements BlackRock’s dominant position in the broader spot BTC ETF sector. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust generates unprecedented AUM, it demonstrates the increasing belief among major investors that Bitcoin merits a crucial place at the global investment table. BlackRock’s IBIT sharp rise in AUM to a new high appears to be exceptional, as many funds took several years to experience this growth. It is worth noting that it took more than 15 years for GLD, the biggest gold ETF, to achieve the same feat. The Kobeissi Letter also reported that the IBIT’s Bitcoin holdings have increased substantially during the period. Data from the market expert shows that IBIT BTC holding has grown to over 700,000 BTC for the first time in history. Comparing this amount of Bitcoin acquired with that of MicroStrategy, a firm that is mainly recognized for its strategic accumulation of BTC, it is 100,000 BTC more than the total holdings of the company. Given the stunning growth of the IBIT, the Kobeissi Letter believes that the overall “crypto markets are making history.” Lark Davis, a crypto expert and entrepreneur, has outlined a new trend in buying activity among institutional players. Despite the continuous capital inflows into ETFs, many investors appear to be more interested in acquiring Bitcoin directly than through ETFs. The expert revealed that BTC purchases by public businesses are outpacing those of ETFs. In addition, Davis stated that the number of Bitcoin Treasury businesses is growing every week, as institutional investors continue to hoard BTC in unprecedented quantities. Considering this mass accumulation by public institutions, the expert is confident that the market is about to go insane from here. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: ‘You’re going to die tonight’: Former garda attacked and threatened to kill partner in Dublin home
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/07/11/youre-going-to-die-tonight-former-garda-attacked-and-threatened-to-kill-partner-in-dublin-home/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:39:54Z
Full Content:
A man has been jailed for 20 months for attacking and threatening to kill his then partner in their Dublin home while he was a serving member of An Garda Síochána. Ian Gillen, of Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to Jennifer Clinton on December 23rd, 2021, at Trafalgar Lane, Monkstown, and to assaulting Ms Clinton on the same occasion. After hearing facts in the case on Thursday, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned overnight. He on Friday said the custody threshold had been crossed, noting that he had considered the facts of the case, Gillen’s circumstances and mitigation. Judge Nolan said Gillen was a front-line garda who had to “make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person”. He also noted that Gillen was “visited with a tragic event with the death of his son”. He imposed a prison sentence of four years, with the final 28 months suspended on strict conditions, which he said was due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in Gillen’s life. Insp Rachael Kilpatrick testified that the couple had socialised together in Blackrock Tennis and Bowling Club, where they were members, before the attack. They had gone home separately, with Ms Clinton arriving first. Ms Clinton told gardaí that when Gillen arrived home, he called her downstairs to sit by the fireside, where he stood over her in an intimidating manner, rebuking her and calling her names. She said he told her ‘Jen, I’m going to rip your head off’, putting her in fear, and prompting her to make an audio recording of the rest of the incident on her mobile phone. She said he punched her with a closed fist three times on top of her head. In an effort to get away, she said she needed to go to the toilet, but he refused to let her go. She eventually managed get away and locked the bathroom door behind her. She cleared the windowsill and eventually made it out of the house. She had managed to record 40 minutes of the threats. An attempt was made to play this in court, but it was not possible due to technical difficulties. A transcript of the recording was handed to the judge instead. Ms Clinton described Gillen’s conduct as pure anger. She said that any time she tried to get up, he kept telling her to sit back down. “You’re going to die tonight,” he told her three times. After Ms Clinton escaped, Gillen was arrested for coercive control. He was interviewed and the recording was played to him. He said he was embarrassed and it was not in him to hit her, but indicated it was another person in his body. “He was shocked by his own behaviour,” said Insp Kilpatrick. Gillen accepted he could snap and be angry when drinking. He said he had issues in his background, including the death of his son, which caused him to drink. He has since retired from the Garda on medical grounds and has no previous convictions. Under cross-examination by the defence, Insp Kilpatrick agreed that Gillen was a front-line garda for 40 years and had dealt with many stressful situations. She accepted that it was in the line of duty that he had to deal with his son taking his own life in his early 20s. Gillen was the first responder on the scene. His mental health deteriorated afterwards and he relied on alcohol, the court heard. Ms Clinton entered the witness box to deliver her victim impact statement. She said her life had been marked by fear and deep trauma since the prolonged assault, during which she felt overpowered and trapped. She said she still lived with the consequences every day, having been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. “I live in a state of hypervigilance,” she said. “I lost my confidence. The memory of that night is etched into my mind and body like the cross he etched into the front door of our shared home one night in a rage.” She said that Gillen’s rising aggression while they socialised earlier that evening had prompted her to leave, but he had arrived home full of fury. “I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive,” she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. At one point, she said, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did because he was a serving garda. “Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time,” she said. “The man I once loved became someone I feared.” She added: “As a long-standing member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality.” However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just his own. “I’m here for justice,” she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was deeply ashamed and apologised for what he put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years in the force, which had taken a toll on him and probably had not been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son, while Gillen was on duty, as the worst nightmare of every guard and parent, and asked the court to take it into account. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide.

Title: Ant International refutes reporting Circle partnership, but stablecoin ambitions remain clear
URL: http://technode.com/2025/07/11/ant-international-refutes-reporting-circle-partnership-but-stablecoin-ambitions-remain-clear/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:16:15Z

Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNode’s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. Ant International, the overseas arm of Ant Group, has refuted reports that it is in talks with Circle Internet Financial to integrate USDC stablecoin into its blockchain platform. Bloomberg first cited unnamed sources on July 10, claiming the two companies were exploring cooperation plans following USDC’s compliance in the United States. Just hours later, Ant International responded, stating, “The media reports are inaccurate. We currently have no such plans.” Why it matters: Ant’s quick denial underscores its cautious approach to publicizing any stablecoin tie-ups. However, it does not diminish the company’s broader ambitions in blockchain and stablecoins. As global stablecoin adoption accelerates and regulatory clarity improves, Ant is actively seeking licenses, forging partnerships, and advancing technology to bring large-scale, trusted applications to the market. Each step by Ant in this space has the potential to reshape the global digital finance landscape. Details: According to people familiar with the matter, Ant processed more than $1 trillion in transactions worldwide last year, with around one-third conducted on its blockchain infrastructure. They also said in June that Ant International is pursuing stablecoin licensing in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg. Context: Stablecoins are a type of digital asset designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to another currency. As of June, the total circulation of stablecoins stood at around $250 billion. According to Bloomberg, in June this year, the US Senate passed legislation setting out rules for dollar-linked cryptocurrencies, a move that has further legitimized stablecoins. As of 9 am local time on Friday (July 11), shares of Circle rose 4.4% to $209.57, marking a surge of over 500% since its listing. Although Ant International has denied reports of a partnership with Circle, its ambitions and active positioning in the stablecoin sector are undeniable. These moves underscore how traditional fintech giants are taking stablecoins seriously, particularly in the wake of the US Senate’s legislative push in June to regulate dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, which has accelerated mainstream acceptance of stablecoins.

Currently, there are 18 new fund offers of MFs waiting to be grabbed by investors, and this trend is likely to gain momentum, with new entrants in the asset management space launching NFOs in the next few months. In fact, in the last 10 days, five mutual fund houses have filed papers with SEBI to launch six NFOs. Interestingly, all of them are on the passive side and returns from these funds are linked to the movement of a particular index with no discretion of fund managers. Amid a volatile equity market and tepid returns from IPOs, investors have been lapping up NFOs. Markets embolden Trump on tariffs, stoking fear he’ll go too far Among the latest entrants, JioBlackRock AMC — a joint venture between Reliance Industries and global fund manager BlackRock — recently mopped up ₹17,800 crore through the launch of overnight, liquid and money market funds. The NFO witnessed participation from over 67,000 individual investors and more than 90 institutional investors. Buoyed by the tremendous response from investors, the digital-focused JioBlackRock AMC has filed draft documents to launch eight schemes, focusing on low-cost, direct-to-investor offerings. The JV aims to disrupt the ₹72 lakh crore fund management business in India with a minimum investment limit of ₹500. Additionally, new entrants in the MF space, such as Bajaj Finserv, Groww, Samco, Zerodha and CapitalMind have lined up NFOs to compete in the 47-member asset management business. The MF industry has raised ₹19,164 crore through the launch of 117 NFOs in the first six months of this year. Of this, 25 equity NFOs have mopped up ₹10,690 crore, according to data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Venkat Chalasani, CEO, AMFI, said, “The launch of NFOs is expected to continue with the new entrants trying to make a space for themselves and the focus may be on the passive front to cater for the mass market.” Global markets: Asian shares up on Nvidia high, investors unfazed by Trump's tariff moves “Retail investors have reposed their faith in the MF industry by pouring into equity schemes consecutively for the last 52 months despite market volatility and geopolitical tensions,” he added. The MF industry has managed to attract investors’ interest despite the sharp increase in fundraising through initial public offerings. Swapnil Aggarwal, Director of VSRK Capital, said, “NFOs offer immediate diversification across multiple stocks and reduce single company risk. On the other hand, IPOs give direct ownership in a specific company, and investors’ returns depend on the financial performance of a single company,” he said. While all investors in NFOs get units at ₹10 a piece, there is no guarantee of allotment in IPOs, and bids can be placed only in specific lots, besides the IPO shares are allotted on a pro rata basis, he said. IPOs are best suited for investors with a higher risk appetite, while NFO offers a unique and compelling investment strategy that aligns with long-term gains, he said.

Title: Bitcoin – How $1.18B in ETF inflows could push BTC’s price higher
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-how-1-18b-in-etf-inflows-could-push-btcs-price-higher/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:00:13Z

Selling pressure from miners increased slightly as BTC hit a new ATH. Bitcoin [BTC] has hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $118k on the backdrop of strong ETF inflows and demand from treasury firms. On the 10th of July, U.S. spot ETFs attracted $1.18 billion in daily inflow, bringing monthly demand to $2.3 billion. In fact, that was the second-largest daily inflow since the products debuted in January 2024. Analytics firm Ecoinometrics said that the strong ETF demand could push BTC to $119K, citing its proprietary model data. Source: Ecoinometrics/X At the time of its post, BTC hovered at around $112K, and soon afterward, the asset extended its rally to $118.8K. The analytics firm said, “Bitcoin is already at an all-time high, and the macro backdrop is shifting into a full risk-on regime.” As expected, BlackRock’s IBIT led the Thursday demand, commanding nearly half of the inflows ($448.5 million). Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely at $324.34 million. Overall, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF recorded $5 billion in trading volume on the 10th of July, following $3.5 billion the day before, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The analyst projected that ETFs would likely hit a billion-dollar flow on Thursday and Friday. “When IBIT sees big volume surges on up price days it portends big boy flows (as seen in chart) = good chance we see $1b in flows over next two days. It’s also a hair away from $80b.” Source: Eric Balchunas/X As of press time, the first $1 billion flow had already been hit. If Friday’s session (July 11) rake in another $1 billion in ETF inflows, then BTC could likely tag $120K or zoom above it. The Options market data showed that the highest volume by strike for calls (bullish bets) was parked at $130K, $120K and $125K. These suggested that bulls were betting that BTC could extend the rally and hit these levels. Source: CoinGlass At the same time, the downside risk positioning showed that most puts (red, bearish bets) were piled at $102K and $100K. In other words, institutional players expected a floor price of $100K, meaning they viewed the level as the new support. Despite the bullish structure, there appeared to be one caveat worth tracking. CryptoQuant reported that the new ATH high had triggered miners to book profit, as indicated by the spike in Miner Position Index (MPI). Source: CryptoQuant While the metric’s reading was at 0.6 at the time of writing, an extended jump to 2 would mean a heightened miner sell-off. A similar move marked a local top back in May, and could be crucial to track.

A man has been jailed for 20 months for attacking and threatening to kill his then partner in their home at a time when he was a serving garda. Ian Gillen of Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin was before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, where he pleaded guilty to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to Jennifer Clinton on 23 December 2021, at Trafalgar Lane, Monkstown, and to assaulting Ms Clinton on the same occasion. After hearing facts in the case yesterday, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight.

They had gone home separately, with Ms Clinton arriving home first. Ms Clinton told gardaí that when Gillen arrived home, he called her downstairs to sit on a pouffe by the fireside, where he stood over her in an intimidating manner, rebuking her and calling her names. "Jen, I'm going to rip your head off," he had said, putting her in fear, and prompting her to make an audio recording of the rest of the incident on her mobile phone, should she not survive. He punched her with a closed fist three times on top of her head. In an effort to get away, she said she needed to go to the toilet, but he refused to let her go. She eventually managed to go, locked the bathroom door behind her, and cleared the windowsill so she’d have a route out. She eventually made her way out of the house. She had managed to record 40 minutes of the threats. An attempt was made to play this in court, but it was not possible due to technical difficulties.

His mental health deteriorated, and he relied on alcohol. Ms Clinton entered the witness box to deliver an emotional victim impact statement, having to take a break to dry her tears at one stage. She said that her life had been marked by fear and deep trauma since the prolonged assault, when she felt overpowered and trapped. She said she still lived with the consequences every day, having been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. "I live in a state of hypervigilance," she said. "I lost my confidence. The memory of that night is etched into my mind and body like the cross he etched into the front door of our shared home one night in a rage." She said that Gillen's rising aggression while they socialised in the club that evening was what had prompted her to leave, but that he had then arrived home full of fury. "I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive," she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. "I’m the biggest white psychopath you’ll ever meet," he had told her. At one point, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda Station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did, because he was a serving garda. Ms Clinton said that she had to work out how she would escape from the home, where she had previously felt safe. "I thought of my children and grandchildren and made a break for it. I still have recurring nightmares where I did not get out," she explained. "Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time," she said. "The man I once loved became someone I feared." She said that she was in a state of heartbreak and vulnerability when he attacked her, having lost her sister, her mother, her best friend, as well as Gillen’s son, Cathal. "I’m not the person I was before this happened to me," she continued. She said that the horror of that night still affected and echoed through the lives of those she loved. "As a longstanding member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality," she said. She said she had not included the most appalling part of what he had said about being a garda, but that they were in the recording. However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just of himself. "I’m here for justice," she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was a deeply ashamed man and apologised for what he had put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years with the force. They had taken their toll on him and probably hadn’t been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son in the very recent past, while Gillen was on duty, as every guard’s and parent’s worst nightmare, and asked the court to take it into account. She said that he had retired from the gardaí on medical grounds. Counsel explained that Gillen was a former senior international bowler and a member of Blackrock Bowling Club, while his son had been involved in Cabinteely Soccer Club. He now works to prevent suicide through these clubs. "He has become involved as a person to speak to about mental health issues," she said. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide. "He was enduring a very traumatic event at the time," she said. "It was an out-of-character incident." She said that her client attends his GP and a psychiatrist, who told him that he was dealing with his trauma appropriately by helping others. Ms Leader quoted the psychologist’s report as saying Gillen was at a low risk of domestic violence in future, provided things are maintained as they are. "This was a man who was stressed at the time for very good reason, not appropriately dealing with the stress," she said. Passing sentence, Judge Martin Nolan said: "It seems only he knows why he attacked her. He beat her over a period of time and slapped her and made very serious threats that were believable. "This injured party was terrified, and she eventually made her escape." Judge Nolan said the background to this case is that this defendant is a retired member of An Garda Síochána. He said Gillen was a frontline garda who had to "make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person". He also noted that Gillen was "visited with a tragic event with the death of his son, which must have affected him". He said there was a report before the court which outlined how this tragic incident impacted the defendant. The judge said the mitigation in this case is clear, that Gillen entered a guilty plea, there was a general level of cooperation, he has no record of conviction, and he has a good work history, all of which the court must acknowledge. Judge Nolan said: "I believe that he has crossed the custody threshold", noting that this is a very serious matter. "I don’t know what was going through his mind on that night," he said. Judge Nolan sentenced Gillen to four years in prison, but due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in his life, he suspended the final 28 months. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Proxy voting giants investigated by Missouri AG for misleading clients about their DEI and ESG priorities

Fox News Digital spoke to Utah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks at the State Financial Officers Foundation conference in Orlando, Florida FIRST ON FOX: Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey launched parallel investigations this week into two of the nation's leading proxy advisory companies, alleging they have abdicated their fiduciary duties and violated state consumer protection laws by misleading consumers about their prioritization of ideology over investor returns. Bailey argued in civil investigative demands sent to Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) that they are violating state consumer protection law by assuring their customers that their proxy voting recommendations are based solely on data and research – and are entirely neutral. But, simultaneously, Bailey argues that publicly available documents from the firms show that their proxy voting recommendations are designed to advance DEI and environmental causes regardless of whether they undermine investor returns. Glass Lewis and ISS are two foreign-owned powerhouses that control roughly 97% of the U.S. proxy advisory market, according to an April report from the House Financial Services Committee. The firms specialize in providing voting recommendations to institutional investors – such as pension funds, retirement systems and mutual funds – on how to vote during corporate shareholder meetings. These votes frequently include decisions related to board member elections, executive compensation, company policies and other proposals. BLACKROCK ADDS NEW PROXY ADVISORY FIRM AMID ESG CRITICISM AS LEADING EXPERT SAYS ‘TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE’ Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey is accusing two major proxy advisory firms of misleading consumers by hiding their prioritization of DEI and ESG policies, even at the cost of investor returns. (iStock; Getty Images) "Missourians deserve answers as to why the unseen power brokers, controlling much of corporate America, are pushing a leftist worldview at the expense of millions of honest investors," Bailey said. "These are foreign-owned actors manipulating the U.S. economy, and we will not let them thrive any longer. We are going after the source. These proxy advisors have held corporate America hostage with their radical ideologies. We are putting them on notice: Missouri will not tolerate ideological coercion disguised as investment guidance." In an enforcement petition Bailey sent to the state circuit court in an effort to compel the companies' compliance with the new probes, the attorney general points to statements on both ISS and Glass Lewis's websites, respectively, that insist they provide "objective and impartial offerings" that are "based on research and data." At the same time, Bailey points to internal company documents, such as a document titled "2025 Benchmark Policy Guidelines" from Glass Lewis, which includes numerous sections on the importance of advancing DEI and ESG causes. "This means that Glass Lewis’s statement that it provides ‘research and data’ that allows its customers to ‘make informed investment decisions’ is false," Bailey wrote in his enforcement petition against Glass Lewis. SEVERAL STATE OFFICIALS DEMAND FEDS PROTECT AMERICANS' RETIREMENT PLANS BY CLEARLY REGULATING ESG INVESTMENTS Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey addresses members of the press in the old post office building in Downtown St. Louis on Thursday, Feb. 2, 2024. (Vanessa Abbitt/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/Tribune News Service via Getty Images ) Similarly, at ISS, Bailey points to company statements claiming it provides customers with "objective and impartial offerings," while simultaneously producing internal company reports that include commitments to recommending votes in favor of proposals "calling for the reduction of [greenhouse gas] emissions." In addition to allegedly misleading consumers about their company priorities, Bailey is accusing Glass Lewis and ISS of omitting or failing to disclose material information about how it weighs DEI and ESG standards when recommending votes. Bailey's investigation is requesting a range of internal documents and communications to help determine whether Glass Lewis or ISS violated state consumer protection laws through its allegedly misleading claims and lack of transparency. FLORIDA ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYS HE IS PUTTING THE STATE’S WOKE COMPANIES ‘ON NOTICE’ Proxy advisory firms are key players in the American financial system, providing recommendations for institutional investors on how to cast their votes on critical shareholder resolutions and proposals. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) "ISS and Glass Lewis have been harming consumers and misleading institutional investors by promoting a radical political agenda instead of focusing on maximizing returns. By taking legal action against both firms, Attorney General Bailey is doing the right thing and holding them accountable for selfishly prioritizing racist DEI quotas, climate activism, and other outdated ESG nonsense," Will Hild, Executive Director at conservative nonprofit Consumers' Research said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "Such deception is not just financially reckless but also illegal and must be met with consequences," Hild continued. "This necessary investigation will aid in exposing these activist proxy advisors for deliberately ditching fiduciary duty in the name of furthering the ESG scam."

Earlier this year, Glass Lewis was served with a similar civil investigative demand by Florida's Republican Attorney General. That move followed another similar request for information in 2023 by 21 state attorneys general, including Bailey at the time.

Title: The EU and the US May Be at Odds, but Is the Animosity Real?

US President Donald Trump secured his second term in office, and a new narrative has emerged. One in which the United States is at odds with the European Union. Alongside newly established 20% tariffs against EU goods, SignalGate painted Europe in unflattering terms during a group chat on the Signal messaging app, where US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, participated. Vance and Hesgeth depicted EU/NATO allies as “freeloaders” and “pathetic”. At one point, Vance stated that he hates “bailing Europe out again”. This shift in rhetoric has not gone unnoticed abroad. In early March, French President Emmanuel Macron noted in a TV address that the West is entering “a new era”, in which the US may no longer be a trusted ally. That warning adds weight to speculation that Washington’s relationship with Europe may face a structural breakdown. Whether this conflict reflects genuine strategic divergence or a manufactured narrative requires further scrutiny. How much of that purported animosity is real? If it is real, will it lead to a permanent restructuring of world powers? If not, why does it seem so real? To untangle these critical questions, we must first examine the system that produces public belief: governance technology. Since the advent of mass media, governance has undergone permanent changes in its form, and in doing so, altered its nature as well. Walter Lippmann was one of the first to notice, in his 1922 book Public Opinion, that modern democracy relies on mass media. In turn, the mass media helps inform public opinion. However, as mass media consists of nodes that disseminate information to form public opinion, it follows that those who control the nodes control the public consciousness. If that is the case, democracy itself is simply a well-crafted illusion of agency. Key tools of power centralize mass media nodes. Noam Chomsky & Edward S. Herman further detailed this mechanism in their 1988 book Manufacturing Consent. Shoshana Zuboff is one of the latest contributors to this thesis with her 2018 book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, in which she warned that: Two men at Google who do not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercise control over the organization and presentation of the world’s information. One man at Facebook who does not enjoy the legitimacy of the vote, democratic oversight, or the demands of shareholder governance exercises control over an increasingly universal means of social connection, along with the information concealed in its networks. Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new agency launched in 2024, revealed just how deeply this control runs. Internal documents from DOGE show that governments worldwide use taxpayer money to fund propaganda and censorship operations without public consent. Even before DOGE, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg regretted his role in colluding with the government to enact mass censorship. It also seems that the division between capitalism and government may be a meaningless exercise, to the chagrin of Zuboff and her concept of “shareholder governance.” Yet, the underlying feature of this phenomenon, this governance technology, is clear. We can divide it into two key components: Specifically, the vast majority of people either lack the time or the cognitive capacity to pick up the implied messaging or delve into secondary information rails. Instead, they absorb only the surface-level messaging, which is visible and promoted by established authority nodes. This topic is also not new in literature, as Antonio Gramsci explored it in his 1929 Prison Notebooks. Gramsci described most people (peasantry, workers) as “subaltern groups”, dominated by the ruling class, whichever type it may be. At the end of the line, in terms of evolutionary biology, it appears that human societies mirror a dominance hierarchy. Perhaps Vilfredo Pareto summed it up best with his theory of the circulation of elites, which Robert Michels later framed as the “iron law of oligarchy” in his seminal 1911 work, Political Parties. Pareto’s theory implies that it is entirely irrelevant what kind of -ism runs society (communism, liberalism, capitalism) because an elite always rules the majority. Naturally, this would make “democracy” both practically and theoretically unfeasible. In this light, it is easy to see why dual-rail messaging and cognitive conversion have become pervasive in modern governance technology. One could even see “democracy” itself as an embedded part of dual-rail communication. One would be remiss not to revisit the most densely packed period in recorded history to point out governance technology in action — the highly anomalous 2020–2022 period. Not to delve too much, here are the basic outlines: This was a fantastic case study of dual-rail messaging and cognitive conversion. In the first half of 2020, it was already discernible that: Later, various countries acknowledged all of this through official statistics. Not only do mask mandates harm people, but vaccinations also do. Professor Stefan Homburg summarized these findings for Germany, which apply to other countries. Of course, the unprecedented coercive measures enacted during the pandemic narrative created the incentives for novel mRNA injections. It turned out in the most extensive vaccine safety study, covering 99 million people, that these injections are exceedingly dangerous, having increased myocarditis risk by 610% among many other conditions. However, as was the case during the entire pandemic narrative, warnings about such a scenario were present long before a single person received the shot. From a governance technology perspective, the pandemic narrative highlighted the following dynamic: To maintain a favorable cognitive conversion rate, global and unprecedented mass censorship had to occur as a matter of structural suppression. Otherwise, all the dissenting doctors, journalists and scientists, as authority nodes in their own right, had the potential to dilute the impact of the first rail messaging. To preserve Rail 1 dominance, it was necessary. Every Rail 1 claim collapsed post-factum, yet zero accountability followed. One could also see the Iraq War in the same light. The Rail 1 promoted the idea of “weapons of mass destruction,” but of course, no one ever found such things. Interestingly, the unprecedented mass censorship and coercion tactics were tonally off, potentially serving as a giant red flag. Yet, this too failed to disrupt the first rail messaging for most people. Again, this is another arrow in Michels’ “iron law of oligarchy” quiver. Now that we understand the key aspect of governance technology, what about the purported deterioration of relations between the EU and the US? The highlighting of nodes during the pandemic narrative is also helpful here. First, let’s review what the “pandemic” actually produced. Perhaps even more importantly, the pandemic narrative highlighted that all major nodes of messaging proliferation are US-centric: Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and others.In concert with the US dollar being the world’s reserve currency, this affords the United States unmatched hegemonic power — cultural, economic, political and technological. Likewise, the Federal Reserve is effectively the world’s central bank. Case in point, just as the Fed launched the historic monetary intervention via BlackRock, so did the European Central Bank (ECB) when it launched the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). However, another intervention occurred that remains in the public spotlight, generating significant attention and influencing events. Overnight, the pandemic narrative shifted to the Russia–Ukraine conflict in February 2022: the same mediatic intensity, the same censorship, the same deplatforming, the same string of absurdities. The US State Department paved the road for this conflict back in 2014, led by Victoria Nuland, by toppling the pro-Russian Ukrainian government. Nuland supported the Maidan coup through the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), a CIA intervention front. At the revolving door point, William J. Burns is currently listed on NED’s official website under the “experts” section, having served as CIA director under the Biden administration. In this company, Nuland was recorded saying “fuck the EU” when discussing the post-toppling regime in Ukraine. Later on, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy ramped up hostilities toward the Russian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which prompted Russia’s direct involvement. Of course, the tie that binds all of these events is NATO’s expansion into Russia’s backyard, as NATO repeatedly broke assurances not to expand. Russia sees this as an existential threat because NATO is a US proxy. The overarching reasoning for all of this is simple. If there is an EU–Russian alliance, economically or politically, this would spell doom for US hegemony. After all, the combination of Russia’s vast land mass and resources with European technology and population density would make the US a second-rate power at best. With this in mind, how does this affect the present EU–US relations? Clumsy clues of deception In the last month, discussions about the EU rearming itself have dominated headlines. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission and known for the Pfizergate scandal, announced an expenditure of up to €800 billion ($938,086,304,000) for this effort. The new America First realignment presents this as a consequence. To that end, do you know how the aforementioned leaks happened in which both the US Defence Secretary and Vice President maligned Europe? Well, they invited the Atlantic editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, into their Signal group chat. Again, dual-rail is afoot: Is there evidence for the Rail 2 this time? Just a month before Leyen’s rearming commitment, the US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth noted that the EU/US must establish a “division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and the Pacific, respectively.” The Pacific is a reference to the US shift from Ukraine to China and Taiwan. In other words, the US is using the EU as a counter to Russia’s interests, which leaves it with a larger budget to handle China. There is another deception clue in the mix, quite a big one. In September 2022, targeted bombings rendered the Nord Stream pipeline defunct. This was the key economic instrument that had the potential to bring the EU closer to Russia. Specifically, to bring Germany, the EU’s economic engine, closer to Russia. Ever since, without Russian cheap gas, Germany has been undergoing a rapid process of deindustrialization due to higher energy prices. Simultaneously, more entrepreneurs and industrialists are moving from EU nations to the US. Most tellingly, in its presentation of antagonism between the US and the EU among the European ruling class, there is not a single mention of this international act of terrorism that had such devastating economic consequences. It remains a mystery, as inquiries by the Swedish and Danish authorities yielded no results. Altogether, does this seem clumsy? The core problem is that such adjectives are not meaningful. From the perspective of people with a high cognitive ceiling, the entire pandemic narrative was extremely clumsy. Yet, it was successful nonetheless, still accepted and talked about as real by the majority. Such is the case with the most recent narrative about EU/US relations. The first rail absorbs, while the second delegates to the fringe. With the “iron rule of oligarchy” in mind, which excludes democracy as a coherent concept, it is increasingly apparent why both the EU and the US accrued such massive government deficits. To defend US hegemony, both in the intermediate and distant future. However, the US now holds all the cards. With tariff tools, President Trump can start reshoring American industry. And even without being beholden to the Federal Reserve, Europe faces a massive problem of bureaucratic parasitism, which disincentivizes taxation and undermines net-zero policies. While the US withdrew from the Paris Agreement and ramped up its “drill, baby, drill” approach, Europe is still on a path to net zero. This puts Europe at a severe and crippling disadvantage. One should also remember that Germany systemically denuclearized its power grid, despite this type of power being considered net zero. Without such suicidal policies, even the Nord Stream bombing would have had a muted effect. One wonders if there was external NED-like pressure for Germany’s denuclearization​​ to increase its vulnerabilities. Post-World War II, Europe entered into a vassal relationship with the US. This relationship has only grown stronger, owing to carefully nurtured American dominance in Big Tech, Big Bank and Big Pharma. The present framework doesn’t make the EU stronger but cements US dominance. Both Americans and Europeans have little to no input in what their respective governments do. That’s because the private-public ruling class easily deploys and controls narratives. In turn, a construction that enables people to work against themselves is all too readily available. With the dawn of AI that brings about algorithmic interception, such capacity is likely to increase further. The pandemic narrative and the complete absence of a meaningful response have vindicated Robert Michels, as we can confidently assert. In the new algorithmically powered governance, thoughts will be much easier to intercept. If someone intercepts them, they can modify their behavior accordingly.

A MAN HAS been jailed for 20 months for attacking and threatening to kill his then partner in their home at a time when he was a serving garda. Ian Gillen of Carysfort Avenue, Blackrock, Co Dublin was before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court today, where he pleaded guilty to threatening to kill or cause serious harm to Jennifer Clinton on December 23, 2021, at Trafalgar Lane, Monkstown, and to assaulting Ms Clinton on the same occasion. After hearing facts in the case yesterday, Judge Martin Nolan adjourned the case overnight. Today, Judge Nolan said the custody threshold had been crossed in this case, noting that he had considered the facts of the case, Gillen’s circumstances and mitigation. He imposed a prison sentence of four years, with the final 28 months suspended on strict conditions due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in Gillen’s life. Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick testified yesterday that the couple had socialised together that evening in Blackrock Tennis and Bowling Club, where they were members. They had gone home separately, with Ms Clinton arriving home first. Ms Clinton told gardaí that when Gillen arrived home, he called her downstairs to sit on a pouffe by the fireside, where he stood over her in an intimidating manner, rebuking her and calling her names. “Jen, I’m going to rip your head off,” he had said, putting her in fear, and prompting her to make an audio recording of the rest of the incident on her mobile phone, should she not survive. He punched her with a closed fist three times on top of her head. In an effort to get away, she said she needed to go to the toilet, but he refused to let her go. She eventually managed to go, locked the bathroom door behind her, and cleared the windowsill so she’d have a route out. She eventually made her way out of the house. She had managed to record 40 minutes of the threats. An attempt was made to play this in court, but it was not possible due to technical difficulties. A transcript of the recording was handed to the judge instead. Ms Clinton described Gillen’s conduct as pure anger. She said that any time she tried to get up, he kept telling her to sit back down. “You’re going to die tonight,” he told her three times. He also said that he was going to die that night, and she believed her life was in serious danger. After she escaped, Gillen was arrested for coercive control, was interviewed, and the recording was played to him. He was embarrassed and said it wasn’t in him to hit her, but indicated it was another person in his body. “He was shocked by his own behaviour,” said Inspector Kilpatrick. Gillen accepted that he could snap and be angry with drink. He said he had issues in his background, including the death of his son, which caused him to drink. He has since retired and has no previous convictions. Under cross-examination by the defence, the inspector agreed that Gillen had been a front-line garda for 40 years and had dealt with a lot of stressful situations. She accepted that it was in the line of duty that he had to deal with his son taking his own life in his early 20s. Gillen was the first responder on the scene. His mental health deteriorated, and he relied on alcohol. Ms Clinton entered the witness box to deliver an emotional victim impact statement, having to take a break to dry her tears at one stage. She said that her life had been marked by fear and deep trauma since the prolonged assault, when she felt overpowered and trapped. She said she still lived with the consequences every day, having been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. “I live in a state of hypervigilance,” she said. “I lost my confidence. The memory of that night is etched into my mind and body like the cross he etched into the front door of our shared home one night in a rage”. She said that Gillen’s rising aggression while they socialised in the club that evening was what had prompted her to leave, but that he had then arrived home full of fury. “I wanted my family to know the truth if I did not survive,” she said, referring to the 40 minutes of the assault that she captured on her phone. Advertisement “I’m the biggest white psychopath you’ll ever meet,” he had told her. At one point, Gillen mockingly suggested that she ring Blackrock Garda Station, insinuating that nobody would help her if she did, because he was a serving garda. Ms Clinton said that she had to work out how she would escape from the home, where she had previously felt safe. “I thought of my children and grandchildren and made a break for it. I still have recurring nightmares where I did not get out,” she explained. “Living with him took a deep emotional toll. I felt smaller and smaller all the time,” she said. “The man I once loved became someone I feared.” She said that she was in a state of heartbreak and vulnerability when he attacked her, having lost her sister, her mother, her best friend, as well as Gillen’s son, Cathal. “I’m not the person I was before this happened to me,” she continued. She said that the horror of that night still affected and echoed through the lives of those she loved. “As a longstanding member of An Garda Síochána, he would present himself as a figure, someone to be believed and relied upon to uphold common decency and morality,” she said. She said she had not included the most appalling part of what he had said about being a garda, but that they were in the recording. However, she said that he did not tarnish the reputation of An Garda Síochána, but just of himself. “I’m here for justice,” she said, asking the court to take into account the enduring horror Gillen had caused. Kathleen Leader SC, defending, handed the court two testimonials and a psychologist’s report on behalf of her client, who she said was a deeply ashamed man and apologised for what he had put Ms Clinton through. She said he had faced a number of traumatic incidents in his 40 years with the force. They had taken their toll on him and probably hadn’t been dealt with as they should have been. She described the death of his son in the very recent past, while Gillen was on duty, as every guard’s and parent’s worst nightmare, and asked the court to take it into account. She said that he had retired from the gardaí on medical grounds. Counsel explained that Gillen was a former senior international bowler and a member of Blackrock Bowling Club, while his son had been involved in Cabinteely Soccer Club. He now works to prevent suicide through these clubs. “He has become involved as a person to speak to about mental health issues,” she said. His two referees were in court to support him, she said, with one crediting her client with saving his life and the other saying that he had helped him in the prevention of suicide. “He was enduring a very traumatic event at the time,” she said. “It was an out-of-character incident.” She said that her client attends his GP and a psychiatrist, who told him that he was dealing with his trauma appropriately by helping others. Ms Leader quoted the psychologist’s report as saying Gillen was at a low risk of domestic violence in future, provided things are maintained as they are. “This was a man who was stressed at the time for very good reason, not appropriately dealing with the stress,” she said. Passing sentence today, Judge Martin Nolan said, “It seems only he knows why he attacked her. He beat her over a period of time and slapped her and made very serious threats that were believable”. He said, “This injured party was terrified, and she eventually made her escape”. Judge Nolan said the background to this case is that this defendant is a retired member of An Garda Síochána. He said Gillen was a front-line garda who had to “make difficult decisions, and this can have an effect on a person.” He also noted that Gillen was “visited with a tragic event with the death of his son, which must have affected him”. He said there was a report before the court which outlined how this tragic incident impacted the defendant. The judge said the mitigation in this case is clear: Gillen entered a guilty plea, there was a general level of cooperation, he has no record of conviction, and he has a good work history, all of which the court must acknowledge. Judge Nolan said, “I believe that he has crossed the custody threshold”, noting that this is a very serious matter. He said, “I don’t know what was going through his mind on that night”. Judge Nolan sentenced Gillen to four years in prison, but due to the substantial mitigation and the tragedy in his life, he suspended the final 28 months for 28 months.

The massive inflows to Bitcoin ETFs were led by BlackRock's IBIT with $448.5 million, followed by Fidelity's FBTC at $324.3 million and ARK's ARKB with $268.7 million, according to Farside Investors data. Even with $40.2 million in outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC, total net flows turned sharply positive. The influx comes as Bitcoin (BTC) hit a new all-time high of $118,000 Friday morning, pushing total net inflows across all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs above $50 billion since their launch last January. Ethereum ETFs locked in $383 million in net inflows on Thursday, their second-highest day on record, dominated by BlackRock’s ETHA with $300.9 million in inflows, per Farside Investors data. The biggest day for spot Bitcoin ETFs was on November 7, with $1.374 billion in inflows following Trump's election victory. "The recent surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs signals a significant shift in how large capital allocators are engaging with the digital asset space," Charmaine Tam, head of OTC sales and trading at Hex Trust, told Decrypt. "It reflects a disciplined approach to capital allocation into custody-grade, regulated vehicles." Tam said the institutional embrace gained momentum following the SEC's July 1st guidance on crypto ETF disclosure standards, providing the “regulatory clarity” that risk-averse allocators demanded. "Looking ahead, this momentum could unlock substantial incremental institutional allocation potential, estimated to be in the range of $8-$10 billion in the second half of 2025," she said. Bitcoin is currently trading at $117,899 according to CoinGecko data, having surged to a new all-time high of $118,667 Friday morning. "What stands out is that this buying pressure is occurring even as BTC trades in a tight range near all-time highs, suggesting that the bid is less about chasing momentum and more about strategic allocation,” Chris Colman, Head of Trading, APAC at Gemini, told Decrypt. Colman noted that "spot ETFs now manage close to $150 billion in assets, and because they require the actual purchase of Bitcoin, these inflows represent real demand—not just synthetic exposure." “Macro conditions are supporting the bid," he said, with softer yields and a stable Fed outlook encouraging rotation into "alternatives with asymmetric upside." The supply-demand imbalance triggered massive forced selling, with short sellers getting crushed as Bitcoin surged to new highs. Over $1.14 billion in crypto short positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with Bitcoin shorts bearing the brunt at $679.8 million as the asset demolished resistance levels, per CoinGlass data. The combination of institutional ETF flows, corporate treasury adoption, and retail FOMO has created what Tam describes as "float-adjusted scarcity" premium. Both institutional and retail investors are “bullish on a short term interest rate cut, based on the latest developments around the Fed chair,” Ganesh Mahidhar, investment professional at Further Ventures, told Decrypt. “This is also being supported by more BTC strategies being announced," he added. President Donald Trump ratcheted up pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell Thursday, demanding rate cuts in a Truth Social post: “"Too Late" DEMEANS THE GREAT CREDIT OF THE USA... LOWER THE RATE!!!" Users of on-chain prediction market Myriad are split, with 43.1% predicting the Fed will cut rates in July, while 35.7% of predictors expect no change. The administration also opened a new front against Powell, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought accusing the Fed chair of "grossly mismanaging" the central bank and citing a "pricey and ostentatious" $2.5 billion headquarters renovation, roughly $700 million over budget.

US stock market futures fell after President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canada, starting August 1, intensifying global trade concerns. Despite positive earnings from companies like Delta and Levi Strauss, investor sentiment weakened as Trump warned of more tariffs on key trading partners including the EU, Japan, and Brazil. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures slipped by 0.6% or more early Friday. Meanwhile, all eyes are on next week's CPI data and Q2 earnings from major banks. Oil prices ticked higher on Russia sanction talks, but growth worries persist. This evolving trade agenda has markets on edge.

Title: The Big Bad Republican Bill Wasn’t Regressive Enough for the Anti-Tax Crusaders
URL: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/07/index-capital-gains-inflation-republican-bill-regressive-antitax-grover-norquist/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T10:00:00Z

Mother Jones illustration; Samuel Corum/Getty It is apparently not enough for America’s anti-tax crusaders that Congress just passed one of the most expensive and regressive tax bills in our history. The Washington Post reports that Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform and other conservative groups are now urging the Trump administration to change how investment profits are taxed—unilaterally, if need be—in a way that would overwhelmingly favor the wealthiest Americans. Sound familiar? Namely, they want to index capital gains to inflation. Suppose I bought $100,000 worth of Apple stock on July 10, 2020, and kept it. Today, I could sell that stock for $170,383—a tidy $70,383 profit. That’s a 74 percent overall return and an average annual return of 11.7 percent. Pretty good, right? Not good enough for Norquist et al. These players want to let me adjust the “cost basis”—the price I originally paid for the stock—for inflation. Using this inflation calculator, I could then tell the IRS that my initial $100k investment was in fact a $120,407 investment, and so my profit for tax purposes is only $40,976. This is insane—for several reasons. First, read the room. Congress just passed a megabill whose benefits are deeply skewed in favor of the wealthy. Its tax provisions and spending cuts, taken together, will result in a 4 percent increase in average after-tax income for the richest 1 percent of American households and a nearly 4 percent decrease for the poorest 20 percent, based on the Yale Budget Lab’s analysis. This is very, very unpopular. The bill will add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt—more like $5 trillion if expiring provisions are extended in the coming years. And indexing capital gains to inflation, according to 2018 estimates from the Tax Policy Center and the Penn Wharton Budget Model, would add yet another $100 billion to $200 billion to the tab—with the richest 1 percent reaping 86 percent of the benefits. “I don’t think reducing [capital gains rates further] will change investor behavior,” says billionaire Mark Cuban. Norquist told the Washington Post he recently spoke with President Donald Trump and recommended the president implement the change with an executive order. Indexing capital gains to inflation was considered during Trump’s first term, the Post‘s Jeff Stein reports, but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin felt Congress should handle it—current secretary Scott Bessent may prove more compliant. “I said something like, ‘Mr. President, after we do the bill, we will need more economic growth,” Norquist told Stein. “The Big Beautiful Bill is very pro-growth, but with this, we can have even more growth.’” In reality, not one of the Republican tax packages enacted since Ronald Reagan became president has lived up to its sponsors’ economic promises. “The economy may well enjoy a sugar-high the next couple of years, as borrowing stimulates near-term consumption,” Maya MacGuineas, president of the nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said in a statement after Congress passed the “One Bie Beautiful Bill” on July 3. “But a sugar-high won’t be sustained, it will do real damage, and often what comes next is the crash.” As for the notion of indexing fueling “more growth,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me in an email that he thinks the current tax rates on capital gains are fair, and “I don’t think reducing it will change investor behavior.” (He added that he would support even lower rates—even zero—under certain circumstances, for ordinary employees of a company that gets liquidated, as a way to reduce wealth inequality.) Yet the fairness of those rates—and their justification—is the subject of fierce debate. Suppose I’m a wealthy investor and I sell assets I’ve held for at least 12 months—stocks, bonds, real estate, or even, say, a stud racehorse—netting my family $1,000,000 in profits. The federal tax on those capital gains ranges from zero for the first $94,000 to 20 percent for the portion that exceeds $583,750. Because my spouse and I have income of more than $250,000, we also have to pay a 3.8 percent “net investment income tax.” This all adds up to an effective tax rate of about 19 percent. But tax rates for wage income are much higher. A couple reporting $1,000,000 in salary income pays an effective rate of about 30 percent. That’s a huge difference, and part of why families whose money comes primarily from asset growth have amassed wealth so much faster than working families have. It no lefty exaggeration to say America’s economic system is rigged against workers and in favor of investors. It’s right there in the tax code. “This kind of proposal will only widen the economic inequality we’re facing.” So how do conservative policy wonks justify the low capital gains rates? A key argument, interestingly, is that inflation eats away at the value of long-term gains. One “solution” would be to index the gains to inflation, notes the libertarian Cato Institute, “but most countries instead roughly compensate” by offering reduced tax rates for investors. And now the anti-taxers want to have it both ways. Investors enjoy other economic advantages, too. Notably, their gains are counted as income only when the assets are sold. In practice, this allows people with a large portfolio of appreciated assets to borrow against their holdings at single-digit interest rates and live off those loans instead of selling assets and paying a double-digit tax. As ProPublica discovered, many of America’s wealthiest families have been doing precisely that. (As a result, from 2014 to 2018, Jeff Bezos paid an effective income tax rate of less than 1 percent.) Or say you have a $100 investment that grows by 10 percent a year during a period of 2 percent annual inflation. The first year’s profit, after inflation, is $8. “But I don’t pay tax on that $8 until I sell, which may be decades later,” says Bob Lord a former tax attorney and associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies. “I’m basically getting a free ride on the appreciation of that $8 portion of my investment.” Doesn’t that benefit, he asks, more than offset any detriment from inflation? And also, isn’t investing supposed to contain an element of risk management? Isn’t the ability to beat inflation part of what separates a savvy investor from a useless one? Indexing for inflation, combined with favorable tax capital gains rates and an exemption for unrealized gains—doesn’t that basically reduce investing to shooting fish in a barrel? It is worth noting, too, that most Americans work for a paycheck, and the ones who make their living via investing are by and large quite wealthy. More than half of Americans now own some stock, but not much. As of January 2024, per Federal Reserve data, 93 percent of US stock holdings were owned by the most affluent 10 percent of the population, and the richest 1 percent owned more than half of all public equities—not to mention private equities. Indexing gains to inflation “would really codify the notion that income taxes are only for people who work for a living,” says Morris Pearl, a former managing director at BlackRock and current chairman of the board of Patriotic Millionaires, a nonprofit that advocates for higher taxes on the rich. If the Trump administration were to attempt the change Norquist recommended—unilaterally or otherwise—its not even clear how it would work. You would presumably need to make changes on both the profit and loss sides of a balance sheet. Kyle Pomerleau, a senior fellow with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, has concluded that indexing is complex and unlikely to generate significant economic impact, and is therefore “more trouble than it’s worth.” “Indexing has been rejected in the past to avoid opening new tax shelters,” says Steven Rosenthal, a Washington tax policy expert and former legislation counsel for the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. “If investors were permitted to index their assets, but not required to index their liabilities, debt-financed investments would explode. Investors could exclude profits and deduct interest. But indexing both assets and liabilities is a mess, which I, as a congressional staffer, discovered when we tried to draft it.” “This kind of proposal will only widen the economic inequality we’re facing,” adds Patriotic Millionaires’ Pearl. “It’s absurd that all I would need to do is buy property that I can rent out, and make a lot of money, and never have to pay taxes again!” Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.

Title: EU ‘has no money except for war’ – Hungarian official
URL: https://www.rt.com/news/621327-hungary-eu-ukraine-fund/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T09:58:50Z
Full Content:
The EU is placing Ukraine’s military needs above the priorities of the bloc’s member states, Hungarian government adviser Balazs Orban has said. He accused EU leaders of always finding money for “war” but not other causes. Leaders of EU nations are considering the creation of a new €100 billion ($117 billion) fund under the bloc’s upcoming seven-year budget to cover expenses for the Ukrainian government, Bloomberg reported this week, citing people familiar with the discussions. Budapest, however, has been a vocal critic of the bloc’s approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict since its onset. “Europe has run out of money – except when it comes to war. There is always 100 billion euros for that,” Orban wrote on Wednesday on social media. He warned that such an allocation of funds would likely lead to further proposals to spend EU taxpayers’ money on Ukraine. Orban pointed to Kiev’s estimate that it would require $1 trillion over 14 years for reconstruction and modernization, a figure shared by Prime Minister Denis Shmigal during a donors conference in Rome this week. “While Europe cannot climb out of its own economic, social and security crisis, Brussels would continue to finance the war – weapons instead of peace, new debt instead of a competitive Europe,” Orban said. Last week, Bloomberg reported that US investment firm BlackRock had abandoned efforts to attract private investors for a Ukraine reconstruction program. The fund was expected to be launched at the Rome conference, but potential participants reportedly expressed “a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty” over the country’s future. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky said at the event that “only friends are invited” to help rebuild the country. He reiterated his call to confiscate Russian state assets frozen by Western nations and transfer them to Kiev. Moscow has warned that such actions would constitute international theft. EU members have voiced concern that expropriating Russian assets could significantly erode global confidence in their financial systems. As an alternative, Ukraine’s backers have been imposing a “windfall tax” on profits from the immobilized Russian funds and channeling the money to Kiev – an approach Moscow has described as another form of criminality. Hungary has accused the EU leadership of inflicting major economic harm on member states through sanctions on Russia, and of wasting resources on a war effort that it argues cannot deliver a military victory over Moscow.

The uptrend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $1,13,500. Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of above $1,16,000, marking a 101 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) gain. With momentum intact, Bitcoin could next target $1,20,000, and possibly more, if ETF inflows and macro conditions stay supportive. The Fear & Greed Index now signals “greed,” reflecting strong investor sentiment and sustained buying interest, observed Edul Patel, Co-founder and CEO of Mudrex. He added that institutional participation remains a key driver, with $1.52 billion flowing into crypto funds over the last five trading days. Pankaj Balani, CEO & Co-Founder of Delta Exchange, expressed optimism on the next leg targeting $1,30,000 and beyond, with support from macro conditions and ETF inflows. A sudden surge in Bitcoin’s price triggered a short squeeze, where traders betting against it were forced to buy back in, resulting in over $1 billion in losses and accelerating the rally. The uptrend remains intact as long as BTC holds above $1,13,500. Ethereum’s breakout past $3,000 and its brief lead over Bitcoin in futures volume at $62.1 billion reflects increasing risk appetite and expanding trader interest in ETH derivatives, Balani also said. Many altcoins followed the broader market uptrend, with GRIFFAIN, SAGA, GOAT, and SEIU rallying more than 20 per cent. “If Bitcoin keeps climbing, altcoins could see a surge in optimism and potentially even larger gains.” Institutional demand remains a major driver of this momentum, with US Bitcoin ETFs surpassing $50 billion in net inflows to date. Himanshu Maradiya, Founder & Chairman, CIFDAQ shared that BlackRock alone holds over $65 billion in BTC, while corporate treasuries continue to accumulate. Macroeconomic shifts including a weaker dollar, rising treasury demand, and sovereign credit downgrades are further positioning BTC as a hedge. Ashish Singhal, Co-founder, CoinSwitch, attributed the rise in institutional demand to more favourable signals from the Trump administration in the US. “This rally is not just about price; it reflects how crypto is maturing into a recognised asset class within the global financial system. With smart regulations, policy clarity, and support for homegrown innovation, India can become a global leader in crypto innovation. India can’t afford to be on the sidelines and a time-bound plan to regulate crypto in India is the need of the hour. On the investor side, it’s encouraging to see most portfolios in green,” he said.

Title: Melting glaciers awaken hundreds of dormant volcanoes, threatening global chaos

Key points: Glacier melt is destabilizing volcanoes, triggering more frequent and explosive eruptions. Historical data reveals that rapid ice loss following the last ice age unleashed violent volcanic activity â a pattern repeating today. High-risk zones include North America, New Zealand, Russia, and Antarctica, where pressure shifts threaten dormant magma reservoirs. Underground nuclear tests and deep drilling may artificially hasten volcanic awakenings, with catastrophic environmental consequences. Governments and corporations remain dangerously unprepared for the cascading effects of multiple eruptions, including climate disruption and mass displacement. Ice retreat, volcanic awakening: A ticking time bomb A groundbreaking study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has revealed a chilling connection: As glaciers vanish, the suppression they once exerted on magma chambers beneath them weakens, allowing pent-up gases and molten rock to expand explosively. By analyzing crystal formations in Chilean volcanoes, researchers confirmed that rapid glacial retreat 18,000 years ago led to volcanic eruptions of unprecedented scale â a phenomenon poised to repeat itself. "Glaciers act like a lid on a pressure cooker," explained geologist Pablo Moreno-Yaeger. "When that lid melts away, the buildup beneath can detonate violently." His teamâs findings suggest that regions once blanketed by thick ice â such as North Americaâs Cascade Range, Russiaâs Kamchatka Peninsula, and New Zealandâs Taup? Volcanic Zone â are now primed for disaster. Even more alarming? The Antarctic ice sheets, which conceal dozens of hidden volcanoes, are melting at accelerating rates, raising fears of a continent-wide eruption cycle never witnessed by modern civilization. Human meddling: Hastening nature's wrath Human interference deep within the Earthâs crust may be exacerbating the danger. Since the mid-20th century, underground nuclear tests have unleashed shockwaves powerful enough to fracture tectonic fault lines â potentially destabilizing nearby volcanic systems. Meanwhile, large-scale drilling projects â whether for oil, geothermal energy, or carbon sequestration â puncture fragile geological layers, creating pathways for magma to surge toward the surface. Evidence of this tampering already exists. In 1961, the Soviet Unionâs Tsar Bomba â the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated â triggered seismic waves equivalent to a magnitude-5.0 earthquake. More recently, the controversial HAARP program in Alaska, designed to manipulate the ionosphere, has been accused of inducing seismic disturbances near volcanic zones. "When we bombard the Earth with these unnatural forces, we gamble with forces we barely understand," warns seismologist Dr. Ken McGee. "A single misplaced detonation or drill hole could be the spark that lights the fuse." Human activities â such as fluid injection, extraction, reservoir impoundment, and mining â can induce earthquakes, a phenomenon known as induced seismicity. Fluid injection: Pumping fluids (e.g., fracking wastewater, geothermal injection) deep underground increases pore pressure in rock formations, lubricating faults and prompting slippage that results in earthquakes. Fluid extraction: Removing large volumes of oil, gas, or groundwater alters crustal stress patterns, destabilizing fault zones and potentially triggering seismic events. Reservoir impoundment: The immense weight of water in dammed reservoirs shifts stress on underlying faults, occasionally causing earthquakes. Mining: Excavation disrupts the stress equilibrium of rock masses, leading to small tremors or earthquakes. Global unpreparedness The grim reality is this: Global disaster response systems are woefully unequipped for a wave of super-eruptions. The 2010 eruption of Icelandâs EyjafjallajÃ¶kullâa relatively minor eventâgrounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, costing billions in economic losses. A Yellowstone-scale event, by comparison, could blanket the U.S. Midwest in ash, collapse supply chains, and trigger mass famine. Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience.

Governments and corporations remain dangerously unprepared for the cascading effects of multiple eruptions, including climate disruption and mass displacement. Historical data reveals that rapid ice loss following the last ice age unleashed violent volcanic activity â a pattern repeating today.

Ice retreat, volcanic awakening: A ticking time bomb A groundbreaking study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison has revealed a chilling connection: As glaciers vanish, the suppression they once exerted on magma chambers beneath them weakens, allowing pent-up gases and molten rock to expand explosively. By analyzing crystal formations in Chilean volcanoes, researchers confirmed that rapid glacial retreat 18,000 years ago led to volcanic eruptions of unprecedented scale â a phenomenon poised to repeat itself. "Glaciers act like a lid on a pressure cooker," explained geologist Pablo Moreno-Yaeger. "When that lid melts away, the buildup beneath can detonate violently." His teamâs findings suggest that regions once blanketed by thick ice â such as North Americaâs Cascade Range, Russiaâs Kamchatka Peninsula, and New Zealandâs Taup? Volcanic Zone â are now primed for disaster. Even more alarming? The Antarctic ice sheets, which conceal dozens of hidden volcanoes, are melting at accelerating rates, raising fears of a continent-wide eruption cycle never witnessed by modern civilization. Human meddling: Hastening nature's wrath Human interference deep within the Earthâs crust may be exacerbating the danger. Since the mid-20th century, underground nuclear tests have unleashed shockwaves powerful enough to fracture tectonic fault lines â potentially destabilizing nearby volcanic systems. Meanwhile, large-scale drilling projects â whether for oil, geothermal energy, or carbon sequestration â puncture fragile geological layers, creating pathways for magma to surge toward the surface. Evidence of this tampering already exists. In 1961, the Soviet Unionâs Tsar Bomba â the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated â triggered seismic waves equivalent to a magnitude-5.0 earthquake. More recently, the controversial HAARP program in Alaska, designed to manipulate the ionosphere, has been accused of inducing seismic disturbances near volcanic zones. "When we bombard the Earth with these unnatural forces, we gamble with forces we barely understand," warns seismologist Dr. Ken McGee. "A single misplaced detonation or drill hole could be the spark that lights the fuse." Human activities â such as fluid injection, extraction, reservoir impoundment, and mining â can induce earthquakes, a phenomenon known as induced seismicity. Fluid injection: Pumping fluids (e.g., fracking wastewater, geothermal injection) deep underground increases pore pressure in rock formations, lubricating faults and prompting slippage that results in earthquakes. Fluid extraction: Removing large volumes of oil, gas, or groundwater alters crustal stress patterns, destabilizing fault zones and potentially triggering seismic events. Reservoir impoundment: The immense weight of water in dammed reservoirs shifts stress on underlying faults, occasionally causing earthquakes. Mining: Excavation disrupts the stress equilibrium of rock masses, leading to small tremors or earthquakes. Global unpreparedness The grim reality is this: Global disaster response systems are woefully unequipped for a wave of super-eruptions. The 2010 eruption of Icelandâs EyjafjallajÃ¶kullâa relatively minor eventâgrounded air traffic across Europe for weeks, costing billions in economic losses. A Yellowstone-scale event, by comparison, could blanket the U.S. Midwest in ash, collapse supply chains, and trigger mass famine. Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience.

Yet instead of investing in decentralized survival strategies â such as natural medicine stockpiles, community-based food reserves, and independent energy grids â governments funnel trillions into militarization and corporate bailouts. Private contractors like BlackRock and Halliburton already position themselves to monopolize on reconstruction efforts. Meanwhile, the same elites pushing climate lockdowns and digital IDs quietly purchase underground bunkersâluxury shelters where they plan to ride out the chaos they helped unleash. The awakening of Earthâs slumbering giants is no longer a question of if but when. Survival demands an immediate rejection of the corrupt institutions that downplay these threats â and a return to self-reliance, truth-telling, and natural resilience.

Title: Pentagon to become largest shareholder in Rinehart-backed rare earth miner MP Materials
URL: https://thewest.com.au/business/cnbc/pentagon-to-become-largest-shareholder-in-rinehart-backed-rare-earth-miner-mp-materials-c-19320336

The Defense Department will become the largest shareholder in Gina Rinehart-backed rare earths miner MP Materials after agreeing to buy $US400 million ($606m) of its preferred stock. MP Materials owns the only operational rare earth mine in the US at Mountain Pass, California, about 60 miles outside Las Vegas. Proceeds from the Pentagon investment will be used to expand MP’s rare earths processing capacity and magnet production, the company said. Shares of New York-listed MP Materials soared about 50 per cent to close at $US45.23 ($68.59). Its market capitalisation grew to $US7.4 billion ($11.2b), an increase of about $US2.5b ($3.8b) from the previous trading session. Mrs Rinehart, Australia’s richest person, saw her 8.5 per cent holding in MP via Hancock Prospecting add approximately $US211m ($320m) to her net worth overnight. Rare earths are used in magnets that are key components in a range of military weapons systems including the F-35 warplane, drones and submarines, according to the Defense Department. The US was almost entirely dependent on foreign countries for rare earths in 2023, with China representing about 70 per cent of imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Rare earths have been a central point of contention in recent trade disputes between the US and China. Ryan Browne Kevin Breuninger Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in April that the Trump administration was considering making direct equity investments in critical mineral companies to break US dependence on China. MP Materials CEO James Litinsky described the Pentagon investment as a public-private partnership that will speed the buildout of an end-to-end rare earth magnet supply chain in the US. “I want to be very clear, this is not a nationalisation,” Litinsky told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Thursday. “We remain a thriving public company. We now have a great new partner in our economically largest shareholder, DoD, but we still control our company. We control our destiny. We’re shareholder driven.” US miners are facing a unique threat from “Chinese mercantilism,” he said. The Pentagon investment in MP could serve as a model for similar deals with other US companies, the CEO said. “It’s a new way forward to accelerate free markets, to get the supply chain on shore that we want and make sure that mercantilism is not going to hurt our ability to do so,” Mr Litinsky said. The Pentagon is buying a newly created class of preferred shares convertible into MP Materials’ common stock, in addition to a warrant convertible at $US30.03 ($45.55) a share for 10 years that allows the US to buy additional common stock. Exercising the convertible preferred shares and the warrant would leave the Pentagon holding about a 15 per cent stake in MP Materials as of July 9, nearly twice the 8.61 per cent held by Litinsky and the 8.27 per cent held by BlackRock Fund Advisors, according to FactSet data. MP Materials will build its second magnet manufacturing facility in the US to serve defence and commercial customers with support from the Pentagon. The facility, whose location wasn’t disclosed, is expected to start commissioning in 2028 and will bring MP Materials rare earth magnet manufacturing capacity to 10,000 metric tonnes annually. This manufacturing capacity is enough to “meaningfully support US defense and commercial needs,” Mr Litinsky told investors on a call Thursday morning. Arjun Kharpal The Pentagon has agreed to buy 100 per cent of the magnets made at the new facility, called 10X, for 10 years after the plant is built to support defense needs and the commercial market. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are providing $1b ($1.5b) to help finance the manufacturing facility. The Pentagon is also guaranteeing a minimum price of $US110 ($166.86) per kilogram for 10 years for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, or NdPr, that is stockpiled or sold by MP Materials. NdPr is a rare earth compound used to make permanent magnets. If the market price is below $US110 per kilogram, the US will pay MP Materials the difference in a quarterly cash payment, Mr Litinsky said. The Pentagon, in turn, will receive 30 per cent of the upside above $110 per kilogram once MP Materials’ second magnet facility is operational, the CEO said. The Defense Department negotiated a very tough deal, Litinsky said. “The taxpayers are going to make a lot of money,” the CEO said. MP Materials also expects to receive a $US150m ($227m) loan in 30 days from the Pentagon to expand its rare earth separation capabilities at Mountain Pass.

Title: BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale Dominate Crypto ETF Assets Amidst Institutional Interest

The firms’ offerings made up 85% of all crypto AUM, while separate research found 75% of investors expect cryptocurrency to soon become part of institutional allocations. Institutional investors expect cryptocurrency to become more prevalent in institutional portfolios and expect traditional financial institutions to dramatically increase their launches of digital asset funds in the near future. According to London-based Nickel Digital Asset Management Ltd., which partnered with research firm Pureprofile to interview 200 institutional investors and wealth managers for the project, 75% of respondents said they expect cryptocurrencies to become a part of institutional portfolio asset allocation within the next five years. Cryptocurrency ETFs are often used by institutional asset owners that seek exposure to the digital asset class. These offerings are dominated by three firms, according to research from ISS Market Intelligence, which, like CIO, is owned by ISS STOXX. BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Grayscale Investments manage more than 85% of all crypto ETF assets under management, totaling approximately $123 billion, ISS MI reported. Fidelity offers exposure to bitcoin and ether through its Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and its Fidelity Ethereum Fund, and Grayscale offers exposure through four different funds. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert newsletter.  BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and iShares Ethereum Trust account for $70 billion in assets, about half of crypto ETF AUM. The Nickel Digital survey also found that 66% of respondents said they see cryptocurrency as the asset class with the biggest opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns over the next five years, followed by private equity and emerging market equities at 64% and 61%, respectively. These investors expect more “traditional financial institutions” to launch crypto funds over the next two years, with 43% saying there will be a dramatic increase and 53% anticipating a slight increase. “Traditional finance firms are already making significant strides into the digital assets space and that is only predicted to increase over the next two years,” said Anatoly Crachilov, CEO and founding partner in Nickel Digital, in a statement. “The views of institutional investors and wealth managers on the ability of crypto to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns helps to explain why that is the case, and why professional investors increasingly expect crypto to be part of institutional investors portfolio allocation.” The Trump administration includes a slate of regulators who are proponents of digital assets, including Jonathan Gould, an attorney who was confirmed by the Senate Thursday to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. After serving the first Trump administration, he was chief legal officer at Bitfury Group, a provider of crypto mining equipment and related services. Additional belief that interest in digital assets also follows the Senate’s passage of the landmark GENIUS Act, setting the stage for the enactment of the first federal framework for stablecoins. The House is scheduled to vote on the measure next week.

That distinction could become more important, as firms’ experimentation with security-based tokens potentially leaves investors confused—a concern raised by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this week. A stock that’s natively tokenized on Ethereum, for example, would carry the same set entitlements that investors receive when purchasing stock through traditional means, like voting or dividend rights, Domingo said. Natively tokenized assets also have no counterparty risk, while avoiding any fragmentation issues, he added. BlackRock’s $2.8 billion USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which Securitize helped introduce last year, is natively tokenized because, as the asset manager’s transfer agent, the firm manages and records the fund’s shares directly on-chain, Domingo explained. Transfer agents usually use proprietary databases instead of a blockchain. “The token represents 100% of the security,” Domingo said, pointing to crypto software platform Exodus’ stock as another example. “One token represents one share.” Exodus shares began trading as tokens on Securitize’s platform in 2022, but this year, interest in tokenization has renewed, with Robinhood unveiling tokenized stock trading on Ethereum layer-2 scaling network Arbitrum last month, and Kraken pushing xStocks on Solana and other networks like BNB Chain. In a statement on Tuesday, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce recommended that firms structuring tokenized offerings, given their obligation to adhere to federal securities laws, should consider meeting with the regulator. Tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations, she underscored. “As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset,” she wrote. “Tokenized securities are still securities.” Anthony Tu-Sekine, a partner at Seward and Kissel LLP who leads the firm’s blockchain and digital assets practice, told Decrypt that the conversation around tokenization pertains to crypto, but at the end of the day, it’s about policing securities under existing securities laws. “People sometimes feel that, because of the nature of the blockchain, crypto should be less regulated,” he said. “That’s not what we’re talking about here.” In some ways, Peirce’s statement represented a warning to investors, not long after ChatGPT maker OpenAI denounced Robinhood’s move to offer so-called stock tokens in Europe that are tied to equity in the tech darling. In response, Robinhood said its tokens give "indirect exposure to private markets” as “tokenized contracts that follow their price.” Indeed, Pierce said in her recent statement that a tokenized security, depending on the circumstances, could resemble “security entitlements” or a “security-based swap,” as opposed to equity in any private or public company. Robinhood’s stock tokens possess some features that appear aimed at creating a controlled environment for the product. U.S. customers are barred from buying stock tokens, they can’t be sent to other wallets or platforms, and users must be KYC-verified via identifying information. Kraken doesn’t allow U.S. customers to purchase xStocks either, but the tokens, which are issued by a firm called Backed, are permissionless, meaning that they can be freely traded on a decentralized exchange or independently adopted by any platform. As the SEC urges market participants to consider federal securities, the regulator is trying to stick to a collaborative approach to crypto under U.S. President Donald Trump, as reflected by a roundtable discussion on tokenization hosted by the SEC in May. “In recent history, we seem to have forgotten a very fundamental concept: that investors and issuers have valuable observations and experiences,” SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, and now-defunct crypto exchange FTX once dabbled in tokenized stock trading—but those products were ultimately shelved. Crypto lending platform Abra began offering contracts as tokens to customers in 2019 that allowed them to gain exposure to price moments of certain U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. The company “voluntarily ceased offering” the tokens after cooperating with an SEC investigation, according to a CFTC filing. In 2020, the SEC and CFTC ordered Abra to pay each agency a $150,000 penalty for allegedly offering unregistered securities and engaging in unlawful off-exchange swaps trading. Abra agreed, “without admitting or denying the findings.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Share this article Aptos Labs, the development team behind the Aptos layer 1 blockchain, has appointed Solomon Tesfaye as its new Chief Business Officer, strengthening its executive team at a time of rapid growth in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and institutional blockchain adoption. Tesfaye previously served as Head of Capital Markets at Aptos, where he led efforts to connect the blockchain to traditional financial players. His leadership enabled Aptos to build partnerships with institutions including BlackRock, Apollo, and Franklin Templeton, helping to position the network for deployment in crypto ETPs and ETFs in both the US and Europe. “Solomon has been critical in shaping our Global Trading Engine vision and forging the partnerships that will help make it a reality,” said Avery Ching, Co-Founder and CEO at Aptos Labs. “As CBO, he’ll be key to scaling that work, bringing more institutions, markets, and real-world use cases onto Aptos as global web3 adoption continues to accelerate.” With more than a decade’s experience in investment banking, venture capital, and digital asset strategy, Tesfaye is expected to lead Aptos Labs’ push into financial services infrastructure, institutional onboarding, and scalable tokenization. His focus will include driving global enterprise partnerships in fintech, payments, and asset management, advancing strategic initiatives and business development, opening new markets and use cases for on-chain finance. Aptos is expected to benefit from pro-crypto policies under the Trump administration, which promise improved regulatory clarity and enhanced support for crypto businesses. “With the US nearing the completion of frameworks for next-generation financial services, Aptos Labs is well-positioned to lead the shift to on-chain assets and help shape the infrastructure of tomorrow’s global markets,” said Tesfaye in a statement. “I’m excited to forge the partnerships and integrations that institutions and other market participants need to fully harness Aptos’ tokenization capabilities at scale.” The leadership change comes amid accelerating adoption, as Aptos surpasses $540 million in tokenized real-world assets, with institutional integrations having doubled since the start of 2025.

Title: Airbnb Host Refuses To Let Renters Stay In The Unit They Reserved, So They Complain To Airbnb Who Kicks The Host Off The App

by Jayne Elliott Shutterstock/Reddit It used to be that if you wanted to travel somewhere and needed a place to stay, you had to stay in a hotel, but websites like Airbnb have changed that. Now, there are a lot more options! The problem with sites like Airbnb is that not all rentals and not all rental hosts are created equal. I’ve used Airbnb multiple times and had great experiences, but there have been a couple times I thought, “I’ll never stay there again!” Thankfully, I’ve never had an experience as bad as the guy who wrote this story. His experience is so bad that he had to complain to Airbnb about it multiple times to gets the problem resolved, but in the end, it did get resolved in everyone’s favor except the Airbnb host! Let’s see what happens. In around 2019 I had a friend coming to visit for Paddy’s Day. Now I’m Irish, but he’s actually from Hong Kong. Given that I’m local, I said I’d take care of booking accommodation etc. I went on and of course as usual everything was like half a grand (welcome to Dublin…). Obviously things were maxed out due to it being Paddy’s Weekend. But I found one spot in Blackrock, which isn’t in the city centre but is only a few stops away on the DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transit), that was going for €68 per night! I booked it right then and there. Then something weird happened. The following morning I got a notification from AirBNB saying the host wanted to up the price by €288.28, and if I would accept that. I clicked no and figured hey, he’s already accepted our booking, I don’t have to say yes to this! I waited the few weeks until the weekend in question, and then it came. My friend landed at Dublin Airport, we made our way to Blackrock, got to the door, rang the doorbell, and… nothing. This is even weirder. There was no car in the driveway, nobody was home. We hung around for forty minutes until the host arrived, and he wouldn’t. Even. Look us in the eye. I said hi, we’ve a booking to stay here this weekend? And he mumbled something about how no one was staying there sorry and he went inside. Airbnb tried to make it right. Well I got straight onto AirBNB. They offered us our money back, and I said no, that’s not good enough, everywhere else is half a grand what are we going to do with €68? So they offered us double, and I still said no, we need a place to stay! So they booked us into a lovely house elsewhere that was closer to the city centre. It gets even better! But that’s not all. I made an official complaint about the host and how he screwed us over, and they booted him off the app! For trying to fleece a couple of twenty-something lads, he had to stop renting his place out entirely! I’m a petty guy, so every couple of months I randomly think about this and check to see if he’s back online yet. As of May 2025, he’s still not. So I’ve cost him over six years of AirBNB rent (and counting). You love to see it. That Airbnb host really should’ve just let the guys rent the place for the agreed upon price. Let’s see how Reddit reacted to this story. Here’s the perspective of someone who hasn’t used Airbnb. A former Airbnb host shares hatred for the service. This person finds the request to pay more pretty unusual. It’s possible the host listed the unit somewhere else. Or maybe the host sold the rental. At least Airbnb made it right for the renter. That’s something. If you liked that post, check out this post about a woman who tracked down a contractor who tried to vanish without a trace.

Learn more and register today. – Sarah Morton Two years ago, I took on the role of editor for Crypto for Advisors at a pivotal moment. It was mid-2023, and the cryptocurrency industry was in the midst of a deep winter. The collapse of major lending platforms and the implosion of FTX had sent shockwaves through the markets. The U.S. regulatory climate was hostile, marked by enforcement-first tactics, and confidence was shaken. But even then, the undercurrents of something bigger were impossible to ignore. Fast forward to today, and we’re standing on the edge of what Bank of America calls a “once-in-a-millennium transformation.” They’re not talking about memes or speculation. They’re talking about the reshaping of global financial infrastructure, economic models, and digital ownership — and it’s being driven by crypto. An Ode to Bitcoin: The Genesis “Bitcoin belongs in the same breath as the printing press and artificial intelligence.” — Bank of America: Bitcoin, born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, created something revolutionary: a decentralized, fixed-supply digital currency. It belonged to no government, no corporation, and no central authority. From there, a movement began. Early adoption saw students tinkering with GPUs, developers building wallets, entrepreneurs launching exchanges, and miners chasing cheap power around the globe. A technological and economic revolution took shape. Today, we’re seeing bitcoin ETFs from the world’s largest asset managers — BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale being the top three by AUM — and even nation-state adoption as countries like the U.S. and UAE race to become global crypto hubs. It’s an unparalleled acceleration of financial innovation. The Rise of Ethereum and Smart Contracts Bitcoin sparked the fire, but Ethereum — and the smart contract innovation it introduced — brought utility, programmability, and the ability to tokenize everything: real estate, carbon credits, fine art, identity, equities, and even yield-generating protocols. While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, tens of thousands of digital assets exist. And while investing grabs the spotlight, blockchain is quietly transforming supply chains, intellectual property, finance, and more. Public companies are adding crypto to their balance sheets. Over 140 public firms have announced bitcoin reserves. Exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken will offer tokenized equities, while retail platforms like Robinhood expand their crypto products. Access points are multiplying: direct-to-consumer platforms, ETFs (now in the hundreds), tokenized funds, and direct ownership. And the list keeps growing. The Landscape Has Changed — Are You Adopting? Only a handful of advisors were very early adopters but that’s slowly evolving. There’s broadening recognition of the opportunity — to support clients, protect relationships, and win new business. It's becoming increasingly common to hear from advisors that they are winning clients simply because they’re willing to talk about bitcoin. On the other hand, the lack of regulation, prohibitive firm policies, digital assets volatility behavior and overall uncertainty with a new asset class has caused hesitancy. Moreover, advisors have a lot to pay attention to —- and now learning a new — and always changing — asset class is added to the list! Despite all of this, clients want to access digital assets. Recent Coinshares survey data highlights that clients want the help of their advisors and expect them to be knowledgeable in digital assets. More than 80% of the respondents answered that they would be more likely to work with an advisor that offers digital asset guidance, and 78% of non-crypto investors say they’d turn to an advisor if crypto support were available. Notably, almost 90% said they planned to increase their crypto exposure in 2025. A Call to Action Blockchain is an infrastructure, crypto is more than an asset class and the technology extends well beyond investing. The industry is maturing,regulation is advancing andthe world’s largest institutions are developing on blockchain. As U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said recently, “Crypto is the most important phenomenon happening in the world today.” You don’t need to be a crypto trader or blockchain developer. But if you’re a fiduciary — a guide, a planner — you owe it to your clients to understand what’s happening. Education is key. In two years of curating this newsletter, I’ve watched sentiment shift from skepticism to curiosity to strategic integration. And we’re just getting started. I’m thrilled to be here with you on your crypto journey. Connect with me for ideas on future topics you’d like to see addressed. - Sarah Morton, chief strategy officer, MeetAmi Innovations Inc. Q. Why is the same digital asset priced differently on each exchange? A. Equities “plug in” to an exchange, allowing for one, centralized price. Crypto, on the contrary, is “decentralized.” This means there’s not one “plug” to price a digital asset. While crypto prices are based on supply and demand (as well as other factors), each exchange operates independently and therefore prices can vary between different exchanges. Q. How can I find reliable pricing data for digital assets? A. There are many digital asset index and data providers. Look for pricing that (1) comes from a reputable and trusted provider with a proven track record in digital assets, (2) has a transparent and rules-based approach to construction, and (3) lays out thoughtfully constructed criteria for how the pricing is captured. The index methodology is incredibly important. For example, if selection criteria of an index included “trading on more than one eligible exchange” with eligibility thoughtfully designed, then in the case of the FTX collapse, FTT (the exchange token of FTX) wouldn’t have made it into the index. Thoughtful construction can rule out bad actors. Q. Why are people using bitcoin to measure the entire digital asset landscape? A. While bitcoin now accounts for 65% of the total digital asset market, there were times bitcoin was less than 40% of the market. One asset should not be a benchmark for the entire asset class. Diversification is key for institutional investors to manage volatility and capture broader opportunities. Effective benchmarking must serve multiple constituencies—enabling performance evaluation, supporting investment strategies, and setting industry standards for everyone. Indices such as CoinDesk 5 (CD5), CoinDesk 20 (CD20), CoinDesk 80 (CD80), CoinDesk 100 (CD100) and CoinDesk Memecoin (CDMEME) were constructed to meet the needs of those looking to benchmark, trade and/or invest in the ever-evolving digital asset landscape. - Kim Klemballa, CoinDesk Indices Keep Reading Kim Greenberg Klemballa contributed reporting.

Title: Bitcoin Blasts to $112,017 ATH – What’s the Best Crypto to Buy Before the Next Surge?
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-blasts-to-ath/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T14:23:15Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. After hovering below the $110K mark over the past few weeks, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high yesterday. Bolstered by growing institutional adoption, $BTC is stronger than ever. And that means now’s the time to buy crypto before the next surge. $BTC finally reached the $100K milestone late last year, before outdoing itself in May, when it reached $111,970. Making it to $112,017 is another first for the crypto OG. Make no mistake, Lady Luck played no hand in Bitcoin’s surge. It’s down to an ever-growing list of financial institutions worldwide that are recognizing the value of $BTC, due in part to supportive government policies. Bitcoin champion Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, argues that Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period. In fact, he told Bloomberg in a June 10 interview that he believes that $BTC will be $1M. “The President of the United States supports Bitcoin. The Cabinet supports Bitcoin. [Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin. Paul Atkins has shown himself to be enthusiastic about bitcoin and digital assets. Brian Quintenz at CFTC feels that the banks will custody Bitcoin.” Saylor explained that Bitcoin Treasury companies are buying $BTC’s natural supply. In addition, “BlackRock and the ETFs are buying another measure of that, and we’ve got nation-state actors coming into the space. The writing is on the wall. Bitcoin is moving higher.” Take GameStop, for instance. It made waves in May by greenlighting Bitcoin buys at the board level. Soon after, GameStop purchased 4.71K Bitcoin. And for its part, the Trump Media and Technology Group is also eyeing a blended crypto ETF. Dubbed the “Crypto Blue Chip ETF,” it plans to offer exposure to five digital assets. Some 70% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $BTC, 15% in $ETH, 8% in $SOL, and 5% in $XRP. The remaining 2% of the ETF’s holdings will be in $CRO – the native token of the ETF’s digital custodian, the exchange Crypto.com. With fresh ETF inflows, increased corporate balance sheet exposure, the rise of crypto futures, and a more favorable regulatory environment, $BTC is experiencing a powerful surge in institutional interest. And the momentum shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. So, if you’re wondering which crypto to buy before the next big surge, you’re in the right place. Here are three altcoins with massive potential to explode when $BTC rallies again. If Michael Saylor’s predictions hold true, that surge could be just around the corner. In keeping with all things $BTC, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) brings an exciting proposal to the crypto table. A Bitcoin Layer-2 (L2) platform. The Bitcoin blockchain has a lot going for it, especially in terms of top-level security. It falls short, however, in terms of speed and high transaction fees, especially when compared to the likes of Solana. In short, Bitcoin lacks scalability. That’s where $HYPER steps up to the plate. This upcoming meme coin is set to power an innovative Bitcoin L2 ecosystem that will increase the speed and reduce fees. More importantly, it adds cross-chain compatibility. That means seamless access to the best meme coins, DeFi, and dApps. At the moment, Bitcoin Hyper is on presale. That means you can buy it for $0.0122. You can also stake your $HYPER for 360% APY. If you’re keen to discover more about this L2 and the meme coin behind it, take a look at our guide to buying $HYPER. It explains all you need to know. Keep in mind, though, that as a presale, the price of $HYPER will increase in stages, offering you the chance to secure tokens at a lower cost now. Additionally, the rewards APY is dynamic and will decrease over time, so the earlier you get in, the better the returns. Once $HYPER lists on DEXs after the presale, the price is expected to rise even further, so now is a prime opportunity to get involved before the price climbs. It’s not only institutions that are taking Bitcoin and other digital assets much more seriously these days. That’s what makes the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) one to watch with a very close eye. It’s the native token of Best Wallet, a non-custodial, no KYC, multi-chain, and multi-currency hot wallet that is gaining serious market traction. So much so that Best Wallet is on a mission to dominate 40% of the global crypto wallet market by the end of next year. And it’s using $BEST to help it achieve that target. Holding $BEST means additional benefits and features of what is already a leading crypto wallet. That includes being able to buy the best presale crypto directly from the mobile wallet (a market first, by the way); lower transaction fees; and higher staking rewards. $BEST is also on presale. Buy yours today for $0.025305 and stake it for 99% before the upcoming price increase. Our How To Buy $BEST guide explains how to do just that. The America Party Token ($AP) is another newcomer to the crypto scene. It was launched mere days after Elon Musk announced he intends to create a new political party. However, unlike $HYPER and $BEST, which are both on presale, $AP is already listed on DEXs. That said, $AP does stand to ride on Musk’s coattails. And to sweeten the deal, when Musk mentions a cryptocurrency, meme coins in particular, that token often explodes. And recently, Musk was asked by a follower whether his America Party will embrace Bitcoin. His response was definitive: “Fiat is useless, so yes.” Another boost for crypto. Right now, $AP costs $0.01830 – up 239.38% since it launched on July 7. Get yours today through UniSwap or MEXC. As Saylor put it, “Bitcoin is moving higher.” And while the market can be unpredictable at best, $BTC’s latest rally to $112K is a definitive indicator that the institutional adoption of digital assets is positively impacting, and with signs of slowing. That means newer cryptos like $HYPER, $BEST, and $AP also have the potential to pump if current conditions continue. And the best part of investing in new tokens is getting in at an early-bird price. That said, nothing is guaranteed, and we’re not financial advisers. Be sure to always DYOR research before making any investment.

Title: The Persecution of Francesca Albanese. Chris Hedges

Time Published: 2025-07-10T14:06:33Z

When the history of the genocide in Gaza is written, one of the most courageous and outspoken champions for justice and the adherence to international law will be Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur, who today the Trump administration is sanctioning. Her office is tasked with monitoring and reporting on human rights violations that Israel commits against Palestinians. Albanese, who regularly receives death threats and endures well-orchestrated smear campaigns directed by Israel and its allies, valiantly seeks to hold those who support and sustain the genocide accountable. She lambasts what she calls “the moral and political corruption of the world” that allows the genocide to continue. Her office has issued detailed reports documenting war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, one of which, called “Genocide as colonial erasure,” I have reprinted as an appendix in my latest book, “A Genocide Foretold.” She has informed private organizations that they are “criminally liable” for assisting Israel in carrying out the genocide in Gaza. She announced that if true, as has been reported, that the former British prime minister David Cameron threatened to defund and withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) after it issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, which Cameron and the other former British prime minister Rishi Sunak could be charged with a criminal offense for, under the Rome Statue. The Rome Statue criminalizes those who seek to prevent war crimes from being prosecuted. She has called on top European Union (EU) officials to face charges of complicity of war crimes over their support for the genocide, saying that their actions cannot be met with impunity. She was a champion of the Madleen flotilla that sought to break the blockade of Gaza and deliver humanitarian aid, writing that the boat which was intercepted by Israel, was carrying not only supplies, but a message of humanity. You can see the interview I did with Albanese here or watch below. Her latest report lists 48 corporations and institutions, including Palantir Technologies Inc., Lockheed Martin, Alphabet Inc. (Google), Amazon, International Business Machine Corporation (IBM), Caterpillar Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), along with banks and financial firms such as BlackRock, insurers, real estate firms and charities, which in violation of international law, are making billions from the occupation and the genocide of Palestinians. You can read my article on Albanese’s most recent report here. Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned her support for the ICC, four of whose judges have been sanctioned by the U.S. for issuing arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant last year. He criticized Albanese for her efforts to prosecute American or Israeli nationals who sustain the genocide, saying she is unfit for service as a special rapporteur. Rubio also accused Albanese of having “spewed unabashed antisemitism, expressed support for terrorism, and open contempt for the United States, Israel, and the West.” The sanctions will most likely prevent Albanese from travelling to the U.S. and will freeze any assets she may have in the country. The attack against Albanese presages a world without rules, one where rogue states, such as the U.S. and Israel, are permitted to carry out war crimes and genocide without any accountability or restraint. It exposes the subterfuges we use to fool ourselves and attempt to fool others. It reveals our hypocrisy, cruelty and racism. No one, from now on, will take seriously our stated commitments to democracy, freedom of expression, the rule of law or human rights. And who can blame them? We speak exclusively in the language of force, the language of brutes, the language of mass slaughter, the language of genocide. “The acts of killing, the mass killing, the infliction of psychological and physical torture, the devastation, the creation of conditions of life that would not allow the people in Gaza to live, from the destruction of hospitals, the mass forced displacement and the mass homelessness, while people were being bombed daily, and the starvation — how can we read these acts in isolation?” Albanese asked in an interview I did with her when we discussed her report, “Genocide as colonial erasure.” The militarized drones, helicopter gunships, walls and barriers, checkpoints, coils of concertina wire, watchtowers, detention centers, deportations, brutality and torture, denial of entry visas, apartheidesque existence that comes with being undocumented, loss of individual rights and electronic surveillance, are as familiar to desperate migrants along the Mexican border, or attempting to enter Europe, as they are to Palestinians. This is what awaits those who Frantz Fanon calls “the wretched of the earth.” Those that defend the oppressed, such as Albanese, will be treated like the oppressed. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: $21M Flows Into First US Solana ETF as Snorter Token Approaches $1.7M Milestone
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/21m-flows-into-us-solana-etf-snorter-token-spikes/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T13:51:16Z
Full Content:
On July 8, the first US-listed spot Solana ETF – Rex-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK) – recorded $21M in net inflows. Impressively, this pushed its total inflows to a hefty $41.2M in the first four days of launching. That single-day surge surpassed the $2.02M raised in the previous three trading sessions, effectively more than doubling the total inflows into the ETF. This is fantastic news for Solana. SSK’s ability to attract more users and capital significantly boosts the network’s visibility, liquidity, and overall credibility, positioning it for even greater success moving forward. As such, it’s highly bullish for Solana-based projects, like Snorter Token ($SNORT). Already, it has nearly raised $1.7M owing to being the backbone of a novel Telegram trading bot slated to launch in Q3 2025. Still, SSK’s footprint remains relatively small compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Despite doubling on July 8, the $41.2M in inflows represents just 0.5% of Solana’s market cap, far below Bitcoin’s 0.34% and Ethereum’s 0.3% penetration rates during their ETF launches. This gap primarily stems from SSK’s structure. Around 40% of its assets are tied to offshore Solana ETFs, whereas the rest is directly invested in $SOL. The SSK ETF’s impressive doubling highlights the growing early institutional interest in Solana. Should the SEC approve pending Solana ETF applications from Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and Grayscale, it could trigger a fresh wave of capital into the network. As demand for the blockchain continues to rise, Solana-based projects like $SNORT are poised to benefit from the increased activity. Now could be the perfect time to explore these low-cap opportunities before they gain significant traction. $SNORT is the backbone of Snorter Bot, a crypto trading bot currently under development. Built directly on Telegram, it promises to make trading the best meme coins faster, safer, and easier. The bot will enable you to manage every part of your trading strategy from the fourth-largest messaging app worldwide: spot new tokens, snipe launches, place trades, and set stop losses. All will be achieved without compromising security. Snorter Bot will include real-time honeypot detection, rug pull alerts, and MEV protection. By doing so, it’ll shield you from malicious tokens and front-running attacks so that you don’t get caught off guard. Given that $2.2B in crypto was stolen last year, protective trading platforms like Snorter Bot have never been more necessary. It’ll initially go live on Solana to take advantage of the network’s low fees and high-speed transactions. After that, it’ll expand to EVM-compatible chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. Beyond granting reduced fees, $SNORT also unlocks governance rights (anticipated around Q4 2025), additional premium features, and high-yield staking rewards, currently offering a 218% APY, which is not to be overlooked. In fact, there’s no better time to lock up some $SNORT. As more investors join the project, this percentage is likely to decrease, resulting in higher returns while also enhancing the ecosystem’s sustainability. It’s no wonder $SNORT has quickly raised $1.6M+ on presale in just a few months and shows no signs of slowing down. Solana’s recent ETF inflows are a clear sign of growing institutional interest, signaling a strong upward trend for the network. With the potential approval of more ETF applications by the SEC, even greater capital could flow into the blockchain. This bodes well for Solana-based projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT), which stand to benefit from the increased activity and investment. You can buy $SNORT on presale for as low as $0.0977 to get the most out of the Snorter ecosystem. Once listed on the best crypto exchanges, as promised around the end of the year, it’s projected to hit $0.94. Thereby, there’s no better time to join for potential 861% gains.

Pentagon investment in MP Materials is making headlines after the U.S. Defense Department announced a $400 million stake in the rare earth mining company. With this deal, the Pentagon becomes MP Materials' largest shareholder—fueling a major push to reduce America’s reliance on China for rare earths. The investment will fund expansion at the Mountain Pass mine and a new magnet factory set to launch by 2028. As MP Materials shares soared 60%, this move highlights a critical shift in U.S. strategy to secure rare earth supply for defense, technology, and clean energy needs. Big changes are coming to this essential industry. (Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Title: The SEC Is Crashing the Digital Stocks Party

For years, the promise of blockchain technology has captivated the financial world, hinting at a future where traditional assets are transformed into nimble, digital “tokens.” This vision, as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester Peirce puts it, is “enchanting, but not magical.” SheÂ just sent a clear message to anyone hoping blockchain would free them from financial regulation: not so fast. Commissioner Peirce acknowledged the promise of tokenization, the process of turning real-world assets like stocks into blockchain-based digital tokens. But she warned that, no matter how futuristic it sounds, the same old rules still apply. âTokenized securities are still securities,â Peirce said in a statement. âThe same legal requirements apply to on- and off-chain versions of these instruments.â Her statement comes amid a frenzy of experimentation in tokenized finance. Firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase, and Robinhood Markets are exploring how to tokenize everything from stocks and treasuries to real estate and private credit. The hype is real: blockchain-based markets promise 24/7 trading, faster settlement, better transparency, and a radically cheaper financial system. But the SEC is reminding everyone that innovation doesnât mean exemption. If youâre creating or selling tokenized securities, even if you’re just wrapping real assets in a digital shell, youâre still subject to decades-old laws governing how financial instruments are issued, traded, and disclosed. The goal of federal securities laws is to protect investors and ensure fair, orderly markets. The End of the Stock Market As We Know It Tokenization refers to the creation of digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership of real-world assets. These can be as simple as company shares or as complex as bundles of loans. Think of it as taking something traditionalâlike a Tesla stockâand putting it into a blockchain wallet so it can be traded like cryptocurrency. But not all tokens are created equal. Some are issued directly by the company (like a tokenized share of a public company), while others are created by third parties who hold the real assets and issue their own tokenized version. According to Peirce, those third-party tokens carry âunique risks,â especially for retail investors who may not actually own the underlying asset. âA token could be a âreceipt for a security,â which is itself a security but is distinct from the underlying security,â Peirce explained. Or worse, it could qualify as a âsecurity-based swap,â whichÂ are typically used by sophisticated investors and are heavily regulated, often restricted from being traded by everyday people (“retail persons”) off of regulated exchanges. If a token falls into this category, it could face severe trading restrictions. Tokenization could reshape how regular people invest, borrow, and access wealth. But it also raises serious questions: Who actually owns these tokenized assets? What happens when a crypto firm collapses or loses customer funds? And what protections do Main Street investors have? Tokenization could make markets faster and more accessible, even allowing people to own fractions of stocks and assets. But Peirceâs statement throws cold water on the idea that blockchain makes all that risk-free. The SECâs message is that innovation must come with compliance. Peirce, one of the more crypto-friendly voices at the agency, still made it clear: âThe process of issuing an instrument representing a security is not new.â Whether it lives on-chain or off-chain, itâs still under the SECâs jurisdiction. Peirce encouraged firms to engage with the SEC early and often if they want to build tokenized products legally. She also hinted that the agency is open to modernizing outdated rules or creating exemptions, but only if firms play by the rules. For now, the crypto and finance industries have been put on notice. Tokenized finance isnât a legal gray zone. Itâs Wall Street on-chain. The message is clear: the future of finance will be built on innovation, but also on accountability.

Title: Former Irish swimming coach George Gibney agrees to extradition from US to face 79 charges for sexual offences

LAST UPDATE | 10 Jul FORMER IRISH OLYMPIC swimming coach George Gibney, who is facing up to 79 charges, including attempted rape, relating to the alleged sexual abuse of four girls in Ireland, has agreed to be extradited from the US to Dublin. Gibney, who was arrested in Florida last week, has withdrawn his application to contest his extradition ahead of a court appearance tomorrow, according to court documents seen by The Journal. The 77-year-old was living in the US for 30 years and was wanted for 79 alleged sexual assault offences, 78 for indecent assault and one for attempted rape, against four girls between 1 January 1971 and 14 August 1974. Gibney was the founder of the Trojan Swimming Club in Blackrock in Dublin, where he also worked as a coach. He was also the Irish national swimming coach until 1991. He was previously charged with 27 sexual offences in 1993, which were dropped in 1994 after Gibney secured a High Court injunction which prevented the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from prosecuting him. Gibney then left Ireland for Scotland, where he continued to work as a swimming coach. He has lived in the United States since 1995. In 1997, a Garda investigation into Gibney was opened after fresh allegations were made against him. Advertisement A specialist unit within the Garda National Protective Services Bureau launched a detailed inquiry after a garda probe was reopened in 2020 when several people made allegations on a BBC and Second Captains podcast titled ‘Where is George Gibney?’. After a three-year investigation, a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who recommended charging Gibney. Court documents relating to the case, lodged last week, refer to the podcast series extensively. The podcast series centred on the survivors of sexual abuse by the accused. A number of alleged victims emerged after an appeal was issued for people with any information to come forward. He was arrested in Florida last week, where he has been living for nearly three decades, on foot of an international warrant which was issued by Irish authorities. It is understood that Irish and US law enforcement had prepared for the arrest for over a week. Gibney appeared before Orlando District Court Judge Daniel Irick for 11 minutes last week. He was remanded in the custody of US Marshals to appear before the same judge tomorrow for a detention hearing. Court documents filed ahead of the hearing yesterday, which have been seen by The Journal, state that Gibney withdrew his application to contest the extradition and agreed to being extradited to Ireland after being advised of his rights earlier this week.

Bitcoin has topped its previous all-time high, climbing above $112,000 per bitcoin as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk confirms wild bitcoin rumors. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has surged over the last year, climbing thanks to a perfect storm of U.S. president Donald Trump’s embrace of crypto and Wall Street piling into bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—with a “huge” BlackRock ETF bombshell suddenly appearing on the horizon. Now, as traders eye “trillions and trillions” of dollars that some think could be about to flow into bitcoin and crypto, a closely-watched Wall Street analyst has predicted the “floodgates” are about to open for crypto ETFs.

More predicting the bitcoin rally could be just getting started. The bitcoin and crypto ETF landscape is braced for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve multiple spot cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds and create a "framework" that would make the approval process for future crypto ETF applications much quicker, according to a report by The Block that cited an anonymous source. "Then we will see the floodgates open on these other assets, but that’s what I’m waiting for," Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart said on an X Spaces broadcast, adding he expects a draft of the framework could emerge as soon as this month, with implementation possible by September or October. The SEC, which has pivoted from being hostile to bitcoin and crypto under the Biden administration to pro-crypto under Trump, has issued new guidance this month on disclosure requirements for exchange-traded products tied to cryptocurrencies, described by Reuters as “the first step toward approval of dozens of applications for ETFs linked to everything from solana and XRP to president Donald Trump’s eponymous meme coin.” "The SEC is moving forward on creating a framework for how they’d like to see all these crypto assets included in investment funds" to address the "explosion" in the number of ETFs now awaiting a regulatory verdict, Sui Chung, chief executive of crypto index provider CF Benchmarks, told the newswire.

BlackRock’s fund alone holds around 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $77 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network.

Title: Ethereum outshines Bitcoin, but ETH’s ATH still out of reach – Why?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-outshines-bitcoin-but-eths-ath-still-out-of-reach-why/
Time Published: 2025-07-10T09:00:55Z
Full Content:
Ethereum is spinning up like a quiet tornado, but still waiting to break free. Zooming in, Ethereum [ETH] seems to be charting its bull path as risk appetite returns. It’s up nearly 30% in under three weeks, about 3x Bitcoin’s [BTC] gains over the same period. The ETH/BTC pair echoes this rotation with a 20% surge, amplified by Bit Digital’s move to swap 280 BTC for ETH, signaling growing investor conviction. Altogether, Ethereum’s Q3 is off to a strong start, echoing its Q2 trend where it outperformed Bitcoin by 1.2x. And yet, the price still hasn’t fully priced in this momentum shift, even as Bitcoin enters price discovery. Ethereum’s market dominance is edging back toward the 10% mark, placing its valuation around $347 billion. Still, it remains a distant second to Bitcoin’s commanding 60%+ market share. The divergence isn’t random. Since breaking into six figures, Bitcoin has notched three fresh all-time highs, the latest peaking at $111,936 on the 9th of July. In contrast, Ethereum hasn’t posted a $3k close in over five months, still trading 43% below its 2021 ATH of $4,891. And despite recent strength, the ETH/BTC ratio remains heavily suppressed, having yet to recover even 50% from its five-year low of 0.018 posted in early Q2. Source: TradingView (ETH/BTC) Even so, Q2 felt like a shift. For the first time since the 2021 cycle, ETH outpaced BTC in quarterly performance. And this outperformance wasn’t a random bounce. Institutional allocation into Ethereum is hitting escape velocity. Five publicly visible treasury holders now control 240,000 ETH, Trump’s disclosed crypto portfolio is 95% ETH, and BlackRock now commands 42% of market share with $4.45 billion in ETH holdings. That’s a textbook setup for a supply-side squeeze. And yet, price action still lags, leaving the market to question whether Ethereum’s breakout is the beginning of its structural shift, or just another temporary blip in a Bitcoin-dominated cycle. Ethereum’s breakout case is building. Price has cleanly breached the $2,815 resistance, with momentum eyeing a test of $3,000. If the structure holds, upside continuation is in play. But the catch is, can ETH decouple if BTC slips? So far, evidence says no. Despite stronger fundamentals and ecosystem growth, ETH remains cycle-bound to Bitcoin. Even in May, while Etheruem consolidated and Bitcoin pulled back from all-time highs, ETH still underperformed sharply, dropping 24%, twice the drawdown of Bitcoin. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) Critics argue Ethereum faces an identity dilemma, torn between being a utility protocol or a growth asset, unlike Bitcoin’s clean monetary pitch. Since December, Ethereum has seen major protocol upgrades, yet on-chain demand remains flat. Unless ETH breaks this structural correlation with BTC, a new all-time high stays out of reach.
