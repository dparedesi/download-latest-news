The Spiritans have paid out €8.8 million to 125 abuse survivors, including former pupils of Blackrock College in Dublin and other schools run by the religious order. The figure includes €3.4 million paid in settlements to 52 abuse survivors who have come forward since RTÉ broadcast its Blackrock Boys radio documentary in November 2022. This figure does not include legal costs. The documentary involved interviews with David Ryan and his late brother Mark who were abused at Blackrock College and its preparatory school, Willow Park. A total of 58 people have made claims against the Spiritans since the documentary was broadcast, with 52 addressed to date. Between 1998 and November 2022 the congregation paid €5.4 million in settlements to 73 survivors. That figure also does not include legal fees. It involves litigation cases brought against the Spiritans’ Irish Province between 1998 and 2022, as well as a small number of actions from other jurisdictions, mainly in the United States and UK, which fall under the responsibility of the Irish Province. By November of last year, 359 survivors of abuse at Spiritan schools had come forward, including the 347 disclosed in the scoping inquiry report on abuse at private fee-paying schools published last September. A further 12 survivors came forward subsequently. The report disclosed allegations against 67 alleged abusers at Spiritan-run schools, including Blackrock College, St Mary’s College, St Michael’s College and Templeogue College in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. [ How religious orders are sitting on assets worth hundreds of millions of euroOpens in new window ] There were 130 allegations made against 24 alleged abusers at Willow Park and 55 allegations against 13 alleged abusers at Blackrock College. There were 60 allegations relating to 18 alleged abusers at Rockwell College, with 32 allegations against six alleged abusers at St Mary’s in Rathmines. There were 10 allegations against four alleged abusers at St Michael’s in Ballsbridge, and five allegations against two alleged abusers at Templeogue College. A further 37 allegations were made against Spiritans not connected to any school. Meanwhile, 171 survivors have, to date, engaged with the Spiritan restorative justice programme – a listening, support and healing process which includes counselling and face-to-face meetings with the Spiritan leadership team. Those incidents of sexual abuse by Spiritans were among 2,395 allegations at 308 schools run by the religious orders, as recorded in the scoping inquiry report. [ Commission of investigation into abuse in schools ‘a priority’ for new governmentOpens in new window ] Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Department of Education said “a high-level interdepartmental group” was “working intensively” in preparing terms of reference for the commission of investigation into schools, as recommended in the scoping inquiry report. The group includes “high-level representation from several Government departments” and was “working closely with the Office of the Attorney General and has sought expert advice where appropriate”. The spokesperson said the issues were “complex” but it was desirable the commission be “robust, and has the necessary powers to compel witnesses and documents, and so that it can complete its work in a reasonable time frame”. It is expected to report “shortly” to Minister for Education Helen McEntee. Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Why Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad Is Going Private

Read The Diplomat, Know The Asia-Pacific When is privatization not really privatization? Passengers walk through the departure hall at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, May 4, 2018. Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) is the holding company that operates most of the airports in Malaysia, including the country’s main entry point, Kuala Lumpur International Airport. MAHB has an interesting backstory because in 1999 it was listed on the Malaysian stock exchange. It was the first major airport operator in Southeast Asia to become a publicly listed company. Although shares were traded on the exchange, until 2023 more than 54 percent of MAHB was owned by three state-owned investment funds: Kazanah Nasional, the Employee Provident Fund, and KWAP, a pension fund for public employees. This is a common ownership structure in the region, where companies operating strategic national infrastructure like airports will be partially privatized so they can raise capital on financial markets. However, a controlling stake will often be retained by state-owned investment funds or in some cases directly by the government. It’s a classic example of a state capitalist political economy, because the state wants to tap capital markets to raise money, but without entirely turning critical national infrastructure over to private market forces. If an airport is run purely according to commercial concerns, for instance, with the goal of maximizing profits for shareholders, then other concerns such as economic development or national security may be sidelined. By listing a company on the stock exchange but retaining majority ownership, the state can have the best of both worlds. MAHB has been operated in this way for the last 25 years. But all of that is changing now, as the airport operator was delisted from the stock exchange at the end of February after a consortium of investors initiated a takeover at 11 ringgit per share. This gives the company a valuation of around 18 billion ringgit, or $4 billion. With MAHB now officially delisted, it means Southeast Asia’s first airport operator to have an IPO has been returned to private ownership. Except, is this really privatization? It’s being referred to as a private takeover. But the consortium that has taken over MAHB is comprised of three parties. The first is Global Infrastructure Partners, an American company owned by U.S. investment firm BlackRock. The other two partners in the consortium are Khazanah Nasional, one of Malaysia’s sovereign wealth funds, and the Employee Provident Fund (EPF), the largest state-run investment fund in Malaysia. They were already major shareholders in MAHB, but with the acquisition, Khazanah increases its holdings to 40 percent and the EPF to 30 percent. So, while it is true that members of the public can no longer freely buy and sell shares in MAHB on the stock exchange, two of its new private owners, who between them control 70 percent of the shares, are state-run investment funds. Another interesting question is why MAHB went private like this in the first place. This is a question many people have been asking because there were some odd things about the deal. For one, MAHB is not a poor-performing company. Unlike Ninoy Aquino International Airport in the Philippines, which was turned over to the private sector because of poor financial and operational performance, MAHB has recovered from the pandemic, is profitable, and is even paying regular dividends. So this is not a case where a struggling company needed to be bailed out by the efficiency of the private sector. The sale has also provoked questions about the valuation and process. The EPF sold a significant amount of its stock in MAHB in 2023 when the price was between 6.8 and 7.7 ringgit per share. Now they are buying those shares back and more, at a higher price of 11 ringgit per share. Moreover, some of MAHB’s independent directors initially recommended shareholders reject the offer because they felt the price was too low. The new owners were granted several extensions by regulators giving them more time to get shareholder approval. Looked at in this way, to me this seems less like privatization and more like the government actually wants to regain greater control over its national airports. State-run investment funds have increased their direct ownership in MAHB, in the case of EPF doing so even when it meant buying back in at a higher price. This fits with a larger pattern we are seeing in Malaysia, where state-run investment funds are being leveraged to play a more active role in economic development. And although they’ve done it using the rhetoric of privatization, the lines between public interest and private ownership in this deal are actually somewhat blurred.

Title: ‘At least 7 in 10′ house buyers get gifts from parents, often six-figure sums

The bank of mum and dad is having a moment. Yes, it may have been around for years but, increasingly, wealthy boomers and Gen Xers are cited as playing an ever-more important role in determining the financial outlook of their children. This is creating a greater divide between those whose parents have and those who do not. This month, New York magazine examined how parents are “slowly transferring trillions of dollars to their New York city children”, while the Financial Times recently likened the situation to the old TV drama, Upstairs Downstairs about the upper classes and their servants in early 20th-century England. In this case, the “upstairs” people are those who can afford to own a home with more than one storey, and the “downstairs” people are stuck renting a flat. Just last week, UK building society Skipton Group published a survey showing that just one in 10 potential first-time buyers can afford to get on the property ladder without relying on their family for financial help. Here in Ireland, the gap between the upstairs and downstairs looks to be widening all the time. New estimates point to more than half a billion euro worth of gifts pouring into the Irish property market each year. All of which makes an already pricey property market even more expensive. “Parents’ gifts are making the difference ... no one can deny it’s a contributory factor to house price inflation,” says Michael Dowling, managing director of Dowling Financial mortgage brokers in Dublin. Just before we speak, Dowling says, he was working with a couple on a house application who are bringing a sizeable sum to the table – a gift of some €117,000. It’s not the typical gift – Dowling puts this at about €50,000-€60,000 – but it’s not that unusual either. “I would say that it [giving gifts] has become particularly noticeable over the past five years, it’s now quite significant,” he says, adding that in his experience in the Dublin market, “at least seven out of 10 [purchasers] are now getting gifts”. With stock in short supply, that creates an unequal playing field, as those with the benefit of family gifts chase the same property as those without those benefits. Martina Hennessy, chief executive of mortgage broker Doddl.ie, says that gifts are prevalent today, with a third of its clients receiving gifts when buying a home. Almost 85 per cent of those who got a gift were under the €100,000 threshold in her experience, with an average gift of €27,000. But that means 15 per cent received a gift that was in excess of €100,000 – and, among this cohort, the average gift was a staggering €198,000. Brian Dempsey, a partner in DNG Stillorgan, says a gift from the bank of mum and dad now “plays a pivotal part in buying a home in today’s market”. “Gifts used to be worth about €10,000-€15,000, but they are considerably more now, I’d say,” he says, adding that these gifts, and the added flexibility it offers house purchasers when making offers, can make or break a house purchase when you have multiple people bidding on it. Official statistics are difficult to come by. Back in 2021, Banking and Payments Federation Ireland (BPFI) collated figures (the last time it has done so) showing that first-time buyers got financial help from family of some €149 million in the first six months of that year, and those trading up got nearly €60.5 million. On an annual basis, this meant about €420 million in gifts a year. Fast forward some four years and industry experts say the scale of gifts must now be well in excess of half a billion. It’s clear that those who have are looking to give. “Gifts bridge the gap on affordability as many parents who have the means to do so provide gifts now as opposed to future inheritance,” says Hennessy. There is some €155 billion currently languishing on deposit in Ireland and falling rates of return on such deposits may encourage those who have the financial resources to gift now, when it can make a bigger impact on a child’s life, rather than waiting until death. After all, baby boomers and many in Generation X have themselves benefited from a sharp increase in house prices. Ultimately this inheritocracy is having a direct impact on rising inequality in terms of access to the housing market Back in 1982, for example, you could buy a five-bed detached house at Grove Lawn in Blackrock for £79,000: that house would now likely sell for more than €1 million. Of course inflation does account for some of this gain – £100,000 back in 1982 would be worth €301,785 today according to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) – but there is still a significant gain made on that property. And many such homeowners also finished paying their mortgage quite some time ago. CSO figures show that some 680,000 homes in Ireland were owned without a mortgage in Census 2022. No surprise then that all this gifted money flowing into the property market is contributing to higher house prices. At a simple level, higher house prices mean higher deposits. Figures from the CSO show that, in the year to November 2024, house prices rose by 9.4 per cent nationally. This put the median price across the State at €350,000, and €470,000 in Dublin. Just two years earlier, in November 2022, the median national price was just €299,500. And thanks to gifts, home buyers don’t always have to stretch themselves when it comes to borrowing. Figures from the Central Bank show that home buyers now typically buy a home with a significantly higher down payment. The average loan to value on a first-time buyer loan in the first quarter of last year was less than 80 per cent, indicating a typical 20 per cent deposit. And it was even less for second-time buyers, at just 66 per cent, reflecting a typical down payment of some 34 per cent. With a median house price of about €655,000 in Dún Laoghaire, south Dublin, this would suggest a deposit of some €131,000 for a first-time buyer, or €222,000 for a trader upper. Saving that sort of money is hard when rents are at record highs; the average rent for a new tenancy nationally stood at €1,612 per month in the first quarter of last year, and €2,128 in Dublin. But the level of gifting means that some first-time buyers are now skipping the typical starter home stage and going straight for the if not quite forever home, then a home for the longer term. So they don’t borrow less; they just use the gift to buy a more expensive property. “It can be the difference between living in one part of Dublin compared to another,” adds Dowling, “or buying a three-bed rather than a two-bed, or one that’s in better condition and doesn’t need renovations”. The scale of gift-giving is now such that many parents can feel an obligation to help their children get on the property ladder – even if they can’t really afford it. “Absolutely, there is an expectation that they’re going to get a gift,” says Dowling. “When we meet couples, they now say ‘and we’ll be getting a gift’ as part of the process.” This can put parents under financial pressure at a time when they may need the funds themselves for their own retirement. “Gifts are now so prevalent and so large that people need to be careful,” says Dowling. Dempsey agrees that there is a pressure, which means that some parents can end up giving more than they had intended. “I bet you that gift amounts change,” he says, adding that some parents may commit to a gift of €20,000, but end up having to hand over €50,000 to get their children on the ladder. Another issue can arise when couples may not have any legal arrangement for buying a home. “When a couple isn’t married, there is often a reluctance from one set of parents to giving a gift,” says Dowling. After all, if the relationship breaks down, and the home is sold, it can be difficult to recoup the money given as a gift, as it’s likely it will depend on the party who didn’t receive the gift to “do the right thing” and give it back. “In an ideal world, they would both bring the same gift,” says Dowling, “but in reality it’s not the case”. Other times couples will come to Dowling and say: “We’ll sign the papers to say it’s a gift, but on the side, we have a loan agreement.” In some instances, Dowling says, this is because parents want to protect their interests – even if it doesn’t really stack up as such. Other times, people might be looking to get around the tax-free threshold on inheritance tax by passing the money off as a loan rather than a gift. However, it should be noted that Revenue has firm guidelines on such loans – and signing a legal document to say the money is a gift may preclude then being seen as a loan down the line. Better to try to use the small gift exemption – which could see the parents of a couple contribute tax-free savings of some €12,000 a year. Ultimately this inheritocracy is having a direct impact on rising inequality in terms of access to the housing market. Government supports, such as Help to Buy, which offers a tax rebate of as much as €30,000 on a new home purchase of up to €500,000, can help closing the affordability gap on a deposit. But with new house supply lower than expected, finding a home that meets the criteria isn’t always that easy; a quick search on myhome.ie for example, shows that there are just five new developments for sale at prices of lower than €500,000 in Dublin. This makes it more difficult for the have-nots to get on the housing ladder. “That social divide is going to continue,” says Dowling. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

In an otherwise empty restaurant, being expected to sit on top of the only other customers is always a pain, says our critic Neapolitan margherita verace pizza. Photo: Lucinda O'Sullivan What should have been a pleasant Sunday afternoon lunch at a new Italian pizza and pasta bar, instead turned out to be something of an endurance test. Un’ Altra Pasta Bar opened recently opposite Blackrock Library, in a premises with which I’m quite familiar having previously been Clarets in the 1990s, Dali’s in the 00s, and more recently the sadly missed Coal. The layout hasn’t changed much through the years. With a small bar to the right and a large newly-added pizza oven area to the left, there are three or four tight tables in front, and a prized alcove table to the side before you reach the main dining area in the rear.

During a closed-door meeting with the SEC’s new crypto task force on Friday, representatives of several digital assets-involved firms—including Coinbase, Andreessen Horowitz, and the financial services giant Fidelity—pressed the regulator to overhaul its ETF policies, according to publicly filed meeting notes. The companies, all members of the Crypto Council for Innovation, an industry lobbying group, have asked the SEC to expand its current ETF-related standards. At the moment, only crypto assets traded in markets regulated by the SEC or CFTC—such as Bitcoin and Ethereum—are eligible to be traded on Wall Street via ETFs. But should the powerful firms that met with the SEC last week get their wish, that could soon change. Those companies have now asked the agency to expand the concept of a regulated market to include a “range of existing crypto trading platforms.” That minor shift in language could have seismic implications. Effectively, crypto and Wall Street’s top players are now asking for any crypto asset traded on, say, Coinbase, to be automatically fast-tracked for ETF approval. That’s a much, much lower bar than the one currently governing the ETF market. If Coinbase and Fidelity get their way, then you could soon see not only spot Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs proliferating on Wall Street—as we've seen pile up in recent months—but Peanut the Squirrel and Gigachad-related products, too. The memo submitted Friday on the subject acknowledged that such a change could usher in “a new wave” of crypto ETFs for retail traders. It would also, effectively, integrate the volatile meme coin sector with the traditional American economy. On Friday, the Crypto Council for Innovation further requested that the SEC allow ETF issuers to directly purchase and sell crypto, participate in staking digital assets, and earn staking rewards. Currently, crypto ETF issuers like Fidelity and BlackRock do not custody the BTC and ETH tied to their products, nor do they generate valuable yield from staking that ETH. A day prior to the Crypto Council for Innovation’s meeting with the SEC, Fidelity also met one-on-one with the agency’s crypto task force. During that conversation, the two parties reportedly discussed standardizing rules for listing crypto ETFs, and clarity surrounding the ability for ETF issuers to collect staking rewards. At Friday’s larger meeting, the companies present made several additional requests, including that the SEC should declare crypto products like stablecoins and NFTs to not be securities, and crypto offerings like airdrops to be outside the agency’s purview.

Title: Germany’s Newly-Elected Conservative Party Would Rather Side With Socialists Than Other Right-Wingers

After Germany’s conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) won a plurality of seats in federal elections Sunday, party leader Friedrich Merz said he will pursue a governing coalition with the country’s socialist party rather than its right-wing populist party. CDU achieved a comfortable 208 plurality in the Bundestag elections, short of the 316-seat absolute majority necessary to secure Merz’s chancellorship — meaning the party must form a coalition with another party before Merz can govern. At a celebration at the party’s headquarters Monday, the CDU leader confirmed he will pursue that coalition with the leftist Social Democratic Party (SPD), which came in third place at 120 seats — and not with the AfD, which came in second at an unprecedented 152 seats, more than doubling its presence since Germany’s 2021 election. (RELATED: EU Regulators Attacking X Because Of Elon Musk’s Political Positions) “We have received a clear governing mandate, and we accept it,” Merz, speaking German, said. “Looking at the Bundestag seat distribution, we are in a position to form a black-red coalition — and that is precisely what we intend to do.” This black-red coalition, better known as the “grand coalition,” is common in German parliamentary politics, with Angela Merkel notably ruling the country with this model when she was chancellor. Pressekonferenz im Konrad-Adenauer-Haus https://t.co/5QDpJGhZQh — Friedrich Merz (@_FriedrichMerz) February 24, 2025 Emphasizing the urgency of forming the coalition, Merz said he plans to meet with SPD leaders, including outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, to negotiate the coalition in the coming days. He added he is hopeful to form the government by Easter. The emerging CDU-SPD alliance, and its exclusion of the AfD, was expected — virtually the entire German political establishment has maligned the AfD as a dangerously radical organization since its founding in 2013, with the German state even classifying the party as a “suspected case of right-wing extremism” in 2022. The government uses this designation to justify its ongoing surveillance of party members and their private correspondences, a practice German federal courts have repeatedly confirmed as constitutional. Merz is a proponent of the “firewall against the far right” strategy in German politics, a practice among mainstream parties that views any cooperation with the AfD as a grave moral failing. He has routinely characterized the party as a successor to the Nazis, calling the AfD “openly National Socialist” in a 2018 interview with WDR 5, a German public radio station. “The regional associations, especially in the east, are receiving a crystal clear message from us: If any of us raise our hand to work with the AfD, then there will be a party expulsion process the next day,” he said in a statement shortly before becoming CDU leader in 2022. He reiterated this position in a January interview with Tagesthemen, a German television station, saying he “ties [his] destiny as party chairman” to preventing cooperation with the AfD. AfD leaders reject comparisons to the Nazi Party, with former party leader Alexander Gauland calling the Nazi era a “speck of bird poop in more than 1,000 years of successful German history” during a 2018 speech — a stance meant to reject what they see as excessive historical guilt. Though it initially focused on Euroskepticism, the AfD has since shifted to emphasize a mix of populist and nationalist positions, primarily opposition to immigration from Muslim-majority countries, which it frames as an existential threat to German culture and security. It calls for stricter border controls, immediate deportation of rejected asylum seekers and, most controversially, a policy of “remigration” — a term the European right uses to advocate for the mass deportation of immigrants and even some naturalized citizens deemed insufficiently assimilated. The AfD’s friendlier disposition towards Russia, its opposition to military aid for Ukraine and its calls to revive the Nord Stream II pipeline are also major points of contention for more established German parties. “We must now carry out large-scale repatriations, and if it is to be called ‘remigration,’ then so be it,” AfD leader Alice Weidel said at a campaign event in January. The AfD’s stances on immigration first gained traction after the 2015 refugee crisis, when Germany accepted over a million migrants under Merkel’s leadership. The foreign-born population has been on a consistent upward trajectory since that year, nearly doubling over this period to a record-high of 19.6% — over 16.5 million — according to German census data. Merz campaigned on a pro-NATO, pro-European Union (EU) platform, primarily advocating German independence from the United States by easing taboos against nuclear power, which he says increases Germany’s reliance on Russian and American energy — breaking from the Green Party, which largely closed Germany’s nuclear plants. He also aims to increase defense spending amid strained relations with President Donald Trump, who many see as offering Russia favorable terms in Ukraine peace talks. (RELATED: Germany Will Shut Down Its Last Nuclear Plants Amid Warnings Of New Energy Crisis) “My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” Merz said in a post-election debate Sunday. “I never thought I would have to say something like this on a television program — but after Donald Trump’s statements last week at the latest, it is clear that the Americans, at least this part of the Americans, this administration, are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.” The chancellor-in-waiting increased anti-immigration rhetoric after recent migrant-perpetrated violent attacks — including a January knife assault in Aschaffenburg that killed a toddler and a man — amid political pressure from the AfD, though Merz stopped short of endorsing remigration. Crime statistics show over 40% of crime suspects in Germany were foreign-born in 2023, according to Tagesthemen. U.S.-German relations have deteriorated since President Trump took office, particularly after his allies’ incursions into German politics. Vice President JD Vance criticized Germany’s online speech policing as “Orwellian” during a Munich Security Conference speech on Feb. 14. German leaders have also condemned Elon Musk’s endorsement of the AfD, which he called “the only hope for Germany.” 🇩🇪 AfD is the only hope for Germany 🇩🇪 https://t.co/CE9uXe8ULm — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 13, 2025 Merz’s political career began after his election to the European Parliament in 1989, later transitioning to serve as a representative in the Bundestag, Germany’s lower chamber of parliament in 1994, where he served until being named CDU leader in 2021. He previously chaired the German branch of BlackRock, an American asset management firm accused of contributing to rising single-family home prices in the United States. Merz, who owns two private jets, described himself as “upper middle class” in a 2018 interview with Bild, a German tabloid. He added in his victory speech Monday that Merkel, the previous CDU chancellor and Merz’s longtime political rival, had yet to congratulate him on his electoral plurality. There remains no indication that Merz — or any major party leader in Germany — will loosen his “firewall” policy against the AfD, despite its surge in support Sunday.

ORANGE, CA — A new episode of HGTV's House Hunters was derailed yesterday after BlackRock quickly purchased all three of the potential properties. In a first for the fan-favorite show, the prospective homebuyers were left without any options at the end of the episode, as the global investment firm swept in to snap up all three houses to add to its growing U.S. real estate portfolio. "Oh no!" said the host to the prospective homebuyers. "It looks like these homes are no longer available. In fact, it seems there are now no longer any homes available in this neighborhood and you can no longer afford to live here. Too bad!" "It's probably something we're going to have to deal with from now on," said House Hunters producer Jennifer Davis. "We were getting ready to present our featured couple with their three options, but at the last moment, we were notified that BlackRock had purchased all three properties and would never allow them to hit the market again. The buyers were disappointed, but there's nothing anyone can do about it." The episode's featured homebuyers, Gavin and Emily Harmon, were taken by surprise when they were told they were left with no options. "We definitely had the impression we were going to, you know, get a house," Emily said. "With the title of the show being House Hunters and all, it was surprising to find out that all of the houses we looked at were absorbed by a shadowy corporation intent on dominating the global real estate market and destroying the dream of home ownership. Oh well. I guess we'll keep looking tomorrow." At publishing time, HGTV announced that the show would be rebranded as House Renters starting next season.

Title: Apple braces for DEI showdown at annual shareholder meeting

Apple is set to face a showdown with shareholders this week as it prepares to defend its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies against critical opponents in its investor base. The iPhone maker is scheduled to meet investors Tuesday at its annual shareholder meeting, where a vote is expected on a motion put forward by the National Center for Public Policy Research to cease DEI efforts. The organization, a conservative think tank in Washington, DC, argued that US Supreme Court cases had called into question the legality of corporate DEI programs, putting employers at risk of discrimination claims. Apple, the world's most valuable company, said in a filing that it would oppose the proposal because it "inappropriately attempts" to restrict how the company manages its operations. It comes at a time when its Big Tech counterparts have been rolling back DEI initiatives. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announced it would cut its DEI programs. The company told employees that the "legal and policy landscape" around DEI efforts in the US was changing. Other companies that have rolled back programs include Google, which said this month that it would no longer pursue hiring goals based on DEI, and Amazon, which has changed references about DEI benefits on some of its websites. Though some companies began shifting focus away from DEI before the election, several tech leaders have recently reacted to President Donald Trump's deeming DEI efforts "wasteful." Apple's decision to stand by its DEI policies could weigh on its relationship with the president. CEO Tim Cook has tried to build a good rapport with Trump, visiting his Mar-a-Lago resort in December. On Monday, Apple announced a plan to hire about 20,000 people over the next four years as part of a commitment to invest more than $500 billion in US projects. Apple is a rare holdout among tech firms stepping back from DEI initiatives. Large shareholders in its investor base, such as BlackRock, have kept a distance from activist campaigns. Shareholder proposals don't always end up on a company's ballot. A review by the consultancy ISS-Corporate found that proposals against ESG policies, including those against DEI, that came to a vote had garnered little support in the past three years. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Jump to

Title: Where Germany Goes From Here

Time Published: 2025-02-24T13:00:16Z

It is salutary to remember that the man set to take over Germany has not had any role in government. Friedrich Merz, whose Christian Democrats won a comfortable if unconvincing victory in Sunday’s elections, will form a government at a time of tumult on multiple fronts. He faces an economy reeling from a decade of under-investment and entering its third year of recession, an immigration crisis exacerbated by a series of lone terror attacks, and the ever-growing popularity of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Most of all it is facing the unprecedented collapse of relations with the U.S., on whom Germans have relied on for security since the end of World War Two. Read More: Exclusive: Alice Weidel on Her Far-Right AfD Party’s Rise, Elon Musk’s Support, and the German Election Merz would see himself as a classic Conservative of the old school, somewhere perhaps between Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, a believer in traditional social values and the established security and political architecture of the postwar era that has bound Germans into the Transatlantic alliance. When Donald Trump was re-elected U.S. President in November, Merz was confident he could do business with him—two fist-pumping men who wanted to slash bureaucracy, cut taxes, and wage war on “woke.” Yet the confrontational approach of Trump’s lieutenants at the recent Munich Security Conference—in which they lauded praise on the AfD—has changed that. The 69-year-old Merz—a man who has interspersed politics with boardroom life as Chairman of the German arm of Blackrock, the investment house—is keen not to waste time. As he made clear during his victory speech, “the world isn’t waiting for us.” Germany, he added, could not spend months haggling over the finer points of a coalition agreement while Ukraine’s fate is decided by Trump and the man whom they feel has captured him, Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Kaja Kallas, the E.U.’s chief diplomat, reiterated that point, expressing the hope that a new government is formed “as quickly as possible, as we really need to move on with decisions at the European level which requires German participation.” With Emmanuel Macron in Washington today, and Keir Starmer following on Thursday, Europe is seeking to persuade Trump to step back from his seeming endorsement of Putin’s Ukraine position. Both the French and British leaders have been coordinating their positions, stressing the need for quiet diplomacy. But within hours of securing his election victory, Merz appeared to take a more confrontational approach toward the White House. “My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,” Merz said Sunday, before even the final election tally came in. Some wondered whether this might be another example of an impetuousness that is seen, even by his confidants, as a weak spot in Merz’s character. Yet he doubled down on his position the following morning: “Now more than ever, we must put Ukraine in a position of strength. For a just peace, the attacked country must be part of peace negotiations.” For such talk to have substance, Merz will have to show that he is prepared to borrow more to ramp up Germany’s defense budget. A decade after NATO members agreed to devote a minimum of 2% of GDP for military spending, Germany only reached that target in 2024. In order to increase it to 2.5%, let alone a new 3% target, will cost tens of billions. For that, the incoming government will have to reform its so-called “debt brake” that places stringent limits on public debt. It seems that Merz is prepared to do that, with the support of the center-left Social Democrats. The outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s SPD suffered a humiliating result, falling into third place to a historic low. They are now expected to play a junior role in a center-right administration. Yet some of Merz’s agenda will be hard for it to accede to, particularly elements of his economic reform package such as welfare cuts and tax breaks, and his plans to crack down hard on illegal migration. In one respect, the row with Trump makes Merz’s task harder; it is a warning to mainstream on the politicians on both the left and right of what may follow if they fail to form a durable coalition. Encouraged by its best-ever result, with 20% of the vote, and boosted by the boisterous support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump Administration, the AfD is waiting in the wings. It is preparing a second front of attack the moment the new government faces its next crisis. The far-right in Germany is confident that its moment will come, again. Contact us at letters@time.com

Title: German election: Who won, who lost and what’s next?

Christian Democrats came first. Their leader, Friedrich Merz, is expected to be next chancellor. But the far right and the left were the top gainers. The conservative Christian Democrats have won Germany’s national election, putting them on track to lead the next coalition government, according to provisional results. The outcome means the party’s leader, Friedrich Merz, will likely be Germany’s next chancellor. Here’s a breakdown of Sunday’s election results and what to expect from Germany’s next leadership: Conservative and right-wing parties emerged on top. The mainstream conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), along with its partner, the Christian Social Union (CSU), finished first with 28.6 percent of the vote, while the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) surged into second with 20.8 percent, according to provisional results announced by election authorities. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) came in third with just 16.4 percent, a nearly 10-point drop from their first-place finish in 2021. Outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz of SPD acknowledged a “bitter” defeat, saying “the election result is poor and I bear responsibility”. Germany’s Greens and the far-left Die Linke, or The Left, party exceeded the 5 percent threshold to secure seats in parliament, with 11.6 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively. As a result, the CDU/CSU partnership is projected to secure 208 seats in the Bundestag, the German parliament, the AfD 152, the SPD 120, the Greens 85 and The Left 64. The 69-year-old CDU leader is a multimillionaire lawyer who has been in and out of politics for decades. He was first elected to the European Parliament in 1989, and by 2000 had become chairman of the CDU’s parliamentary alliance. However, fellow party member Angela Merkel eventually pushed Merz aside, and he left parliament in 2009 to jump into the private sector, working for multinational companies like Mayer Brown and BlackRock Germany. Merz was re-elected leader of the CDU in 2022 after Merkel retired from politics following her 16-year-long stint as the country’s chancellor. A social conservative who has broached the idea of a new European defence coalition, Merz says he plans to govern Germany “reliably” and push for European “independence” from the United States. “That is my absolute priority, I have no illusions at all about what will come out of America,” Merz said on Sunday, amid growing public differences between European leaders and US President Donald Trump over Ukraine and US security cover for Europe. Soon after his party’s victory on Monday, Merz went on to pledge that Europe will “remain firmly by” Ukraine, which he said must play a role in any peace negotiations. The far-right party finished just after Merz’s CDU, with 20.8 percent of the vote, double their 2021 support. It is projected to win 152 seats in parliament. That marks the strongest showing by a far-right movement in Germany since the end of World War II. The AfD’s rise highlights its growing populist appeal among voters who are critical of immigration and the European Union, especially in eastern Germany, where it outperformed all other parties. Despite little chance of the AfD being invited into a coalition, the party, led by 46-year-old Alice Weidel, is celebrating what it believes to be a victory, positioning a once-fringe force firmly in the mainstream of Europe’s right wing. The results are also expected to further strengthen the AfD’s clout in the German parliament, where it scored a big win in January when Merz and the CDU — for all of their talk of not allying with the far-right party — turned to Weidel’s group for votes to push through a bill calling for tougher restrictions on immigration. The Left won 8.8 percent of the vote, nearly doubling its share from the last election. It performed especially well in the capital, Berlin, surpassing all parties with 19.9 percent of the vote. That puts it on track to win 64 seats in the Bundestag. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), a populist left-wing party formed last year after a split with The Left, took 4.97 percent of the vote. That was just shy of the 5 percent hurdle needed to take seats in the Bundestag, meaning larger parties would get more seats. The Social Democrats’ two outgoing coalition partners – the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP) – also took a hit in the elections. The Greens won 11.6 percent of the vote, a 3 percent drop from the 2021 elections. The party’s chancellor candidate, Robert Habeck, conceded it was “not a good result” and said he would no longer seek a leading role in the party. The FDP, which effectively triggered the snap election by abandoning the coalition over a budget dispute, fared worse, getting just 4.3 percent of the vote. Since the party did not win any constituencies, and its national vote is below the 5 percent threshold required to hold seats in parliament allocated through proportional representation, it is projected to lose all 91 seats it has held since 2021. As its poor result became clear, leader Christian Lindner announced he would leave active politics. “The German election brought defeat for the FDP, but hopefully a new start for Germany. This is what I fought for,” he said in a post on X. Die Bundestagswahl brachte eine Niederlage für die FDP, aber hoffentlich einen Neuanfang für Deutschland. Dafür hatte ich gekämpft. Nun scheide ich aus der aktiven Politik aus. Mit nur einem Gefühl: Dankbarkeit für fast 25 intensive, herausfordernde Jahre voller Gestaltung und… pic.twitter.com/UuT1jTUeRW — Christian Lindner (@c_lindner) February 23, 2025 Merz will now begin the tough task of forming a coalition government. To do so, he needs to shore up at least 316 seats in the 630-member Bundestag. He has ruled out working with the far-right AfD, saying they have “fundamentally different views”, despite joining hands with the party in January over the immigration bill. That means his best bet is likely a two-way alliance with the SPD, which would come out to 328 seats. The CDU/CSU and the SPD have ruled through so-called grand coalitions four times in the past — between 1966 and 1969 in West Germany, and thrice since reunification, under Merkel’s chancellorship. A three-way partnership with the Greens and The Left would likely require more concessions from Merz’s centrist CDU and be more fragile. The Greens support higher taxes on the wealthy and renewable energy, while Merz favours corporate tax cuts and nuclear energy. The Left also backs higher taxes for the rich and advocates laxer immigration policies, conflicting with Merz’s stance to curb immigration and ramp up deportations. The composition of the next government is also likely to influence the foreign policy stances that Merz, who aims for Germany to play a leading role in European affairs and help unite the continent, can adopt. “If it winds up being a coalition with two parties – with Merz and CDU, and the centre left – that puts him [Merz] in a stronger position,” global strategy adviser Marco Vicenzino told Al Jazeera. “If it has to go into a three-party coalition, it gets into a weaker position.” With major defence challenges facing Europe, particularly due to the war in Ukraine, the European Union’s foreign policy chief urged German parties to form a coalition quickly “I hope that they do it as fast as possible, because we really need to move on with the decisions also on the European level that require German participation,” said Kaja Kallas. Merz said he hoped to form a new government by Easter, April 20, 2025. Party leaders have hailed AfD’s performance and argued it should be represented in the next coalition government. “We have achieved something historic today,” AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla said to cheering supporters on Sunday. “We are now the political centre and we have left the fringes behind us.” Weidel said the party remains open to joining a coalition and claimed that if Merz partners with left-wing parties instead, that would be “electoral fraud”. If that happens, she added, “next time we’ll come first”. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: After Germany’s Right-Wing Gains in Elections, New Conservative Leader Vows to ‘Achieve Independence’ From U.S. Under Trump’s Rule

By Ed Meza @edmezavar While the far right made historic gains in Germany’s pivotal federal elections on Sunday, the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party ultimately thrived with Friedrich Merz securing nearly 29% of the vote and placing him in the top spot to lead the country. Poised to become Germany’s next chancellor, Merz has yet to form a coalition with at least one other party in order to secure a majority in the German parliament, but he has already vowed to “achieve independence from the U.S.A.” in view of President Donald Trump’s indifference towards Europe. These elections, which saw a record-breaking voter turnout of 83.5% (the highest since unification in 1990), saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party make historic gains to become the second largest political force in the country. Related Stories VIP+ Apple TV+ Viewership Is Surging. Is It the ‘Severance’ Halo Effect? Jennifer Lopez Remembers Hairstylist Jesus Guerrero, Kylie Jenner Covering Funeral Expenses With around 21% of the vote, the AfD nearly doubled its result from four years ago as immigration, crime, inflation, unemployment and the war in Ukraine became hot-button issues that helped galvanized support for the populist, Eurosceptic party, which leads in eastern Germany. The rise of the far right in the country has also been fueled by a series of attacks that have involved immigrants, the latest of which happened on Feb. 13 in Munich, on the eve of the Berlin Film Festival, and caused dozens of injuries. Popular on Variety Sunday’s snap election was triggered by the collapse in November of Germany’s coalition government made up of Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s left-of-center Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democratic Party (FDP). Disputes over budget and economic policy led Scholz to fire FDP finance minister Christian Lindner, ending the coalition. For the moment, there appears no chance of the AfD joining a new government with the CDU as Merz has rejected forming a coalition with the party, which remains a pariah in Germany’s political establishment. The AfD has nevertheless won strong support from the Trump administration – Musk in particular has championed it as the only party “that can save Germany.” For Merz, that support appears to have gone too far. Taking part in a discussion on broadcaster ARD on Sunday, Merz said it was his “absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that we can really achieve independence from the U.S.A. as quickly as possible.” Merz, a traditionally pro-American politician and former exec at Blackrock, said he would have never imagined saying something like that on television but stressed that Trump’s recent statements made it clear that his administration was “largely indifferent to the fate of Europe.” He also questioned the future of NATO and said it may be necessary to establish an independent European defense capability, noting that he had “no illusions at all about what is happening in America — just look at the recent interference in the German election campaign by Mr. Elon Musk. “The interference from Washington was no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interference we saw from Moscow,” he added. “We are under so much pressure here from two sides that my absolute priority now is really to create unity in Europe.” German security officials have accused Russian actors of spreading disinformation online with fabricated videos claiming election fraud in the country in the run-up to Sunday’s vote. For Merz, navigating such a new kind of relationship with the U.S. may be challenging despite his own extensive ties to the business world. A corporate lawyer, Merz served as a member of parliament, or the Bundestag, from 1994 to 2009, when he left politics for a private sector career that saw him take seats on numerous corporate boards, including that of supervisory board chairman of Blackrock Germany from 2016 to 2020. What effect those ties may have on his administration remains to be seen. Merz’s election was actually welcomed by Trump who hailed it as “a great day” for Germany in a post on his social network Social Truth on Sunday. “It looks like the conservative party in Germany has won the elections… This is a great day for Germany and the United States of America, under the leadership of a ‘gentleman’… Congratulations to everyone,” Trump wrote. Trump is not the only problem Germany is facing. The country is currently undergoing a period of economic decline as it struggles with such major challenges as inflation, immigration and the consequences of the war in Ukraine, including the end of cheap Russian gas that for decades powered Germany’s industrial might. While votes are still being tallied late into the night Sunday, a coalition between the CDU and the SPD, which managed 16% of the vote, or a larger one with the SPD and Green Party (12%) is seen as likely. However, political analysts see a three-way coalition as potentially dysfunctional due to the major policy differences between the CDU and Greens. Taking part in a roundtable discussion on Sunday on broadcaster ARD, AfD head and chancellor candidate Alice Weidel said the CDU had “completely copied our program, adopted our entire position” but would “not be able to implement it with leftist parties.” Weidel said the AfD was extending its hand to the CDU, noting that Merz may not be willing to accept it but perhaps others in the CDU would. Weidel warned that a coalition between the CDU, SPD and Greens would result in an “unstable government that would not last four years” and the AfD would end up overtaking the CDU in the next few years. While widely rejected by the establishment, the AfD and its policies, including its stark anti-immigration stance and demonization of pro-Palestinian activists, seem to have had a profound impact on Germany’s other leading parties. The AfD’s stance on cultural issues was also evident in the recent revamp of federal film funding. The AfD has long rejected diversity, gender equality, inclusion, anti-discrimination and sustainability as film funding criteria – standards that were championed by Green Party culture minister Claudia Roth in her ambitious reform of film funding legislation. Yet, it was the FDP that killed the draft law’s planned diversity advisory board and ecological sustainability guidelines when it agreed to provide its decisive vote for the measure in December, saying it was seeking to do away with “bureaucratic advisory councils.” The reform nevertheless managed to extend and increase two key funding incentives, implementing one of three planned measures that also included a 30% tax incentive and an investment obligation for streamers and broadcasters. Some industry players are eager to see the new government tackle those measures, others less so. In a statement to Variety, Fred Kogel, CEO of leading entertainment giant Leonine Studios, said: “We’re confident that the new government under the leadership of Friedrich Merz will be formed quickly and will help our country move forward. Over the course of the last months, we held constructive talks with members of the CDU/CSU, SPD and Bündnis 90/Die Grünen [the Greens] who recognize the cultural and economic importance of Germany as a media hub. “We now need to build on this,” Kogel added. “The rapid introduction of a tax incentive and an investment obligation with a legally regulated reversion of rights to producers remains our key message to the new government. This is a long overdue step and the only way to restore Germany’s international competitiveness as a media location and as a relevant player in the global production business.” Björn Böhning, CEO of the Produktionsallianz industry association, added: “Germany urgently needs a stable and capable federal government. The film and television production industry also depends on planning security and sustainable framework conditions. The international competitiveness of Germany as a film location stands and falls with the continuation of the film reform that has begun. It is high time to finally hold international streaming providers accountable and ensure that rights to German productions do not migrate abroad unhindered.” The Produktionsallianz therefore calls on the new federal government to approve the investment commitment as well as the planned tax incentive within the 100-day program of its term in office, Böhning said. Vaunet, the association of private broadcasters, is vehemently opposed to an investment obligation for VoD providers, which, it argues, restricts programming freedom and would not necessarily lead to an increase in investments in Germany. It does back the new tax incentive plan, however. Vaunet expressed hope that a new government would improve economic prospects and create a fairer environment. “The audio and audiovisual sector is both an economic and a cultural asset: Securing the economic foundations and freedom of programming as well as protecting content is crucial for the activities of journalistic and editorial media and thus for our democracy. “Vaunet therefore expects a new government to bring about a rapid and sustainable improvement in the economic framework, especially in the areas of refinancing through advertising, as well as preventing further burdens on media providers and equalizing the level playing field with the big tech platforms. Strong and competitive private media are the guarantee of media diversity in Germany and an important driver of the cultural and creative industries.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment

Title: Germany Holds an Election in an Alternate Reality

Germany held an election yesterday. It went about as expected. The biggest surprise continues to be how the majority of parties all support some flavor of ongoing belligerence towards Russia — a policy that is destroying Germany. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) achieved its best result in any national vote (20.8 percent) since it was founded in 2013. The party which started out more as an anti-EU, anti-NATO party and became more ethno nationalist and now favors both an end to conflict with Russia as well as strong ties with the US, looks likely to be excluded from government according to statements from Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leaders. The pro-war, capital-friendly CDU came in first with 28.6 percent and will likely head the next government with former Blackrock executive Friedrich Merz at the helm. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s centrist Social Democratic Party (SPD) was rewarded for its disastrous governance of the past four years with its worst national election result (16.4 percent) in more than a century. Yet its stance on “supporting” Ukraine remains unchanged. And the warmongering Greens lost a few points from 2021 but remained mostly steady with 11.6 percent of the vote. As of Monday morning in Berlin the anti-war Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) is at 4.97 percent, which means the party would just miss getting into the Bundestag. Some BSW members are crying foul: The Germans abroad referenced by De Masi cannot vote at embassies or consulates and postal delays might have prevented their ballots from arriving on time. Euronews, for example, reports on abroad voters still waiting for their ballots on Thursday, which even if returned immediately via express mail would have been unlikely to arrive before the 6 pm Sunday deadline. Here are some possibilities on the future governing coalition from Deutsche Welle: To form a government, a majority of at least 316 seats out of the 630 seats in the Bundestag is needed. A coalition between CDU and AfD would have been possible numerically, as both parties easily pass this threshhold, adding up to 358. But according to conservative leader Friedrich Merz, this is out of the question. That leaves Olaf Scholz’s SPD as a possible partner, which together with CDU scrape by with 328 seats. A bigger majority could be formed if CDU were to add the Greens to the mix, reaching 416. But the CDU’s junior partner CSU has repeatedly ruled out governing with the Greens. Over the coming days and weeks a coalition will likely be formed, voter shifts will be dissected, and campaign promises will fade away. There will be plenty of time to examine that, but here I’d like to pose a few questions. Will the new chancellor and the new government be able to confront reality and begin to seek a path out of Germany current …predicament? How could they do so? And are any of the parties that will be seated in the upcoming Bundestag even asking the right questions that would lead to possible answers? Germany’s House of Mirrors Germany’s political elite largely represented by the four parties (the CDU/CSU, SPD, Greens, and the Free Democratic Party, which fell below the five percent threshold to be seated in the Bundestag) remain stuck in the “rules-based order” transatlantic fantasyland championing their democracy and liberal values while demonizing Russia, reality is at the gates. It’s increasingly difficult to square that paradigm while remaining obsessed with supporting Israel’s genocide campaign and criminalizing speech (notice JD Vance in his widely celebrated Munich dress down didn’t criticize Germany’s heavy handed approach when it comes to this area of free speech). But more than anything it is an economy circling the drain, which is largely the result of the war against Russia, as well as hitching itself to the US empire with a more combative stance against Beijing. And for all the talk of a US-Russia peace, what do we have so far? Let’s cut away all the headline-grabbing transatlantic political fights and look at the ways Germany and Europe remain on autopilot on a journey to becoming the next Ukraine: The madwoman in Berlin, foreign minister Annalena Baerbock let the cat out of the bag on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that $700 billion is coming. She told Berliner Zeitung the following: “We will launch a large package that has never been seen on this scale before,” said Baerbock. “Similar to the euro or the [Coronavirus] crisis, there is now a financial package for security in Europe. That will come in the near future.” According to Baerbock, the deal will be announced sometime after the German election. The package is believed to include money for ​​”military training, the acceleration of relief efforts, arms deliveries and what Europe could offer for security guarantees.” Merz, too, is reportedly on board. He had this to say following yesterday’s victory. From DW: The favorite for the future German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, sharply criticized Donald Trump’s administration and urged Europe to distance [itself] from Washington during a post-election panel airing on state broadcaster ARD. “I am communicating closely with a lot of prime ministers, and heads of EU states and for me it is an absolute priority to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible, so that we achieve independence from the US, step by step,” Merz said. “Step by step” is doing a lot of work there. Merz was after all recently floating the idea of buying F-35s from the US. How will the European public, which has largely soured on the war, react to more power going to Brussels and loads of debt in order to keep losing to the Russians? The humiliation from the US has been so thorough — self-inflicted by Europe but humiliating nonetheless — while the propaganda against Russia so relentless for years, I wonder if we’re going to see a rally around the EU flag moment similar to the time after the official start of the Ukraine war in 2022. The hatred and fear of Russia certainly remains strong: One factor limiting the stimulus to be had from rearmament is that Europe buys much of its military gear from American suppliers. Former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi’s competitiveness report estimated that 78% of purchases come from production outside the EU—and 63% from the US alone. That means any “multiplier” effect of stepped-up spending on growth would be low. What’s more, recruiting more Europeans to the military and defense industry would bring down unemployment, possibly fueling inflationary pressures that would lead to higher interest rates. In all, Rush calculates that EU economic output might be higher by about 0.6% in 2028, “which implies a modest nudge up in GDP growth in the next few years.” And yet the priority is more weapons to fund an unwinnable war and prevent the Russians from conquering Europe — a threat for which there is still no evidence and makes no sense if you spend ten seconds thinking about it. But on the plus side from the perspective of the European vultures, it provides cover to continue dismantling the welfare state and privatize everything from infrastructure to social services. The US and Russia could work out some rapprochement, which some in Washington believe will help with other wars in the Middle East, as well as the looming confrontation with China. Meanwhile, the EU continues to piss into the tent, and should talks between Washington and Moscow fall apart, Europe’s militarization is setting it up to become the next Ukraine. That would certainly “extend” Russia as the famous 2019 RAND report suggested. At the very least, Europe’s doubling down on suicidal belligerence ensures that it remains walled off from the Eurasian project for the foreseeable future, and the US can focus its efforts on blowing up other bridges in the world’s heartland. One would have thought that the US would have had to stay in the heavyweight fight against Russia in order to continue to profit off of Europe’s misery, but this line of thinking might have underestimated the EU’s impotence. As of now, it looks like the EU countries are content with ongoing vassalage despite the increasing abuse coming from Washington. What Is Needed to Get Germany — and Europe — out of This Mess? The New York Times ran a Friday guest essay by one Konstantin Richter entitled “Germany Is in Big Trouble, and Nobody Knows What to Do About It.” What? There are plenty of people who have been saying for the past three years (at least) that Germany was heading down a ruinous path. To change course all it would take would be a minimal amount of courage to imagine Germany as part of Eurasia, break with transatlantic slavishness — including quitting NATO, repair ties itself with Russia, take up China on its offer to merge the Belt and Road Initiative with Europe’s Global Gateway, and forge stronger ties in other areas. Rather than spend untold billions on arming against some imaginary Russian invasion, the EU could use that money to rebuild its economies with the help of Russian energy, Chinese investment, and integration with Eurasia. Yet, there are no signs this is being considered — at least not yet. Why, for example, are European heads of state not requesting their own bilateral talks with Russia? There is nothing preventing them from doing so. Why not resurrect the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe? At some point — one way or another — Europe is going to have to come to terms with Russia’s desire for a new European security architecture agreement. Do any of Germany’s leaders look capable of such a task? Are they even thinking about it? Are any in Europe for that matter? Maybe Orban? What’s on Offer Instead? Well, let’s take a brief look at the positions of the parties in yesterday’s election. Merz and the CDU. They represent the status quo with regards to Russia and atlanticism with more financialization to boot. Merz is the author of 2008 book “Dare more capitalism” and dare he does. The former Blackrock executive loves himself some privatization and deregulation. German workers are likely to see their living standards continue to decline under a Merz government. Merz likes to talk about Germany taking on a leadership role in Europe. What does that entail? Here’s a taste: International fugitive and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had a “warm conversation” with new German chancellor Friedrich Merz. Despite an ICC arrest warrant, Merz said he would invite Netanyahu to Germany, according to Netanyahu’s office. — jeremy scahill (@jeremyscahill) February 24, 2025 Here’s what the European Council on Foreign Relations expects: Should Merz triumph, the new German government will have a mandate to pursue a foreign policy based on integration steps concerning defence spending and debt-sponsored innovation policies. Eventually, Germany will be less likely to aim for the broad supranational alliances it previously developed to ensure no state was left behind. Instead, a ‘two-speed Europe’ is likely—although it come at the cost of alienating Germany’s core EU partner, France. …apart from Merz, the CDU’s leaders are generally younger—the powerful leader of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hendrik Wüst, is 49; the informal leader of the CDU’s conservative wing, Jens Spahn, is 44. Politically socialised in a reunified Germany, this new generation refers to their country as a clear leader in both Europe and the EU. Their parents were born after the second world war, while their grandparents—who might retain some connection to the post-war order—have long since passed away. Consequently, they lack the ties which defined previous generations of German leaders. To them, restraint is a foreign policy concept not rooted in personal conviction. AfD – Who knows? What Wolfgang Streeck said last year in an interview with Die Zeit about the AfD rings increasingly true: ​​I don’t know a single consistent thought from [Bjorn] Höcke and his followers. It’s all just cynical symbolic provocations. Lately that lack of consistency means taking a more friendly turn towards the US. The party that started out as an anti-EU and morphed more into an anti-immigrant has long been hated and feared by the German political-media establishment. Yes, it has a small core support from neo Nazis, but the real reason was its anti-NATO stance, brutal honesty about Berlin being a “slave” to the US, and a desire to make nice with Moscow seeing as it is in the national interest of Germany to do so. Well, last month the AfD adopted a motion in support of Germany and the US building closer relations, and it has embraced of Elon Musk and the Trump administration. So one can expect it to be an extension of the US rebrand in Europe. The shift also shows up in polling. German public opinion begins to take a more realistic view of the country’s relationship with the US: But the AfD supporters, unlike other German voters, are softening their stance towards Washington: Streeck, in that interview with Die Zeit, continued: Conservatives on the right believe in a natural hierarchy, a world in which the better ones are there to tell the less good ones what to do. But I am an unconverted egalitarian: all people are of equal value. Furthermore, right-wing conservatives believe that there can be no peace in this world: there are Schmittian existential enemies with whom we can only live if we don’t let them live. The latter has become a central theme of the American neocons and the European NATO conservatives, including our foreign minister. Zeit: Are you comparing Annalena Baerbock to Höcke? Streeck: If you say that this war can only end when we hand Putin over to The Hague, then that means final victory: German tanks in Moscow. And I say we should think about that again. And that leads us to… The Greens At least we know what we’re going to get here: more crazy, exemplified by Baerbock. Annalena Baerbock is apparently still angry about Russia’s WW2 defeat of Nazi Germany. Baerbock fixates on the Oder River, where her Nazi grandfather fought against Russia. Imagine the anti-Russia hatred in the Baerbock households during Annalena’s formative years. https://t.co/esk9rOsgZ0 pic.twitter.com/ujWx2IV3JX — ⏳Towhee 🌏☮️ (@amborin) February 21, 2025 The Greens are already angling to get into the next government with the party’s Bundestag leader, Britta Haßelmann, telling DW that the Greens are now more of a governing party than an opposition party. Wonderful. SPD. Representative of the “center.” Largely on board with Germany’s neoliberal war path, but might get there slower than the Greens and CDU. Die Linke. The Left Party collapsed in recent years after abandoning nearly all of its former working class platform in favor of identity politics in an attempt to appear “ready to govern.” The party saw a resurgence in response to the AfD’s rise, as well as a renewed focus on economic issues. It also softened key foreign policy stances including dropping any pretense of opposition to NATO, and there’s no evidence that the party is prepared to consider what is necessary to get Germany out of the hole it has dug for itself. BSW. Sahra Wagenknecht from the party that bears her name might be the one politician who grasps the enormity of Germany’s challenge and what it takes to tackle them. She’s been pushing the balancing of ties between the US and Eurasia and rebuilding German industry while also curtailing immigration. Alas, as of Monday morning in Germany BSW is only at 4.9 percent — just short of the 5 needed to get the party’s anti-war voice in the Bundestag. If Merz and company are serious about moving forward with hundreds of billions for militarization, it’s hard to see how the situation in Germany doesn’t go from a disaster to devastation. Even without that colossal misstep, it still appears as though the situation is destined to get a lot worse before it can get better. It all brings to mind something Glenn Diesen wrote the other day: … idealism is dangerous as unrealistic demands and uncompromising moral slogans are destroying both Ukraine and Europe. A key rule in political realism is that refusing to accept the world as it is will result in devastation. Once Trump’s team settled on a plan regarding Ukraine-Russia-Europe events and policy changes have been moving so fast these recent weeks, I’m half expecting Trump to announce an alliance with Russia against Ukraine and Europe. I jest, but never expected such quick US reproachment towards Russia. But Trump’s swift reproachment with Russia comes with a warning: Why is he doing it? So that the US can next try to drive a wedge between Russia and China. He motives I suspect are not entirely pure or innocent as he presents. Trump campaigned in 2016 in favor of better relations with Russia but was convinced/coerced into continuing anti-Russian policies. Russiagate was powerful in this regard. So perhaps his turn toward Russia is another part of him doing everything that the permanent bureaucracy and the media stopped him from doing last time. For better or worse. Good observation on driving a wedge. But Brian Berletic, always a voice of sanity, believes this is anything but a rapprochement with Russia. He believes the US intends to continue the war but is trying to rework the division of labour. As always he is meticulous about backing himself up with sources direct from the parties themselves. Check out his post of two days ago with Angelo Giuliano, titled “Is There a Real US-EU Split?” Warning: it’s a long one – 2 hours. I trust Brian on military issues; on geopolitics, not so much. Experts such as Jeffrey Sachs differ with him, in major ways. This is ad hominem. You need to address the particulars of his argument and try to debunk that and not engage in a personal attack in lieu of a rebuttal. I’ve watched Brian’s podcast and his interviews here in BKK. He tends to become adamant about US “actions”. His military background is extensive enough but his grasp of geopolitics often seems naïve, rather idealistic. He often “protests too much”. Sounds good to me. Seems more to me that the Trump administration is trying to get Europe to take over the Russia Ukraine fight to free up the US to spend more resources on losing WW3 to China. The whole story of the rare earths (which Ukraine doesnt have) and other natural resources being committed to a $500 billion dollar fund seems like a way for the US to come back down the road and claim Russia is “stealing” things which the US has already rightly stolen for itself! EU leaders have flocked to Kiev today to announce their undying support. The Germans now seem determined to give Ukraine taurus missiles to fire directly into Russia. Starmer now ‘guarantees’ that Ukraine will join Nato. World War III to come? Only if Trump agrees to send US troops into the Ukraine which he does not want to do, no matter how many times countries like the UK and France try to trick him into it. If countries like the UK, France and Germany sent troops into the Ukraine, the Russians have already said that they would attack them which is why they won’t do it without total US backing. Numbers would be low in any case. I believe that with troop rotations in mind, that the UK has said that it can only send in a hodgepodge force of some 3,000 troops as part of such an effort so that is about a brigade’s worth. You couldn’t garrison a major city with a force that size. They would probably be outnumbered by the local police force. Thank you, John. The UK’s stuffed. Let’s get it over with. Northwood and High Wycombe are down the road. Perhaps a warning shot on Chequers first? Thank you. Good idea. I had some friends visiting over the weekend and showed them Chequers and Wotton. I’m sure the Russians have the GPS coordinates 51.74357064219684, -0.781010480432043 Do they seem determined to do so? (sending Taurus to Ukraine and launching them towards Russia). I though it was nothing but cheap talk by Merz moths ago. Not having warranted support from the US which in turn has stopped launching ATACMS i believe this will not happen. It would be extremely stupid given Europe is absolutely unprepared against Russian retaliatory attacks with whatever they have including the Oreshniks. It´s just filling empty space. I have seldom seen such a blowhard as Merz. Even worse than Scholz or even Habeck who has actually turned out to be a giantly dishonest asshole considering his insulting behaviour towards his own ministerial staff. I have got accustomed to a little trick – if you wanna know a politician´s true colours go back to their early years and look what they did and how. And you will mostly see a ridiculous, cowardly clown. At least Lindner is honest. He promised not to enter another coalition with the Greens and will do what he said How will the European public, which has largely soured on the war, react to more power going to Brussels and loads of debt in order to keep losing to the Russians? They are going to punish the establishment by voting for it again. And has the public really soured on the war? They seem to not like the economic repercussions of the war, but the war course itself remains popular. There is no innocent population that was forced to go down this path by a treasonous political elite. Most people actively want this, they are just bitching and moaning about the personal discomfort that follows from their own actions. What is clear from the German election result is that the country is still divided into east and west Germany. After the asset stripping of eastern Germany to profit the west, the far right moved into the area and started to blame foreigners for all their woes, rather than the real culprits which was the German state and German corporations. This suited the west because it diverted attention from the real cause so they colluded to support the lie of foreign workers and not corporate asset stripping. Thus east Germany became the new home for the fascists of west Germany, the type of politics that the east had banned because of its destructive divisive nature. Now Germany is divided between the far right and the not quite so far right, not because thy are supported but because the left has been so heavily infiltrated by the right (the Greens are now a pro war party). It is said that the turnout has been high at over 80% but the result is still fractured and the German election rules have left many parties marginalized and unable to campaign effectively (criticism of Israel can result in bans). What is clear is that this election leaves the country deeply split and the people strongly opposed to the state The final tally for BSW — the only voice in the center-to-left spectrum that opposes further German military support for Ukraine — is 4.972%, missing by only 14,000 of more than 49.6 million votes cast (82.5% turnout) to hit the 5% required to enter the Bundestag (good graphics and numbers freely available here). This is a tragedy. Had they made the mark, the probable center-right aggressively Russophobic minority government would be more difficult to achieve. The blind march to war is so disheartening. It feels like 1914 around here. A CDU/CSU coalition with SPD is natural given their convergence on the top policy agenda items. (The Greens fit quite well too.) Given the progress of AfD, would it make sense for the CDU/CSU to form an pact with the SPD for future elections? Where are my manners? Thank you, Conor, for this valuable summary. My comment was already in mod when it dawned on me. Thank you, Conor. Further to the dodgy grandfathers, how about AfD toff Beatrix von Storch’s. Beatrix von Storch You couldn´t make up a better name for a shady character in some spy B-movie. “Storch” of course meaning the bird stork. “Why not resurrect the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe?” Aha, Conor Gallagher, because the OSCE had found extensive violation of human rights in Ukraine — including torture chambers and disappearances. The OSCE had to tone down those unfortunate findings after it became necessary to prove that the Russians were just plain old crazy Asiatics. Meanwhile, going forward, the horizontal bar chart: Which founding / core country is not like the others, at all? Italy. The Italian bar contrasts strikingly with the bars for Poland and Germany, which are similar indeed. So you have two rather unsuccessful countries spoiling for a fight. As to the Denmark bar, something is rotten in Denmark. Let us pray that akvavit consumption drops. And Italy is going its own way, as I watch the news and read the papers. Everyone from well-established Giuseppe Conte and most Five Stars, plus Marco Tarquinio in the Partito Democratico, to commentators like Alessandro di Battista and supposed alt-right (but more of a populist anarchist) Pubble are pushing Italy in another direction. And then there’s the Pope Factor. No wonder Giorgia Meloni is at CPAC telling the Elect that Italy is for sale and for plunder. Long term, she’s short term. PS: Noting the AfD’s figures, and noting Linke’s resurrection, I am reminded of a map that I saw today of results. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_German_federal_election#/media/File:2025_German_federal_election.svg This is what happens when the oh-so-rational Germans have economic integration (merge and purge) without considering social and political integration. The old East asserts itself. Bavaria is extremely conservative. Conserving what? The right to have illegitimate children? According to the Catholic Encyclopaedia, 14.01% of all births in Bavaria around 1890 were illegitimate, second to only Austria with 14.67%. Given her petite stature, she cannot possible see too far ahead… Some very high heels would be useful. Could get to be Putin’s height… Judging by the trajectory of the Sweden Democrats in Sweden, AfD will fill the following function: – say no to NATO until the vote when they immediately say yes. AfD will not help Germany to leave this destructive organization. – do not care about sovereignity because they voted yes to the defence agreement cooperation = surrender your territorial sovereignity. AfD will not tell the USA to deoccupy the country. – use immigrants as a scapegoat for all the ills in the country and attract voters with this argument – continue to inflict neoliberal pain on society to maintain and/or increase voter support because of immigrants causing all ills of the world – toe the lines of the zionist lobby and the US and neocons Goals stated to SD by a zionist lobbyist https://x.com/Johnpatrick500/status/1889794786959241408 2024 petitions from Sweden Democrats (SD) Petition from SD to the Swedish government to withdraw support to UNRWA https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/indraget-bistand-till-unrwa_hc02225/ Petition from SD to move the capital to Jerusalem https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/erkannande-av-jerusalem-som-israels-huvudstad_hb0259/ Petition from SD to cut all aid to Palestine https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/motion/upphorande-av-bistand-till-palestina-och-en_hc02386/ Petition from SD to cut diplomatic relations with Palestine https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-och-lagar/dokument/skriftlig-fraga/diplomatiska-atgarder-efter-palestinskt-stod-till_hb111057/ These far-right parties are definitely completely detached from the idea of sovereignity. Larry Johnson put some pen to this too: Friedrich Merz, leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), is a war hawk and is likely to push anti-Russian policies. Fortunately, with only 28% of the vote, he lacks a mandate to up the ante and risk war with Russia. The political fissures that divide the German people mean that their country, once considered a powerhouse in Europe, will become irrelevant. https://sonar21.com/german-election-results-signals-more-chaos-ahead/ It’s now been two decades since I last visited Europe, and I spent quite a bit of time there in the 80s and 90s: I longed to return, but now I’m thinking I’d rather keep my memories as they are. As a Romanian, I say that it cannot happen to nicer people. Prior to WWII, Germany forced Romania via the Vienna Dicktat to cede the Northern Transylvania to Hungary, which was the downpayment to have Hungary join in the coming fight against USSR (likely it was not in the small print, otherwise Hungary would have rather taken the chance to stay neutral and maybe get the Austrian treatment after war). Then, with the non-agression treaty with USSR, Germany winked-winked, nod-noded for USSR to take over Basarabia from Romania (and of course the free hands in the Baltic and Finland, which was to be just provisional). This ensured that Romania would join Germany in the attack against USSR in June 1941, to recover lost territory. And the attitude towards the genocide in the Occupied territories… It cannot happen with nicer people… I don’t think anyone in Eastern Europe is feeling sorry for the Germans. German ideological infections are highly resistant to rationality treatment. However, the national recovery from near death in 1945 was quite vigorous. We can only hope that the return of realism in Germany does not require a similar degree of suffering. Germany needs to pull the EU together and lead an independent foreign policy that establishes economic ties indifferent to U.S. geopolitical machinations. Thanks. Only one wrinkle I feel, overextending Russia will not. The 2019 RAND paper is lacking data and insight into the reality of Russian planning and conduct. In fact I would suggest it´s the other way around EU overextending especially with commitment on the Pacific frontline being expanded. The Russians have stepped up production of hypsersonic systems among others for this very reason. With current Zircon covering almost all of Europe. The entire arsenal is well known to readers here. And that´s just the tip of the iceberg. Almost none of what RAND suggested will work. And where it did with Syria, in the long run we will see how it actually plays out for the perpetrators of that mess. Besides by now Russia appears to have found a new base with Algeria. Not to speak of BRICS etc. But as I said last night, as Connor stresses above – there is noone in Germany in sight who admits this or would act according to it. Germany.is.doomed. I can only hope BSW will create a grassroots basis with doing streetworkers´ jobs to work up from there. Like the Communist Party did in the Autrian city of Graz. As of now they are “our last hope” to quote Princess Leia. And the massive swing voters movements are proof of how insecure people truly are. With China having the Russians´ back and Russia being self-sufficient on every possible level RAND was producing fairy-tales. Besides that report was based on data at least 6 years old. wow. That´s like a lightyear away. Thanks Conor for your essay on the “alternate reality” Germany lives in. The main topic of the election campaign was not – as someone with a glimpse of common sense would have guessed – the accelerated deindustrialization process bleeding Germanys industrial sector dry or the destruction of the – in former times – very reliable german energy system or the destructive proxy war fought in Ukraine costing hundred thousand of lives and billions of Euros but the stupid idea of firewalling the AfD (a party with roots in hayekian neoliberalism as well as national conservatism) out of the parliamentary process. With the “firewall” the entrenched interests of the established party cartel manages to keep away the AfD from the possibility of having immediate influence on government politics. The other party which could have been a threat for the existing party cartel – the left-conservative BSW – was smeared as “puppets of Putin” by the MSM and – to make things worse – undermined itself by agreeing to government coalitions with cartel parties in Thuringia and Brandenburg. Not only were economic questions sidelined during the election campaign, a huge part of the populace seems neither interested in economic policy nor informed about the dire straits the national economy is in. And in the short run there will be no change of this: The MSM – one of the main tools of the professional-managerial caste – is still very good at “manufacturing consent” and upholding the “alternate reality” Conor described so precisely. p.s. quick look into the 2019 RAND study and its initial verdict of the Russian military which I need not comment here further. Just looking into their quoted sources reveals how they are missing the crucial points albeit trying to not denigrate the enemy. Which with faux respect fed false hopes. What is most striking: how little Western – publicly available – studies have changed since. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3063.html “(…) The present-day Russian military is a capable, albeit uneven, fighting force. Its ground and air forces can dominate the country’s near abroad militarily, (…) The Kremlin also possesses a survivable strategic nuclear deterrent consisting of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-based ship-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and bombers with air-launched cruise missiles, along with a formidable arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons. Thanks to decades of sustained investment, Russia boasts advanced air defense capabilities. Compared with the United States (or the Soviet Union), Putin’s Russia has a limited ability to project force, but defeating it on its home turf would be extremely challenging and costly. Moreover, it maintains these capabilities with a defense budget comparable to that of several weaker military powers, (…) Western observers disagree over the level of Russian military leaders’ acceptance of such concepts as “hybrid warfare” and such proposals as “escalating to deescalate” with nuclear weapons, but the 2014 seizure of Crimea demonstrated the Russian military’s capability to wage an unconventional military campaign. (…) While much Russian military equipment still dates back to the Soviet period, Russia launched an ambitious modernization program at the beginning of the decade seeking to provide the military with “70 percent modern equipment by 2020.”18 While the post-Crimea budget crunch has forced the Kremlin to scale back these targets, generous funding in the early 2010s enabled substantial progress. (…) The Russian militaryindustrial complex has shown it can produce modern weapons, if only in relatively limited numbers. Certain systems favored by Russian decisionmakers have benefited from decades of sustained investment and are world class. The S-400 air-defense system and T-14 Armata tank are advanced systems with no U.S. counterpart, as is Russia’s family of mobile ground-based strategic nuclear launchers. (…) Much of Russia’s defense industry has been neglected since Soviet times and is in desperate need of capital modernization. Critical production facilities and suppliers are located in former Soviet republics that are now hostile to Russia, particularly Ukraine, necessitating costly substitution programs. Like the rest of the Russian economy, the military-industrial complex is afflicted by corruption, although this might not be particularly bad by Russian standards. Moreover, much of the defense industry is state-owned via large holding companies. Both Russian and Western critics often charge that isolation from market forces is a critical weakness of the Russian military-industrial complex, but it is far from clear that this presents a vulnerability that could be exploited by a cost-imposing strategy. Corrupt and inefficient as the Russian defense industry might be, the cost-control problems afflicting U.S. defense procurement are so large that the Russians are often highly competitive on a cost-comparison basis. Potential Vulnerabilities For all their strengths, the Russian military and defense industry still suffer from many vulnerabilities. Even though ground forces make up the bulk of the Russian military and are still using outdated equipment, the Russian defense budget deemphasizes them in comparison with other services. While the quality of the average Russian soldier and his equipment is improving, it still lags considerably behind U.S. standards. The need to recapitalize the defense industry and the inadequacy of available funds to do so have helped perpetuate these critical weaknesses. Such areas as surface shipbuilding are in parlous condition, contributing to an uneven modernization. Furthermore, the scientific and technical capital underlying Soviet military strength has atrophied, as have the human resources available to the Russian militaryindustrial complex. Finally, military spending has been more protected from the effects of Russia’s budget crisis than have other areas of the state budget, but it is likely only a matter of time before economic realities catch up with Moscow’s military ambitions. (…)” In fact the truth of how little they understood in 2019 (and apparently might still do to some extent) is buried in the very last 1,5 pages of the 277 page study. Even if not all assessments in the entire study are wrong they did regard Russia as a leightweight. With some horrible consequences to everyone but Russians. Implications and Recommendations for the US Army “(…) Ultimately, the task of “extending” Russia should not fall primarily to the U.S. Army or even the U.S. armed forces. Indeed, the most-promising ways to extend Russia—with the highest benefit, lowest risk, and greatest likelihood of success—probably fall in the economic and information domains rather in the military domain. Moreover, as this study has argued, Russia is not seeking military parity with the United States and might simply choose not to respond to some U.S. military actions (e.g., shifts in naval presence), while other U.S. military actions (e.g., posturing forces closer to Russia) could ultimately prove costlier to the United States than to Russia. Nonetheless, there are at least three major implications of this work for the U.S. Army. First, the Army should rebuild its expertise on all things Russian, including foreign area officers, linguists, and intelligence analysts. If Russia does indeed pose a long-term threat, then the U.S. Army needs to develop the human capital to engage in this strategic competition. Second, the Army should consider investing—and encouraging the other services to invest—more in the handful of capabilities (e.g., ATACMs, IFPC2, longer-range anti-air defense, and other systems designed to counter Russian A2AD capabilities) that could extend Russia. The U.S. Army also might consider spending some of its R&D resources on less mature, more futuristic systems (e.g., swarm unmanned aerial vehicles or remote ground vehicles). While these measures would likely be insufficient in and of themselves to extend Russia, they would benefit U.S. deterrence efforts and could augment a broader whole-of-government policy. Third, even if the U.S. Army is not directly involved in “extending Russia” per se, it will play a key role in mitigating the consequences. As already mentioned, all the measures to extend Russia incur some degree of risk. As a result, enhancing U.S. deterrence posture in Europe and increasing U.S. military capabilities (e.g., an enhanced Javelin or active protective systems for Army vehicles) might need to go hand-inhand with any move to extend Russia as a way of hedging against the possibility of tensions with Russia escalating into conflict. (…)” A key difference that is missing is the aspect of morale: it is very clear to Russian front-line fighters why they are there and what they a doing it for, where as aside from the remaining true-believing Azov troopers who are simply thrilled to be killing “orcs,” most Ukrainian troops would likely rather be elsewhere. I don’t have the stats, but I know that the USA forever wars helped demolish many a hundred, two hundred years family traditions of serving the nation by serving in the military. Many of the actual combat vets I’ve encountered from these seem pretty messy in the head and often have fairly high disability-ratings from the VA. I haven’t come across one yet who thinks “it was worth it.” Training will only carry one so far, and it’ll usually click on when SHTF, but over the longer-term motivation from fear alone will not carry one through– it becomes burn-out. What do our soldiers fight for, especially if there is no god, tradition is dead, and that those who run their country actually hate them? edit: I am seriously sorry, I seem to not learn that the correct spelling is CONOR!!! Not CONNOR as in Terminator´s LISA CONNOR. You probably mean Sarah Connor. ;) Thanks Conor for the excellent article. 🙏 Germany´s biggest alternative news site NACHDENKSEITEN seems pretty devastated. They have 3 articles alone today filled with the tune of the doomed. “The BSW’s election defeat – a political disaster” ““I don’t know any parties anymore…!” – or: Requiem for a country” “Peace is the big election loser” It is interesting though that Germany´s pro forma most influential evening news TAGESSCHAU writes: “Millions of votes not represented in the Bundestag – “A little more than one in seven votes in the Bundestag election went to a party that will not be represented in the next Bundestag. According to the results of the counting of all constituencies, around 13.9 percent voted for a party that failed to clear the five percent hurdle. That corresponds to around 6.9 million votes” Add to that 17% of non-voters. There is a lot of potential there for BSW. BERLINER ZEITUNG with a commentary on Habeck: German version https://archive.is/x2kV1 The end of Robert Habeck: His power was more important to him than his political ideals After the election, the Green Party member quickly found the culprit for his failure: Friedrich Merz. But that is not true. It was Habeck’s will to power. A commentary. by Anja Reich On the day of Robert Habeck’s defeat, one could once again experience what had caused him to fail. It was election Sunday, between 6 and 7 p.m., the first projections were in, the Greens were at 13.3 percent, later they slipped to 11.6 percent, far below the expectations of the man who had stood to become Chancellor for the Greens. In interviews, Habeck was asked about the reasons for the Greens’ poor performance, and he had – well – an interesting explanation: Friedrich Merz is to blame. His vote in the Bundestag with the AfD. Green sympathizers had wished that he would never speak to the CDU again, said Habeck with a concerned expression. But that was not possible for him, Habeck. Because: “I can’t do that. I’m polarized differently, we’re polarized differently.” And then he added: “In that respect, we are now victims of Friedrich Merz’s voting behavior.” Robert Habeck – a victim of the CDU? The Green candidate for chancellor – a victim of the CDU? Because he stood by Friedrich Merz in a difficult hour? Against his own conscience? Anyone who followed Habeck’s election campaign must have thought at this point that the Vice Chancellor was suffering from memory loss. Let us remember what really happened after the much-discussed decision on the “Influx Limitation Act” on the last day of January this year. The CDU had introduced the proposal for the law to the Bundestag, knowing full well that the AfD would also vote for it. But contrary to expectations, not only the SPD and the Greens voted against it, but also some members of the FDP and the Union. The law failed. And Robert Habeck ? Seemed to be in a good mood. He wanted to become Chancellor, to beat Merz; he had started the election campaign in November with this unrealistic goal. And it became more and more unrealistic. The CDU was at 30 percent in the polls, the Greens around 15. But now, after the vote with the AfD, people took to the streets, even former Chancellor Angela Merkel stabbed Friedrich Merz in the back, the churches protested against him, half the country, it seemed. Robert Habeck wanted to depose Friedrich Merz from his poll throne Habeck’s tone towards the CDU suddenly became harsh and relentless. He accused Merz of breaking taboos and breaking his word. “Not once, but twice. Not by accident, but on purpose. Against all warnings,” he shouted at a campaign event in Cologne. The CDU candidate had disqualified himself for office. Habeck even had his election campaign changed: “One person. One word” became “One word broken. Hundreds of thousands of people.”, “Word instead of word broken,” “Habeck instead of Merz.” Just a few hours after the Bundestag vote, Habeck’s anti-Merz ad was already appearing on Spiegel Online and other websites. Something was happening, he announced, “from the depths of the soul of the country.” He wanted to become chancellor, to topple Merz from his poll throne. That was Habeck’s mindset. And nothing else. But the Greens’ figures did not improve, and Habeck’s plan to beat Merz did not work. And again he changed his strategy, his tone, drafted a ten-point paper himself to limit migration, offered himself to Merz, and said on Markus Lanz about the CDU’s vote with the AfD: “Mistakes can be healed.” There is more that the SPD and CDU have in common than what divides them. If not chancellor, then at least minister in a government with Merz and Scholz. That was the new plan. And many of Habeck’s supporters must have realized by now: The former do-gooder, the Greens’ great hope from the last election campaign, seemed to be primarily concerned with one thing: himself, with his position. Having power was more important to him than political ideals. Habeck’s last hope was the success of the BSW – of all things That is the case with many politicians. But Habeck’s bad luck was that the Left, led by the young East German Heidi Reichinneck and the former Greenpeace activist Jan van Aken, showed that there was another way: the uncompromising fight against the right, the commitment to left-wing ideals and green politics. The Left’s poll ratings shot up. The Greens warned against voting for them. In vain. In the end, the Left were the winners and the Greens the losers. And Robert Habeck also lost his direct mandate in the Flensburg-Schleswig constituency – to the CDU candidate. His last hope was, of all things, the Sahra Wagenknecht coalition, which Habeck had accused of being “bought by Russia” during the state election campaign. If the BSW had received more than five percent, the CDU would have needed the Greens as well as the SPD for a coalition, and they would have taken on government responsibility – and Robert Habeck would probably have become a minister. But the BSW did not make it. The CDU does not need the Greens for the government. On Monday, Habeck announced that he no longer wanted to take on a leadership role. An end that seems almost symptomatic of a man who for a long time no longer seemed to know what he stood for – or against. In the end, he was not dependent on the outcome of his politics, but on a party he despised. Regarding that comment about some BSW members crying foul over the vote of Germans living abroad – as one of the members of that particular club I’ve seen a noticeable amount of anecdata from Germans mostly living in the US and Canada that their ballot documents didn’t arrive in time or at all. Apparently that’s not unusual based on comments from some members of a forum I’m on, but it seemed worse this time. The way voting works for Germans abroad is that you need to get in touch with the town you were last registered to vote in and they’re supposed to mail you the ballots. The excuse this time around was that the local election offices didn’t get the final candidate lists until very late and had to rush the ballots to the printer and out the door. Given how long it can take to get a letter from Germany to the US, I’m expecting that a fair number of people will have received their ballots too late to send them back in time or will get them after the election. Not that this is a massive surprise for me as I’ve lived about half my life outside Germany and I didn’t get the impression that the bureaucracy is set up to deal with their citizens living abroad very well, at least not during the last quarter century. Did I vote? No. I fell foul of a law that states that one has to petition the Bundeswahlleiter for permission to vote if one lived abroad for more than 25 years. That tends to take a while from what I heard (would’ve been my first time) and with the short notice for the election, it wasn’t even feasible to go through that process and have the documents sent out in time. In NJ you can vote from Europe by email (with a printed copy as backup). I am disheartened by BSW’s near miss from entering the Bundestag — Sarha Wagenknecht offered something otherwise missing from the German political scene. Instead it looks like more “radical centrism” and a continuation of the policy failures of the German political establishment. Where there is no vision, the people perish … I am disheartened as well. I reckon we’re not the only two. Wasn’t she regularly polling in the teens? It looks like the flashy new Linke’s youth scene drained Sarah’s support just in the last months. Very disappointing, but one can hope that the trad Left will become useful again. Following the #BSW hashtag on Twitter a bit, I also read people saying that in recent months die Linke had received a bunch of positive press, extra coverage which apparently was unusual. Just speculating, but no doubt this media campaign was designed to draw people away from the BSW. AfD is quite useful to the establishment centrists and to the oligarchs, as has been explained in comments above. BSW and any serious popular left movement is a threat. “…And yet the priority is more weapons to fund an unwinnable war and prevent the Russians from conquering Europe — a threat for which there is still no evidence and makes no sense if you spend ten seconds thinking about it. But on the plus side from the perspective of the European vultures, it provides cover to continue dismantling the welfare state and privatize everything from infrastructure to social services…” “…The US and Russia could work out some rapprochement, which some in Washington believe will help with other wars in the Middle East, as well as the looming confrontation with China….” And if no war with China materializes, all that money was thrown at “AI” hype which is nearly ALWAYS presented needing to be urgently adopted “becuase China.” Three years in, couldn’t understand then and can see consequences now. I cannot fathom why anyone would favor fighting a war you are going to lose. FWIW Macron arrived at the White House today. Trump did not receive him at the entrance. Adam Tooze – a few of the statistics are in English via FT Deutschland 2025 – A live (and complicated) democracy. https://substack.com/@adamtooze/p-157799674 p.s. Democracy? Well I guess you can spin it in any way. Who can fail to be charmed by Lord Bebo’s clip of the delightful Annalena’s expression of joy at finally achieving the goal her grandfather shared with the Mustache Man and for which he so bravely continued to fight for at the Oder even after Germany’s unconditional surrender? I hazard that it takes a real man, a prime example of pure blooded German manhood, to continue committing war crimes long after the war is over. He, too, was probably a vegetarian who never killed a living creature for food. Regarding Annalena Baerbock’s €700 billion (yes, euros) for Ukraine, that money really looks like its coming. I know some people consider this to be some Russian disinformation, so here is a link to a pro-Ukraine news site telling the story: https://united24media.com/latest-news/europe-eyes-unprecedented-eur700-billion-military-aid-plan-for-ukraine-5981 (though the site credits Berliner Zeitung as the source) It isn’t just the war that is in favor of this package. The military support package is about the same size as the €750 billion NextGenerationEU (NGEU) programme, which was set up to help EU countries cope with the Covid pandemic, and was financed with EU common debt. The NGEU programme increased the EU debt from 50 billion to 300 billion, which not only made larger investments possible, but also made the EU a bigger player in the bond market. The NGEU programme will end in 2026, so the EU needs another similar package to maintain its economic influence. “Regarding Annalena Baerbock’s €700 billion (yes, euros) for Ukraine…” I thought this was sarcasm, but evidently a serious Western European proposal. To me, the reality would be self-destructive madness. On the hidden transformation of the German LEFT PARTY as the cause for its sudden “success”: German daily JUNGE WELT: https://archive.is/28kXW From: Issue of 25.02.2025 , page 3 / Focus 2025 federal election Left strengthens Western ties Triumphantly back: The Left Party owes its return to the Bundestag primarily to a change in preferences among the urban “progressive” electorate By Nico Popp If the Left Party’s 4.9 percent in the 2021 federal election marked the transition from the latent to the open party crisis, then the 8.8 percent (4.35 million votes) in the early federal election in 2025, or so it seems, represent its conclusion. Two months ago, after years of political and organizational decline and at three percent in the polls, still almost written off, the Left Party has managed a comeback that no one expected. No other party has made such gains in the election campaign, no other has gained so many members. The Left Party had actually based its election campaign on winning at least three direct mandates, because a second vote result of more than five percent was still considered almost unattainable at the turn of the year. In the end, the party won six constituencies directly, four of them in Berlin, where Die Linke was also the strongest force in terms of second votes with 19.9 percent. Co-party leader Ines Schwerdtner won the mandate in Berlin-Lichtenberg, Gregor Gysi in Treptow-Köpenick, Pascal Meiser in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg and Ferat Koçak in Neukölln. Neukölln is the first “western constituency” that the party has ever won. In the Berlin-Mitte and Berlin-Pankow constituencies, the Left Party candidates were only narrowly defeated by the Green candidates. The former Thuringian Prime Minister Bodo Ramelow won the Erfurt-Weimar-Weimarer Land II constituency, Sören Pellmann again won the Leipzig II constituency (the only Saxon constituency that did not go to the AfD). What happened here? Clearly, in the middle of the ongoing election campaign, a political constellation arose that was extremely favorable for the party, but which the party did not bring about itself. This constellation has resulted in considerable parts of the urban “progressive” electorate, who have voted for the Greens for decades (and in some cases for the SPD or Volt in the 2024 European elections), but who nevertheless steadfastly maintain the self-image of being “left,” making the transition to the Left Party – albeit only at the last minute and against the very specific background of the election campaign focusing on the interrelated issues of migration and dealing with the AfD. Pascal Meiser’s victory in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, which had long been considered a Green “model constituency,” is exemplary in this respect, and was not anticipated by anyone in the party just a week or two ago. This development is particularly striking when contrasted with the finding that the election campaign focused on social policy issues in the party’s old strongholds, the eastern German states or a former 50 percent constituency such as Marzahn-Hellersdorf, has not led to a return to previous highs. Here, the party has at best slightly improved on the comparatively poor result of 2021. The sudden and steep rise was driven by significant gains in the western German states (and especially in the big cities), where the party has recently performed disastrously. On Sunday, however, it also climbed above five percent in Bavaria, Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein, i.e. in large states that were previously considered particularly “difficult” for the party. The party was particularly successful here and elsewhere in constituencies with university towns, where the Greens have long been the main winners. In the Münster constituency, for example, Die Linke received an above-average 12.5 percent of the second vote (plus 7.5 percentage points), in Bonn 12.5 percent (plus seven), and in Freiburg 13.9 percent (plus seven). Overall, the individual state results of the Left Party in the West and in the East are no longer so far apart. This is a first in the party’s history, in which the success (or failure) in a federal election always depended on the result in the East German states and in which, even in the phase of the party’s initial successes, such as the 2009 federal election, the gap between the results in the West and the East was very large – not to mention the PDS years, when the votes were almost exclusively obtained in the East and repeated attempts to “expand” to the West failed. This chapter now seems to be finally closed – the former strongholds in the East are no longer there, but the party has prospects of approaching ten percent of the vote in the western German states under favorable conditions. The focus of the party’s voters and members has shifted to the West. With this election, the party apparatus has achieved two long-held goals: breaking into the “progressive” electorate of the Greens and SPD and at the same time reducing dependence on the old strongholds in the East. The attempt to stabilize this state of affairs by further forcing political and programmatic adjustments to the new clientele will not be long in coming. addendum to the article: Background: More crosses The early federal election has at least brought about a moderate repoliticization: the non-voter bloc, which had grown to almost a quarter of those eligible to vote in federal elections, has shrunk somewhat. 82.5 percent of those eligible to vote – 49.9 million – cast their vote this time (2021: 76.6 percent). This is the highest voter turnout since the GDR was incorporated into the Federal Republic in 1990. The lowest voter turnout was recorded on Sunday at 77.7 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, the highest at 84.5 percent in Bavaria. According to the preliminary results published by the Federal Returning Officer on Monday, the Union won the election. The CDU and CSU together received 28.6 percent of the second votes, while the AfD, which almost doubled its 2021 result, received 20.8 percent. They were followed by the SPD (16.4 percent), which fell by almost ten percentage points, Alliance 90/The Greens (11.6 percent) and the Left Party with 8.8 percent. The FDP, which played a key role in bringing about the end of the traffic light government in November 2024, is no longer a member of the Bundestag with 4.3 percent. It has lost about two-thirds of its 2021 vote share. The BSW, which entered the race for the first time in a federal election, narrowly failed to clear the five percent hurdle. On Monday, the Federal Returning Officer reported 4.972 percent of the vote (2.46 million votes) for the party; in the end, it was about 13,400 votes short. The party performed above average in eastern Germany – best with 11.2 percent in Saxony-Anhalt, where it also finished ahead of the Left Party (10.8 percent). The party also achieved double-digit results in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. It is striking that the party only received 9.4 percent in Thuringia, where it had received 15.8 percent in the state elections in September 2024 – so entering a coalition with the CDU and SPD cost a lot of votes. Another key factor in the narrow failure was that the party remained below five percent everywhere in the west, with the exception of Saarland. In North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous federal state, 4.1 percent of voters voted for the BSW. In the Bundestag, which has shrunk to 630 seats as a result of the traffic light coalition’s “electoral reform”, the Union parties have 208 seats, the AfD 152, the SPD 120, the Greens 85 and The Left 64. In addition, there is a single representative from the SSW. Apart from the AfD, with which no party wants to work together, the Union, as the strongest force, only has a parliamentary majority with the SPD. Popps article analyzes the surge of the party “The Left” correctly: “considerable parts of the urban “progressive” electorate, who have voted for the Greens for decades (and in some cases for the SPD or Volt in the 2024 European elections), but who nevertheless steadfastly maintain the self-image of being “left,” making the transition to the Left Party”. Estimated 700.000 voters flocked from “The Greens” to “The left”. That means: it is a borrowed success. The “Left” abandoned their old working class base in exchange for the academic salon bourgeoisie. The latter tends to look for moral purity instead of material interests based on the respective position in the economic process. It is to expect that this “greened left” will act like “The Greens” and say yes to “project Ukraine”, to “no borders/no nations” and to the neoliberal-authoritarian EU. On election night a fried reminded me of the “demise” of the Kipping party wing. Later I realized that actually it is not the temporary past demise that is of interest but its partial fulfillment now. THIS was Kipping´s idea: sneak away GREEN voters to the LINKE. After GREENS betrayed their promises this project materialized with one smart move: They “woked” the LEFT without calling it that. Your email address will not be published.

Some elections are hard to fathom. Amid a wave migrant attacks, greenie energy devastation costing the country its global competitiveness, and a surge of populist conservative victories from political upstarts elsewhere -- in Italy, Netherlands, and other parts of Europe, as well as the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina, Germany opted for the same-old stale conservatives who brought them to the state of where they are. According to NBC News: BERLIN — Germany woke Monday to the aftermath of a bruising election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes and far-right nationalists surged to huge gains, causing dismay in a country deeply wary of its Nazi past. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is under surveillance by German intelligence over suspected far-right extremism, experienced its largest-ever share of the vote, garnering the support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump administration. Merz is very much a globalist: GERMANY - The Globalists win again. New chancellor Friedrich Merz is their perfect pick. âªï¸Ex Chairman of Blackrock Germany âªï¸Dedicated to deeper EU integration âªï¸member of the WEF’s Board of Trustees âªï¸ regular atendee WEF in Davos âªï¸attended Bilderberg Group meetings… pic.twitter.com/kkG3hPwTfw — Bernie (@Artemisfornow) February 24, 2025 Sure, they threw a nest of leftist vipers out, which I suppose is an improvement. The far-left SPD trashed Germany's energy production in the name of going green, mismanaged the country's economy, spent up a storm, left Germany a military weakling, and opened the country's borders to the absolute bottom of the barrel in illegal immigrants, enforcing no laws against them, which has led to a string of terror attacks and a sea of crimes. presumably, the CDU/CSU, led by the inexperienced and unfortunately named Friedrich Merz (can we call you 'Fred'?), will hopefully clean up at least some of that. And on the bright side, NBC News described the results as "causing dismay," forgetting that every election has a winner and a loser and one of them is going to be unhappy. But the upstart AfD should have won, not the stodgy CDU/CSU, if Germany were ride the world's populist trend. Call me impatient, but they should have won. They could have joined the Trump-like nations, brought back law and order, thrown the illegals out, ended green nonsense, and restored their nation's greatness. Their moment seemed to be now, but they didn't win. Sure, they made gains, but they didn't win. How many times have we heard this kind of story in Europe? Germany just held their election. They require photo ID and use paper ballots. They hand-count the votes of each station one by one. No electronic voting machines due to security concerns. 50 million votes. It was all done in 8 hours. pic.twitter.com/542MgrGVXX — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) February 24, 2025 Worse still, Merz has stated that he plans to form a coalition with the outgoing SPD leftists, the third-place finishers who took 18% of the vote, their worst result in decades, bypassing the AfD because he considers them basically Nazis, ignoring that Nazis carried 'socialism' right there in their name as well as game. That pretty well means the socialists will be calling the shots, given the experience we know here in the states of RINOs aligning with leftists. They all go leftist when that happens. The AfD will be completely shut out of power, much as France's upstart party led by Marine Le Pen got that number pulled on them a couple years earlier. For us, the Germans will probably be a pain in the keister, with Merz stating he will distance himself from the U.S. If that means Germany pays its NATO bills and adopts a responsible energy policy, we can salute them anyway. If that means Germany gets rid of its open immigration and at least repatriates criminals, even better. But more likely, they will just obstruct the U.S. in the name of consensus or what the U.N. wants, making themselves a drag on the alliance. Elon Musk, who loudly supported AfD, noted that it was young people, particularly in the battered east, who supported AfD in the greatest numbers, meaning, the picture isn't entirely bleak -- the young people will continue to build strength for this party as the older, more cautious, generation dies off. As Rich Baehr has noted, movements take time to build strength and compared to the last election, this was impressive. The layered building of this party is continuing, much as has been seen elsewhere, because up until now, they were nowhere on the map. If the momentum continues, they will eventually win. But oh, it's so disappointing to see that, as Thomas Lifson once told us, the Germans "just want to be nice people." That seems to be the dynamic here, and one can only hope that for Germany, it's not too late to change course and become the dynamic nation they ought to be. Image: X screen shot Some elections are hard to fathom. Amid a wave migrant attacks, greenie energy devastation costing the country its global competitiveness, and a surge of populist conservative victories from political upstarts elsewhere -- in Italy, Netherlands, and other parts of Europe, as well as the U.S., El Salvador, and Argentina, Germany opted for the same-old stale conservatives who brought them to the state of where they are. According to NBC News: BERLIN — Germany woke Monday to the aftermath of a bruising election in which the center-right conservatives won the most votes and far-right nationalists surged to huge gains, causing dismay in a country deeply wary of its Nazi past. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is under surveillance by German intelligence over suspected far-right extremism, experienced its largest-ever share of the vote, garnering the support of Elon Musk and others in the Trump administration. Merz is very much a globalist: GERMANY - The Globalists win again. New chancellor Friedrich Merz is their perfect pick. âªï¸Ex Chairman of Blackrock Germany âªï¸Dedicated to deeper EU integration âªï¸member of the WEF’s Board of Trustees âªï¸ regular atendee WEF in Davos âªï¸attended Bilderberg Group meetings… pic.twitter.com/kkG3hPwTfw Sure, they threw a nest of leftist vipers out, which I suppose is an improvement. The far-left SPD trashed Germany's energy production in the name of going green, mismanaged the country's economy, spent up a storm, left Germany a military weakling, and opened the country's borders to the absolute bottom of the barrel in illegal immigrants, enforcing no laws against them, which has led to a string of terror attacks and a sea of crimes. presumably, the CDU/CSU, led by the inexperienced and unfortunately named Friedrich Merz (can we call you 'Fred'?), will hopefully clean up at least some of that. And on the bright side, NBC News described the results as "causing dismay," forgetting that every election has a winner and a loser and one of them is going to be unhappy. But the upstart AfD should have won, not the stodgy CDU/CSU, if Germany were ride the world's populist trend. Call me impatient, but they should have won. They could have joined the Trump-like nations, brought back law and order, thrown the illegals out, ended green nonsense, and restored their nation's greatness. Their moment seemed to be now, but they didn't win. Sure, they made gains, but they didn't win. How many times have we heard this kind of story in Europe? Germany just held their election. They require photo ID and use paper ballots. They hand-count the votes of each station one by one. No electronic voting machines due to security concerns. 50 million votes. It was all done in 8 hours. pic.twitter.com/542MgrGVXX Worse still, Merz has stated that he plans to form a coalition with the outgoing SPD leftists, the third-place finishers who took 18% of the vote, their worst result in decades, bypassing the AfD because he considers them basically Nazis, ignoring that Nazis carried 'socialism' right there in their name as well as game. That pretty well means the socialists will be calling the shots, given the experience we know here in the states of RINOs aligning with leftists. They all go leftist when that happens. The AfD will be completely shut out of power, much as France's upstart party led by Marine Le Pen got that number pulled on them a couple years earlier. For us, the Germans will probably be a pain in the keister, with Merz stating he will distance himself from the U.S. If that means Germany pays its NATO bills and adopts a responsible energy policy, we can salute them anyway.

Title: An action plan for net-zero compatible with budget constraints

VLRS - stock.adobe.com When it comes to IT sustainability, the present economic uncertainty and political swings from diametrically opposite policies regarding climate change present a significant challenge to IT leaders. They require a technology roadmap to navigate these turbulent times robust enough to adapt to economic and political volatility. Sujata Kukreja, general counsel and chief compliance officer at network management platform Expereo, urges tech leaders to manage sustainability with innovation and take into consideration the running costs of inefficient datacentres. “We have to invest money and we are very conscious of datacentre energy consumption,” she says. Expereo therefore continues to prioritise emissions reduction, even if it’s costly. The procurement team increasingly seeks renewables-based arrangements. It’s about having a longer-term focus, especially with artificial intelligence (AI) tools coming in, says Kukreja. “But our investors are not going to continue if we’re not a business with purpose.” Another company that expects to continue to focus on emissions reduction and science-based targets despite economic pressures worsening in the past year is Crown Worldwide. Chris Davis-Pipe, chief information officer at the global logistics firm, commands a 70-strong enterprise IT team with 3,000 staff across business units in some 50 countries. “We’re working to get more visibility of the carbon we’re using and how to turn things off when we don’t want to use them,” says Davis-Pipe. “We stick solar on warehouses, we’re looking at using more renewable electricity, then we’re also moving from our own datacentres to more cloud-based services.” Customers increasingly demand information on emissions reduction, including a plan with science-based goals and demonstrable progress. Crown’s carbon-accounting platform has been calculating its carbon footprint, with 66% of estimated emissions accounted for by the end of 2023. It doesn’t plan to roll back the strategy, but it is buying more software and services off the shelf. In the past, it would have built its own. In-house IT skills have refocused on integration and data analytics, he says. Crown has also given countries and branches more leeway to improve IT environments locally – for instance, to achieve agility or efficiency within a governance framework. “We have core systems – main service delivery and financial systems – globally, but we’re much more open now for people to solve local issues locally,” Davis-Pipe explains. Automation and AI – beyond Copilot content in marketing – are also areas where the company is alert to future use cases that support the business and its net-zero goals, he says. Many firms may be in a similar position. Sarwar Khan, sustainability director at BT Group, reports that the company – and many of its partners and customers – are doubling down on net zero despite various pressures. “I sit in the business arm, with support for SMB [small and mid-sized business] customers, public sector, wholesale including channel partners. And the pressure to reduce [environmental] impact is not going away,” Khan confirms. “It’s a key priority.” While smaller businesses have “serious concerns” in terms of how they’re going to be sustainable and comply with net zero by 2050, they’re not backing off despite increasingly realising it’s an enormous task. Meanwhile, more specific key performance indicators (KPIs) on carbon, often revised quarterly, are appearing in the public sector. “SMBs are looking to big organisations, like us, to lead and support them,” says Khan. “In corporates, too, many are probably in that disillusionment phase, realising that they have to figure out how to operationalise it.” BT this year brought forward its annually reviewed net-zero target for the business to 2031, and for the customer and supply chain to 2041 – from 2050. How? “First, we looked at how we accelerate our plan on EV [electric vehicle] transition, as one of the largest fleet operators in the UK. Second, we looked closely at what we could reduce across our supply chain.” About 70% of BT emissions are Scope 3, so supply chain efficiencies are crucial. Tier 1 contracts are coming in for specific attention, he adds, and must have a science-based net-zero target against which they disclose performance. “If you don’t move the dial in that [Scope 3] space, getting to target is very difficult,” says Khan. BT is doing more advocacy – including alongside competitors – as well as looking at the make-up of its renewables certificates and power purchase agreements. Multiple innovations and efficiencies are crucial as datacentre power demand rises, Khan points out. Jon Healy, chief operating officer (COO) at datacentre solutions provider Keysource, reiterates that customers are shifting their net-zero strategies, including increasingly pushing suppliers to do more and reveal more rather than pulling back. Previously, some net-zero plans weren’t viable. “In our world, they’re not going to get more customers if they’re not addressing their own emissions. Of course, what’s difficult is to get there despite the pressures, including speed to market, constrained supply chains and demand for compute,” Healy maintains. “This has an impact right back to the drawing board, to strategic decision-making about where an organisation goes and which projects are fundamental.” Consequent designs have to underlie and underpin sustainability and carbon intensity, as well as support datacentre sector growth. Entire ecosystems are being evaluated. Upcoming infrastructure refreshes look likely to reap the benefits of currently evolving data, frameworks and metrics. “Companies must understand where their carbon emissions sit and what’s causing impacts or generating those emissions, and really pinpoint the detail to realise savings,” says Healy. Mary Jacques, director of global environmental, social, and governance (ESG) and regulatory compliance at Lenovo, agrees. It is continuing to focus on full carbon accounting, increasingly homing in on Scope 3 supplier emissions, partly in response to customer requirements across its portfolio. It’s not about taking your foot off the pedal temporarily in response to unfavourable economics, she says. With AI particularly, there’s demand to understand full impacts and help customers build up AI investments and infrastructure “in the right way”, Jacques adds. “These are long-term commitments by their nature,” she points out. “Ours, including the net-zero targets, remain the same.” Progress towards lower emissions continues under the surface of reports, commentators suggest. For example, bidirectional information flows between Lenovo, customers and suppliers are still developing, but ultimately, organisations will better quantify and reveal progress on emissions. Michael O’Hara, founder of not-for-profit support group Techies Go Green, is aware of economic pressures affecting organisational emissions reduction plans. That said, he believes what’s going on is more a readjustment of expectations and deflation of greenwash, even overhyped “green growth”. “It’s like in the 1990s – the internet was going to change how we did business, and there was huge investment, and then the dot com crash. But slowly, surely, the ‘enlightenment’ period happened, maybe 10 years later,” says O’Hara. “The sustainability hype kicked in after the 2016 Paris Agreement and Biden took office, and when BlackRock said they’d prioritise sustainability investments in 2020.” If he’s right, going green looks about halfway along. O’Hara says we can still see longer-term sustainability and profitability. Short-term thinking can be the enemy in business, as much as in politics with leaders only looking to their next election. “Among our members, there’s still positive sentiment, but there is a slowness in moving forward and putting in the investment. To be honest, a lot of [previous] net-zero goals have been too high,” O’Hara says. Over time, though, he expects emissions reduction to embed into company cultures, not least as data and transparency improve, with teams increasingly buying into the requirements. Until now, this has proven difficult in many companies, with sustainability sometimes tasked to the marketing person or receptionist, rather than someone with physical levers to pull. A lot of education and information communication still remains to be done as well. O’Hara points out that people are still joining Techies Go Green – it now has 650-plus members and targets 1,000. That suggests many still take emissions reduction seriously. Ben Brial, founder of green platform engineering company Cycloid, agrees there’s progress, especially on carbon accounting. Yet “short-cut” generative AI (GenAI) projects, such as China’s DeepSeek, should remind industry that alternative paths to innovation can exist beyond brute-force financial scaleup. “Prior to AI, many had this mindset about ‘we grow at any cost’. The goal was to go faster, regardless of resource use,” says Brial. But organisations can develop new, more economical, more sustainable methods and strategies, including in emissions reduction. “Cheaper is not new, but the idea of pushing to use less resources is kind of a new game-changer,” says Brial. “We can think our way to different solutions and ways of achieving our priorities, goals and objectives.”

Projects Images Products Folders AD Plus Benefits Archive Content Maps Audio Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is a comprehensive urban planning strategy aimed at creating dense, walkable, and vibrant neighborhoods centered around public transportation hubs. By seamlessly integrating residential, commercial, and recreational facilities within close proximity to transit nodes, TODs seek to reduce automobile dependency, increase public transit ridership, and stimulate local economic development. Government agencies play a pivotal role in supporting these developments through zoning reforms, easing floor area ratios (FARs), selling air rights, and facilitating public-private partnerships to secure capital for public infrastructure. While TODs have gained global traction, East Asia boasts some of the most successful examples. Conversely, efforts to replicate these models in different contexts—such as New York City—highlight the importance of adapting TOD principles to local conditions, geographical characteristics, and community needs.

High population density ensures steady transit ridership and foot traffic for new developments, making significant investments in public transportation and related developments economically viable. The region's commitment to modern technology and continuous infrastructure upgrades contributes to reliable, efficient transit systems, further reinforcing public reliance. In cities like Hong Kong and Singapore, policies also actively discourage private car ownership: Hong Kong imposes automobile taxes for new vehicles typically exceeding 80%, while Singapore requires a Certificate of Entitlement (COE) that can surpass USD 70,000 just to own a car. These measures make public transportation the practical choice for the majority of residents.

Authorities often spearhead the planning and financing of these projects to ensure alignment with long-term urban strategies. Mixed-use developments—combining residential, retail, office, hotel, and recreational functions—are a common feature, fostering neighborhoods that remain active throughout the day and night. Climate considerations also play a vital role; given the region's frequent hot and humid weather, TODs are designed to offer comfortable, climate-controlled environments, sometimes at the cost of unsustainable practices such as large-scale continuous air-conditioning. Far from being just transit points, these hubs serve as essential community spaces where people gather, shop, and socialize, thus embedding themselves into the fabric of daily urban life.

Related Article Twenty Years of Transforming Transportation: Where Are We Now? The Case of Hong Kong: Transit as Both Infrastructure and Refuge Hong Kong's TOD model is globally renowned for its efficiency and seamless integration of transit infrastructure with commercial and residential spaces. Major transit nodes such as Admiralty, Hong Kong Station, and Kowloon Station have evolved into vibrant, multifunctional hubs that serve both commuters and local residents. Admiralty Station, which opened in 1982, exemplifies this approach. Originally established as a key interchange between multiple subway lines and bus routes, the development encompassed multitude of economic activities and services. It encompasses large-scale shopping malls, world-class hotels, modern office towers, and access to essential public facilities, including courthouses and parks. Admiralty's continual evolution has reinforced its status as a critical transit nexus; today, the area hosts over four luxury hotels, serviced apartments, high-end retail spaces, and extensive office complexes, including one built by Paul Rudolph as well as Zaha Hadid's latest addition, all interconnected with an ever-expanding subway network.

Beyond commercially driven TODs, Hong Kong also demonstrates the effectiveness of residential-focused developments strategically positioned near transit hubs. Tai Koo Shing, completed in 1985, is a notable example. Adjacent to its namesake subway station, the development comprises 61 residential towers with more than 12,500 apartment units. This close proximity to reliable public transportation has significantly enhanced property values and improved the overall quality of urban living for residents. The success of Tai Koo Shing underscores a core principle of Hong Kong's TOD strategy: fostering convenient, high-density living environments that prioritize accessibility, economic vitality, and long-term urban sustainability.

The success of Tai Koo Shing underscores a core principle of Hong Kong's TOD strategy: fostering convenient, high-density living environments that prioritize accessibility, economic vitality, and long-term urban sustainability. One of the defining features of Hong Kong's TODs is their active climatic control as a response to the city's weather conditions. With summer temperatures often exceeding 33°C (91°F) and humidity levels nearing 90%, air-conditioned transit hubs provide essential relief for commuters. These conditioned indoor spaces become informal extensions of public life, offering places to meet friends, relax, or simply escape the sweltering heat while waiting for a train. These hubs double as vital communal areas in a city with scarce outdoor public space.

Hong Kong's success with TOD is largely driven by the "Rail + Property" model pioneered by the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation. By leveraging land development rights around transit stations, the MTR finances the expansion and upkeep of its rail network through co-developments or the sale of air rights for property projects. This approach ensures the functionality of TODs and fosters the creation of dense, mixed-use neighborhoods. The synergy between transit infrastructure and real estate development creates a sustainable, self-financing urban ecosystem where transit accessibility, commercial vitality, and residential convenience reinforce one another.

The Case of Japan: Connectivity, Convenience, and Community Japan's TODs are distinguished by their exceptional focus on connectivity and user convenience. Major transportation hubs such as Tokyo, Shinjuku, and Shibuya stations exemplify how transit nodes can evolve into vibrant, multifaceted urban centers. Tokyo Station, a key national gateway, successfully leveraged the sale of its air rights to neighboring developments, generating the capital necessary to fund an extensive rehabilitation and modernization project. This initiative revitalized its aging infrastructure while enhancing its role as a central transportation hub. Shinjuku Station—renowned as one of the world's busiest—attracted significant private investment through zoning incentives that allowed for increased floor area ratios (FAR). This policy enabled the integration of public amenities, cultural venues, and commercial enterprises within the station's complex, transforming it into a dynamic urban nexus. Meanwhile, Shibuya Station prioritizes pedestrian connectivity, employing multi-level walkways and carefully designed circulation routes to navigate its densely built surroundings, thus improving ease of movement for thousands of daily users.

Rail commuting is deeply ingrained in Japanese culture, with many residents regularly traveling significant distances for work. For instance, the approximately 55-kilometer journey between Kyoto and Osaka takes a mere 25 minutes on conventional trains (not high-speed trains), making long-distance daily commutes both practical and common. This efficiency surpasses even that of other well-regarded transit systems like Hong Kong. Recognizing these commuting patterns, Japanese TODs are designed as comprehensive service hubs where commuters can shop, dine, and complete errands without deviating from their transit routes. These station complexes have become essential social spaces, frequently serving as meeting points for friends and family. The country's extensive high-speed rail network further reinforces this role. A trip from Tokyo to Hiroshima—spanning over 800 kilometers—takes just over four hours by train without the need for time-consuming security checks or prolonged boarding procedures. To put this in perspective, a similarly timed journey in the United States, such as the train ride from New York to Boston, covers less than half that distance at approximately only 350 kilometers. This stark contrast underscores Japan's exceptional integration of local and long-distance rail systems, positioning TODs as indispensable elements of the nation's urban and social fabric.

A Case Study in New York: When TOD Ambitions Meet Local Realities New York City's Hudson Yards project was envisioned as a flagship TOD, anchored by the extension of the No. 7 subway line. The development aimed to create a modern, mixed-use neighborhood featuring luxury residences, upscale retail, and expansive office spaces. While Hudson Yards has primarily succeeded in attracting major corporations such as BlackRock and Pfizer, other aspects have underperformed. Residential sales have lagged behind initial projections, and the high-end shopping mall—anchored initially by Neiman Marcus—has struggled with declining foot traffic, leading to the conversion of several retail spaces into office use.

Residential sales have lagged behind initial projections, and the high-end shopping mall—anchored initially by Neiman Marcus—has struggled with declining foot traffic, leading to the conversion of several retail spaces into office use. The shortcomings of Hudson Yards underscore the importance of contextual sensitivity in TOD planning. Unlike the integrated transit hubs of Hong Kong and Tokyo—where major TODs function as central nodes within a larger, interconnected network—Hudson Yards operates as the last stop of Manhattan's transit system. Despite being geographically central, its location on the west side lacks the seamless connectivity that characterizes successful TODs in East Asia. For example, in Hong Kong, the journey from the international airport to Kowloon Station takes less than 30 minutes, delivering passengers directly into a mixed-use district with offices, hotels, and residential towers above the transit hub. This convenience facilitates door-to-door international business travel and contributes to the area's vibrancy and commercial success. In contrast, Hudson Yards' comparatively limited transit connections and absence of efficient airport access hinder its appeal as a truly integrated transit destination.

The development's focus on luxury experiences has also narrowed its user base. Whereas East Asian TODs typically incorporate essential services, affordable retail, and accessible public spaces to attract a broad demographic, Hudson Yards emphasizes high-end retail and upscale dining, making it less relevant to everyday New Yorkers. This exclusivity undermines the broader community engagement that TODs strive to foster. Hudson Yards illustrates that the replication of TOD principles without careful adaptation to the local urban fabric, commuter habits, and socioeconomic diversity can limit a project's potential to become a positive, inclusive urban hub.

Context Matters: From Transit Nodes to Urban Ecosystems The success of TODs in Hong Kong and Japan demonstrates that effective transit-oriented developments do far more than simply erecting buildings near train stations. They seamlessly integrate transportation with residential, commercial, and social infrastructure while responding to local climate conditions, cultural commuting habits, and community needs. In contrast, Hudson Yards reveals how TODs have its flaws when architectural spectacle is prioritized over everyday functionality or when developments fail to embed themselves within existing urban systems and ridership patterns. Even in East Asia, TODs are not without shortcomings; mega-development proliferation risks displacing local communities and replacing rich urban fabric with homogenized retail environments and standardized residential towers. Such outcomes highlight the importance of balancing large-scale planning with sensitivity to existing neighborhoods and cultural heritage.

TODs should be considered more than mere transit nodes; they should serve as integral parts of the urban ecosystem, enhancing quality of life, promoting inclusivity, and ensuring long-term resilience for diverse urban communities.

Title: Who Is Friedrich Merz, Poised to Be Germany's Next Chancellor

Friedrich Merz, a man who has never held a government role, is preparing to take the reins in Germany just as the country faces its biggest economic and diplomatic crises in decades and Europe looks urgently for a new generation of leaders for an era of transatlantic tension. Merz's conservatives came first in Germany's national election on Sunday, according to projected results, well ahead of their closest rival, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), giving him a mandate to form a coalition government. "Germany will once more be governed reliably," he told supporters on Sunday evening. The results spell an unlikely third-act triumph for the 69-year-old, who just seven years ago was seen as a failed politician fully reconciled to ending his career as a wealthy lobbyist and member of numerous company boards. A protege of the late Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister and icon of German fiscal conservatism, Merz enjoyed a meteoric rise through his Christian Democrats, becoming the party's parliamentary leader in the 2000s. Tall and with a sonorous voice, the arch-conservative Merz was a perfect figure for the party in 1989 - when he first won elected office for the European Parliament. Hailing from the Sauerland, a Catholic upland region in far western Germany known for its social conservatism and close-knit village communities, he embodied many of the virtues of West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall - transatlanticist, business-oriented and socially conservative. However, reunification in 1990 allowed Angela Merkel, the East German daughter of a protestant pastor, to enter politics and elbow both Schaeuble and Merz aside on her rise to become chancellor. The east continues to be Merz's weak spot. A Forsa poll on Friday showed that unlike his Social Democrat and Green rivals, this distinctly Rhineland figure is still far less trusted in the east than the west. It is also the east that gave rise to the greatest challenge to Merz's authority in the guise of the far-right AfD, which took first place in one eastern regional election last year and could yet greatly constrain his ability to govern after the elections. Never the favourite of his party's professional advisers, Merz was twice rejected as Merkel's successor as party leader, in 2018 and 2021, before his doggedness won out in 2022. He took office pledging to kill off the nativist AfD by breaking with Merkel's centrism and moving the party rightwards. The AfD, on 10% when he took office, won some 20% in Sunday's election, according to projected results. "I want to do politics so that a party like the AfD is no longer needed in Germany," he told a congress of his conservatives in January, blaming the Social Democrat Scholz and his Green partners for creating the conditions that nurtured the AfD. In January, responding to two high-profile killings in which immigrants were the main suspects, he manoeuvred to get a resolution demanding a clampdown on migration through parliament, knowing that it would only pass with AfD support. Critics, even in his own ranks, saw this as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine designed to keep the AfD out of power. For some, it was a case of Merz's strategic sense not matching the acute tactical skills that enabled him to repeatedly pin down Scholz, first with a 2022 visit to Kyiv that exposed the chancellor's hesitancy on supporting Ukraine, and then by getting a court to strike down a budget, setting in motion the chain of events that collapsed Scholz's government. The migration vote created a lingering sense of distrust, and fueled concerns that he may struggle to persuade other parties to govern with him, a necessity in Germany's proportional electoral system. "I don't want to suggest Merz plans (a coalition with the AfD), but I have to say my personal confidence that he won't do it after the election if that's his only way of becoming Chancellor - that's gone," said Ulf Buermeyer, host of the popular and influential podcast State of the Nation. Some internal critics grudgingly sense his Atlanticism, excellent spoken English and negotiating skills honed in the boardrooms in which he served during his political hiatus make him a good candidate for the Trump era. An early and outspoken backer of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, he has said he would under some circumstances send Kyiv the high-end Taurus missiles that Scholz has always blocked. On fiscal policy, his policies are equally ill-defined, but he has suggested he is open to reforming constitutionally-enshrined debt limits that doomed Scholz's government and have hampered attempts to boost military spending. For all that, he is in many ways an old-fashioned figure from the time before he left politics for a lucrative second career at Blackrock that made the hobby pilot wealthy enough to own an aeroplane. Parts of his policy agenda are reactive: he has pledged to scrap an unemployment benefit and easier citizenship rules introduced by Scholz's coalition, and to introduce tougher border controls. He once told an interviewer that he would leave politics if it ever placed his 40-year-marriage, to Charlotte, a judge, under strain. "For me that price would be too high," he said. If he takes office, he will be the first chancellor with children, and the first not previously divorced, since Helmut Kohl left office in 1998. He has been assiduous about building contacts with the European leaders who would be his peers, with some welcoming the prospect of an end to Scholz's divided and indecisive government. "Almost undiplomatic," was how one European diplomat described the enthusiasm with which Paris was awaiting Merz's arrival. Last weekend's Munich Security Conference saw him doing the rounds of European leaders and holding meetings with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. But world leaders may have to wait: with polls showing a real chance of a parliament with as many as seven parties, Germany could be in for many months of fractious coalition talks before Merz walks into Berlin's riverside chancellery.

Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) said Sunday that forcing Ukraine to agree to a resource deal with the U.S. in exchange for the possibility of support against Russia is akin to “victim extortion.” The moderate Republican said Russian President Vladimir Putin, who launched the invasion of Ukraine three years ago, should be the one forced to pay. “Putin, and Putin alone, should bear the economic costs of Putin’s illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine,” Fitzpatrick said in a post on the social platform X. “To force Ukraine to pay these costs is the epitome of victim-blaming and victim extortion.” (Excerpt) Read more at thehill.com ...

Title: Ambulances, helicopters and medical advice: Behind the scenes at one of Ireland's 999 call centres

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. CHANCES ARE THAT if you’ve dialled 999 or 112, it has been a worrying time in your life. But for over 230 staff at the National Ambulance Service, your call was just one of around 1,000 emergencies that are processed at their command and control centres every day. The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), where calls are taken, is split across two sites: one is based in Tallaght in Dublin; and a smaller site is based in Ballyshannon in Co Donegal. In Tallaght, Martha Loorem can see the Dublin Mountains from her desk as she answers the phone to people in need from a centre that’s five storeys up. “It can be very varied; you know it pretty much covers everything,” she tells The Journal when asked to describe her work. “It can range from somebody with a cough or a cold [who doesn’t] know where to go for help or [who doesn't] have a GP, right up to… very tragic, very traumatic cases, and everything in between really.” Although no two emergencies are the same, Loorem says that there are some common features in the calls – and common types of caller – that they get. Every call-taker follows a script and inputs the caller’s answers about the situation they’re ringing about in order to determine the seriousness of the incident. Call-takers work 12-hour shifts, some during the day and some at night, but everyone alternates on a shift pattern. “I like the mix, so I wouldn’t want to do either full-time; I actually like switching between the two,” Loorem says. “I think it just suits me, I don’t really think I have a body clock any more. I suppose in terms of why I chose the job, I wanted to do something that I thought I would find rewarding. “There are calls where people are very, very sick, and they’re genuinely panicked, and they really don’t know what to do or where they’ve just seen something tragic; they need that reassurance on the other end of the phone as well, not only that the help is coming, but [that they can be told] what to do.” “When you have those calls where you know you made a difference, that is quite rewarding, and it is quite satisfying to bring somebody from being panicked to quite panicked, and then the ambulance gets there, and paramedics take over.” Martha Loorem, an Emergency call-taker with the National Ambulance Service Alex Rowley Alex Rowley As The Journal walks through the control room, it feels surprisingly calm given the number of people in it and the work they’re doing. However, Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin assures us that things can get hectic during peak hours. “Everybody is trained as an emergency call taker,” he explains. “Technically, everyone is classed as an emergency medical controller… Generally, the journey is call taking, and then some will decide they want to take on dispatch.” There are rows of desks on either side of the room, with supervisors in a back corner who oversee everything. Screens hang from the ceiling which show how many call-takers are active across both call centres in Dublin and Donegal, as well as how many calls are coming in and the number of response vehicles that are in active use at a given time. At a dispatcher’s desk, Amy Curtis sends crews in the southwest of the country out to calls. She joined the NEOC after completing a PLC in the Pre-Paramedic Fire and Ambulance course at Blackrock Further Education Institute. Curtis spent two years as a call-taker before moving into her new role as an Emergency Medical Dispatcher just over six months ago. In her job as a dispatcher, she collates all the information received by call-takers and assigns an appropriate response vehicle and crew to the emergency. Dispatchers have to take into account a myriad of factors, including the severity of an emergency, vehicle availability, and the safety of the scene. “Dispatching is a lot more fast-paced than call-taking,” Curtis says. “I would call dispatching like putting pieces to a puzzle; you’re trying to figure things out for each case. Every crew member is your responsibility from the start of the shift until the end. “You need to know where all your crew members are and who is going where, because sometimes when the radio is going, and you are on your own at the desk, there could be six or seven radio transmissions, and you need to know what each crew is doing to be able to prioritise which crew you answer first.” Trainee dispatchers are mentored by a senior member of staff for 13 shifts before becoming fully qualified. This may seem like a relatively short schooling; however, Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin points out that although it is a particularly difficult job, NEOC staff are constantly receiving further education through the HSE’s learning and development programmes. Advertisement “It is an extremely challenging environment for the dispatchers because [they are dealing with] multiple calls, and are getting a lot of information thrown at them from the radio and the people around the desk. “It’s about assimilating that information and putting it in a logical order in terms of its priority, and figuring out what each piece of information does to your next decision.” Larkin explains that there are various layers to learning how to dispatch, but that the ultimate outcome is patient care. All staff are licensed by the academy, and there is mandatory continuous learning associated with re-certification every two years. In yet another corner of the room, there is a set-up that looks like a mini situation room: it contains a whiteboard with codes, call signs, and maps with a row of desks in front. This is where the aero-medical dispatch desk is located, and the team that sit there are responsible for coordinating helicopter responses to medical emergencies. In Ireland, there are two helicopters available to the National Ambulance Service. The Air Corps operates one air ambulance from the Custume Barracks in Athlone, which is staffed by military pilots, an Air Corps Emergency Medical Technician, and an advanced paramedic from the NAS. In Cork, the ambulance service contracts another, smaller helicopter based in Rathcoole. In addition, the Coast Guard has four rescue helicopters based in Shannon, Dublin, Waterford, and Sligo, which are on hand to assist the ambulance service if required. The Coast Guard can organise medical evacuations for critically ill patients to other countries, such as England. It’s also responsible for pre-planning and dispatching the Critical Care Retrieval Service (CCRS) – like an intensive care unit on wheels, enabling critically ill patients to be transported to a major hospital alongside a team of specialist doctors, nurses, and pre-hospital practitioners. The National Emergency Operations Centre in Tallaght Alex Rowley Alex Rowley Daragh Lettice is one of the members of that team, and explains how he co-ordinates air ambulances to 999 incidents anywhere in Ireland, liaises with the Irish Coast Guard for search and rescue missions, and works with emergency teams for mountain rescues. “We also look after repatriations with a wider HSE group, the Treatment Abroad service, [looking after] any injured parties on holidays or whatever the case may be, technically, for anywhere in the world,” he says. “The flip side of that is that if we have a patient going out of the country, we would arrange all the logistics again. That may involve ambulance transport or an air ambulance with the Irish Air Corps, or from a list of private suppliers that are contracted to the HSE. The team also carries out vital work helping children who are on organ transplant lists, called the ‘Priority 1′ service. In those cases, the team’s job is to keep children’s details – their addresses, next of kin, and passports – on file and up to date. If a call comes in for transport, there is a four-hour window from the time of the call to get a child to the hospital, whether that’s in the UK or elsewhere. “Our goal is always to get advanced life support to the scene of an incident that may warrant helicopter transfer.” Lettice explains. “We see it as a completed mission if we deploy the advanced paramedic to the scene, regardless of whether the patient flies to the hospital or goes by road”. But what is the work like day-to-day? Duty Control Supervisor John Larkin puts considerable emphasis on the working environment of the control room and the overall culture within NEOC. The aim is to ensure that each staff member can operate at the highest level every day. The control room is full of people with experience working in clinical settings and in different parts of the HSE, with whom younger colleagues can liaise if they’re faced with a problem. There are also strong support structures in place for anyone who wishes to avail of them, should they feel overwhelmed by a particular emergency. “What we are really after here culturally is an environment where people can perform to their maximum ability but also an environment that encourages escalation and cooperation, so that nobody is sitting at their desks wondering, ‘What will I do here?’,” Larkin says. “We are very open about it: if you have an issue, put your hand up, and we will fix it together. “If that is on the aeromedical desk, dispatch desk, or call-taking desk, it doesn’t matter. “If we know about it, we can put the remediation in, and that is the culture that we absolutely promote.” Sometimes, those tasked with responding to 999 emergency calls need help too.

Title: Who is Friedrich Merz? Meet the conservative leader taking the reins of the German chancellery
URL: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2025/02/23/germany-election-who-friedrich-merz/79860012007/
Time Published: 2025-02-23T21:33:41Z
Full Content:
Friedrich Merz, a man who has never held a government role, is preparing to take the reins in Germany just as the country faces its biggest economic and diplomatic crises in decades and Europe looks urgently for a new generation of leaders for an era of transatlantic tension. Merz's conservatives came first in Germany's national election on Sunday, according to projected results, well ahead of their closest rival, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), giving him a mandate to form a coalition government. "Germany will once more be governed reliably," he told supporters on Sunday evening. The results spell an unlikely third-act triumph for the 69-year-old, who just seven years ago was seen as a failed politician fully reconciled to ending his career as a wealthy lobbyist and member of numerous company boards. A protégé of the late Wolfgang Schaeuble, finance minister and icon of German fiscal conservatism, Merz enjoyed a meteoric rise through his Christian Democrats, becoming the party's parliamentary leader in the 2000s. Tall and with a sonorous voice, the arch-conservative Merz was a perfect figure for the party in 1989 – when he first won elected office for the European Parliament. Hailing from the Sauerland, a Catholic upland region in far western Germany known for its social conservatism and close-knit village communities, he embodied many of the virtues of West Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall – transatlanticist, business-oriented and socially conservative. However, reunification in 1990 allowed Angela Merkel, the East German daughter of a protestant pastor, to enter politics and elbow both Schaeuble and Merz aside on her rise to become chancellor. The east continues to be Merz's weak spot. A Forsa poll on Friday showed that unlike his Social Democrat and Green rivals, this distinctly Rhineland figure is still far less trusted in the east than the west. It is also the east that gave rise to the greatest challenge to Merz's authority in the guise of the far-right AfD, which took first place in one eastern regional election last year and could yet greatly constrain his ability to govern after the elections. Never the favorite of his party's professional advisers, Merz was twice rejected as Merkel's successor as party leader, in 2018 and 2021, before his doggedness won out in 2022. He took office pledging to kill off the nativist AfD by breaking with Merkel's centrism and moving the party rightwards. The AfD, on 10% when he took office, won some 20% in Sunday's election, according to projected results. "I want to do politics so that a party like the AfD is no longer needed in Germany," he told a congress of his conservatives in January, blaming the Social Democrat Scholz and his Green partners for creating the conditions that nurtured the AfD. In January, responding to two high-profile killings in which immigrants were the main suspects, he manoeuvred to get a resolution demanding a clampdown on migration through parliament, knowing that it would only pass with AfD support. Critics, even in his own ranks, saw this as an unforgivable breach of a political quarantine designed to keep the AfD out of power. For some, it was a case of Merz's strategic sense not matching the acute tactical skills that enabled him to repeatedly pin down Scholz, first with a 2022 visit to Kyiv that exposed the chancellor's hesitancy on supporting Ukraine, and then by getting a court to strike down a budget, setting in motion the chain of events that collapsed Scholz's government. The migration vote created a lingering sense of distrust, and fueled concerns that he may struggle to persuade other parties to govern with him, a necessity in Germany's proportional electoral system. "I don't want to suggest Merz plans (a coalition with the AfD), but I have to say my personal confidence that he won't do it after the election if that's his only way of becoming Chancellor - that's gone," said Ulf Buermeyer, host of the popular and influential podcast State of the Nation. Some internal critics grudgingly sense his Atlanticism, excellent spoken English and negotiating skills honed in the boardrooms in which he served during his political hiatus make him a good candidate for the Trump era. An early and outspoken backer of supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, he has said he would under some circumstances send Kyiv the high-end Taurus missiles that Scholz has always blocked. On fiscal policy, his policies are equally ill-defined, but he has suggested he is open to reforming constitutionally-enshrined debt limits that doomed Scholz's government and have hampered attempts to boost military spending. For all that, he is in many ways an old-fashioned figure from the time before he left politics for a lucrative second career at Blackrock that made the hobby pilot wealthy enough to own an aeroplane. Parts of his policy agenda are reactive: he has pledged to scrap an unemployment benefit and easier citizenship rules introduced by Scholz's coalition, and to introduce tougher border controls. He once told an interviewer that he would leave politics if it ever placed his 40-year-marriage, to Charlotte, a judge, under strain. "For me that price would be too high," he said. If he takes office, he will be the first chancellor with children, and the first not previously divorced, since Helmut Kohl left office in 1998. He has been assiduous about building contacts with the European leaders who would be his peers, with some welcoming the prospect of an end to Scholz's divided and indecisive government. "Almost undiplomatic," was how one European diplomat described the enthusiasm with which Paris was awaiting Merz's arrival. Last weekend's Munich Security Conference saw him doing the rounds of European leaders and holding meetings with U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. But world leaders may have to wait: with polls showing a real chance of a parliament with as many as seven parties, Germany could be in for many months of fractious coalition talks before Merz walks into Berlin's riverside chancellery.

Title: Friedrich Merz: conservative set to be Germany's next chancellor

Time Published: 2025-02-23T18:58:20Z

The Local Europe ABVästmannagatan 43113 25 StockholmSweden A long-time rival of centrist ex-chancellor Angela Merkel within the CDU party, Merz has attacked her open-door migrant policy and drawn her ire for accepting support from the far-right AfD on the flashpoint issue in parliament. At age 69, trained lawyer Merz boasts a strong business background -- including at investment fund BlackRock and on many corporate boards, which made him a millionaire -- but has never held a government leadership post. Nonetheless, the combative orator seeks to project a statesman-like persona and has voiced confidence he can deal with mercurial US President Donald Trump, whom he has labelled "predictably unpredictable". As the three-way coalition of centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz floundered, Merz as head of the opposition CDU/CSU block rained withering fire on the outgoing "green-left" government. Polls had long declared Merz -- despite lukewarm personal approval ratings -- the strong favourite to oust Scholz and bring an end to what Merz labels "three lost years" for Germany. In a recent blistering parliament speech, Merz likened Scholz and his allies to business managers who have bankrupted a company but still ask to extend their contracts by four years. "Do you know what the owners would say once they stopped laughing?" Merz asked mockingly. "They would politely ask you to leave the company. That's how it is in normal life." Merz's campaign promise was to revive the ailing economy and rebuild Berlin's international standing for "a Germany we can be proud of again". On Sunday a jubilant Merz -- eager to get going with his decades-old dream to run the country -- urged speedy talks to forge a new coalition government, warning that "the world out there is not waiting for us". 'Zero tolerance' Among his toughest pledges is to shut German borders to undocumented migrants, even if they seek asylum and to detain those awaiting deportation. Merz has in the past labelled the sons of Muslim immigrants "little pashas" and accused some Ukrainian war refugees of "social welfare tourism", before later apologising. Last month, Merz sparked high drama in parliament -- and waves of street protests -- when he pushed through a motion signalling his immigration crackdown with support from the extreme-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), breaking a long-standing taboo of never dealing with the controversial party. In other signals of a rightward shift, Merz has vowed a "zero tolerance" law-and-order drive, to reverse marijuana legalisation, limit "woke" policies and gender-sensitive language and study a return to nuclear power. READ ALSO: Tax to citizenship - What should foreigners in Germany expect from a CDU-led government? Merz argues all this will lure voters back from the AfD. But he may yet have to temper some of his policies as he seeks one or more coalition partners. Scholz during the campaign sought to portray his rival as a "hothead" and charged that his dalliance with the AfD signals he would one day rule with the far-right party -- a charge Merz strongly rejects. News magazine Der Spiegel has said Merz takes conflicts personally and is sometimes given to fits of anger, opining that "if Merz were a bullfighter, he would probably hold the red cloth in front of his stomach". Hobby pilot Merz, who is Roman Catholic, was born on November 11th, 1955, and lives among the rolling hills and forests of the Sauerland region of North Rhine-Westphalia state. At 198 centimetres (or six feet six inches) tall, Merz stands out in a crowd and is a licenced pilot who sometimes flies his own private jet. He has been married for more than 40 years to Charlotte Merz, a judge, with whom he has three adult children. He was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and soon after to the Bundestag, where his mentor was the late CDU powerbroker Wolfgang Schaeuble. After chancellor Helmut Kohl's long reign ended in a slush fund scandal, Merkel soon sidelined Merz to take over the party and went on to run Germany for 16 years. For over a decade, Merz pursued a career in the private sector but never gave up his life-long ambition of becoming chancellor. A free-market liberal who wants to cut corporate taxes and slash red tape to help Germany Inc, he outlined his views in a 2008 book titled "Dare More Capitalism". Merz has sought to turn his long stint in the business world into a key selling point, said political scientist Antonios Souris of Berlin's Free University. "He likes to flirt a little with this role of having returned to politics as an outsider, as an experienced captain of industry, not just a career politician like Scholz." His CV and personal wealth have left Merz open to charges of being out of touch with voters -- an accusation he has rebuffed by insisting he belongs to the "upper middle class".

After winning the German election, the conservative leader must navigate a new era without Washington as a close ally. This article is also available in: French BERLIN — Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany’s most American chancellor. Never in history has a German head of government had more affinity for the United States. Merz has traveled to the U.S. over 100 times, by his own tally, and counts former U.S. President Ronald Reagan as one of his role models. Merz, whose conservative alliance looks to have won Sunday’s national election with 29 percent of the vote, according to early official projections, is particularly fond of one Reagan quip that summarizes the German leader’s American-style skepticism of state intervention: “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: ‘I’m from the government, and I’m here to help.’” But just as Merz is on the cusp of taking power in Germany, his cherished America has turned from indispensable friend to frenemy. Merz and other European mainstream leaders increasingly see the U.S. no longer a beacon — that “shining city upon a hill,” as Reagan liked to call it — but rather as another force joining Russia and China to steadily chip away at their ever-more brittle democracies. “This is really now the change of an era,” Merz said on stage at the Munich Security Conference earlier this month after U.S. Vice President JD Vance gave a speech that cast Europe’s centrist parties — not Russia or China — as the greatest threat to European security. “If we don’t hear the wake-up call now,” Merz added, “it might be too late for the entire European Union.” Vance’s appearance in Munich is likely to go down in European history as an epochal shift just as significant as Vladimir Putin’s 2007 speech at the same conference, when the Russian president effectively declared war on the U.S.-led liberal order. Now, it’s the U.S. administration itself that is turning its back on that consensus. German leaders, including Merz, have been especially slow to accept the new reality, declaring until recently that the transatlantic alliance will endure despite clear signals from the Trump administration that it will halt military aid for Ukraine, question the U.S. commitment to defend Europe, and bolster far-right, Kremlin-friendly forces. For Merz, an avowed transatlanticist, there could hardly be a ruder awakening. The question that will define his tenure will be whether he can lead Germany and Europe in defending the fraying liberal order without the U.S. — or whether, as Merz suggested in Munich, it’s already almost too late. This wasn’t how Merz had imagined his long-sought moment of victory. Born a decade after the end of World War II in Sauerland, a rural, mountainous region of West Germany, Merz was, by his own account, a less-than-spectacular student and an early smoker and drinker prone to disciplinary problems. Despite that rebellious streak, he was influenced by the deeply embedded conservative culture of the area and joined the center-right Christian Democratic Union while still in high school. After serving a brief stint in the military, Merz went to university in Bonn, then the capital of West Germany, where he studied law. Merz became a conservative member of the European Parliament in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. Five years later he was elected to the German Bundestag, where he developed a close relationship with Wolfgang Schäuble, the CDU stalwart and forceful advocate of European Union integration. Under Schäuble’s tutelage, Merz rose in stature and was considered a likely choice for chancellor candidate. His rise ended in 2002, however, when he lost a power struggle with the more centrist Angela Merkel. Note: Without rounding, BSW’s result stands at 4.972 percent; Source: ARD Seeing no role for himself in the CDU under Merkel, Merz withdrew to the back benches, and in the midst of the world financial crisis of 2008 published a paean to free markets titled “Dare for More Capitalism.” A year later he left the Bundestag to work as a corporate lawyer while also taking the helm of Atlantik-Brücke, a lobby advocating transatlantic ties. While with Atlantik-Brücke, Merz pushed for an EU-U.S. trade agreement — the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP — and forged closer connections with the U.S., networking with American politicians and corporate leaders. One of his favorite places in the U.S., he told biographer Volker Resing, is the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, where the former president is buried. Over a decade in the private sector, Merz sat on a series of corporate boards, including a four-year stint with U.S. asset manager BlackRock, a time he counts as among the happiest in his life, according to biographer Resing. Merz says this time provided him valuable experience outside of politics, but his critics accuse him of simply using his political connections to lobby for powerful interests, making himself a millionaire in the process. When Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018, Merz saw an opportunity to return to politics. Merkel’s centrism and generous refugee policies, Merz believed, had opened up the CDU’s right flank and allowed the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Merz set out to undo much of Merkel’s legacy and aimed to pull the CDU sharply to the right. The party, looking for reinvention after 16 years of Merkel and an election loss to Olaf Scholz’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) in 2021, elected him chairman in early 2022 on his third attempt for the job. “I am deeply moved,” Merz said after the vote, fighting back tears. Though Merz and his conservatives emerged victorious in Sunday’s election, surveys suggest he’s not particularly popular among the public. In a country that remains deeply skeptical of the financial industry, Merz’s wealth and time at BlackRock, the American investment company, are often viewed with suspicion. It doesn’t help matters that Merz routinely jets around the country in his own twin-engine plane, which he flies himself, having fulfilled a lifelong dream by getting his pilot’s license in his 50s. “Friedrich Merz is not really very beloved, but he is respected,” Günther Oettinger, a former senior CDU politician and European commissioner, told POLITICO late last year. Yet Merz also has a reputation for being impulsive, thin-skinned and prone to populist bluster, particularly when it comes to migration. His defenders say he’s merely a risk-taker — at trait he took from his years in the private sector — and someone who doesn’t shy away from sharp-tongued debate. Merz took one of his biggest gambles shortly before the election. After a series of high-profile attacks blamed on asylum-seekers in the months before the vote, Merz saw his conservatives steadily decline in the polls while the AfD rose. In January, after a knife-wielding Afghan man attacked a group of preschool children in a park in Bavaria, killing one child and a man who tried to protect the children, Merz decided it was time for a drastic shift. In a taboo-breaking move that weakened Germany’s postwar “firewall” around the far right, he and his conservatives aligned with the AfD in an attempt to get tough immigration measures through parliament — including a proposal to reject asylum-seekers at the border. In response to Merz’s acceptance of AfD support, tens of thousands of outraged demonstrators turned out in cities across the country. “Merz can no longer be trusted,” said Scholz, whose center-left SPD came third in Sunday’s election. Robert Habeck, the chancellor candidate for the Greens, called Merz’s move “a disqualification” for the office of chancellor. But voters, who were broadly supportive of his tough migration policies, ultimately disagreed, lifting Merz to power. German conservatives have long hoped that Merz’s tough border policies, business background and familiarity with the U.S. will endear him to Donald Trump. “Merz is one of the Germans who is best connected in the U.S.” said Thomas Silberhorn, a conservative lawmaker specializing in transatlantic ties. “In this respect, I am very confident. He also knows the way things work. He is used to the mindset that you have to speak plainly.” Merz has also vowed to make “deals” with Trump. In an interview last month he suggested Germany could endear itself to Trump by buying American F-35 fighter jets and boosting defense spending to put Germany consistently above the NATO spending target of 2 percent of gross domestic product. Despite the U.S. president’s love of tariffs, Merz also floated trying to bring back negotiations on TTIP, which collapsed during the first Trump administration. Until recently, however, Merz’s approach for confronting the Trump administration consisted mainly of denying the enormity of the challenge. Just a day before Vance’s speech at the MSC, Atlantik-Brücke, the transatlantic lobby group Merz formerly headed, published one of his essays on the transatlantic relationship. “Our alliance with America has been, is and will remain of paramount importance for security, freedom and prosperity in Europe,” Merz wrote. With Trump, he went on, “transatlantic relations will change again and yet we will continue to share common values, interests and a common promise of protection within NATO.” A few days later, Merz’s tone changed drastically as he warned of a transatlantic rupture. “The differences between the U.S. and Europe are taking on a whole new quality,” he wrote in a note to his supporters after Vance’s speech. “Now it is no longer ‘just’ about defense; now it is about our basic understanding of democracy and an open society.” Merz compared the moment to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when, as he put it, “we woke up from our dreams and had to learn to understand that our world is no longer what it was supposed to be.” German and European leaders were even more alarmed when Trump, a few days later, blamed Ukraine — not the Kremlin — for starting the war and then called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator.” Following Trump’s statements, Merz warned supporters at a rally in the state of Hesse that the “autocratic behavior at the top of the state” in the U.S. could persist for a long time. “Our response can only be that we must finally become resilient, capable of defense, and able to stand on our own feet in Europe,” he added. In an interview the following day, Merz warned that Europe should prepare for Trump to end NATO protection and hinted at a major strategic shift, saying Germany needed to discuss the possibility of “nuclear sharing, or at least nuclear security” with European nuclear powers the United Kingdom and France. German conservatives have previously favored maintaining strong ties with the U.S. over calls from Paris to cultivate European “strategic autonomy.” Merz’s rhetorical shift showed just how unnerved he now is by the Trump administration. The question is whether Germany’s next chancellor will succeed in taking the EU — itself confronting the rise of Russia-friendly, far-right parties — in a fundamentally new direction. Merz has expressed a willingness to chart a new course, but the way forward remains murky. “Within this Europe, Germany must play a leading role,” Merz said at the rally in Hesse. “We must take on this responsibility. I, for one, am determined to do so.” Nette Nöstlinger and Rasmus Buchsteiner contributed to this report. Conservative leader’s gambit to weaken the postwar ‘firewall’ may be a boon for the AfD ahead of a national election. The AfD is using Elon Musk’s endorsement to reach out to Donald Trump — and to appear more acceptable at home ahead of a national election. The “chameleon” tech billionaire is one of the most powerful politically connected people in the world. Europe’s governments are still working out how to deal with being on his bad side. Dissolving of parliament sets the stage for what could be Germany’s sharpest swerve to the right in decades.

Title: Vitalik Buterin Reveals the Most Disappointing Moment for Ethereum
URL: https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-reveals-the-most-disappointing-moment-for-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-02-23T15:58:02Z

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has voiced concerns over criticisms directed at Ethereum’s stance on blockchain-based gaming applications. During a Wednesday AMA session on the chat app Tako, Buterin addressed user Mable Jiang’s inquiry about moments in the past year that left him frustrated or disappointed with the Ethereum Foundation, its community, or the industry. Jiang also asked if he had ever considered taking a break. In response, Buterin expressed his disappointment, particularly over criticisms that Ethereum is “bad and intolerant” for not embracing blockchain-based casinos as openly as other networks. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” He stated. Despite occasional online rants about the network, Buterin, however, noted he finds comfort in personal interactions with the Ethereum community, most of whom remain committed to the platform’s original values. “I have a responsibility to this community and cannot abandon them. We Ethereum need to work together to create the world we want to see,” he added. Buterin also suggested potential strategic shifts to enhance the network, emphasizing the need for structural improvements for the network and greater decentralization within the Ethereum Foundation. He noted that the foundation, which currently facing a backlash for lack of neutrality, might need to be less neutral at the application layer and take a more active role in supporting certain initiatives. “This will require some changes,” he stated, adding, “But this project is worth doing.” Notably, Buterin’s response comes amid an ongoing debate in the blockchain space about balancing ethical considerations with open access. Some networks, like Solana, have taken a more permissive approach, welcoming applications across various sectors, including gambling and speculative ventures. However, this openness has also led to high-profile failures, such as the collapse of LIBRA, a meme coin on the Solana network. Recently, LIBRA collapsed, wiping out $4.5 billion in investor funds and causing a 15% drop in Solana’s value. Ethereum, in contrast, has long positioned itself as a network focused on decentralization, innovation, and long-term sustainability. These qualities have attracted institutional interest, with entities like BlackRock launching tokenized investment funds on the Ethereum network. Meanwhile, beyond his frustrations, Buterin remains actively engaged in Ethereum’s evolution, particularly its scalability through Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In January, he reaffirmed Ethereum’s commitment to scaling via L2s, identifying key challenges such as insufficient space for BLOB objects and L2 heterogeneity. He detailed upcoming upgrades, such as the Pectra update, which aims to enhance Ethereum’s transaction throughput with long-term goals, including achieving 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). He also underscored the importance of Ethereum’s economic model, advocating for ETH to serve as a “triple point asset,” functioning as a means of exchange, a consumable product, and a store of value. To strengthen Ethereum’s economic position, he proposed incentivizing L2 projects, optimizing rollup revenue structures, and adjusting BLOB pricing strategies.

Title: Open-Access Networks Explained: A New Way to Get Internet

How we test ISPs Open-access networks bring fast fiber to cities across the US, but they don’t operate like typical internet service providers. It's not Santa and his sleigh, but trucks like these bring a present of another kind: the gift of fiber connectivity. Colorful painted symbols decorate the streets a few blocks from my Albuquerque, New Mexico, home. Bright arrows and checks mark hidden water and gas lines. Large trucks with boring machines and vast spools of orange pipe are parked along the sidewalks. They’re here to install fiber for Gigapower, an open-access network. When Gigapower arrives at my house, it won’t be my internet service provider. Gigapower represents a different fiber model. Here’s what home internet customers need to know about open-access networks. Chances are, your home is covered by one or more internet providers, each with its own infrastructure -- whether cable, fiber, DSL or 5G, like my T-Mobile Home Internet. Open-access networks flip this concept on its head. Locating local internet providers An open-access fiber network is installed by a company that then sells access to ISPs. That means you can have multiple providers offering plans for your house. They use the same infrastructure but may have different prices, services and bundles. Don’t be surprised if you haven’t heard about open-access networks before. “Open access is not mainstream,” says Gary Bolton, president and CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association. “It’s kind of an edge case in the US.” Locating local internet providers Bolton says the concept is more widespread in countries where regulations and government involvement mean open access is common. You’re about to hear more about open-access networks thanks to Gigapower’s ambitious plans to expand fiber into previously overlooked communities. “From an operator's perspective, it's a no-brainer because someone else bears the cost of building out the network,” says Bolton. You’ll find two types of open-access networks in the US. Municipally-owned networks are owned by cities. Private companies own commercial networks. They both work in a similar fashion, usually with multiple ISPs competing for customers. The Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency (Utopia Fiber) is a community-owned fiber network covering homes in 21 Utah cities, including Brigham City, Orem, Payson and Woodland Hills. The Utopia communities weren’t satisfied with existing home internet options. They wanted fast fiber. “If the incumbent operators aren't willing to make the investment, then the community takes it in their hands because they need it for economic development,” says Bolton. Gigapower is an example of a commercial open-access network. The company is a joint venture between telecommunications giant AT&T and investment company BlackRock. In Albuquerque, AT&T Fiber is signed on as an anchor tenant, but that still leaves room for other ISPs to potentially jump on board and compete to offer fiber internet to customers. When ISPs share the same network, they want to stand out from the crowd. That can translate into a complex dance of promotions, pricing and streaming or phone bundle options. Gigapower’s rollout is still young, so we have yet to see how this might play out in the longer term, but we can look to Utopia for clues. With the Utopia model, consumers cover two fees. One is the monthly price paid to the ISP and the other is the fiber connection cost for Utopia, which typically runs $30 monthly. Put the two together to get your total. For example, you could sign up for XMission’s 1Gbps plan for $54. Adding in the Utopia fee brings your monthly total to around $85. Bolton says that’s pretty typical for gigabit pricing on an open-access network. “You start seeing there's a lot of bundling going on,” Bolton says. “Providers typically try to find other things of value that they can add to sweeten the deal.” If you’re shopping among ISPs on an open-access network, look at promotions, bundles, add-ons and the provider’s customer service reputation. Scan the Utopia providers’ pricing and you won’t see huge swings at the 250Mbps, gigabit or 2.5Gbps plan levels. But there is one area where pricing varies widely. Not all ISPs offer 10Gbps plans, but those that do have prices ranging from $110 to $200 per month. That won’t likely affect very many customers. Here’s how to figure out how much internet speed you really need. Utopia and Gigapower are two big names in open-access networks, but others exist. Colorado Springs Utilities, for example, is building out with Ting Internet as its initial anchor tenant. Other communities scattered around the country -- including Ammon, Idaho and Ashland, Oregon -- have open-access networks as well. On the commercial side, Ubiquity is expanding with a focus on Arizona, California, Nebraska and Texas. SiFi Networks specializes in citywide open-access fiber with networks under construction in California, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and New York. Cities that feel passed over for fast fiber broadband will continue to consider open-access networks. Meanwhile, Gigapower’s rapid expansion could bring more commercial companies into the fold. “I think it’s a great model and I wouldn’t be surprised if other people took advantage of it,” says Bolton. While gigabit speeds are common across fiber networks, most can offer faster services to homes. Utopia, for example, goes up to 10Gbps with some ISPs. AT&T Fiber typically offers up to 5Gbps. The open-access networks going in across the country can be scaled up to handle the internet demands of the future. “This is the final network for at least the next couple of generations,” says Bolton. There’s a hunger for fiber. Albuquerque has been a cable and DSL town for too long. Gigapower isn’t the only fiber player in the city. Ezee Fiber, Vexus Fiber and Quantum Fiber are all staking out parts of town with traditional networks, but Gigapower is coming in hot. I’ll notice Gigapower when it shows up on my street to install the bright orange tubes to run fiber. After that, I likely won’t give it much thought. I’ll be dealing with AT&T Fiber as my ISP, and, perhaps someday, I’ll be comparing AT&T with a competitor using the same network. Ultimately, what’s most important to me as a customer isn’t how the fiber gets here, just that it gets here. If that means ISPs competing on pricing and bundles down the line, then all the better. An open-access network is installed and operated by a company that leases access to ISPs. That means multiple providers can offer plans to customers using the same fiber network. An open-access network is one way a community overlooked for fiber can access fast, symmetrical broadband services. If private companies aren’t willing to invest, cities can use a municipal model instead. On the commercial side, open access networks remove the burden of installation and operation from ISPs, which can then piggyback on the network to reach customers. Plus, customers may benefit from competition among ISPs looking to differentiate themselves through pricing, customer service, perks or bundles. Competition among ISPs on an open-access network can benefit consumers, but don’t expect cut-rate price wars. There may be slight contrasts in pricing but more significant differences in phone and video bundles or free add-ons like streaming services. Also, look for promotional deals, like one or two months of free service for new customers.

Title: The House of Cards of Russian Aggression Against Ukraine Collapses

The news from the New York Times is explosive: “U.S. Opposes Calling Russia Aggressor in G7 Declaration on Invasion”. U.S. opposition to a draft Group of 7 statement on the third anniversary of the Russian attack on Ukraine comes after President Trump blamed Kyiv for starting the war. Trump’s shift towards Putin’s Russia reverses generations of US policy. At the opening of the peace talks in Saudi Arabia, President Trump made it clear that Russia’s days of isolation are over and suggested that Ukraine is to blame for its invasion. Zelensky and Trump exchanged blows as the feud over the peace talks escalated. President Trump called Volodymyr Zelensky an ‘unelected dictator’ after the Ukrainian President said Trump was ‘in a web of disinformation’. “Europe,” writes the Wall Street Journal, “is looking for a response after Trump blamed Kyiv for the war in Ukraine. Stunned by the US rapprochement with Russia over Ukraine, European leaders are trying to find common ground.” . . . Screenshot from WSJ . Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni “reaffirmed Italy’s support for Ukraine”, but prudently did not go to Kyiv to the commemoration of the third anniversary of the war. Vice-President Matteo Salvini is explicitly siding with Trump, wishing that “he will absolutely go ahead”. The parliamentary left-wing declares through Fratoianni “nothing in common with Trump on Ukraine.” However, it is announced that in Kyiv “the EU will reaffirm Zelensky’s legitimacy as president of Ukraine.” Who Zelensky is and what his role is, we documented in Grandangolo of 11 August 2023. We, therefore, report the essential part of it: Scott Ritter’s investigative documentary showing the offshore companies set up by Zelensky and his associates in tax havens, through which “his puppeteers provided him with a financial cushion” with a first payment of 41 million dollars. The film shows the luxurious villas that Zelensky owns in Miami (this one alone is worth $34 million), in Israel, in Forte dei Marmi (Italy), in London, in Georgia, in Greece, and even in Crimea (the only bad investment, because Zelensky no longer owns it). Scott Ritter’s investigation also shows how Ukraine is being robbed of its most fertile land, sold off by Zelensky and Co. to multinational corporations. Still, it is also becoming increasingly indebted as the huge military supplies he receives from the US and the major European powers are not given away, but given on credit. This debt will increase with the ‘reconstruction‘ that Zelensky has put in the hands of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment company. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Exclusive — Nate Morris: America Has to Fight Back Against the Climate Change, 'ESG Mafia'

Kentucky businessman and potential Senate Republican candidate Nate Morris on Breitbart News Saturday said that America has to fight back against the environment, social, and governance (ESG) “mafia,” noting how large Wall Street firms push leftist policies on corporations. Morris spoke to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle as he considers a potential run for Senate to replace the retiring Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). The Kentucky businessman, who founded a waste management company, said that the pressure he received to back ESG policies was like nothing else, noting that the waste management business often has mafia connections, citing the hit television show the Sopranos. “I’ve never seen extortion like what I saw with the ESG mafia and the thugs that try to push corporate America into doing things that satisfy a political agenda,” Morris said on Breitbart News Saturday. ESG was one of the major vectors by which Wall Street firms, namely asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, could push publicly listed companies to back leftist policies such as anti-climate change policies, diversity quotas, among others. Companies, facing a backlash, stopped employing these controversial policies. Morris then said he invested in Strive, a firm backed by Vivek Ramaswamy, that seeks to push anti-ESG policies, and challenge BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. “We got to fight the ESG mafia that has been coming against our corporate leaders as an extension of politics to satisfy the leftist agenda,” he remarked. Morris said that the country needs to expose “ESG for the scam it is.” Breitbart News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.

It’s halftime at Twickenham and Scotland lead England 10-7. Thank you for your company today. Ireland win in Cardiff and all roads lead to a meeting with France at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday week. Man of the match Jamison Gibson-Park 🗣 "They're an unbelievable team, a proud nation, they showed that today."🗣 "It would be a dangerous thing to do to come over here with preconceived ideas."Player of the Match Jamison Gibson-Park after Ireland's battling win in Cardiff. #WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/Lgv9nrNqt5 MATCH REPORT: Gerry Thornley has his say. “The home side were, as expected, much improved; beyond recognition in truth. As was always liable to be the case, Matt Sherratt had injected enthusiasm, energy and no little cohesion in his first game in charge. Their set pieces were strong and with a much more balanced 9-10-12-13 combination their attack had variety, shape and width. Ireland’s initially confident and smooth start unravelled in large part through ill-discipline and especially scrum penalties. This was compounded by Garry Ringrose incurring a red card following a bunker review for his 35th-minute high hit on Ben Thomas, and Ireland were relieved and indebted to this being a 20-minute red card, not least as Bundee Aki was an ideal replacement.” You can read the full match report here Scotland lead England 10-7 at Twickenham after 24 minutes. James Lowe produced another brilliant performance. He’s what he had to say about a tough afternoon in Cardiff. One of Ireland's key men yet again this afternoon.Great to chat to James Lowe live from Cardiff.#WALvIRE | #GuinnessM6N pic.twitter.com/EM4moAonb0 PLAYER RATINGS: Johnny Watterson gives James Lowe, Jamison Gibson-Park and Jack Conan 8/10. You can read them here A fitting tribute Not sure Finlay Bealham, gets enough credit! Again If you like what you see, please like share and follow, cause I've f#%k all other reasons to do them! 🙏❤️#SixNations #WalvIre @IrishRugby #FinlayBealham #Rugby pic.twitter.com/4dyhpxFZf1 Easterby: “We’re pleased with the result. There’s lots of things we could have done better. I’m pleased with how we got ourselves out of a hole.” ⌚️ Sam Prendergast slotted the three points for Ireland against Wales to steer his side to a win and a Triple Crown in Cardiff 🙌#Breitling #DefiningMoment @Breitling pic.twitter.com/MvYnOUZPWh Watching the Andrew Porter incident again. No wrap from replacement tighthead prop Thomas his arm in tucked and even though it is chest to shoulder, it is not a legitimate attempt to tackle. Therefore should have been a yellow card. Johnny Watterson’s player ratings are going through the subbing machine and will be available here presently. Simon Easterby, calm and measured in victory. Acknowledged some of the shortcomings, gave credit to Wales, which they deserved and pointed to the fact that his tea showed character to see out a match that got sticky.

A stunning cross-field kick to James Lowe! Jamie Osborne is there to collect the ball and score!! #GuinnessW6N pic.twitter.com/5Eq7cq0Lz8 Johnny Watterson’s player ratings, lot of red pen you’d suspect, Gerry Thornley’s match report and all the reaction coming here. That’s a 14th Triple Crown for Ireland. MATCH SNYOPSIS: Ireland led 7-0, trailed 13-10 at half-time and 18-10 early in the second half, before Gibson-Park, Lowe and Osborne combined for the latter’s try and then Prendergast’s boot saw them home. Ringrose had a yellow card upgraded to a red card. Ireland win a Triple Crown. Performance was well below par, individually and collectively. To Ireland the spoils, including a Triple Crown but to Wales the plaudits in performance terms. Coming off a 14-match losing streak, that’s now gone to 15, and given very little hope but the home side was so courageous in defeat, playing some cracking attacking rugby to boot. Ireland will be relieved rather than happy. Finlay Bealham, Ryan Baird and Bundee Aki made a huge difference on their arrival. Full-time: Wales 18 Ireland 27 80 mins: Prendergast takes on long range penalty that drops short after Beirne won a ruck penalty. Wales with one last effort in chasing a bonus point. 77 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Great counter-ruck from Ireland led by van der Flier supported by Gus McCarthy and Jack Boyle leads to a penalty. Henshaw and Baird with key tackles in the build-up. Prendergast is unerring. Gibson-Park announced as man of the match. No argument. Brilliant again. Conor Murray on at scrumhalf Wales 18 Ireland 27 75 mins: Gus McCarthy on for captain, Sheehan. Brilliant again from Osborne in tidying up. Wales 18 Ireland 24 72 mins: Brilliant response from Wales and Ellis Mee is deemed to have scored a try by referee Ridley. His on-field decision is try. Tempest the TMO is rocking and rolling the angle, I think his hand is in touch. 47 angles later. Knock-on. Hits short and it’s a knock-on. That’s unfortunate for Wales. Another superb passage of play in attack. Ireland are very, very lucky. Good work from Hansen, who’s now been replaced by Jack Crowley and Osborne. Boyle and Bealham win a scrum penalty. Crowley is on at fullback, Osborne moves to the wing. Wales 18 Ireland 24 Jack Boyle becomes the 12th St Michael’s College old boy to be capped at senior level by Ireland; 11 have been in the last decade. Michael’s capped players, year of debut and number of caps. 1984 - Derek McGrath (5) 2014 - Noel Reid (1) 2016 - Dan Leavy (11) *Luke McGrath (19) 2017 - Rory O’Loughlin (1) *James Ryan (70) 2018 - *Ross Byrne (22) 2020 - *Ronan Kelleher (39) *Max Deegan (2) 2021 - *Ryan Baird (25) *Harry Byrne (4) 2025 - *Jack Boyle (1) * - still active 69 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. A blood splattered Bundee Aki wins a penalty at a ruck, clamped on after Sheehan’s tackle. Prendergast is going to take it on. It’s two metres inside the Welsh half. The outhalf strikes it superbly. Gibson-Park with a brilliant relieving kick from the re-start. Jack Boyle is on for his debut. Wales 18 Ireland 24 68 mins: Porter is hit in the head by Thomas, referee thinks it’s chest. Ian Tempest agrees. NO further sanction. NO foul play. Wales 18 Ireland 21 64 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Wonderful catch and kick from Lowe. Ryan back on for McCarthy. Gibson-Park with a wonderful sniping break. Hansen denied a try, held up brilliantly by Murray and Morgan. Ireland were on penalty advantage. Hansen might have given Sheehan a scoring pass in hindsight. The Irish hooker and captain asks Prendergast to kick the penalty and the young outhalf bisects the posts. Wales 18 Ireland 21 62 mins: It’s another brilliant counter-attack from Wales who are playing without fear. Width to their attack, first instinct is to offload. Joe Roberts is on for try scorer Tom Rogers. Free-kick Ireland ats scrum, the first after Welsh loosehead Nicky Smith has gone off. Wales 18 Ireland 18 58 mins: Osborne has done superbly in the air for the most part. It’s been a superb post interval response from Easterby’s side. The one caveat is the discipline. 11 penalties now, the latest for a neck roll. Wales 18 Ireland 18 55 mins: TRY OSBORNE. That’s a great reaction from Ireland. On penalty advantage Ireland pack Sheehan, O’Mahony X2, Baird carry and Gibson-Park with a cross-kick with the boot is tapped back brilliantly by Lowe into the waiting arms of Osborne. Prendergast misses the conversion. It’s all tied up. Wales 18 Ireland 18 53 mins: Ireland have conceded nine penalties to date. Fantastic piece of skill from Prendergast, brilliant spiral for a 50/22 after great play from Osborne. Ireland deep inside the Welsh 22. Wales 18 Ireland 13 52 mins: Henry Thomas on for WillGriff John for Wales. McCarthy with a superb play. Ireland scrum. Anscombe off for a HIA. Jarrod Evans is on. No referee changes his mind. Penalty Wales. Wales 18 Ireland 13 50 mins: McCarthy is back on for Ryan having passed his HIA. Wales with some lovely running angles and offloading but Henshaw comes up with a brilliant turnover. Great line kick from Prendergast and Ireland are back up to 15 players, as Aki replaces Ringrose. Wales 18 Ireland 13 47 mins: PENALTY Prendergast. Ireland win a scrum penalty inside the Welsh 22, more direct around the fringes, where there is space. Baird involved several times. Finlay Bealham on for Clarkson. Wales 18 Ireland 13 42 mins: ROGERS TRY. Ireland are panicky. Osborne kicks away possession, Sheehan gives away possession and it all ends in a try for TOM ROGERS. Flamboyant finish. Ireland again the architect of their downfall. Anscombe misses the conversion. Conan off with an injury. Ryan Baird, who didn’t expect to play today, is on. Wales 18 Ireland 10 Ireland will have to survive another 10-minutes a man down until Ringrose’s 20-minute red card is played out and they can bring on Bundee Aki. Referee Ridley confirms the red card ruling as the second half gets under way. “High degree of danger and no mitigation.” James Ryan is on for McCarthy (HIA) Okay, how to unpack that. Ireland conceded four scrum penalties, two against Porter, two against Clarkson. Apart from the opening 15-minutes, they have been very disjointed, dogged by basic mistakes, handling hasn’t been good and some of the decision making has been flawed too. They will rue that missed opportunity when Osborne’s pass to Ringrose went to turf as a try beckoned. That would have out them 17-3 up. Wales though deserve hue credit for the manner in which they have hung around and to be honest played the better attacking rugby. They’ve troubled Ireland particularly out wide. Ireland will need to be a lot more precise and composed in possession. They’ll need to sort out the scrum, be better disciplined and connected in attack and defence. The high point of the Irish half from an Irish perspective The Power of Jack Conan 😮‍💨💪#GuinnessM6N @IrishRugby pic.twitter.com/aIUIWgCk6d RED CARD: Ireland’s Garry Ringrose’s yellow card has been upgraded to a 20-minute red card. Head on head contact on Ben Thomas. The correct decision. Needed to be lower. Half-time: Wales 13 Ireland 10 40(+2) mins: TRY Morgan. Wales on penalty advantage from the lineout after Ireland come in from the side at the maul; van der Flier pinged. Clarkson saved a try with a great tackle. Anscombe kicks the penalty to the corner. Rowlands takes, backs join maul. Wales pound the Irish line, stopped by millimetres until captain, Morgan forces his way over. Anscombe converts. Wales have deserved that. Wales 13 Ireland 10 36 mins: Prendergast hits an upright with a long-range penalty. Superbly struck but the outhalf then knocks on a high ball. Ireland are at sixes and sevens defensively, looking a little ragged on both sides of the ball and there are simply too many missed straight up tackles. Ireland concede a fourth scrum penalty. Leads to a schemozzle. Seven penalties Ireland have conceded, four at scrum time. Wales 6 Ireland 10 31 mins: Ireland are guilty of ball watching at a ruck. Van der Flier protects the ball, but no one goes in to move it on in the absence of Gibson-Park and Ireland penalised for holding on. Osborne with a superb tackle at Wales go on the attack again. They are inside the Irish 22. Ireland are penalised, Ringrose not rolling away. The television match official Ian Tempest advises the referee Christophe Ridley to look at a Ringrose tackle previously. Ringrose receives a yellow card and it will be reviewed by FPRO, Matteo Liperini (Italy). 34 mins: Anscombe kicks the penalty. Wales 6 Ireland 10 30 mins: Should have been a try for Ireland, great work by McCarthy and Peter O’Mahony in the build-up, the visitors sweep wide, but Osborne throws a poor pass. Ringrose was in for a walk in try, if the pass had gone to hand. A long pass was required but Osborne slapping the turf tells you he felt he should have done better. Smith is back in the front row. Scrum is completed. Wales 3 Ireland 10 27 mins: Good work from Ireland, good strike, Conan gets off the base of the scrum superbly and Lowe completes the clearance with his left foot. Wales though are back on the attack and they’re playing some lovely rugby. Wales 3 Ireland 10 24 mins: A poor enough re-start from Prendergast, too far and Tomos Williams with a superb clearance into the Irish half. Ireland kick away possession, Wales get it to the edge. Sheehan rescues his team by covering a kick through but Osborne doesn’t get much on the clearance. Brilliant work from Wales down the touchline but Williams knocks on what would have been a try scoring pass from Jac Morgan. That’s a huge let off for Ireland. Wales 3 Ireland 10 22 mins: Brilliant take from Beirne at the re-start, Sheehan knocked on though and Ireland are caught offside. Anscombe kicks the easy penalty. Wales 3 Ireland 10 19 mins: PENALTY, Prendergast. Gareth Thomas (Ospreys) on for Nicky Smith at loosehead prop. We’re about to have another scrum. Wales 3-0 up on penalties. What will the change do? Ireland win a scrum penalty. Thomas, the new boy penalised. Prendergast points at the posts and thumps it over. Wales 0 Ireland 10 15 mins: Lovely fluency from Ireland in attack, going from one touchline to the other. Move ends when Lowe goes through a gap but loses the ball in contact seven metres from the Welsh line. Wales win a third scrum penalty. Clarkson called again, this time by Gianluca Gnecchi, the other assistant referee. Worrying for Ireland. All three officials have called a scrum penalty against Ireland. Wales 0 Ireland 7 11 mins: Ireland are penalised at the second scrum, this time Thomas Clarkson for dropping his bind. Josh van der Flier reclaims an overthrow at a lineout. Hansen kicks through but Blair Murray rescues Wales and the home side clears. Good work from Lowe and Ringrose. Prendergast kicks the ball away. Wales 0 Ireland 7 8 mins: Good clearance from Jamison Gibson-Park from the re-start, Tom Rogers beats Jamie Osborne to Gareth Anscombe’s up and under. Wales get some continuity. The home side penalised, Elliot Dee for a tip tackle on a ruck clear-out. Tadhg Beirne inverted. Ireland clear but Henshaw knocks on from the long throw over the back. Wales 0 Ireland 7 6 mins: TRY Jack Conan. Superb from Conan, great power and a one-handed fend to stretch and reach over the Welsh line. Prendergast kicks the conversion. Wales 0 Ireland 7 5 mins: Good direct running from Ireland, Taulupe Faletau penalised two metres from his line. The visitors take it off the tail. Joe McCarthy great carry, James Lowe too. Wales 0 Ireland 0 4 mins: A bit of aerial tennis ends in a Welsh knock-on and the first scrum of the match. Collapses. Re-set. Andrew Porter penalised. Call came in from assistant referee Nika Amashukeli. Nothing in it. Ball had gone. Should have been play on. Jack Conan wins turnover. Mack Hansen counter-ruck. Garry Ringrose great grubber for a 50/22. Wales 0 Ireland 0 Ireland kickoff through Sam Prendergast. Roof closed, wonderful atmosphere, passionate rendition of the anthems. Let’s go. A reminder of the teams WALES: Blair Murray (Scarlets); Tom Rogers (Scarlets), Max Llewellyn (Gloucester), Ben Thomas (Cardiff), Ellis Mee (Scarlets); Gareth Anscombe (Gloucester), Tomos Williams (Gloucester); Nicky Smith (Leicester Tigers), Elliot Dee (Dragons), WillGriff John (Sale Sharks), Will Rowlands (Racing 92), Dafydd Jenkins (Exeter Chiefs), Jac Morgan (Ospreys) (capt), Tommy Reffell (Leicester Tigers), Taulupe Faletau (Cardiff).

Time for the anthems. Tommy Bowe knows a thing or two about Irish and Welsh rugby. What is the secret to Ireland's rugby success? 🤔@TommyBowe has his say 🗣️ #BBCRugby #SixNations pic.twitter.com/C0YdCVQPrL Right a little under half an hour to go to kickoff. Johnny Watterson will have green and red markers as he does the Player Ratings post match, Gerry Thornley will have his match report and I’ll keep you up to date with all the post match reaction. Stay here and all that will be coming your way on the blog. We will link everything to this blog. Statistics, the last refuge of the scoundrel. And I’d know. One that caught the eye was that Ireland had just 47% possession in their first two games – the second lowest after Italy (44%) – but they have enjoyed more territory (56%) than any other side and made more entries into the opposition 22 (22) than anyone else. Other reasons to be cheerful from an Irish perspective. Wales have conceded the most (26) and been awarded the fewest (14) penalties of any side in the Six Nations. We'll wear our new alternate white kit in Cardiff on Saturday to help supporters impacted by colour blindness! ⚪️#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/h1D22FiGck The reason that Ireland will wear their changed strip today. In a significant move to support spectators and viewers with colour vision deficiency (CVD), Ireland will wear their new alternate white kit against Wales. This decision, driven by new World Rugby regulations, aims to prevent kit clashes that can be problematic for those affected by CVD. Colour vision deficiency, commonly known as colour blindness, affects approximately one in 12 men and one in 200 women. The traditional red jerseys of Wales and the green jerseys of Ireland create a challenging visual scenario for those with CVD, making it difficult to distinguish between the two teams on the pitch. The stage is set! 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿#TeamOfUs pic.twitter.com/dPIAtAvJ2L Today’s teams WALES: Blair Murray (Scarlets); Tom Rogers (Scarlets), Max Llewellyn (Gloucester), Ben Thomas (Cardiff), Ellis Mee (Scarlets); Gareth Anscombe (Gloucester), Tomos Williams (Gloucester); Nicky Smith (Leicester Tigers), Elliot Dee (Dragons), WillGriff John (Sale Sharks), Will Rowlands (Racing 92), Dafydd Jenkins (Exeter Chiefs), Jac Morgan (Ospreys) (capt), Tommy Reffell (Leicester Tigers), Taulupe Faletau (Cardiff).

Referee: Christophe Ridley (England) Assistant Referees: Nika Amashukeli (Georgia), Gianluca Gnecchi (Italy) TMO: Ian Tempest (England) FPRO: Matteo Liperini (Italy) BREAKING NEWS: Cian Prendergast has had to withdraw from the Ireland bench because of illness and his place goes to Ryan Baird. That’s very unfortunate for the Connacht captain but Ireland are fortunate to have such an accomplished stand-in. A word from the coaches. Simon Easterby: “Playing Wales in Cardiff is one of the great tests and we know the challenge that awaits us. “With a new coaching set-up in place, Wales will be re-energised and determined to impress in front of a vocal home support. “There will also be a huge Irish travelling support which, when added to the closed roof and the great respect and rivalry between the two nations, will add to an electric atmosphere.” He added: “We have made a few changes to the squad this week, some of which were enforced, and we’re confident that the 23 we have selected are primed and ready to go. “Dan’s (Sheehan) selection as captain is recognition of his high standing within the squad, both on and off the pitch. I have no doubt that he will relish the opportunity to lead Ireland for the first time. “Equally, I would also like to congratulate Jack Boyle on his inclusion in the matchday squad for the first time. Jack has impressed for his province Leinster, and in the national training camps over the last number of months, and he’s a young forward with a bright future.” Wales interim head coach Matt Sherratt: “We’re looking forward to the challenge of facing Ireland. We have spoken this week about being brave, but not reckless and making sure everyone knows their roles. “We also know that keeping our discipline will be huge. Everyone is excited for our first home game of the Six Nations. “The atmosphere Wales fans create at the Principality Stadium is incredible, and playing at home is something the players really look forward to.” Love the sentiment behind this image. Good to hear the Wales fans in good voice and spirit as the first rugby special pulls out of Pontypridd for Cardiff this morning #cymru #CYMvIWE #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/Svg9KFVbgO Some important information for those using the train station in Cardiff before and after today’s game. 🏉3 things to remember before coming to watch the Wales v Ireland rugby game today @principalitysta 🧍A post-event queue system will be in place at Cardiff Central❌Cardiff Queen Street station will close at 15:30🎟️Buy your tickets before you board the train pic.twitter.com/dUyzo8bAHq Wonderful atmosphere in Wales (Cardiff) this morning ahead of their #SixNations game against Ireland this afternoon!Great to bump into lots of supporters from home, in a city which is already buzzing. C'mon @IrishRugby - you got this!#TeamOfUs #ShouldertoShoulder pic.twitter.com/RKZR9pBOMK For those of us who have been around a while (!) I remember the Triple Crowns of 1982 and 1985 - our 5th and 6th ever in history. Glory days ! Today we’ll be going for our 8th this century after 04, 06, 07, 09, 18, 22 & 23. @IrishRugby has come a long way …. Welsh Twitter is certainly going all-in on the victory of the Wales Under-20 side as a positive harbinger for this afternoon’s game at the Principality Stadium. I am half expecting to see them point to the fact that the Irish 20s and the senior side were/are in the changed white, and I use that description loosely, strip. Maybe it’s an omen. A little under an hour and a half to go to kickoff in Cardiff. Just enough time to grab a bite and a drink of choice and read Gerry Thornley’s preview Former Wales great Jonathan Davies things that the Welsh 20s can inspire their senior brethern. Great win for Wales U20s just the boost Welsh rugby needed. 👍💪👏👏👏 Time to rip the plaster off the Ireland Under-20s performance in the 20-12 defeat to Wales at Rodney Parade last night. Once again they dominated territory and possession but the same old failings came back to haunt them in the opposition 22, leaving behind oodles of points. To their credit Wales defended with courage and grit, making over 228 tackles to their opponents 67 but the visitors made that job easier with an attack that lacked shape and cohesion and a multitude of handling errors. Nathan Johns was in Newport and here’s his thoughts on Ireland’s shortcomings. The best of both worlds for one Welsh fan. About to make the long long drove to Monmouth services for a @GreggsOfficial And while I’m in the area i thought i might catch Wales playing Ireland in the #GuinnessM6N Say hi if you’re about! pic.twitter.com/S1EIYYQqlp Go well Ireland 🙌#SUAF ☘️ | @SixNationsRugby | #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/TGkgHmnghd The bookmakers have Ireland as 25-point favourites on the handicap for today’s game and offer Wales at 14/1 against on a straight bet, which is long, long, long odds in a two-horse race to mix sporting metaphors. However, the Irish side would do well to remember that the tournament has had some famous upsets in the past, starting on the opening weekend on the first ever Six Nations in 2000. Scotland, the defending Fix Nations champions, travelled to the Stadio Flaminio in Rome to face an Italian side playing their first ever game in the Six Nations and lost 34-20. Italy’s, Argentine born outhalf, Diego Dominguez kicked 29-points. Wales beat raging hot favourites England 31-30 at Wembley in 1999 to deny them a Grand Slam. A late try by Scott Gibbs gave Wales the win and Scotland the title on points’ difference. In 2019 Ireland had just toppled world champions New Zealand in an unbeaten series of matches in November and sat on a run of 12 home wins on the bounce and 18 victories from their past 19 games. England, the visitors, hadn’t scored a try in Ireland in eight years, so it was no wonder that Joe Schmidt’s men down as heavy favourites on the day. England, under Eddie Jones, cruised home 32-20 for only their second win in Dublin since 2003. Italy enjoyed two huge upset wins in Rome, the first in 2011 when the squeezed-out France 22-21 with Mirco Bergamasco the hero, while two years later it was Ireland that suffered a similar fate losing 22-15 in the last game of Declan Kidney’s tenure as head coach. When Scotland beat England 11-6 at Twickenham in 2021, they were 9/2 underdogs with their hosts 1/6 to win that match. England were the reigning champions and it was a first win for the Scots in 38 years at the London venue. Good news and bad news today. Bad news is I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Good news is… I’ll miss the rugby because we’re racing 🤣 Come on boys 💪🙏🏉 #WALvIRE pic.twitter.com/Gpy9NIL9am Hello and welcome to the Irish Times blog for today’s Six Nations match at the Principality stadium. John O’Sullivan here and I’ll be taking you through the afternoon, before, during and after the game. We have some exclusive content too, not just what’s been on the website or in the newspaper. Will Wales get the big game bounce under new management with Cardiff coach Matt Sherratt taking over in an interim capacity following Warren Gatland’s departure, a decision based on mutual agreement between the New Zealander and the Welsh Rugby Union? The home supporters will be hoping that’s a fervent, ‘yes.’ Ireland are also under an interim coach, albeit in happier circumstances, in Simon Easterby, who is caretaking while Andy Farrell devotes himself to the British & Irish Lions head coach’s role. Not sure, when, if ever you would have had two countries facing one another in a Six Nations clash under interim head coaches. That’s not the only similarity. Wales and Ireland share a common identity prior to today’s match as the only two sides capable of winning the Triple Crown in this season’s Six Nations Championship. Ireland have safely negotiated two thirds of that remit with victories over England and Scotland, while for Wales this is the first leg of the treble with games against England and Scotland to come. Ireland take on Wales this afternoon as they look to keep their perfect start to this year’s Six Nations campaign going and claim the Triple Crown, although eyes are firmly set on the bigger prize with a third championship in a row and a grand slam within their sights. Simon Easterby has made seven changes to his side for the game with Dan Sheehan set to captain his country for the first time. Ireland come into the game as heavy favourites after the poor start Wales have had to the tournament and the departure of Warren Gatland.

Title: Here's what to know about Germany's election this Sunday

Rob Schmitz People walk past a truck with an election campaign poster featuring Friedrich Merz, leader of conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), in Oberhausen, Germany, on Feb. 21. VOLKER HARTMANN/AFP via Getty Images hide caption BERLIN — An economic slump, an immigration crisis and the lifting of a security blanket provided for decades by its most powerful ally are on the minds of German voters as they head to the polls for Sunday's national parliamentary election. The general election of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not supposed to come until September of this year. But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election. The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%). The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government. "I'm just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form," says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. "Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break." The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table. Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world. Merz's longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany's parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction. Röttgen has known Merz for more than 30 years. The two entered parliament together and have worked side by side through successive governments. He says Merz has strong beliefs: "Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people," says Röttgen. "And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist." Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies. The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says. "I think Merz, by disposition, would be more open to also support Ukraine more decisively," says Puglierin. "But he has to work in a framework. He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population." After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says. Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic. Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz's potential leadership. "He claims to be up to the job, and we know he's a good businessman, but I worry he will go back on his promise to never enter into a coalition government with the AfD," she says, referring to repeated vows Merz has made throughout the campaign. Another voter, Ulrich Hinz, a 74-year-old retired businessman from Frankfurt, says he thinks Merz's pro-European outlook could help at such a trying time for Germany. "We need a chancellor and a government that is more European and one that can get along better with the French, Italians and the Poles," he says. "That's the only way we are going to be able to keep up with China, Russia, and the United States." Esme Nicholson contributed to this story from Berlin. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor

Title: Travel Startups Raise $580 Million Over Two Weeks

Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:05:20Z

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else In the past two weeks, six travel startups have collectively raised $580 million, showcasing ongoing investor interest in travel technology advancements. Companies like Archer Aviation are leading the charge with significant funding aimed at developing flying taxis, with plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Klook and RoomPriceGenie are leveraging AI and automation to enhance travel experiences and hotel pricing, underscoring a shift towards modernizing traditional travel sectors. Tech companies promising to automate old industries are still getting big investment deals in 2025. Klook, which is modernizing the historically low-tech sector of ticketed experiences, just landed its second large fundraise in the past 18 months. And RoomPriceGenie, despite having several notable competitors, raised $75 million to help hotels automate pricing — an area that’s seen a lot of demand as hotels have been looking to modernize and generate more revenue since the pandemic. While startups developing flying taxis and renewable jet fuel are not producing much revenue yet, they’re raking in large amounts of money with the promise of big business in the future. Six travel startups raised nearly $580 million over the past two weeks. Archer Aviation, which is developing a flying taxi for commercial flights and defense clients, has raised $301.8 million. Investors included funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. The company has now raised over $2 billion, including its most recent deal of $430 million in December. The company said the latest fundraise brings its total liquidity to around $1 billion. California-based Archer is developing an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft called Midnight. It is designed to hold a pilot with four passengers and luggage for urban trips of 20-50 miles at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour. It is powered by six independent battery packs, each supporting a pair of electric engines, the company said. Archer said it now has manufacturing contracts worth over $6 billion. That includes a recent purchasing agreement for up to 100 aircrafts from Soracle — owned by Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation — which plans to operate a flying taxi service in various cities in Japan. The company recently unveiled plans for an air taxi network in Los Angeles ahead of some major sporting events: the World Cup in 2026, the Super Bowl in 2027, and the Summer Olympics in 2028. The network includes vertiports (eVTOL airports) at Los Angeles International Airport, University of Southern California, Orange County, Santa Monica, Hollywood Burbank, Long Beach, and the Van Nuys neighborhood. The company is also planning to establish a vertiport near the SoFi Stadium, home of the Los Angeles football teams Rams and Chargers. The plan is to begin LA network operations in 2026. This is in addition to plans for a network at California airports where Southwest Airlines operates, along with five vertiports in the Bay Area. The funding will go toward the continued development of the company’s aircraft. Klook, an online travel agency for tours and attractions, has raised $100 million The company said that the fundraise brings its valuation to over $1 billion for the first time. Vitruvian Partners led the round. The company last raised $210 million in equity and debt in 2023. Hong Kong-based Klook says it offers hundreds of thousands of ticketed experiences, such as walking tours, in 2,700 destinations globally. The company has also been expanding to offer hotels, trains, and car rentals. The new funding will go toward AI initiatives, such as for enhancing merchant operations, through an expanded partnership with Google Cloud. (See Skift’s story.) RoomPriceGenie, which provides AI-powered pricing tech for hotels, has raised $75 million. The funding comes from Five Elms Capital. Switzerland-based RoomPriceGenie provides a revenue management system for independent hotels and groups. The tech is meant to automate updating room rates based on changing market conditions. Competitors include Duetto, which was acquired by a private equity firm last year. The company says it has more than 3,000 hotel clients in 65 countries. The company also said it appointed Chas Scarantino as CEO. The co-founder and previous CEO, Ari Andricopoulos, is now the chief strategy officer. The funding will go toward expanding internally. Twelve, a renewable jet fuel production startup, has raised $83 million. Investors included DCVC, Amazon (The Climate Pledge Fund), Mitsui & Co., Development Bank of Japan, Japan Hydrogen Fund, Greycroft (Coca-Cola Sustainability Fund), 2551 Capital, SMBC, TPG, Pulse Fund, and others. The company most recently raised a series C round of $200 million in September. The new funding is a mix between an extension of the series C round plus financing to build a production facility. California-based Twelve says its tech generates jet fuel by converting a mix of carbon dioxide from either tanks or the atmosphere, along with water and renewable energy. Airline customers so far include Alaska Airlines and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways. Superlogic, which helps users apply loyalty points to ticketed experiences, has raised $13.7 million in its series A funding. Superlogic, a trailblazer in experiential rewards technology, today announced a first closing of $13.7 million in its Series A funding round. Led by Powerledger led the round, with support from including Sangha Capital, 10SQ, Nima Capital, Actai Unicorn Fund, Hyla Liquid Venture Fund, Liquid 2 Ventures, Amex Ventures, Galaxy Interactive, Mirabaud Lifestyle Impact and Innovation, Recharge Capital, Dispersion Capital, Sanctor Capital, and more. Miami-based Superlogic provides an AI-powered platform that loyalty programs can use to connect users with experiences tailored to their interests. Spark e-Fuels, which is developing tech to make renewable jet fuel, has raised $2.4 million (€2.3 million) in pre-seed funding. Nucleus Capital led the round, with support from Zero Carbon Capital, IBB Ventures, Chemovator, Voyagers.io, 1.5° Ventures, and a group of angel investors. Spark is focused on building its first e-fuel pilot plant and expanding its team to accelerate technology development and commercialization. The Berlin-based startup is developing tech that converts renewable resources like carbon dioxide, into jet fuel. The funding will go toward building its first pilot production plant and hiring.

Title: Coinbase CEO’s Hot Take: Bitcoin Is Basically A ‘Meme Coin’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/coinbase-ceos-hot-take-bitcoin-is-basically-a-meme-coin/
Time Published: 2025-02-21T21:00:16Z
Full Content:
Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, has recently made an audacious statement regarding Bitcoin that has caused quite a stir in the crypto industry. He recently proposed that Bitcoin could be regarded as “somewhat of a meme coin,” which sparked a debate among enthusiasts, analysts, and investors. Like meme currencies, Armstrong pointed out that the value of Bitcoin is essentially derived from popular or collective belief. He explained that unlike conventional assets, Bitcoin lacks inherent value connected with actual objects or direct use. Instead, its value is swayed by societal trust and the shared perception of its significance. He also likened Bitcoin to the US dollar, noting that although the dollar’s value has persisted mostly due to mass acceptance and faith in its purchasing power, and it is not connected to the gold standard. This comparison highlights Bitcoin’s status as a store of value rather than a commodity with inherent worth. Armstrong did not intend to undermine Bitcoin’s credibility; however, his statements underscored the expanding influence of meme coins. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are two cryptocurrencies that have amassed substantial followings despite possessing minimal fundamental utility. On memecoins… Memecoins have generated a lot of buzz recently, and I’ve gotten some questions on how I think about them. I am personally not a memecoin trader (beyond a few test trades), but they’ve become hugely popular. Arguably, they’ve been with us since the beginning –… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) February 19, 2025 For example, Dogecoin, which originated as a joke, experienced a price increase of over 15,000% in 2021 as a result of social media publicity and endorsements from prominent figures such as Elon Musk. Shiba Inu reached an all-time market cap of around $40 billion. This trend is a reflection of how sentiment and viral appeal can push asset valuation up, much like what Armstrong suggests applies to Bitcoin. Armstrong agreed that, in spite of the comparison, Bitcoin is still the most well-known cryptocurrency. The crypto continues to dominate institutional adoption, regulatory discussions, and long-term investment strategies. Meanwhile, the legitimacy of Bitcoin has been strengthened even more by the trust big financial firms like BlackRock and Fidelity have in the crypto asset. Its limited supply of 21 million coins and decentralized nature also sets it apart from the typical meme coin phenomenon. Armstrong’s statement has fueled discussions about how cryptocurrencies derive their value. Some critics argue that equating Bitcoin to a meme coin undermines its role as “digital gold,” while others believe it accurately describes the evolving nature of financial assets in the internet era.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.
