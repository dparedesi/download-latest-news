Ethereum’s 2025 bull rally is garnering serious attention — especially now that BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF has crossed more than $10 billion. This has sparked new optimism about the ETH price, with whispers of a potential breakout to $10,000. With old-school giants joining in, projects such as Remittix (RTX) are trending toward more utility-driven strategies, addressing fundamental pain points in cross-border crypto payments. Ethereum is priced at $3,825.95, which is a 2.33% increase within the past 24 hours. The market capitalization of $461.68 billion positions it at the second-largest crypto rank, behind only Bitcoin. Volume traded is lower by 18.4%, though, and is at $24.35 billion, which could be reflective of a short-term breather after weeks of increasing optimism. Most long-term investors are hopeful the ETH price could retest highs. Legacy institutions launching spot ETFs have given renewed life to Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives, DeFi platforms, and crypto with real utility. As hype gathers steam, the search for the next giant altcoin 2025 gets more intense. That shine is increasingly turning towards smaller, high-utility tokens—like Remittix. The Remittix DeFi project is seriously gaining momentum in 2025 with a very specific mission: to enable users to send cryptocurrency directly to fiat bank accounts in 30+ countries. With this fiat bridge, there is no need to go through centralized exchanges, so real-world payments can be easily made by using RTX. The beta wallet, which will roll out in Q3 2025, will cover Ethereum and Solana, with low gas fees and fast transactions. It is best suited for freelancers, global workers, and those in emerging markets where bank services are not available. At $0.0876, Remittix has already raised $17 million+ and sold over 565 million tokens. Early buyers also get a 50% bonus, with the project heading towards its $18 million soft cap. You can buy RTX tokens here and view the wallet beta roadmap for upcoming milestones. The Remittix whitepaper also mentions long-term token deflation and cross-border expansion plans. Why Remittix Is Making Waves in 2025 With a $250,000 Remittix giveaway running and beta around the corner, RTX is in the spotlight as among the most undervalued crypto initiatives today. And while price movement in Ethereum may be the big news, Remittix is building the rails for real-world adoption behind the scenes.

Title: Left-wing hedge fund D.E. Shaw fears ‘reprisals’ over DEI from Trump administration: sources
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/28/business/left-wing-hedge-fund-d-e-shaw-fears-reprisals-over-dei-from-trump-administration-sources/

Staffers at the notoriously secretive hedge fund D.E. Shaw fear the wildly lucrative left-wing firm could face “reprisals” from the Trump administration over its woke DEI policies, The Post has learned. The New York-based powerhouse founded by billionaire David E. Shaw — whose algorithm-driven trades made it the most profitable hedge fund in 2024, raking in $11.1 billion for investors, according to Institutional Investor magazine — has grown remarkably quiet of late when it comes to diversity, equality, and inclusion, sources said. D.E. Shaw did not respond to The Post’s emailed request for comment for this article. The company, which gave a young Jeff Bezos his big break in finance before he set up Amazon in 1994, has promoted DEI policies for years. A June 2019 memo obtained by The Post that was written by managing director Eddie Fishman encouraged staffers “to display their pronouns” that “align with their gender identity” in their emails so managers could “foster an inclusive culture.” But a review by The Post of archived pages from D.E. Shaw’s website shows that its DEI language has since been scrubbed, including references to how the firm “actively promotes LGBTQ+ inclusion.” Now, its site merely says it’s seeking “talented people with diverse perspectives and backgrounds.” One insider said top brass at the Wall Street firm — whose 74-year-old namesake helped bankroll the presidential campaigns of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton — made “a strategic move” to steer away from full-throated wokeness over fear of catching the attention of the White House. “There was some concern that aggressive policies would make the firm a target for reprisals by the current administration,” the source said. “And we were about as aggressive as you could get.” “They were going 100 miles an hour on DEI in public, only then to drop to zero and fall off a cliff,’ said another staffer. “The communications have certainly been ratcheted back,” claimed a third employee. “It’s not as in-your-face as it once was.” D.E. Shaw’s retreat follows a Supreme Court ruling last month and a White House-led crackdown on corporate DEI policies, which critics say lower performance standards and foster so-called reverse discrimination. Top Department of Justice lawyer Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights, issued the starkest of warnings to corporate America during a testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 23. “The goal is clear: either DEI will end on its own, or we will kill it,” the top Trump administration official said. Nevertheless, five sources with direct knowledge of the matter told The Post that executives at the company — founded by computer scientist Shaw in 1988 after he did stints at Stanford, Columbia and Morgan Stanley — are still paying lip service to wokeness to the rank and file. “They have said internally that our commitment and programs regarding DEI are not changing,” said another senior D.E. Shaw source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They have themselves in a bit of a bind. They went hardcore DEI to appear progressive and cater to liberal recruits,” a veteran of the firm added. “Internally, they are putting a brave face on it. But they are now very worried that the administration will start looking into them.” Fearing Trump’s ire, the hedge fund appears to have axed its “inclusive” Bridge internship. The program was set up in 2016 for “historically underrepresented” groups in finance. The ‘woke’ job placement schemes still featured prominently on D.E. Shaw’s website last week. But they have now been deleted after The Post approached the firm for comment on their DEI policies on Friday. According to an archived version of D.E. Shaw’s Campus website — an online recruitment portal — the firm created three programs aimed at diverse recruitment. Its “Discovery” program was “designed for students who self-identify as women”, while “Momentum” was aimed at those “who self-identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community D.E. Shaw also had a program called “Latitude,” which was “for students who self-identify as Native American or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, or Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander.” Other Wall Street giants including Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Bank of America and Jamie Dimon’s JPMorgan Chase have scaled back their public commitments to DEI. The Post reported exclusively how Goldman decided to give woke the boot — on its website at least — when its partners met with CEO David Solomon in Miami in February. The Post attempted to speak to additional employees at D.E. Shaw, but they declined, citing fears of retribution from D.E. Shaw’s management, which has even been known to weigh in on whether employees can attend social gatherings with people who have left the company. “It is definitely something that people are talking about at the firm,” a separate person briefed on the matter told The Post. “The irony is that the whole firm is still very white and very male,” said another source. The hedge fund’s leadership team counts two females, Alexis Halaby and managing director Anne Dinning, amongst its ranks. The firm last made major headlines in 2022 when it was forced to pay a $52 million defamation settlement to one of its former rising stars, Dan Michalow, after an arbitration panel found that it had falsely accused him of sexual misconduct. Michalow, who always denied any wrongdoing, left the company not long after the start of the #MeToo movement, where hundreds of rich and powerful men were accused of sexual misdeeds. Aside from Amazon’s Bezos and his ex-wife, Mackenzie Scott, D.E. Shaw’s most famous alum is arguably Lawrence Summers. He served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and as director of Barack Obama’s National Economic Council. Advertisement

Title: Ethereum price prediction: ETH eyes new all-time highs in August, whales buy up Pepe and Remittix

Ethereum price prediction models are flashing green as August approaches, and institutional demand continues to climb. While ETH aims to break past the $4,500 resistance, investors are also flocking to newer projects like Remittix, which is becoming the go-to cross-border crypto solution in 2025. This August, Ethereum price prediction experts are eyeing strong resistance breakouts. Leading analysts like Fundstrat’s Mark Newton forecast Ethereum reaching $4,000–$4,500 in the short term, with longer-term predictions soaring to $15,000–$20,000 by year-end (Changelly forecast, Finance Magnates update). Driving this optimism is a surge in Ethereum ETF inflows led by BlackRock, coupled with reduced liquid supply as more ETH is staked across DeFi protocols. This bullish cycle aligns with major trends like the rise of Layer 2 Ethereum alternatives and top crypto to buy lists focused on blue-chip altcoins. With decentralized exchange volume climbing and smart contract usage on the rise, ETH is once again leading the charge among long-term crypto investments. Remittix is making waves in the early stage crypto investment scene. Whale activity has surged since the announcement of its Q3 wallet beta, which enables direct crypto-to-bank transfers in 30+ countries. At a price of $0.0876, over 551 million tokens have already been sold, raising $17.4M+ to date. This cross-chain DeFi project is solving real problems in borderless finance—and investors are paying attention. A Nigerian freelancer recently used Remittix to accept ETH and convert it to mobile funds to support his family instantly. That’s the kind of utility missing from most low cap crypto gems. Remittix is quietly becoming the breakout presale of 2025, as smart investors seek crypto with passive income potential and real-world impact. While Remittix delivers utility, Pepe continues to attract meme coin momentum. Whale wallets have scooped up trillions of tokens recently, including a massive $22M withdrawal from Binance. These high-volume moves signal bullish sentiment. Source: TradingView PEPE is forming a bullish cup-and-handle chart structure, with traders predicting gains of 40% or more. It’s a speculative bet, but one that still commands strong attention in the meme coin space. Ethereum price prediction targets remain high for August, but whales aren’t just holding ETH. They’re hedging into upcoming crypto projects like Remittix and low gas fee crypto plays like PEPE for broader exposure this bull cycle. If you’re looking for the next 100x crypto, this could be your signal.

Title: DWF Ventures Analyzes Catalysts Behind ETH’s Price Rally, Including Rising Institutional Interest

July 28, 2025 – Dubai, United Arab Emirates It examines the catalysts behind ETH’s rally, which has seen its price rise by 70% in the past month, with a particular focus on institutional support. In its analysis, first published as an X thread, DWF Ventures assesses whether ETH’s recent performance is indicative of an Ethereum season arriving, propelling both ETH and the assets its EVM ecosystem supports to greater heights. DWF pinpoints the triggers that have prompted ETH to break out of a three-year downtrend and flip bullish. The Web 3.0 investment firm notes that ETH’s recent price rise hasn’t occurred in a vacuum but is rather the product of growing interest in the Ethereum ecosystem. On-chain activity on Ethereum has been increasing steadily including transactions, active addresses, volume and the total percentage of ETH staked. Many of these metrics are at or approaching ATHs (all-time highs), paving the way for ETH to move up. As highlighted in the report, institutions are increasingly acquiring ETH as a strategic asset, whose ETF inflows have surged past 230,000 ETH in a single day, while the ETH/BTC ratio has broken out of a multi-year downtrend. The analysis observes that companies are leveraging ETH for treasury diversification, capitalizing on its yield-generating potential through staking and DeFi integrations. It also asserts that greater regulatory clarity, aided by legislation such as the GENIUS Act, has provided the transparency required to attract cautious investors, paving the way for sustained upward momentum. Public companies that have purchased significant quantities of ETH include SharpLink Gaming, which DWF Ventures records as having purchased over $1 billion of the crypto asset since May 2025. It acknowledges that BTC remains the asset of choice for public companies acquiring crypto but suggests that ETH’s ability to generate native yield via staking is desirable for preferred stock holders who are accustomed to receiving dividends. Other tailwinds contributing to ETH’s rally, as outlined by DWF Ventures, include the CLARITY Act, which places less restrictions on institutions accessing ETH because it is regarded as a commodity rather than a security. It also notes that while the GENIUS Act was primarily concerned with stablecoins, Ethereum’s dominance of almost 50% of the total stablecoin market cap will work in its favor as stablecoin capitalization increases. DWF Ventures concludes by analyzing increased institutional demand to bring capital on-chain through tokenized RWAs (real-world assets) and participation in DeFi, with Ethereum overwhelmingly the blockchain of choice. It cites global institutions including BlackRock, PayPal, Deutsche Bank and UBS – all utilizing Ethereum infrastructure. The analysis finishes by saying, “The strong performance of associated sectors and tokens are encouraging signs of a potential ‘ETH szn,’ especially for protocols that share and benefit from overlapping tailwinds in clearer regulation, stablecoin expansion and onboarding of institutional capital.” The full ETH analysis from DWF Ventures can be read here.

East Asia A view of the Balboa Port is pictured in Panama City, Panama on Mar 4, 2025. (File photo: Reuters/Enea Lebrun) HONG KONG: Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison said Monday (Jul 28) it was considering inviting a Chinese "major strategic investor" to join a United States-led consortium negotiating the sale of its global ports business outside China, including operations at the Panama Canal. The firm said in March it was offloading the ports - including operations in the vital Central American waterway - to a group led by asset manager BlackRock for US$19 billion in cash. The consortium was to include BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated ports at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading The sale was seen as a political victory for US President Donald Trump, who had vowed to "take back" the Panama Canal from alleged Chinese control, prompting Beijing's ire. China's market regulator said in March it was reviewing the deal. In May, Hutchison co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte. Aponte's family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with the owner of CK Hutchison Li Ka-shing, who is also Hong Kong's richest man. "(CK Hutchison) remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting (a) major strategic investor from (China) to join as a significant member of the consortium," CK Hutchison said in a stock exchange filing Monday. The firm added that changes to the consortium's membership and deal structure will be needed for the deal "to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities". It said the "period for exclusive negotiations" mentioned in the March announcement had expired, but discussions will continue. It did not name the major investor. The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on Jul 27.

The deadline for their exclusive negotiation period ended on Jul 27. China's biggest shipping company Cosco was set to join the consortium and was requesting veto rights or equivalent powers, Bloomberg News reported. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong told the outlet that "ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal's viability". Gary Ng, senior economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, said Monday's developments show that "business deals can be increasingly subject to politics in the new economic and geopolitical reality" as the Hong Kong conglomerate seeks to "keep everyone happy". CK Hutchison said it "intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions to achieve" a workable arrangement. It said it had stated on several occasions that it "will not proceed with any transaction that does not have the approval of all relevant authorities". The initial deal, valued at nearly US$23 billion including US$5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at either end of the canal. That agreement also required approval from Panama’s government. Its Hong Kong-listed shares fell 0.6 per cent Monday, while Cosco dropped 2.2 per cent. AFP has contacted Cosco for comment.

Title: Earn $8900 a day with your mobile phone with BTC Miner!

As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) steadily runs in the range of $118,000 to $120,000, the market’s expectations for it to hit historical highs again are getting stronger. With the continuous increase in institutional holdings and the continuous inflow of funds on the chain, the crypto market is entering a structural growth cycle with policy loosening, capital acceleration, and technology upgrading as the core. But for ordinary investors, facing the reality of high currency prices and volatility, how to enter the market and how to make stable profits? Smart cloud mining platform BTC Miner may be the answer. According to Coindesk data, Bitcoin has tested the area above $119,000 many times in the past 72 hours, and the technical side shows strong support signs. If it can successfully break through the current platform consolidation area, the next target may be $130,000. At the same time, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s “realized cap” has exceeded $1 trillion for the first time, which means that more long-term investors will include BTC in their core asset allocation rather than a short-term speculative tool. This bull market is no longer driven by emotions, but a systematic revaluation driven by ETF funds, policy shifts and institutional buying. BTC Miner: Ordinary people can also seize institutional dividends While the crypto market is developing rapidly, BTC Miner is using a simple, efficient, and automated way to provide ordinary investors around the world with a low threshold to enter the mining income. Five core advantages of the platform: 1. Zero technical threshold, one-click mining Users do not need equipment or blockchain knowledge; they only need to register and purchase contracts, and the system automatically allocates computing power and participates in the mining of mainstream currencies such as BTC, XRP, ETH, and DOGE. 2. Daily automatic settlement, transparent income to the account The platform implements an automatic income calculation and distribution mechanism, and you can see the income account every day, which is clear and traceable, avoiding the uncertainty of waiting and fluctuations. 3. Register to get $500 computing power, free trial mining for new users BTC Miner gives $500 computing power to all new users, and you can experience the real mining process without recharging, and the daily stable income is credited to your account in real time. 4. Multi-currency support, global use Supports recharge and withdrawal of mainstream crypto assets such as BTC, ETH, XRP, USDT, DOGE, etc., and the internal income is calculated in US dollars, which is unified and transparent. Referral rewards, build a passive income network Through the invitation mechanism, users can get up to 7% rebate to create a sustainable passive income model. Bitcoin has entered an upward track, but the investment threshold is also rising simultaneously. Compared with the high volatility and high threshold of direct currency holding, BTC Miner provides a lightweight and stable income alternative: purchase computing power contracts from a minimum of $200, with an annualized income of up to 180%+. BTC Miner continues to optimize product structure and profit mechanism, and launches diversified contract solutions suitable for all types of investors. All plans support automatic settlement of daily income, and return principal when the contract expires, which is simple and transparent: Contract principal Contract period Daily income Total income at expiration (Actual income is intelligently adjusted according to market conditions and contract types, transparent and traceable) Especially in the stage where the currency price has not yet broken through significantly and the mining difficulty is still controllable, early entrants can obtain more attractive returns. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of BlackRock, recently said that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates as soon as possible to release liquidity; Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Fund, suggested that investors allocate at least 15% of their assets to Bitcoin and gold. All signs indicate that Bitcoin is gradually becoming a new generation of “risk hedging and value-added” dual tools. For most ordinary investors who cannot deploy capital and resources like institutions, the cloud mining platform BTC Miner provides an opportunity to stand at the same starting line as institutions. You can also make money through invitations: just share your personal invitation link. Directly invite friend B: 7% rebate [Friend B invests $10,000, you can get $700] Friend B invites C: 2% rebate [C invests $10,000, you can get $200] Build an exclusive computing power network, earn while using, and share the benefits! The price of Bitcoin is on the eve of a key breakthrough, and the BTC Miner cloud mining platform has opened a stable door to high returns for ordinary people. It is not only a new way to participate, but also a passive income tool that resists inflation and stabilizes growth. If you want to seize this round of structural bull market, act now.

A Hong Kong conglomerate that’s selling ports at the Panama Canal says it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong conglomerate that had agreed to sell its two ports at the Panama Canal said Monday it may seek a Chinese investor to join a consortium of buyers, a move that could please Beijing but bring more U.S. scrutiny to the geopolitically fraught deal. CK Hutchison Holdings’ initial plan to sell port assets in dozens of countries to a group that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock Inc. pleased U.S. President Donald Trump, who has alleged that China interferes with the critical shipping lane’s operations in Panama. However, the deal apparently angered Beijing and drew a review by Chinese anti-monopoly authorities. After months of uncertainty brought by tensions between Washington and Beijing, Hutchison said in a statement Monday that the exclusive negotiations period with the consortium had expired. However, it added “the Group remains in discussions with members of the consortium with a view to inviting major strategic investor from the PRC to join as a significant member of the consortium,” referring to the People’s Republic of China. It said it needed to change the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction for the deal to be able to pass reviews by “all relevant authorities.” In Beijing, a Chinese official said the government had noted the announcement but did not comment directly on it. “The Chinese government will conduct supervision in accordance with the law, firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintain market fairness and justice,” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a daily briefing. A Hutchison subsidiary has operated the ports of Balboa and Cristobal at both ends of the Panama Canal since 1997. The awkward position Hutchison found itself in for months highlights the challenges Hong Kong business elites face in navigating Beijing’s expectations of national loyalty, especially when relations between China and the United States are strained. CK Hutchison is owned by the family of Hong Kong’s richest man, Li Ka-shing. It announced March 4 that it would sell all its shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the consortium that also includes BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Mediterranean Shipping Company. A Beijing-backed newspaper in Hong Kong posted scathing commentaries about the deal, with one describing it as a betrayal of all Chinese. Chinese government offices overseeing Hong Kong affairs reposted some of the commentaries, widely seen as an indication of the Chinese leaders’ stance. In May, Hutchinson co-managing director, Dominic Lai told shareholders that Terminal Investment was the main investor. Its parent company is led by Italian shipping scion Diego Aponte, whose family reportedly has a longstanding relationship with Li’s. The initial deal, valued at nearly $23 billion including $5 billion in debt, would have given the consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal. That agreement would have also required approval from Panama’s government. The deadline for the exclusive negotiation period ended on Sunday. The Panamanian government maintains it has full control over the canal and that the operation of the ports by Hutchison does not mean Chinese control of it. ___ Associated Press writer Ken Moritsugu in Beijing contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery CK Hutchison said it may invite a "major strategic investor” from China to join a group seeking to buy its global ports, as the Hong Kong-based company works toward a solution that pleases all in the geopolitically sensitive deal. The unnamed investor would join as a significant member of the consortium, the company said in a stock exchange filing Monday, hours after the expiry of a 145-day exclusive talks window with the group backed by American asset manager BlackRock. "Changes to the membership of the consortium and the structure of the transaction will be needed for the transaction to be capable of being approved by all relevant authorities,” CK Hutchison said, adding that it "intends to allow such time as is required for such discussions.” In a time of both misinformation and too much information, quality journalism is more crucial than ever.By subscribing, you can help us get the story right.

Title: Investors Bet Li Ka-Shing Will Clinch Controversial Ports Deal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network A view of the Balboa Port is pictured after Hong Kong's CK Hutchison agreed to sell its interests in a key Panama Canal port operator to a BlackRock Inc-backed consortium, amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb China's influence in the region, Panama City, Panama, March 4, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun By Shirley Zhao Jul 27, 2025 (Bloomberg) –Investors are regaining enthusiasm for CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. despite a delay in the company’s plan to sell 43 ports, with optimism fueled by news that a Chinese shipping behemoth is finding its way into the global deal. Shares of CK Hutchison, which oscillated between gains and losses since the company first announced the deal on March 4, reached the highest this year on Friday after state-owned China Cosco Shipping Corp. emerged as a potential new member of the buyer consortium that includes American asset manager BlackRock Inc. Although a 145-day exclusivity window for talks between CK Hutchison and the buyers’ group lapsed on Sunday, the possible involvement of China Cosco is boosting expectations that it would nudge the transaction forward. Beijing has so far viewed the deal as a threat to its interests because it would transfer two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal to the BlackRock-backed group, which China sees as a proxy for American influence. “Ongoing negotiations and the reported inclusion of Cosco Shipping in the consortium have likely eased concerns over Chinese regulatory hurdles, strengthening investor confidence in the deal’s viability,” according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Denise Wong. China separately warned the parties involved not to bypass antitrust reviews, so as to prevent them from rushing into a deal. As of last week, the buyers’ group was considering China Cosco’s demand for veto rights to secure Beijing’s interests, Bloomberg News reported. CK Hutchison’s shares, which shot up 37% in the days following the sale announcement in March, saw political pressure wipe out all the gains in the space of a month. The stock started rallying again last month as investors flocked back after China Cosco came into play. The share price recovery shows investors are increasingly betting on Li Ka-shing, the 96-year-old founder of CK Hutchison, to seal the deal of his lifetime. If it goes through, the sale will net the group more than $19 billion in cash. The renewed optimism is largely due to China Cosco’s interest in playing a role in the buying consortium, alongside BlackRock and Italian billionaire Gianluigi Aponte’s Terminal Investment Ltd. Initially hailed as a smart move by Li to exit a business caught up in global trade tensions, the deal quickly drew the ire of Beijing. With President Donald Trump billing the transaction as the return of Panama Canal back to American influence, that didn’t help. Challenges remain even as Cosco enters the discussions, David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors, wrote on financial analysis platform SmartKarma. That could reverse the current rhetoric and upset Trump, who has a handful of issues already on his plate, he said. CK Hutchison’s share price could also be under pressure should talks on the sale drag on, he added. Even with an extended timeline, revised terms or a partial agreement, uncertainty around the deal’s value and timing would increase, said Bloomberg Intelligence’s Wong. The delay may also fuel concerns about regulatory and policy challenges, she said. Investors will be watching out for more answers to questions surrounding the deal, including what role the Chinese side will play in the consortium, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis. The controversial deal has also weighed on Li and his family’s other businesses. Younger son Richard’s talks to expand his insurance business into mainland China have stalled after the ports deal upset Beijing, Bloomberg reported earlier this month. That followed another Bloomberg report in March that China told its state-owned firms to hold off on any new collaboration with businesses linked to the Li family. The original structure of the buyer consortium was designed to give the Aponte family-controlled Terminal Investment ownership of all the ports except the two in Panama, whose control will go to BlackRock’s Global Infrastructure Partners unit. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Slow And Steady Wins? Bitcoin To Hit $1M Via ‘Pump’ And ‘Consolidate’ Pattern: Expert
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/slow-steady-expert-says-bitcoin-to-reach-1-million/
Time Published: 2025-07-27T23:00:07Z

The bull cycle was deemed over when the price of Bitcoin tragically fell toward $75,000 earlier in March 2025. Having notched an all-time high of above $100,000, most investors feared that the premier cryptocurrency had already reached its top for the current cycle. Contrary to popular belief, the price of Bitcoin has since forged multiple new all-time highs, with the current record high at around $122,800. Interestingly, the now-popular market consensus is that it is only a matter of time before the BTC price reaches a seven-figure valuation. In a recent post on the X platform, Blockware Bitcoin analyst Mitchell Askew has joined a growing list of experts to put forward a $1 million projection for the premier cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, the price of BTC is expected to achieve this major milestone over the next 10 years. What’s interesting is that Askew expects the Bitcoin price to reach a $1 million valuation in the next 10 years. The crypto intelligence expert believes that “the days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over” for the flagship cryptocurrency. Askew highlighted that Bitcoin looks like two entirely different assets before and after the launch of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. With this shift, the analyst expects the price of BTC to reach $1 million through a consistent oscillation between “pump” and “consolidate.” Askew added: It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions. It is worth mentioning that Askew’s thesis aligns with the recent claim that the Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. In essence, both beliefs state that the premier cryptocurrency is now less likely to experience the extended bear market that typically follows after a bull run — a theory based on the introduction of institutional players through spot ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas agreed with Askew’s theory about the movement and trajectory of the Bitcoin price since the spot exchange-traded funds hit the market. According to the pundit, the Bitcoin market has witnessed less volatility and fewer corrections since BlackRock filed for a spot BTC ETF. Ultimately, the air of increased stability around the premier cryptocurrency has made it a more attractive investment option for large institutional players. Balchunas also acknowledged that the BTC price is now less likely to experience major surges in short periods — as seen in the past. Over the past week, the price of Bitcoin moved mostly sideways, oscillating between the $120,000 and $115,000 levels. As of this writing, the market leader is valued at around $117,900, reflecting a 0.4% price increase in the past day. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Welcome to Slate Sundays, CryptoSlate’s new weekly feature showcasing in-depth interviews, expert analysis, and thought-provoking op-eds that go beyond the headlines to explore the ideas and voices shaping the future of crypto. If 2024 was the year of the dragon, 2025 has been the year of the stablecoin. U.S. dollar-backed digital assets, in particular, have taken front and center stage, achieving buy-in all the way from the highest office. The World Liberty stablecoin, USD1, was launched in March by a DeFi platform majority-owned by members of the Trump family. Then Vice President JD Vance set the stage alight at the Bitcoin Conference in May, clarifying the administration’s bullish stance on stablecoins and their ability to act as a “force multiplier” for U.S. economic power. Stablecoin issuer Circle’s $20 billion IPO followed, igniting what the Bankless podcast duo coined “stablecoin summer.” And last week, the GENIUS Act was signed into law, becoming the first piece of U.S. legislation to directly regulate digital assets, creating a turning point for global finance. Even Jamie Dimon’s getting in on the action despite his personal skepticism about Bitcoin and digital assets. He may publicly claim not to understand their appeal, but there has long been a gap between what Dimon says and what Dimon does: America’s largest bank has been a pioneer in blockchain technology, developing its own stablecoin, JPM Coin, since 2019. So, what’s with all the latest developments in moving value worldwide, and what does the GENIUS Act mean for the future of crypto, TradFi, and the global economy? I asked experts from the technical, legal, and financial fields to throw some light on the subject and unpack the types of advancements we may see in the years ahead. For those of you who’ve been hiding under a rock, let me guide you out of your shadowy abode. The GENIUS Act stands for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025,” but “GENIUS” is a lot more catchy. It’s the first comprehensive U.S. federal law that specifically regulates “payment stablecoins” (AKA, digital tokens pegged to fiat money). The GENIUS Act establishes a long-awaited licensing and oversight regime for stablecoin issuers, mandating full 1:1 reserve backing, imposing strict consumer protection measures, and creating a clear legal footing for integrating stablecoins into mainstream finance. The law also bars non-financial companies like the Facebooks and Googles of this world from issuing stablecoins without special approval, applying substantial penalties for noncompliance (violations can incur fines of up to $200,000 per day, and criminal penalties including up to five years’ imprisonment). Why is the GENIUS Act such a big deal? Well, because after years of opacity and uncertainty surrounding stablecoin issuers in the United States, it provides the first federal legal framework, providing clarity on how to run their operations. As international law firm, Winston & Strawn LLP writes in a recent blog: “The Act pushes stablecoin issuers into a regulatory regime similar to that of banks. For many firms, this means a need to hire compliance officers, invest in risk management systems, and potentially partner with experienced regulated institutions to meet the standards set by Congress.” Moon Pursuit Capital is a fast-growing crypto investment fund. Its founder, Utkarsh Ahuja, shared his thoughts on just how groundbreaking the GENIUS Act is, commenting: “The GENIUS Act is a major step forward, not just for crypto, but for U.S. leadership in global finance. For the first time, we have clear rules around stablecoins, which are the backbone of open, programmable money infrastructure. For too long, uncertainty has held the industry back and driven builders offshore. The GENIUS Act changes that. It gives stablecoins legal clarity and sets the stage for broader crypto adoption.” Genna Garver is a partner at the international law firm Troutman Pepper Locke LLP. She also provided her thoughts on the GENIUS Act to share with CryptoSlate readers. She said: “This is a watershed moment for institutional financial services. The GENIUS Act authorizes the tokenization of fiat currency and regulation of the same, thereby legitimizing digital US dollarization.” Guillaume Poncin is CTO at Alchemy, a developer platform that facilitates over $100 billion in transactions annually for businesses across the ecosystem, from Fortune 500 firms like Robinhood, Visa, JPMorgan, and PayPal, to crypto-native companies like Coinbase and Circle. He told me via written commentary: “The GENIUS Act provides the clarity that institutions have been waiting for, and it helps legitimize programmable money that operates at internet speed. This legislation is important because it reduces regulatory uncertainty that has held back institutional adoption.” What’s more, the GENIUS Act does not exist in a vacuum. With a groundswell of favorable momentum toward digital assets from the current administration, the tailwinds are blowing like crazy. The unwinding of the stranglehold on crypto during the Biden years, and the repeal of key pieces of prohibitive legislation such as SAB 121, which prevented U.S. banks from providing custody of digital assets, are creating a perfect storm. Poncin enthused: “We saw immediate interest from major banks that had previously been cautious. Now, with GENIUS in place, we believe every major bank will move toward issuing or supporting stablecoins in some form. It unlocks the next era of programmable money that is trusted, regulated, and built for internet-scale speed.” The GENIUS Act also serves to extend U.S. dollar dominance, spurring innovation based on the USD and reinforcing the dollar’s standing as the world’s reserve currency for decades to come. As crypto-native investment firm, CoinFund, president Chris Perkins commented: “The GENIUS Act will go down in history as a law that served as a foundational step in the mainstreaming of crypto as an asset class. By catalyzing innovation on our greatest export, the greenback, GENIUS will position the dollar as the global reserve currency for decades to come, enhance national security, and unlock financial opportunity across the globe Stablecoins deliver obvious utility by offering inexpensive, 24/7 payments. But, by enabling seamless and efficient access to U.S. dollars across the developing world, stablecoins will also serve as a store of value when local monetary policy goes awry.” Stablecoins have come a long way from their original use case as a means to store wealth, while avoiding the volatility of digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to be enshrined in a landmark bill recognizing them as key financial infrastructure. So what are some of the main use cases the GENIUS Act enables, and what can we expect from the coming years? Ahuja comments: “The GENIUS Act unlocks real innovation, instant remittances, AI-native payments, and global commerce without intermediaries.” Poncin adds: “The opportunity in stablecoins isn’t in holding them, unless they’re being used in DeFi for yield opportunities. The real opportunity lies in companies issuing their own stablecoins, such as payment processors integrating stablecoins and fintechs launching their own tokens. We’re seeing fintechs generate meaningful revenue from stablecoin reserves through treasury management. This can potentially be $100M+ annually on $2-3B in deposits. The real value creation comes from how stablecoins are enabling the new financial system.” Beyond experimenting with its own stablecoins, JPMorgan made headlines this week for its moves to allow clients, particularly institutional ones, to use bitcoin as collateral for loans. Thanks to the GENIUS Act, the bank is developing a new program that would allow clients to pledge their Bitcoin or Ether holdings to secure cash loans, much as they might with stocks or real estate. While JPMorgan already enabled clients to borrow against crypto ETFs, the move to accept direct crypto holdings as collateral is a paradigm shift for an institution helmed by one of the industry’s most vocal critics. The GENIUS Act’s significance extends across the industry, with DeFi platforms and tokenized RWAs taking note as well. Orest Gavryliak, the chief legal officer at DEX aggregation pioneer, 1inch Labs, told me: “Tokenized technology has become a major area of focus for TradFi giants like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and more, as it represents marked improvement on the current setup of financial standards. It is also a major benefit in terms of the accessibility of liquidity. By transcending geographic barriers, the global nature of tokenization, enabled by blockchain technology, allows markets with limited, isolated liquidity to unify and access liquidity from multiple sources—available 24/7, in real time.” Poncin expands: “Banks will enable customers ‘investor-grade opportunities, like trading in private equities, and get loans against their holdings. Small businesses can finally harness the remote work era to pay overseas workers affordably. We’re about to see a flood of not one, but hundreds of stablecoin ‘killer apps’, all enabling people to exchange and create value in ways unimaginable just months ago. Tokenized treasuries are growing significantly. Stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, hold substantial U.S. debt positions. We’re seeing increased interest in tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets like private credit and real estate to unlock liquidity. There’s also growing development of infrastructure to make RWAs composable with DeFi protocols. The real innovation is about making these assets programmable. This enables new financial products like automated lending against tokenized assets or smart contracts that can interact with real-world collateral.” One interesting clause in the GENIUS Act is the prohibition on paying interest or yield to stablecoin holders, which could mean an explosion of demand in DeFi yield-earning opportunities. Perkins says: “Under GENIUS, stablecoins do not pay interest to end users, and without interest, stablecoins are depreciating assets. So, holders will seek yield. And that’s where DeFi comes in. If the Treasury Department’s projections are correct and trillions of stablecoins come into the system, expect DeFi summer on steroids as users seek to maximize yield by engaging across a variety of yield strategies. Users will be drawn to yield-bearing vaults, and they will commission AI agents to optimize their returns. With the U.S. back in the lead, countries around the world will need to accelerate and optimize stablecoin policies of their own. The $7.5 trillion per day FX market stands to benefit. Watch this space.” Will Beeson, founder of MultiLiquid, and former co-lead of Standard Chartered’s Tokenization platform, comments: “The outright ban on stablecoin yield marks a critical inflection point. Capital is already shifting. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin as traders seek returns via Ethereum-native protocols and tokenized funds. The stablecoin market is entering a phase where only institutions that can put capital to work efficiently will survive. But there’s a bottleneck: stablecoins move 24/7, Treasurys don’t. Liquidity infrastructure that bridges this gap is now mission-critical.” Gavryliak adds: “Regulatory clarity, like the GENIUS Act, means companies and institutions can now look to leverage stablecoins for fast, cost-efficient cross-border payments, treasury optimization, and real-time settlement, bypassing TradFi banking rails and unlocking operational efficiencies. It’s a positive step forward for DeFi. It also provides security for institutions and other TradFi operators, who can now put their full weight behind the sector. Those previously just dipping their toes in can now dive headfirst with the clear guardrails.” With digital assets an increasingly partisan issue, and key Democrats like Elizabeth Warren holding onto her anti-crypto army, is there any risk of the GENIUS Act, or any other legislation, being reversed if and when the blue team returns to power? And with the Trump family so overtly benefiting from digital assets, does this clear conflict of interest pose any threat? Poncin believes it’s too late for that: “The momentum in crypto adoption transcends political divisions. We work with institutions across the spectrum that recognize blockchain’s potential. The repeal of SAB 121 had bipartisan elements, and there are crypto advocates across party lines. Major banks, asset managers, and payment companies are building on blockchain because it offers superior technology for settlement and programmable money. Moreover, the cryptocurrency industry has demonstrated resilience in the face of various challenges over the years. What matters is that institutions are building real utility on blockchain. These use cases exist because they solve real-world problems, such as settlement speed, operational costs, and 24/7 availability. That’s what drives lasting adoption.” Garver is also positive that GENIUS brings in lasting change. She says: “During the legislative process, there were numerous attempts to debate and offer amendments to the bill to address certain conflicts of interest, but those amendments were not adopted as part of the final GENIUS Act. Now that we have final legislation authorizing permitted payment stablecoins, digital asset adoption likely will depend more on the use cases. Not unlike ATM adoption of the last generation, at some point, it’s just too convenient and beneficial not to get on board. I don’t see potential users sitting on the sidelines as a sign of protest. I think the ship will quickly sail, and crypto will become too integrated into the fiber of our economy, the global economy, and the financial services industry.” With the ballooning global debt, liquidity expansion, geopolitical uncertainty, and lowering interest rates, favorable regulation for digital assets in the U.S. could mean that “nothing stops this train.” As Ahuja affirms: This is, frankly, as constructive a macro setup as you can ask for, short of resolving event-driven risks like tariffs or Middle East escalation. But from a pure market-structure and liquidity standpoint, the conditions are primed. We’re entering a rare window where fundamentals, liquidity, and macro dynamics are all pointing in the same direction; and that’s precisely when the most compelling upside gets unlocked.” Christina is a web3 writer, editor, and content manager with a passion for technology and starting important conversations.

Title: Bitcoin’s Parabolic Glory Days May Be Over, Analyst Claims

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin has climbed 250% since BlackRock’s IBIT launch. But those massive green candles—spikes traders chase—could become a thing of the past. According to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, the era of sudden jolts up or down may be ending. He says that spot ETFs and big companies piling in will smooth out those drawdowns. Balchunas pointed out that IBIT just passed $100 billion in assets under management. Based on his view, that landmark tells you everything. Bitcoin traded between $116,000 and $120,000 after Galaxy Digital sold 80,000 coins. No panic sell‑off followed. Before ETFs, a sale like that could send prices tumbling by double‑digit percentages. Now, deep corrections look less likely. This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 In‑and‑out profit‑hunters once drove Bitcoin up or down by 20% or more in a day. But steady inflows from regulated products lure in large investors. Balchunas argues that fewer wild swings will make crypto more useful for buying coffee or paying bills. He believes this shift will help Bitcoin behave more like a real currency and not just a roller‑coaster asset. Based on reports from Citigroup, every $1 billion of ETF inflows can lift Bitcoin by about 3.6%. Using that math, Citi sees Bitcoin hitting $199,000 before December 31. That forecast depends on steady money flowing in. Big funds make big bets. And those bets tend to stick around longer than retail traders chasing quick gains. Citigroup notes that BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $100 billion. That matters because it shows how hungry big players are for crypto. If those trends keep up, Bitcoin could push past its current trading band. It may even test new highs without the classic “God candle” leaps that gave quick fortunes—and quick losses. Meanwhile, some analysts warn that early Bitcoin whales are taking profits and stepping aside. As institutions arrive, some old‑school traders will leave. That could shift volume to less regulated spots or exotic derivatives markets. In a calmer main market, risks may hide in side channels. Lower volatility brings fewer heart‑stopping moments. It also means less of the adrenaline rush that attracts day‑traders. For some, that trade‑off is worth it. For others, the loss of big swings could drive them away. Overall, Bitcoin seems to be entering a new phase. Based on Balchunas’s take, those “God candles” won’t vanish overnight—but they’ll be rare. The push from spot ETFs and corporate treasuries aims to make price moves smoother. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock’s CIO fires at Fed’s policy delay: ‘It’s not a goods economy’

With crypto inflows rising and Fed criticism peaking, Rieder’s support for rate cuts may shift the macro winds this week. BlackRock’s Rick Rieder pushes for rate cuts as the crypto industry and housing sector strain under Fed policy. With ETH ETF inflows surging past BTC, all eyes now turn to the upcoming FOMC decision. With just four days to go before the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting, the debate around interest rates is heating up, drawing in voices from both Wall Street and the crypto industry. This time, it’s not just crypto-native investors calling for rate relief. BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer, Rick Rieder, has entered the conversation. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Rieder urged the Fed to begin slashing interest rates. He argued that the broader U.S. economy and particularly the service sector would benefit from such a shift. That said, markets have heard this tune before. Earlier this month, traders piled into Bitcoin [BTC] ahead of a strong U.S. jobs report, hoping the Fed would finally pivot—only to be met with data that reaffirmed its hawkish stance. As previously reported, that macro surprise cooled crypto momentum and reminded investors that the Fed’s next move remains tightly tethered to real-world labor and inflation numbers. Rieder’s comments contrast with prevailing sentiment on Wall Street, where many still favor a cautious or minimal easing approach. For the crypto sector, however, Rieder’s remarks could serve as a critical point of validation, as lower interest rates historically fuel investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. He said, “The service economy is what drives this economy today. It’s not a goods-oriented economy, not commodities, not exports, not manufacturing.” Further in the interview, Rick Rieder emphasized that the Fed’s current approach to inflation may no longer be effective in today’s service-dominated economy. According to the BlackRock executive, aggressive rate hikes are now doing more harm than good, particularly in sectors like housing, where the impact is most pronounced. “The real impact of interest rates on the economy today… it’s about housing.” These individuals, he noted, are the ones most reliant on credit and now face increasing barriers to home ownership. Rieder argued that easing rates could spur more housing construction and improve affordability, ultimately benefiting the broader economy. He added, “If we get the rate down, you actually can bring home prices down. You build more houses, you’ll actually reduce inflation.” This shows that his stance not only challenges the Fed’s current policy direction but also adds weight to the growing call, especially from within the crypto industry. However, despite the Fed’s continued concerns about inflation, BlackRock’s Rieder pointed out that even a rate cut to 3.25% would remain above current inflation levels. Still, optimism for an imminent Fed rate cut remains low. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there’s a 95.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged after July’s FOMC meeting, with only a slim 4.1% chance of a cut. Meanwhile, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs have outpaced Bitcoin [BTC] in inflows, with ETH seeing $1.85 billion in net inflows between 21 and 25 July, compared to just $72 million for BTC. With so many crosscurrents shaping the market, all eyes are now on the FOMC meeting and its potential ripple effects across the crypto landscape.

Title: Lions and Wallabies give the MCG the epic it deserves

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist Think about all of the times you've seen Jerry Guscott’s drop-goal to clinch the series against the Springboks in 1997. Hugo Keenan’s try to defeat Australia in Saturday’s epic second Test at the MCG has joined a list of iconic moments in the 137-year history of the British and Irish Lions. Owen Farrell’s winning penalty in the second Test in Wellington in 2017, George North lifting Israel Folau over his shoulders and carrying him like a toddler in Brisbane in 2013, Brian O’Driscoll’s dancing feet at the Gabba in 2001. Jim Telfer’s 'This is your Everest’ speech. Add Keenan to the montage. Every four years, the sight of the Ireland and Leinster full-back hitting the gas and burning Len Ikitau to the line will be replayed again and again and again, probably with a Scott Quinnell or Ian McGeechan voiceover that would have you ready to run through walls. Sport can create unlikely heroes, and when Keenan was playing off the bench for Blackrock College’s U14 C team back in the day, never in his wildest dreams would he have imagined scoring a last-minute winner to win a British and Irish Lions series. Even a few weeks ago it would have seemed like a long shot. Having come into the tour shaking off a calf injury, his Lions debut was delayed by a gastro bug that emptied him out and left him 6kg lighter. One of the more level-headed players – even by modern rugby standards – Keenan couldn’t be contained after the final whistle, doing his best to leap into the stands of the MCG every time he spotted some of the friends and family that made their way down to the front row to meet him, including some particularly emotional moments with his parents, Paul and Avril (below). Maybe we’re biased, but on a Lions tour that was so dominated by green, it felt appropriate that one of the Irish contingent was the hero of the day. It was also appropriate that the game itself matched the setting and occasion. The Melbourne Cricket Grounds is one of the world’s iconic sporting venues, and with 90,307 people crammed into ‘The G’, we were treated to one of the all-time great Lions Tests. While the Wallabies fell 60 seconds short of bringing it to a decider in Sydney, Joe Schmidt’s side put to bed any ideas of this series being a formality. Bullied a week ago in Brisbane, they allowed the Lions win pulling up and only a sleepy final quarter at Suncorp put some respectability on that scoreboard. Last night at the MCG it was a different story. While the Lions never played with the same efficiency that marked the first half of their win a week ago, both teams played their part in a thrilling 80 minutes. All week there were fears that this game would be wasted on the occasion, but what played out was a game of rugby that delivered beyond all expectations. In the first half, Australia played with a determination and flair unrecognisable from a week ago. With Will Skelton and Rob Valetini back in their side, they used their two most powerful forwards effectively. The first two lineouts saw them manufacture touches for each player in space; first Skelton broke down the touchline off a clever short lineout, and on their second they went over the top where Valetini charged to the 22. They carried nine times each, with Valetini departing at half time as his calf injury caught up on him, while Skelton’s tank was empty early in the second half. Even with those early departures, captain Harry Wilson was the only forward who carried more. It wasn't just physically where they matched the Lions. Full-back Tom Wright was inspired in the first half, with his glorious 50:22 laying the platform for Jake Gordon’s try, before he raced clear to score one of his own almost straight from the restart, after Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii had left Bundee Aki for dead. "I suppose the drama and how it unfolded is what makes it special," Lions head coach Andy Farrell said. "We came here to win a series. To do it in that type of fashion, you wouldn’t have backed us at 23-5, but to find a way adds to the story, doesn’t it? It adds to the fairytale." Twelve years ago Farrell was part of Warren Gatland’s coaching group who were brought the distance by the Wallabies in the series, before blowing them away in the Sydney decider. "To be a part of it is an honour, it really is. 2013 was special, 1-1, and being able to win it at the death, but we won quite comfortably in the end. "To win it like that is what top level sport is all about." If any context was needed to back-up how thrilling Saturday’s game was, the numbers back it up. Keenan’s match-winner saw the Lions take the lead for the first time on the night, having trailed for 75 minutes, while no Lions side had ever come from more than 10-points down to win a Test, as highlighted by the great rugby historian Stuart Farmer. Jack Conan’s workload summed up the physical toll, with the excellent stats man Russ Petty confirming his combined 31 tackles (24) and carries (7) were the most for Lions player in a single Test across the last five series. Judging by the singing in the Lions’ changing room, which could be heard loudly from the press conference room at the MCG, there will be a physical toll to the celebrations too, and the players are set to be given a couple of days off before turning their attention to Saturday’s third Test in Sydney. With the series win complete, it’s unlikely we’ll see the intensity of the MCG repeated at Accor Stadium. But with a first 3-0 sweep against the Wallabies for more than 100 years the prize on offer, there’s incentive enough for the Lions to throw everything they have at the last week, and give the final game of this tour, and Australian rugby, the respect it deserves.

Title: Tracing the real people in Brian Friel’s ‘first great Irish play’

Brian Friel had a healthy suspicion of journalists. A reporter once described how, when asked to reflect on the success of one of his plays, he did “a touching impersonation of an opossum playing dead at the approach of danger”. Still, in February 1963, when a journalist from the Belfast Telegraph caught up with him, Friel was frank about his work in progress. He was writing a play called The Ballad of Ballybeg but didn’t know if he’d ever finish it: “I have been working at it for six months and so far my characters aren’t moving.” His ambition, he added, was to write “the great Irish play”: “Such a play is one where the author can talk so truthfully and accurately about people in his own neighbourhood … so that these folks could be living in Omagh, Omaha or Omansk.” A few weeks later, the 34-year-old left for Minneapolis, where over several months as an “observer” at the Guthrie Theater he honed his craft. On his return home, he and his wife Anne took their children to the Rosses of west Donegal. And there, near Kincasslagh, which comprised little more than O’Boyle’s shop and Logue’s hotel (in truth, a bar), the Ballad of Ballybeg became Philadelphia, Here I Come! The play spans the night and morning before the emigration of Gar O’Donnell, a young man conflicted about both his imminent departure and his relationship with his emotionally inarticulate father, Screwballs, a county councillor and proprietor of a general store. Philadelphia opened at the Dublin Theatre Festival to a rapturous reception in September 1964. It moved to Broadway in 1966, where it ran for 324 performances and won several Tony Awards, including that for Best Play. Friel had written his first “great Irish play”. Philadelphia was the first play Friel set in “Ballybeg”. Among the others are Translations (1980) and his best-loved work, Dancing at Lughnasa (1990), whose run at Dublin’s 3Olympia finishes this weekend. And because of the symmetry between Lughnasa’s characters and the lives of his mother’s people in Glenties, there is a tendency to assume “Ballybeg” represents that southwest Donegal town. But then, as Friel intimated to the Belfast Telegraph, Ballybeg is Anywhere. Well, it is Anywhere – and it is not. In Philadelphia, for instance, the stage directions for the shopkeeper-cum-county councillor’s entrance are as follows: “SB appears at the shop door. He is in his late 60s. Wears a hat, a good dark suit, collar and tie, black apron. SB O’DONNELL is a responsible, respectable citizen.” In notes on characters in an early draft, Friel remarks of Screwballs: “Aged in his 60s. Hat. Daniel E O’Boyle.” It is a clear reference to Daniel E O’Boyle (1873–1958), the proprietor of the general store in Kincasslagh, who was a county councillor from 1925 through 1950, and who, just like Screwballs, had a younger wife. Daniel E O’Boyle died in 1958. However, at least one other character in Philadelphia was based on somebody who was alive in the 1960s: Master Boyle, who drops into Screwball’s to say goodbye to Gar. And to rant about the priest trying to get him fired: “Enter MASTER BOYLE from the scullery. He is around 60, white-haired, handsome, defiant. He is shabbily dressed; his eyes, head, hands, arms are constantly moving – he sits for a moment and rises again – he puts his hands in his pockets and takes them out again – his eyes roam around the room but see nothing.” Boyle has a gift for Gar, a volume of his poems: “I had them printed privately last month.” Public Gar appears genuinely touched. But Private Gar, his alter ego, who has been sneering at Master Boyle, is dismissive: “He’s nothing but a drunken aul schoolmaster – a conceited, arrogant washout.” Master Boyle may seem a stock character. Indeed, in 1966 Friel himself said: “All my characters are the stock ones of Irish plays … I use the stock people and then have to make something of them.” Still, young fellows who rocketed from the west of Ireland to college in bright cities sometimes burned up on re-entry. And if the drunken schoolmaster with frustrated ambitions was a stock character in Irish literature, he was a familiar figure in many small towns. In an early draft Friel named the person who was in his mind’s eye when conjuring Master Boyle: “The local teacher Dominick Kelly, brilliant, mad, touting his book of privately printed poems; years ago he urged Gar to ‘clear out’ and now that Gar is escaping the teacher turns mean through jealousy.” Dominic Ó Ceallaigh or O’Kelly (1900–70) was once considered “brilliant” and he was what people in the 1960s called “mad”. The son of schoolmaster, he trained for the priesthood, studying in Rome in 1915–18, but abandoned the idea after completing a degree in Philosophy. Returning to Ireland, he joined the IRA. A severe beating from Black and Tans left him deaf in one ear. After the Civil War, in which he took the anti-Treaty side, he taught in various schools in Dublin, including stints in Belvedere and Blackrock, before becoming principal of Finglas National School and then, in 1930, principal in Rush. In 1933, he left Rush to become principal of Dungloe National School, settling in Kincasslagh, where his wife Úna, herself a teacher, was appointed to a position in the local school. Úna O’Kelly (née Turner) was a native of Gortalowry, CoTyrone, where she had been taught by Friel’s aunt, Kate MacLoone. [ Anne Friel on her late husband playwright Brian: ‘I was crazy about him. He was everything’Opens in new window ] O’Kelly was active in Fianna Fáil, attending ardfheiseanna as a constituency delegate. Indeed, he was master of ceremonies in 1937 at a Fianna Fáil Aeraíocht, cultural festival, on Narin Strand when eight-year-old Brian Friel was among the performers. And then things came undone. On the morning of July 17th 1939, O’Kelly left Kincasslagh on the mail car to go to his school in Dungloe – it was the holidays – and when he arrived home at 4.45pm he clearly had drink taken. He took his dinner, and then at 6.00pm said was going to get the paper at Daniel E O’Boyle’s, a stone’s throw from the house. After 15 minutes there, he crossed the road to Logue’s. On arrival home at 10.00pm, “very drunk”, he picked a row with his wife when he was unable to tune the wireless. Then he viciously attacked her, punching and kicking her unconscious. A priest was called to administer the last rites to her. According to court records, O’Kelly called him a “baldy-headed bastard” and ordered him out of the house. Arrested in Belcruit on July 24th, O’Kelly was removed to Sligo Gaol and brought to court three days later, charged with inflicting grievous bodily harm on his wife and indecently assaulting one of the maids, a young girl. A trial date was set for mid-October and O’Kelly remanded in custody. However, on August 17th he was released on bail to Letterkenny Asylum. In October, a doctor testified in court that he was unfit to plead: “He was suffering from a certain amount of depression and confusion, and a certain amount of loss of memory.” Press reports at the time show the judge ruled O’Kelly was “not of sound mind” and returned him to the asylum. There he remained until February 1941, when a jury deemed him sane. He now pleaded guilty to three charges relating to the assault on his wife; the indecent assault charge had been dropped. The judge sentenced him to three months in Sligo Gaol. Úna O’Kelly, meanwhile, moved with their children to Ramelton, north Donegal, where her brother Seán was an established solicitor, and resumed her teaching career. By 1943, Dominic O’Kelly was back teaching, at the Prior School, a Protestant secondary school, in Lifford. He taught there until 1948, when he returned to primary teaching in CoSligo as principal of St John’s Well and then, in 1950, of Geevagh, a three-teacher school, moving a few years later to Claremorris, Co Mayo. After a car hit him in 1959, he retired early to Downings, north Donegal. O’Kelly knew no shame. Since his release from prison, he had been a regular contributor of verse to the regional press, especially the Derry Journal. In 1960 he published, like Master Boyle, a collection of his poetry, Sky, Sea, Sod. It was available from the printer, the Donegal Democrat, and from himself for 10 shillings and sixpence. His short introduction alludes to his “undermined career” and there is a marked note of grievance in several poems, notably the 30-verse “Death by Despair (How a Man Might Die in a Mental Hospital)”, which includes his self-pitying account of his attack on his wife. [ ‘Glenties is the stage’: Brian Friel’s DonegalOpens in new window ] Dominic O’Kelly died in 1970. An obituary in the Derry Journal lamented the passing of a man of “giant intellect”, a “most lovable and entertaining character”, and a “poet of outstanding genius”. Preceding it on the very same page was an interview with Friel on plans to make a film of Philadelphia. Friel alone likely got the irony. The solicitor who represented O’Kelly in 1939–41 was Pa O’Donnell (1907–70) of Burtonport, a UCD-educated lawyer, who was subsequently a Fine Gael TD (1949–70) and minister for local government (1954–57). Although not mentioned by name in Friel’s drafts, might O’Donnell have been the model for the UCD-educated Senator Doogan in Philadelphia? Perhaps. Certainly, other Rosses notables inspired characters in Friel’s “Ballybeg” plays. In a draft of Translations, for instance, Friel describes the Ballybeg hedge-schoolmaster as “a kind of dissipated Eunan O’Donnell”. Eunan O’Donnell (1923–99), who had an MA in Classics, had established a fee-paying secondary school in Dungloe in 1956. And when free education was introduced, and it was decreed that Dungloe was to have a vocational school, with an emphasis on the trades, not a secondary school, with an emphasis on academic subjects, he left to teach in Gonzaga in Dublin. In the play, Hugh O’Donnell, the Greek- and Latin-speaking hedge-schoolmaster is uncomfortable with the incoming national schools. He remembers, how, in 1798, he and Jimmy Jack, a 60-year-old who knew the classics and not much else, had marched, with the Aeneid in their pockets, before getting drunk in Phelan’s pub in Glenties. There, overcome by the desiderium nostrorum (the need for our own), they resolved to march home. “And that was the longest 23 miles back I ever made.” Glenties, before the road was straightened in recent years, was 23 miles from Kincasslagh. So Ballybeg isn’t Glenties any more, Toto, it is Kincasslagh? No, Dorothy: Ballybeg is Anywhere, but populated in Philadelphia and Translations with characters modelled on people in the Rosses where Brian Friel holidayed from the 1950s. Breandán Mac Suibhne is a historian at the University of Galway. He is writing a book on the individuals on whom the characters in Dancing at Lughnasa are based. A new 35th anniversary production of Dancing at Lughnasa opens as part of FrielDays - A Homecoming on August 1st at St Columba’s Comprehensive School in Glenties, near the house in which was play was set. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Massive data centers also require oodles of energy.“These AI data centers are going to require more power than anything we could ever have imagined. We at the G7 do not have enough power,” said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink last year.From Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk and many more, there is a similar consensus among Silicon Valley’s leaders that AI will necessitate a huge increase in demand for dependable and affordable energy.In order to meet this forthcoming rapid increase in demand for reliable and affordable energy, it is absolutely essential that the United States pursues what Trump calls “energy dominance.”A few months ago, Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council, which aims to “expand energy production and address cost barriers.”RELATED: Trump Admin to Announce Big, Beautiful News in AI InvestmentsTrump Holds Post-Certification Press Conference, Announces Huge New Investment in Data CentersDuring his first term, Trump made great strides in unleashing American energy. However, most of those successful policies were rejected by President Biden, who then went all-in on the so-called green energy transition.This created a skewed energy market that subsidized unaffordable and unreliable power via solar panels and windmills to the detriment of conventional energy sources that are much more affordable, reliable, and cleaner.Fortunately, President Trump recognizes the sheer folly of the green transition. For years, he has rightfully pointed out that solar panels and windmills are not actually friendly to the environment, unless you ignore the facts that they destroy pristine lands, disrupt ecosystems and habitats, are nearly impossible to recycle, and result in the mass killing of birds, whales, and other animals.So far, Trump has delivered on his campaign promises to eliminate the “Green New Scam.” In a little more than six months, he has already taken the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again), signed a bevy of executive orders to accelerate the domestic production of coal, oil and natural gas, and signed into law the reconciliation bill, which eliminated many of the outrageous subsidies that have kept the green energy industry afloat for decades.Moreover, Trump has assembled an all-star team of energy officials who are climate realists. From Energy Secretary Chris Wright to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the days of climate alarmism driving federal policy are long gone.Americans should rejoice at this development. Going forward, Trump’s energy dominance agenda will keep prices at the pump low and utility bills less exorbitant.

For years, he has rightfully pointed out that solar panels and windmills are not actually friendly to the environment, unless you ignore the facts that they destroy pristine lands, disrupt ecosystems and habitats, are nearly impossible to recycle, and result in the mass killing of birds, whales, and other animals.So far, Trump has delivered on his campaign promises to eliminate the “Green New Scam.” In a little more than six months, he has already taken the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again), signed a bevy of executive orders to accelerate the domestic production of coal, oil and natural gas, and signed into law the reconciliation bill, which eliminated many of the outrageous subsidies that have kept the green energy industry afloat for decades.Moreover, Trump has assembled an all-star team of energy officials who are climate realists.

However, most of those successful policies were rejected by President Biden, who then went all-in on the so-called green energy transition.This created a skewed energy market that subsidized unaffordable and unreliable power via solar panels and windmills to the detriment of conventional energy sources that are much more affordable, reliable, and cleaner.Fortunately, President Trump recognizes the sheer folly of the green transition. For years, he has rightfully pointed out that solar panels and windmills are not actually friendly to the environment, unless you ignore the facts that they destroy pristine lands, disrupt ecosystems and habitats, are nearly impossible to recycle, and result in the mass killing of birds, whales, and other animals.So far, Trump has delivered on his campaign promises to eliminate the “Green New Scam.” In a little more than six months, he has already taken the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement (again), signed a bevy of executive orders to accelerate the domestic production of coal, oil and natural gas, and signed into law the reconciliation bill, which eliminated many of the outrageous subsidies that have kept the green energy industry afloat for decades.Moreover, Trump has assembled an all-star team of energy officials who are climate realists. From Energy Secretary Chris Wright to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the days of climate alarmism driving federal policy are long gone.Americans should rejoice at this development.

Title: The coming Bitcoin treasury bubble could rival the dot-com era with $11T of capital chasing BTC

Experts are calling the next boom a Bitcoin treasury bubble that could rival the dot-com era, with $11 trillion of institutional capital on the sidelines and a possible path to $1 million BTC. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s quiet rally has captured the attention of Wall Street and beyond, but some voices from OG Bitcoiners like American HODL are predicting that what we’ve witnessed so far is just the calm before an explosive storm. The Bitcoin treasury bubble thesis is that, within just a few years, a tidal wave of corporate, institutional, and possibly sovereign capital totaling as much as $11 trillion could flood into Bitcoin. Some projections suggest that true mania may not hit until 2026 or beyond, potentially sending the price as high as $1 million per coin. Swan Bitcoin exchange unpacked this thesis, examining the signals, mechanics, and real-world examples supporting the case for a Bitcoin treasury bubble that could rival the wildest days of the dot-com boom. Let’s check it out. This month, Bitcoin marked a new all-time high above $120,000, pushing its market cap to $2.4 trillion, trailing only behind Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and gold. Yet, this move has come with little public awareness or euphoria. The price has stair-stepped higher in a quiet fashion, led not by retail speculation but by deliberate, low-profile corporate and institutional buying. As Swan pointed out: “This is the least euphoric bull market we’ve ever seen… and that’s bullish.” Public companies ranging from Strategy to Metaplanet, GameStop to Trump Media are accumulating Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and more novel models, such as those pioneered by Strive Asset Management, see companies converting cash reserves to Bitcoin, not for speculation but as an inflation hedge and long-term holding. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently warned that if the U.S. can’t rein in ballooning debt, America might lose its stance as the world’s reserve asset. He said: “I just don’t know if it’s going to be a crisis in six months or six years, and I’m hoping that we change both the trajectory of the debt and the ability of market makers to make markets. Unfortunately, it may be that we need that to wake us up.” As of fiscal year 2025, U.S. debt interest payments are projected to reach $952 billion, and as the dollar loses luster, Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold” and a reserve asset strengthens. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed Dimon’s concerns, saying: “If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin.” The bond market is pricing in interest rate cuts, suggesting a potential return to “easy money” conditions as early as 2026. Lower rates mean cheap capital, more risk-on sentiment, and historically, a surge in asset prices, including Bitcoin. As Swan observed: “Bitcoin ran from $42K → $123K during the tightest monetary policy in modern history. What happens when liquidity floods back in?” Remember the lockdown era? When rate cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic spurred rally after rally across crypto markets, culminating in parabolic gains for Bitcoin? With another cycle of rate slashing potentially on the horizon, the setup looks eerily similar. According to Swan, big buyers are still mostly on the sidelines, finalizing mergers and legal structures. Names like Nakamoto, Twenty One Capital, and Strive Asset Management have yet to fully deploy capital, but are preparing multi-billion-dollar mandates. As coins are absorbed by corporate treasuries through algorithmic “drip-buying,” available supply dries up without dramatic price spikes. When enough boardrooms and sovereigns hit “bid” at the same time, price action could turn “reflexive” where buying by one entity triggers more entities to chase Bitcoin, echoing the late-’90s scramble for “internet stories.” Just like every dot-com needed an “internet story” to survive in 1999, every major firm may soon feel pressure to have a “Bitcoin strategy.” This “narrative contagion” can push prices to unimaginable heights (well beyond what fundamentals alone would suggest). American HODL, among others, sees a realistic path: “I think the treasury company bubble can get dot-com level large. We could see a 3–4 year run that takes Bitcoin well beyond a million dollars.” This isn’t isolated. BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes and long-term Bitcoin advocate Mark Moss also projected a $1,000,000 BTC by 2030. So is it plausible that we’re seeing the opening moves of a bubble that could rival the dot-com era? The pieces are falling into place. Mania may yet be a year or two away, but if history rhymes, the blow-off top could take Bitcoin to levels few believed possible just a few years ago.

Title: Ethereum ETFs Outpacing Bitcoin? BlackRock’s ETHA Hits $10B Benchmark

Time Published: 2025-07-26T14:30:32Z

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust has raced past a major mark. It now holds $10 billion in assets, just one year after launch. That pace makes it the fastest non‑Bitcoin ETF to hit that level and the third‑fastest ETF overall in US history. ETHA’s rapid popularity also may lead to more competition. Other issuers will be watching closely to see if staking approval gives ETHA a leg up on the competition. Lower cost fees or competing custodians may change their offerings to remain competitive. Investors will be comparing fee schedules, custodial arrangements, and staking opportunities as they place their Ether. LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC. Amazingly it went from $5b to $10b in just 10 days (ETF asset equiv of a God candle). Is in Top 5 in flows 1M, 1W. Sister Hazel! pic.twitter.com/Jrrb15BdHV — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 24, 2025 Ethereum ETFs are moving quickly. Latest data shows they drew nearly $5 billion in monthly inflows overall. On July 17 alone, Ethereum funds saw $602 million net injections. At the same time, Bitcoin ETFs brought in over $520 million. That shift hints at growing confidence in Ethereum’s role beyond simple currency use. ETHA’s sponsor fee of 0.25% is low enough to attract big players. Based on reports, BlackRock set it up with Coinbase Prime as custodian after filing in November 2023. The US Securities and Exchange Commission approved spot Ethereum ETFs alongside seven other funds early in 2024. That green light opened the door for major institutional flows. Analysts point to Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake system and its DeFi applications as key drivers. Staking locks up Ether and earns rewards, offering a potential yield that Bitcoin funds can’t match. BlackRock has applied to let ETHA stake its holdings. If approved, some of ETHA’s Ethereum will be locked up to generate staking income. That decision could come later this year after the SEC clarified that staking rewards count as income, not a security. Ethereum’s rise also reflects a broader search for yield. With bond returns still low and stock markets volatile, some investors are turning to crypto products that offer returns beyond price gains. ETHA’s quick growth shows that institutional demand for crypto is no longer limited to Bitcoin. Based on reports, ETHA ranks first among spot Ethereum ETFs in both size and growth rate. BlackRock’s deep pockets and respected brand do not hurt either. A large brand like BlackRock has clout when it comes to working with highly regulated assets. With Ethereum now being seen as a broader-than-niche token, large asset managers see a chance to add crypto to mainstream portfolios.

Title: XRP Price Set To Teleport As Major Financial Players Tap In — Opportunity Window Closing Fast
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-set-to-teleport/
Time Published: 2025-07-26T13:00:13Z

The XRP price is already looking at a rapid move after the market decline that rocked the altcoin in the last few days. This comes amid expectations of a Spot XRP ETF, as well as a move by Ripple to sweep in and take a bite out of SWIFT’s market share. As one XRP analyst puts it, the altcoin is already set for takeoff, and the only thing left now is for it to trigger a face-melting rally. Crypto researcher and XRP community member Ripple Van Winkle has sounded the alarm for investors for what could be coming next for the altcoin. In a video posted on X, Van Winkle explains that the teal XRP move was yet to happen, and what was seen before was only a preview of what was yet to come. He pointed to a number of factors that are set to drive the XRP price higher, including larger institutional players looking to tap into the altcoin. The analyst mentioned that the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, and PNC, among others, are already circling, especially as XRP ETFs become more popular over time. These trillion-dollar players are expected to possibly jump on the bandwagon once XRP begins receiving ETF approvals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Due to this, the researcher believes that the XRP price has not even started to move. In fact, he explains that the ‘real move’ is actually ‘encoded into the system.’ This move, he explains, is not going to be a gradual move for the market. But rather, he expects the price to expand rapidly during this time. Ahead of this expected move, Van Winkle has urged XRP investors to hang tight. For those who are still holding their coins, he suggests continuous holding and faith in the altcoin for a move that he says will hit like a freight train and catch everyone off guard. As for those who are yet to invest in the altcoin, the crypto researcher explains that they have only a small window of opportunity to get into the cryptocurrency before it takes off. He expects the move to make instant millionaires of investors when it eventually happens. In his post, he points to things like pre-programmed liquidity and institutional ETFs as things that will drive the rally. According to Van Winkle, there is going to be a reset that will cause the XRP price to teleport to possibly new all-time highs. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: The Best Brokers For Saving On Capital Gains Taxes

ByWilliam Baldwin ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. You make money in the market but tell the IRS you’re losing money. Yes, this works—for a while. Direct indexing with loss harvesting looks like a bonanza, for both providers and customers. Is it? Short answer: Yes, but. Yes, you can do nicely with this scheme, more than covering the fees charged. The two buts: (1) Before getting in, think about what’s going to happen on the way out. Below I will present a cautionary tale about the resulting mess. (2) Take any vendor’s projection of tax savings with a grain of salt. Providers evidently see gold here. In recent years Vanguard, BlackRock, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan, Stanley have bought their way into the business. Wealthfront, a Palo Alto, California robo-adviser, has made a great success democratizing automated loss harvesting and aims to go public in the near future. Frec, a newer San Francisco firm and something of a Wealthfront knock-off, has shaken up the business with an insanely low-cost offering. Direct indexing means owning the S&P 500 or another index not via a fund but via individual stock positions. Instead of putting $100,000 into the Vanguard S&P 500 exchange-traded fund you buy 42.4 shares of Nvidia, 13.7 shares of Microsoft, 0.33 shares of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies and so on. Or rather, a computer does the buying. Periodically the computer plucks out losers to sell for a capital loss, replacing them temporarily with substitute stocks that behave similarly (Merck for Pfizer, perhaps). After 30 days have passed, the original position can be restored without creating a loss-killing wash sale. You sit on the winners for as long as you can. We are, of course, talking about money in taxable accounts. There is no point to direct indexing inside an IRA or 401(k). A direct indexing account typically has between 200 and 400 stocks. You don’t need more than that to do a decent job of tracking an index with 500 stocks in it. Parametric Portfolio Associates was a pioneer in this business, originally offering the tax dodge to wealthy clients paying for custom portfolio management. Its direct-indexing skills (and the large footprint of Morgan Stanley, which picked up the company when it acquired Eaton Vance) explain Parametric’s $400 billion of assets under management. The prevalence of fractional shares and the automation of financial advice mean that little people can now get in on the action, with as little $5,000. What kind of capital losses do you get? That will depend on the direction and the volatility of the market. Over a decade, Wealthfront reports, capital losses have averaged 2.6% to 3.3% per year for its clients, but there is a great deal of year-to-year variation. People who put money in at the beginning of 2022 got a gusher of losses in the ensuing crash, but then they would have been better off waiting for a year and doing without the tax goodie. Remember that your aim with loss harvesting is not to have losses. It’s to have gains but report losses. Suppose you have a plump capital loss to put onto your tax return. How much good does that do you? This is a function of your tax bracket and your other investing activity. Capital losses can absorb any amount of capital gains and, beyond that, can be written off against up to $3,000 a year of ordinary income like salaries. Unused losses can be carried forward indefinitely but expire with the taxpayer’s death. It is reasonable to expect that the tax benefits will, in the early years of a direct indexing account, more than pay for the fees, which are usually in the range of 0.1% to 0.4% a year. But at some point, perhaps after five years of a mostly bullish market, or later if stocks go sideways, you will have nothing but gain positions. Note that someone who bought in 2015 would not have derived much tax benefit from the crash of 2022 because even at its low point that year the market was twice as high as in 2015. This matter of loss exhaustion brings me to the first caveat about fancified indexing. What are you planning to do when it’s time to move on? To illustrate, I will cite the case of a Forbes reader that I will identify as Mr. X. X signed up for a separately managed account with a financial advisor who was using direct-indexing software. Recently, with most of the potential losses captured, he quit the advisor and deposited the stock at a discount broker. He asked me: Now what should I do? X is sitting on an interesting pile of shares. He owns Nvidia at a $12 entry point, and should let that position ride. So, too, with gains in Taiwan Semiconductor, Broadcom and Microsoft. But he’s got 140 positions that are now underwater or showing small gains. It would be nice to declutter. Some of these clunkers will be easy to dispose of. Pepsico, Nike, Pfizer—no problem. But what about PT Bank Raykat or Airports of Thailand? These American Depositary Receipts trade over the counter, which is to say, not on Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange. On Yahoo Finance I recently saw the airport ADR with an average daily trading volume of 993 shares and a frightful bid/ask spread of $9.52 to $12. X could sell all the cats and dogs, but would probably get hosed on the OTC shares. Apart from their sometimes larcenous bid/ask spreads, unlisted shares may not qualify for commission-free trading. Another problem: Odd lots (less than 100 shares), of which X has more than 400, are sometimes hard to trade. This junkpile cries out for all-or-none orders (you don’t want a trade to turn an odd lot into an odder one). But combining that restriction with a price limit increases the chance that an order simply won’t be executed. X did walk away with a fat loss carryforward, which may come in handy some day, but is likely to spend many hours cleaning up. Here’s someone commenting anonymously online on direct indexing: “I made a big mistake doing it in a Wealthfront account and when I wanted to consolidate holdings with another firm, I had to manually sell 195 securities. Stick to broad index ETFs!” I don’t entirely agree with that sentiment. Direct indexing makes sense if you have plans for the end game and if you stick to large U.S. companies. I’ll go this far with the Wealthfront critic: You should get your small-stock and foreign exposures via ETFs. Now let’s look at the second caveat, which is to understand the value of a capital loss. Wealthfront says that, over the past decade, it has captured $3.5 billion of losses for its customers, 91% of them short-term. (These figures include earlier versions of tax-wise automated investing as well as the more recent direct indexing product.) The losses, it declares, have saved people an estimated $1 billion in taxes. Fine print: The estimate assumes that all of the short-term losses went to use, immediately, against short-term gains. This is unrealistic. Someone with a $100,000 account generating $3,000 of capital losses, and with no capital gains to report, can indeed use the $3,000 against ordinary (that is, high-taxed) income. But someone with a $1 million account generating $30,000 of capital losses is unlikely to be using all that against high-bracket income. It would require having at least $27,000 of short-term capital gains. People do not have short-term capital gains unless they engage in foolish behavior, such as investing in a hedge fund. Rational investors do, however, have long-term gains to report. They get them from employer stock, sales of homes, all-cash takeovers and unwanted capital gain distributions from mutual funds. Realistic assumptions for big-ticket investors: You will be using most of your capital losses, whether short or long, to absorb long-term gains. You may find yourself using a loss long after you harvested it. The top rate on long gains is 23.8% plus whatever your state grabs. Conclusion: Losses are valuable but not as valuable as advertised. Now here are some product reviews. This one is my favorite. It offers a direct-indexed S&P 500 account at a bargain-basement 0.09% annual fee, with a $5,000 minimum. In a price war with Wealthfront, this outfit has the same 0.09% fee for the S&P 500 direct deal, with a $20,000 minimum. It gets a runner-up status because it’s newer and smaller. It oversees $350 million to Wealthfront’s $80 billion. Frec has some interesting variations on the theme, including a Sharia-compliant index portfolio at 0.35%. Its direct-indexing product uses 250 or so stocks to mimic the Fidelity Large-Cap Index (similar but not identical to the S&P 500). The annual fee is 0.4%, with a $5,000 minimum. When the harvesting wears out you can transfer the collection of stocks to a no-fee brokerage account. Forty basis points is a lot. But using this service could make sense if you have other money at Fidelity, which oversees (in custody or management) $15 trillion. It has a powerful brokerage platform and the oldest and biggest broker-affiliated donor-advised charity fund. Exit plan: Offload your long-term winners onto the charity, which will take them, fractional shares included, with a few mouse clicks. Charles Schwab has a 0.4% direct indexing product (minimum, $100,000) and a charity fund similar to Fidelity’s. This firm invented retail-level indexing and is known for its low costs. Four years ago it spent an undisclosed sum of money (your money, if you are a Vanguard customer; it’s a mutual corporation) to acquire direct indexer Just Invest Systems. So, what’s on offer? I can’t find an answer on the Vanguard website, which has only a vague description of direct indexing aimed at financial advisors. The company did not respond to a press inquiry. A few weeks ago former shareholders of Just Invest sued Vanguard, claiming they were double-crossed on a performance payout. Could be a while before we see a competitive offering from the indexing king.

Title: FeliSpeaks: Life as a ‘black, Irish, queer culchie’

Full Content:
Over the past decade, Felicia Olusanya, who performs as FeliSpeaks, has written themselves into the contemporary Irish cultural canon. Growing up in Longford town, having moved to Ireland from Nigeria (via France) at the age of eight, there have been multiple landmarks along their creative journey to becoming a compelling and well-recognised performer on Dublin’s spoken word scene. Yet early on, they imbued their poetry with its own specific cadence, intonations, a musicality that can move like waves, often becoming an enveloping experience for audiences. A moment that felt especially important was in 2017, at a fundraiser for the Repeal the 8th campaign in the Olympia Theatre. Olusanya’s capacity to both quieten and command the room was potent. What emerged was a poem written at their desk in the credit union where they worked: They were nominated for Best Performer at Dublin Fringe Festival in 2018 for Boy Child, co-written with Dagogo Hart, and then won the award in 2022, for their performance in thisispopbaby’s production, WAKE. Their poem, For Our Mothers, was included on the English Leaving Certificate curriculum in 2023. Olusanya has spent the past two years living in Brussels, returning to Dublin in early July. They arrive in Temple Bar on a sunny weekday morning, finishing up a deli pastry. In the Project Arts Centre, we sit at the back of the empty auditorium upstairs, the airy silence interrupted only by a lone technician clearing lights from the stage floor. At this year’s Dublin Fringe Festival, this stage will be Olusanya’s. Octopus Children, presented by thisispopbaby, is written by Olusanya, who also performs in the piece. Olusanya describes it as a “choreopoem”, using the term coined by the American playwright and poet Ntozake Shange, where multiple disciplines including poetry, music, and dance combine. “Octopus Children,” Olusanya explains, “is this idea that we’re all connected by water. We all come from the water, the birth canal, we drink water to survive, we’re 70 per cent water. I think water is integral to how we live, and one of the things we waste the most. That’s the underbelly of the piece. The overbelly, if I can say that, is just trying to figure out where you fit as a person.” These are the tentacles. “There are many layers people can see themselves in. But being black, and then being black-Irish, and then being black, Irish and queer in a religious setting, in a Nigerian setting, in Ireland, is very specific.” And beyond that, Olusanya deadpans, “being a culchie”. The idea for Octopus Children arrived in 2021. Olusanya felt the poems landing as songs. “I could hear a sonic world with them.” They began hanging out with some producers in a garage in Blackrock in Dublin – “very sweet boys” – working on a concept for an EP. The first piece completed in 2022, Tough Meat, was a video poem directed by Bobby Zithelo. “Putting that out into the world, I was hoping to leverage that in some capacity – somebody will see it! Somebody will think it’s brilliant!” In the meantime, Olusanya captivated audiences in WAKE. That show was a hit, journeying from Dublin Fringe Festival to a standalone sold-out run at the National Stadium in Dublin, and then to London’s West End, and Manchester’s Aviva Studios. The show holds many things simultaneously: chaotically fun cabaret; aerial artistry; breathtaking pole-dancing; club anthems; dance; poetry; Irish traditional music – all combining to become a moving funeral rite and a great night out. In WAKE, Olusanya is a central character – part ringmaster, part preacher, part spirit, part healer, an anchor tethering the audience to the spiritual essence of the show. In rehearsals, Olusanya says that before developing the character, the thisispopbaby team “really developed my talent and stretched it a bit”. Olusanya relishes a challenge. “If you’ve ever grown up in a choir and a Nigerian auntie has been your choir master, girl, you take challenges real well! Nothing can faze you.” [ Thisispopbaby’s magic sauce: ‘Take Irish traditional culture, add some mirror balls, throw some glitter on it’Opens in new window ] Olusanya recalls telling Jennifer Jennings, WAKE’s co-director and co-creator, that the character felt like an offering for the audience. Amid the neon and glitter, WAKE is also about expressing and diffusing grief. “Grief is so traumatic, and if you’re going to address it, you need to bring balm. I feel like that was what I was tasked with,” Olusanya says. At one performance in the West End, they recall “coming off the stage and I wasn’t even thinking about the words, I was being the words ... I vacuum cleaned the grief in the room. There’s something so difficult about that, feeling the intensity of people’s grief. Take it off their hands, and then offering balm. Oftentimes I’ll get offstage and my body is wracked. Hyperventilating. I can’t breathe.” An audience in the midst of releasing their emotion – joy or pain – doesn’t often consider where that energy goes when those on stage are opening up those channels. “Energy cannot be destroyed or created,” Olusanya says. “It can only be passed from one to the next. So if you’re releasing and you feel great, I’m determined to swallow it all up. I’ll bring it before my chi and my god and release it that way.” They pause to consider that process and experience. “I felt powerful enough to be able to do that. I’ve been thinking about power a lot. Once you’re aware of your magnitude or power, for me, awareness of my power meant service. You can’t be powerful and useless – come on! The more aware of my power I am, the more I submit to the service of other people via my art. That’s what I’m here for.” After the second run of WAKE in Dublin, Olusanya says thisispopbaby asked, “What do you want to create? What do you have in mind?” Olusanya answered: Octopus Children. “I made them a little PowerPoint with all the ideas and thoughts, the sounds, the music I had already created. They were like, ‘What in the hell? Here’s a director. Go sort that out.’ They were interested, they were curious. I really appreciated that they wanted to see my perspective on life.” That director is Oonagh Murphy. Murphy says Olusanya is “a counter voice to what we’re familiar with in the Irish cultural imagination. But also the craft of their work is incredible. When you think about how prolific their output is, there is a real discipline ... And there’s a deep playfulness there too. For all the weight and darker elements of the work – which need to be given space – Feli also brings a real lightness, humour, and an irony.” [ Sabotage review: Joyously chaotic festival opener has all the fun of the circusOpens in new window ] Working on Octopus Children, Murphy says, “has felt quite spiritual, magical”. Early on in our conversation, Olusanya refers to “being the rebel in your family unit”. What does that rebellion look like? Their upbringing, community and family in Longford runs deep. As a youngster, Olusanya was “a good girl, because I liked the things that I was supposed to like”. They loved school, “which, if you know anything about immigrant families, this is the one thing”. They loved church, “because I was very aware of my spiritual nature from when I was very young, and I didn’t have any other outlet for it”. They loved going to choir, and being part of a youth group. “The rebellion started when I hit 15 or 16. I started wrestling with my gender identity without knowing what it was. I didn’t even know what those terms were until I hit maybe 21, 22 ... I wore the wrong clothing. I ‘girled’ differently to how I should have. So my mum was quite worried about that. I also wanted to explore kissing boys and girls, but it was like: that’s not something you do. And I was very aware of that.” Around the age of 17, Olusanya recalls taking their younger brothers to the barber shop. “I came home with a haircut too. My mother said, ‘What is the matter?’ She was so concerned because I cut my hair.” The rebellion “ramped up” in college in Maynooth, where they were studying English and sociology, “because I decided to leave Christianity”. Then, there was coming out as queer. “I came out by accident. I didn’t know I was coming out, I was just talking about being queer on Instagram.” I want black Irish girls, or non-binary people, or gays, to be like, ‘Ahh! That’s a bit of me!’ Olusanya had attended Dublin Pride, alone, “so excited, just taking it in, like wow ... I came back from my first Pride parade, and I made a whole Instagram post – as you do when you’re 23 and stupid. I was so excited, saying all my thoughts, and I forgot church people followed me. My mum followed me, obviously. She commented, ‘Mum’s got your back always.’ It was really beautiful in that moment. However, some tricky conversations in the community in Longford followed. “You know in the movies where they want to pray the gay away? They’re really serious about that, you know… I was like: I like my gay. I’m not giving up my gay… That in itself was a rebellion.” On the hurt this induced, Olusanya says they “would rather that pain, than the pain of hiding”. Tears pooling in Olusanya’s eyes, they express empathy and understanding for the context. “That in itself is complicated and confusing, and requires all the emotional intelligence in the world to navigate. But yeah,” they say, brushing the tears away, “that’s also in Octopus Children.” Olusanya flips the atmosphere into a moment of unexpected lightness, “Do you know what? The Laya Healthcare ad helped!” Laughter fills the empty theatre. “Do you know how cool it is when you’re on billboards? They get over the gay stuff quick!” In late 2021, Olusanya appeared in a campaign for the health insurance company, bringing their image and words on to television screens and billboards across Ireland. I suggest that this feels like a quintessentially Irish experience, but perhaps one more associated with another time. Olusanya nods, connecting the social attitudes of older generation white Irish people to first generation Nigerian-Irish. “I don’t like saying this, but that’s how far away we are in terms of where we should be. I’m not saying white Irish Ireland has it all figured out, but in terms of the queer thing? It just feels like the story is a 1980s Irish experience. It feels like a time-travelling experience. [ Taylor Tomlinson at 3Arena review: more personal, more vulnerable but few surprisesOpens in new window ] “When immigrant black people come here and they make black Irish children, they’re not expecting the assimilation that we experience. My parents and their peers came purely out of survival – ‘at least you’re going to have a fighting chance’. When people come from a survival mentality and you’re trying to operate from a thriving mentality, they’re terrified. Because even though they do want you to thrive, they don’t know what that looks like. And so there is this push and pull between: ‘I want you to be better and that’s why I brought you here,’ versus, ‘What better looks like is really confusing and alienating for me as the mother or father or family that brought you here.’” This can cause, Olusanya believes, a “disconnect” between some black youth in Ireland, and their parents and older relatives. “It’s either thrive and evolve, or we just end up replicating our parents. So that 1980s connection is so interesting. There’s half of us who are like, ‘F**k it, I’m going to take this opportunity to thrive beyond the economic.’ Because, no word of a lie, black Irish people my age? Disgustingly equipped and educated. They have masters degrees for no reason, bruv! What, to work in a Centra? Relax!” The Centra line is obviously a joke. “They’re taking over Google! What’s going on?! Educated to s**t. Lawyers, medical doctors. We’re not playing it small, because we’re not allowed to. We’re not allowed to play it small, because survival involves going all the way up here,” Olusanya raises their hand. “But that’s economic survival.” The social and spiritual aspect, they say, is another thing. I wonder whether the reaction Olusanya experienced to them being queer was also about a fear of another layer of oppression to contend with in a racist society. The conversations Olusanya had with family and others, they say, were “not about hate, it’s about fear. They were terrified, because they’ve built these communities and structures that incubate them safely. When you pop out of it for work, to socialise, you can still come back home. Even if I get racist experiences at work, there’s a whole community that have my back I can come back to, so that is a temporary experience. That’s how I think the older generation view it. Whereas if you’re then gay, it’s not the thing that’s going to break you out ‘there’ in the white Irish world, but it will,” - or may - “in the home that we’ve all built that’s supposed to support you no matter what.” “I want us to be able to have our communities, grow our communities, and not be caged by our communities, because that’s also what’s happening when people come from a space of survival, psychologically. I can’t wait for a couple of generations where our people feel completely safe, that there isn’t a demarcation. Sociologically and psychologically we all do this: you’re drawn to people who are more like you, that’s normal, so you’ll always have those type of communities anyway. I’m not saying we need to dismantle our safety in our community in order to integrate. That’s not what I’m asking for. But what I am saying, is to free ourselves from the limitations that the survival of our communities has brought. And one of those limitations,” Olusanya says, is a feeling “that you can’t be queer. Especially not out loud.” They have just returned from two years in Brussels, a place Olusanya went to out of a sense of adventure and “safety, because it felt like the country held me well - I visited several parts of of Belgium before settling in Brussels - and I didn’t want to go to London especially, very Dublin 2.0 vibes.” Living there, they were exposed to “a type of freedom and blackness that I had never seen before or experienced”, as well as new forms of dance and jazz. Now, Olusanya is ready for the next phase. They hope what Octopus Children does is make people “one, feel visible in multiple ways, per tentacle. But two, that it frees us from the limitation of our own community – seeing a ‘me’. I’ve come to accept – and no ego s**t – you just end up being a pioneer. You don’t want to be a public figure, you don’t want to be the person people look up to. But if you’re going to do something different, you’re going to end up being that ... With this show, I want to show my community – black Irish people – and the white Irish community, that this weird layered person-being can be visible, and it’s completely okay. Visible and celebrated. I want black Irish girls, or non-binary people, or gays, to be like, ‘Ahh! That’s a bit of me!’ and not feel like there’s no representation. I hate the word representation, but it’s so f***ing important. But I don’t want to be the only one. I want to be able to make Octopus Children so octopus children can find it, so there can be a community of us, so we’re very visible, very loud.” Una Mullally, a contributor to The Irish Times, writes a weekly opinion column © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: JioBlackRock Mutual Fund: New entrant in industry eyes profitable and scalable growth in India

Jio BlackRock Asset Management, one of the latest high-profile entrants into the Indian mutual fund industry, may be following a slightly different playbook from group entity Jio's disruptive telecom foray, as reported by ET Bureau. The 50:50 joint venture between Mukesh Ambani-backed Jio Financial Services and the world's largest asset manager BlackRock, may not be as aggressive on its pricing strategy to grab market share, unlike Jio's sharp discounting that helped it catapult into the big league in telecom. Profitability and capturing share from new growth in a market that has grown threefold in five years will be some of its mantras. "It is not at all to just capture market share, and profitability will be important and pricing is one of the key points," said Sid Swaminathan, MD and CEO, Jio Blackrock Asset Management, in an exclusive interview with ET. The fund house is keen to offer differentiated content, value-added products and grow the market rather than grab share from existing players, he said. One of the differentiators Jio BlackRock will bring is its proprietary tech platform Aladdin, which will help in cutting transaction costs. Jio Blackrock started operations in India this month with launch of three debt schemes that include overnight, liquid and money market funds that mopped up Rs 17,800 crore in early July. There have been talks that Reliance has also invested in the NFO. Though the fund house has started with index funds, it aims to offer the entire range of index and active funds, funds that are driven by data, exchange traded funds (ETFs), specialised investment funds (SIFs) and alternate investment funds (AIFs) over time.

Title: Valuing cherished heirlooms: ‘Google can be a good starting point but it’s best to ask a specialist

Auctioneers regularly hear from members of the public seeking their opinion on the value of a piece of jewellery, a painting, a rare book or a piece of antique furniture. And while most auctioneers offer their expertise for free, many say that members of the public often have unrealistically high expectations of the value of the items they bring in to be valued. “Some clients have done their own research before they come to us but a lot of the time it has been done incorrectly, leading them to having higher expectations than the true auction market,” says Claire-Laurence Mestrallet, head of jewellery at Adam’s Fine Art Auctioneers and Valuers on St Stephen’s Green, Dublin. She explains that people can be confused between the insurance valuation (ie the retail value in case of loss or damage) and the more realistic price a piece might fetch when sold at auction. “Sometimes pieces are overvalued for insurance,” she says. According to Mestrallet, some people accept the valuation given by the auctioneer, while others need time to come to terms with the news before deciding to sell a piece. Engagement rings are among the items for which valuations are frequently sought. Jewellery that’s no longer worn and jewellery that’s been inherited but not necessarily wanted are also likely to be brought in for assessment on valuation days, she says. It’s often the case that people no longer want to keep valuable jewellery that they don’t wear in their homes and decide to sell it on. Adam’s is hosting valuation days next week in hotels in Dublin (Monday, July 28th), Belfast (Tuesday, July 29th), Cork (Wednesday, July 30th) and Limerick (Thursday, July 31st). Anyone interested in attending should email stephanie@adams.ie in advance. Mestrallet says valuation days always bring some surprises. “It’s like fishing. Some days, there is nothing and other days, you might see something spectacular,” she says. Valuation days are also a way for auctioneers to build relationships with future clients, with about 40-50 per cent of items seen on the day put on the market for sale subsequently. Will de Búrca of De Búrca Rare Books in Blackrock, Co Dublin, says his antiquarian and rare books shop receives photographs almost on a daily basis from people “hoping they’ve stumbled upon a hidden treasure in their attic or in their inherited library”. Most of the time, the owners of these potentially rare books, maps or manuscripts have already typed the details into Google in the hope of finding the answers to their questions. “The internet can be a good starting point but it’s a bit like diagnosing an illness – it’s best to ask a specialist,” says de Búrca. “What many people don’t realise is that a book’s true value lies in the detail: edition, condition, rarity, provenance and sometimes the story attached to it.” While it may be difficult to fathom, he says two books with the same title and date can differ in value substantially. “Valuations can be a bit of a reality check. Sometimes people are disappointed to learn their cherished heirloom is more sentiment than substance. Others are pleasantly surprised to discover that a volume on their shelf is actually quite valuable,” says de Búrca. Genuinely valuable or remarkable books don’t turn up very often. “Most inquiries turn out to be relatively common editions or books with more sentimental than market value.” He says that what makes a book particularly interesting for a dealer isn’t always its monetary value. “It’s rather if it has unique binding, marginalia [notes written in the margins of the text] from a notable owner or a forgotten piece of Irish printing that fills a gap in the historical record.” De Búrca Rare Books regularly puts up a selection of new books on its website for collectors to view. Morgan O’Driscoll, which has offices in Skibbereen, Co Cork and Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin, says paintings are often brought in for valuations. “If people send us an image of a painting, we will give them an initial valuation but we will never sell something unless we physically have it here,” says O’Driscoll. A final, formal valuation will only be given once he sees the painting in person to check its authenticity, size and condition. “Valuations are one of the most rewarding aspects of the job – never knowing when something truly special will come through the door. Those unexpected finds keep things exciting,” he says. On average, O’Driscoll estimates that about 50 per cent of the paintings sold in his art auctions come in through clients seeking valuations. One such work is the John Shinnors painting Falling, which is being offered in his current Irish Art online auction. Executed by the artist between 2000 and 2001, the oil-on-canvas work carries an estimate of between €8,000 and €12,000 and is available to bid on until 6.30pm this Monday, July 28th. According to O’Driscoll, most people are happy with the estimates that auctioneers give them. “They can see online the highest price an artist has made and avid collectors will know how much each artist’s paintings are worth,” he says.

Title: Is the YouTube channel you’re watching right now owned by private equity? A YouTuber investigates
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/news/youtube-channel-private-equity/
Time Published: 2025-07-26T03:00:00Z

Charlotte Colombo If you’re a YouTube enthusiast, I have bad news for you: some of your favorite channels might be owned by private equity companies. In a 12-minute video, Micro, a YouTube channel known for its microeconomics content, broke down exactly what this means. Essentially, a large portion of YouTube watch time is on channels owned by private equity firms, which in turn have raised billions of dollars from investors like Amazon and Softbank. Some channels like Donut Media, Veritasium, and Task and Purpose have been acquired publicly. Others, such as Dude Perfect and Coco Melon, have been acquired more privately, with no public disclosure. According to Mirco, the reason private equity firms are interested in YouTube channels is their growth and profitability potential, which makes them seem highly investable. Micro also claims that, currently, legacy media companies are threatened by new media. For them, private equity acquisitions are a form of self-preservation. The fact that YouTube channels already have an established audience makes it a lot easier to scale and monetize. Thus, private equity operations have dramatically increased. Firms like BlackRock manage over $12 trillion. The video also notes that the rise of private equity can have a substantial impact on YouTube content. The increased overheads that come with a private equity acquisition mean that they need more revenue to stay profitable. This, in turn, puts pressure on channels to produce more content and take on more sponsorships. According to Micro, this can lead to these creators gravitating towards “safer” and more generic content. Moreover, acquired channels often move away from one creator and build out a team to ensure that one person isn’t the be-all and end-all of the investment. This has the disadvantage of reduced viewership and a lack of fan support, as they struggle to adjust to the new content. Micro says this has led to the former hosts of big channels leaving to start independent channels. With this uptick in predictable, cookie-cutter-type content, could we be seeing a decline in YouTube creativity? Netizens, who made their feelings clear on Reddit, seem to think so. “Honestly, it’s pretty easy to spot corporate content imo,” one wrote. “Like it’s just so bland most of the time. It doesn’t have any personality behind it you know?”“Another dead giveaway is when they start collaborating with big companies instead of other YouTubers, schools, small businesses,” a second replied. While a third emphasised that we should keep in mind that “these are only the channels which have been publicly acquitted by P.E. firms. There are likely even more channels which we are unaware have already been acquitted or are in the process of being acquitted.” Is the future of entertainment doomed, or are we all just being a little too dramatic?

Title: Ethereum Validator Exit Queue Explodes To 521,000 ETH ATH, What This Means
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-validator-exit-queue/
Time Published: 2025-07-26T00:00:54Z
Full Content:
Ethereum staking validator Everstake has announced that the validator exit queue has reached its highest point in one year. The expert further explained why this development might be a positive for the ETH ecosystem. In an X post, Everstake stated that the Ethereum validator exit queue has reached its highest level in over a year, representing approximately 520,000 ETH, which is equivalent to $1.9 billion at current prices. The validator noted that this queue will take around 19 days to fully clear. He further explained that this exit queue tracks how many validators are leaving Ethereum’s staking system. This typically raises concerns about a huge sell-off being imminent from these validators. However, Everstake assured that the surge in the validator queue is not a sign of fear or collapse. Instead, the expert claimed that it is a shift, whereby these validators are more likely to exit and restake, optimize, or rotate operators than leave the ETH ecosystem. Meanwhile, Everstake admitted that there is still the possibility that these validators may want to lock in profits, especially seeing as the Ethereum price just recently surged to a six-month high. He noted that it is natural to assume that some stakers are preparing to sell, which could create short-term sell pressure and potentially cause ETH to correct. However, on the other hand, the validator remarked that Ethereum is seeing record ETF demand, with billions of dollars in net flows since the beginning of this month. As such, BlackRock, Fidelity, and other ETH ETF issuers could match this potential sell pressure with similar buying pressure. Everstake also declared that this development with the validator exit queue is a “sign of health” and the freedom to move. He claimed that activity like this shows how mature ETH staking has become, with the protocol doing what it was designed to do. He added that this is what decentralization looks like. SoSo Value data shows that the Ethereum ETFs have now recorded 15 consecutive days of net inflows. This follows the net inflow of $231.23 million that they recorded on July 24. These funds currently hold $20.70 billion in net assets, representing 4.59% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. The significant inflows into these funds support Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s theory that ETH will soon witness a demand shock. He stated that this demand will come from the ETFs and corporate treasuries, predicting that they could purchase up to $20 billion of ETH in the next year. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,630, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Government Bitcoin Reserves Could Push Price Beyond $1M, Analysts Say

Time Published: 2025-07-25T23:00:00Z

Governments are quietly reshaping the Bitcoin narrative—and it may be the catalyst that sends BTC beyond $1 million. A growing number of nations are adding Bitcoin to their reserves, according to analysts, as sovereign wealth funds and central banks turn to digital assets in the face of inflation, geopolitical risk, and the long-term decline of fiat confidence. From El Salvador’s BTC holdings to speculative reports of Kazakhstan, Bhutan, and even BlackRock-backed ETFs interacting with government channels, the momentum is building. Some macro analysts argue that just 1% of global sovereign reserves moving into Bitcoin could drive the price beyond $1 million. Amid this rising interest, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction as a breakout altcoin. Previous rounds sold out instantly as investors rushed to secure their spots, signaling a wave of early-stage demand that mirrors meme coin booms of the past. MAGACOIN FINANCE rounds spark early-mover frenzy In the midst of institutional accumulation and sovereign adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-upside opportunity for retail investors. Previous rounds sold out instantly, and analysts are projecting aggressive return potential as MAGA continues to expand utility and build community. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its hybrid positioning: cryptocurrency with viral appeal, but layered with growing functionality and planned listings. The lean supply and anti-dilution model have drawn comparisons to the early-stage couple of top 30 tokens on CoinMarketCap. As momentum builds, strategic entry remains a core focus for those looking to front-run the next altcoin cycle. Sovereign demand reshapes crypto market The shift began subtly. El Salvador became the first nation to make Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, but now other governments are exploring Bitcoin for reserve diversification. Sanctions, inflation, and debt monetization have eroded faith in traditional assets like U.S. Treasuries and euros—prompting smaller economies and wealth funds to explore BTC as a hedge. Financial strategists suggest that reserve diversification into Bitcoin is no longer fringe. With even mainstream banking giants like BlackRock facilitating sovereign access through ETFs, the process is becoming seamless. Analysts note that if global institutions continue this trend, Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics could undergo a seismic shift—driving long-term price appreciation beyond current expectations. Conclusion The idea of governments holding Bitcoin is no longer hypothetical—it’s happening. And with each new reserve-level buyer, the long-term price trajectory shifts upward. For institutional and retail investors alike, this changing landscape is creating both macro opportunity and altcoin openings. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such opening—already generating buzz as its momentum mirrors the conditions that drove past viral success stories.

Title: Tesla misses out on massive Bitcoin gains after selling at $20K
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/tesla-bitcoin-profits-missed-opportunity/
Time Published: 2025-07-25T20:26:53Z

Share this article Tesla could have made billions if it had held onto Bitcoin (BTC) instead of selling the bulk of it when prices crashed in 2022. In early 2021, Tesla acquired 43,200 Bitcoin worth $1.5 billion as part of its treasury diversification strategy, data from BitcoinTreasuries.net shows. Soon after, the company began accepting the asset as payment for its cars, but then suspended the option due to environmental concerns related to Bitcoin mining’s energy usage. In March of that year, Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company made its first Bitcoin sale, offloading 4,320 BTC when Bitcoin was trading above $58,000. Bitcoin reached a high of $61,500 during the 2021 cycle, so Tesla’s initial sale was not entirely unreasonably timed. By the end of June 2022, Tesla had sold another 29,160 BTC, representing 75% of its remaining holdings. At that time, Bitcoin was trading around $20,000 and later dropped to a yearly low of $16,500. However, the second sale was less favorable. It resulted in massive missed gains. Bitcoin has exploded since Wall Street stepped in, with major players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and other fund managers pushing to bring Bitcoin to institutional investors through ETFs. Grayscale’s court victory over the SEC paved the way for the landmark debut of spot Bitcoin funds in the US. Following that, Bitcoin has left the $20,000 level well behind. The digital asset crossed $100,000 last December and extended its rally to $122,000, its latest high. With Bitcoin trading at around $116,300 at the time of reporting, Tesla’s initial holdings would be valued at about $5 billion. The BTC it offloaded would be worth over $3.5 billion now. Tesla now holds 11,509 BTC worth around $1.4 billion. The company has not adjusted its Bitcoin portfolio since its last purchase. Tesla’s auto revenue dropped for the second quarter in a row, and the company missed Wall Street’s projections. The stock plunged 8% on Thursday before bouncing back 3.5% on Friday. It’s still down more than 21% so far this year, per Yahoo Finance. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account?

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, which trades under the ETHA ticker, just became the third-fastest ETF to reach $10 billion. It reached the milestone in 251 days. And was beat by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund—which did it in 34 days and 53 days, respectively. There was much hand wringing and head scratching on Wall Street when the launch of spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024 didn’t get the kind of reaction as Bitcoin ETFS did in January 2024. We’re talking $1 billion in trading volume for ETH funds’ debut vs. $4.5 billion for Bitcoin. But investors don’t seem worried or confused now. Looking ahead, there’s reason to believe the growth of crypto ETFs could accelerate even more. Analysts recently told Decrypt that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF issuers are likely to get the nod from the SEC to offer in-kind redemption and creation of shares. That would mean shares could be purchased with BTC or ETH—whichever happens to be the underlying asset—and that investors could receive BTC or ETH when they redeem their shares. The feature is popular with investors, but regulators are concerned the process is complex and could pose security concerns in crypto-based funds. Bitcoin glutton Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is back in the market raising cash to buy even more Bitcoin—this time with a new preferred stock offering that could add another $2.5 billion to its war chest. At the time of writing, Strategy’s 607,770 Bitcoin is currently worth $70.6 billion with a 1,519.17% in unrealized profit after adding another $739.8 million to its holdings on Monday. The company initially said it would raise $500 million with its new Stretch preferred stock offering, selling 5 million shares at $100 a pop. Then news got out (initially reported by Bloomberg) that the company would expand its offering to $2 billion. When the SEC filing finally hit EDGAR on Friday, it became clear the company intends to raise closer to $2.5 billion with its new Stretch preferred stock offering. Meanwhile, there’s a new class‑action lawsuit brewing over how Strategy amended terms for its Strike preferred stock offering. The company acknowledged in a July 21 filing that a plaintiff has filed a class action lawsuit alleging that holders of MSTR common stock ought to have been given a chance to vote on a July 7 amendment made to the Strike offering. Speaking of class action lawsuits: The July 15 deadline has passed for a judge to choose a lead plaintiff in the other Strategy class action lawsuit over statements made by executives about the risks involved in its Bitcoin treasury. Issuing debt to buy Bitcoin hits different when it's a Bitcoin miner. At least that’s what can be deduced from the way MARA Holdings saw its share price tumble when execs announced an $850 million raise on Wednesday. The stock slipped again on Thursday, when an SEC filing revealed the company upsized its offering to $950 million. The BTC the miner already holds in its treasury—second only to Strategy’s stash—is currently worth $5.8 billion. That puts its Bitcoin holdings nearly even with the company’s intraday market cap, which is $6 billion at the time of writing. But the company isn’t just going to buy Bitcoin with the proceeds of its raise. It wrote in its SEC filing that it plans to use a portion of the new cash for “working capital, strategic acquisitions, expansion of existing assets, and repayment of additional debt and other outstanding obligations.” All told, MARA shares look to be ending the week 12% lower than they started it, having gone from $19.98 per share to $17.15 at the time of writing. But Compass Point analysts see the dip as a minor issue. Early Friday, Compass Point analyst Ed Engel upgraded MARA from Sell to Neutral and nearly doubled his price target from $9.50 to $18. But he did caution in a note shared with Decrypt that the investors should expect to see some “pullback during seasonally weak August.” The upgrade is largely driven by Bitcoin’s recent performance, he added—but that’s not all. “While most miners are transitioning to HPC,” he wrote, referring to high-performance computing, “MARA seems committed to its HODL strategy that prioritizes ATM and convertible debt sales over selling BTC.” He also noted that while the company has increasingly used its BTC holdings in yield-generating strategies—approximately 15%, by Engel's count—”MARA has yet to disclose any ROI.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.
