Whether John Maynard Keynes said, “When the facts change, I change my mind" is often disputed, but the witticism has never seemed more apt. German chancellor-to-be Friedrich Merz, long a fiscal hawk as the leader of Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), recently made an about-turn on the virtues of higher deficit spending after being briefed on the country’s dwindling growth prospects and witnessing geopolitical gyrations in the US, which seems keen to patch up with Russia, potentially leaving its European allies in the lurch. The irony is that Merz campaigned as a fiscal conservative ahead of last month’s German elections, which delivered a victory for the CDU and its allies. Merz is also a former executive of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. This month, it spent $23 billion buying ports from CK Hutchison, including two in Panama. Although Hutchison is Hong Kong-based, Trump had warned against “Chinese" ownership and said he wanted US ownership of the Panama Canal. Also Read: Will Germany under Friedrich Merz script the EU’s independence from America?Merz had long been committed to stronger ties between the US and Europe, but with security alliances like Nato and Aukus now looking akin to a Scrabble board overturned by an unruly child, all is change. Early this month, Merz announced that his government would break the debt ceiling imposed on all German administrations since the global financial crisis to raise defence and infrastructure budgets. This includes an infra fund of €500 billion that its alliance partner, the Social Democratic Party, had campaigned for. Cumulatively, this would dramatically widen Germany’s fiscal deficit, but with GDP growth flat for two years and major industries (such as automobiles) in crisis, this is a good time for a Keynesian stimulus. Germany’s fiscal deficit was 2.8% of GDP last year and its total government debt is well below that of other large European countries. In a rousing speech, Merz vowed a “whatever it takes" approach to defence in the face of “threats to freedom and peace" in Europe. It was a clear reaction to the new world disorder. The CDU and its allies are now expected to rush through a debt-ceiling tweak before the term of this parliament ends because they need a two-thirds majority to do so. Also Read: Germany’s economic crisis offers it an opportunity to break an old gridlockSignificantly, asset markets cheered. “The steepening German yield curve, rising stock prices, euro appreciation, and stable credit default swap prices collectively indicate that markets interpret Germany’s fiscal expansion as growth-enhancing rather than a reckless fiscal bet," according to a paper by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The contrast with the market’s punishment of former UK prime minister Liz Truss’s fiscal adventurism in September 2022 could not have been more vivid. Farzad Saidi, author of the Kiel paper, wittily titled it ‘In Merz we Truss.’ Higher defence and infra spending is expected to revive German manufacturing, which has been in the doldrums. Retooling is already underway. The Financial Times outlined some aspects of it: a car parts factory being used to produce military equipment and a state-owned maker of sensors and radars looking to hire “teams of software engineers from Continental and Bosch, two of Germany’s largest automotive suppliers, which together have announced over 10,000 job cuts in the past year." Also Read: America First: Trump’s trade aggression could trigger another eurozone crisisFiscal policy aside, Germany’s leap of faith from cars to tanks is a 180° pivot from policies pursued since the middle of the last century. Germany has indicated it is open to discussions on a nuclear shield with France. Think-tanks estimate that Europe might need “300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion in the short term to deter Russian aggression." Across Europe, from Poland to Denmark, governments are raising defence budgets. As a response to the anarchy of announcements and tweets from the White House, this is simply sensible policy, given Washington’s apparent reversion to the Westphalian state system that arose from treaties at the end of the Thirty Years War in the 17th century. According to Oxford Reference, this means “a system of states… possessing the monopoly of force within their mutually recognized territories." If there is anything consistent in White House outbursts against Canada and Ukraine, it is this. European states, unsurprisingly, are forging closer ties in response.

Title: SEC postpones altcoin ETF decisions but 2025 approval prospects remain strong

Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart assessed that the delays were expected, and the odds of approval for altcoin ETFs this year are still relatively high. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed various altcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on March 11. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, the approval odds for these ETFs this year are still relatively high. Decisions on Grayscale’s filings for Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), and Cardano (ADA) ETFs were delayed. The SEC also delayed decisions for XRP ETFs filed by Canary Capital, Bitwise, and 21shares. The regulator also postponed decisions on the Solana (SOL) ETFs filed by 21shares, Canary, and VanEck. Canary’s Litecoin filing was the last altcoin-related ETF delay. Other crypto ETF delays include in-kind creation and redemptions for BlackRock’s IBIT, as well as Fidelity’s FBTC and FETH. 21shares also saw a delay in the proposal to include staking in its Ethereum (ETH) ETF. Despite the delays, the SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s filing for a Hedera (HBAR) ETF and Bitwise’s DOGE-related filing. Additionally, on March 11, Franklin Templeton filed an S-1 Form for an XRP ETF, joining a new altcoin exchange-traded product race. Seyffart assessed that the multiple delays were expected, as “this is standard procedure.” He added that Paul Atkins has not been confirmed as the new SEC chair, which is also a factor in the delays. The analyst also highlighted that the final deadlines for an SEC decision on all ETFs are due in October and that the odds of approval are still relatively high. In February, Seyffart and Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas published their approval odds for Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin ETFs. LTC leads the odds with a 90% probability of approval this year, with DOGE holding the second-largest percentage at 75%. SOL trails close behind with 70% chances, and XRP with a 65% chance of approval. The analysts highlighted that these odds were less than 5% before President Donald Trump’s November election, making the new numbers relatively high. Moreover, the odds for all ETFs listed by Balchunas and Seyffart could go up if regulatory conditions in the US improve even further.

Title: Trump defends tariffs, meets corporate America as economic fears nip stocks

World President Donald Trump speaks at the Business Roundtable quarterly meeting in Washington, Tuesday, March 11, 2025, as Business Roundtable Chair and Cisco Chairman and CEO Chuck Robbins listens at right. (Pool via AP) WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump defended his tariff policies on Tuesday (Mar 11) as he met the CEOs of America's biggest companies, including many whose market value has dipped in recent days as recession and inflation fears soured consumer and investor sentiment. The Republican president spoke to about 100 CEOs at a regular meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, an influential group of CEOs leading major US companies, which include Apple, JPMorgan Chase and Walmart. Trump met with technology company executives at the White House on Monday. Trump said his increased tariffs on many imports, which have rattled global markets and prompted stock selloffs, will have a tremendously positive impact over time. "The tariffs are going to be throwing off a lot of money for this country" and entice companies abroad to build plants in the United States, he said. Trump's economic policies so far have centered on a blitz of tariff announcements. Some of the levies have taken effect and others have been delayed or are set to kick in later. He said they will correct unbalanced trade relations, bring jobs back to the country and stop the flow of illegal narcotics from abroad. He ramped up a burgeoning trade war with Canada, vowing to double tariffs set to take effect within hours on all imported steel and aluminum products from America's northern neighbor to 50 per cent. The White House said later the tariff would remain at 25 per cent after Canadian officials agreed to talks. Markets have been spooked by the prospect that tariffs could raise prices for businesses, boosting inflation, and undermine consumer confidence in a blow to economic growth. US stocks on Tuesday extended last week's selloff that has dragged the benchmark S&P 500 down 3.6 per cent since Trump's election in November last year and 5.3 per cent so far in 2025. "Markets are going to go up and they're going to go down, but you know what? We have to rebuild our country," Trump told reporters earlier. "Some people are going to make great deals by buying stocks and bonds and all the things they're buying." Investors fear that Trump's trade policies could trigger an economic slowdown. Meanwhile, a survey of American households showed consumers growing more pessimistic about their prospects. Trump had already imposed an additional 20 per cent tariff on Chinese goods entering the United States, and 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, although he suspended most of the duties on US neighbours until Apr 2, when he plans to unveil a global regime of reciprocal tariffs on all trading partners. Trump said last month the policies could cause "short-term, some little pain" before delivering long-run benefits. In a Fox News interview aired over the weekend, he declined to predict whether his economic policies would cause a recession. "I don't see it at all," Trump said on Tuesday regarding a recession. Until recently, investors have been optimistic that Trump's policies would tip toward stimulating more growth, for instance through lower taxes, or easing inflationary pressures, for instance by loosening regulation on fossil fuel production. But tax cuts need congressional approval. And some economists see plans to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants increasing price pressures in the labor market, while cutting the federal workforce could raise unemployment. "I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic - and I'm not saying that's a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me - that it's going to have elevated inflation," said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, a Business Roundtable member, at an industry conference on Monday. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group have cut their 2025 US growth forecast and raised their inflation forecast, "both on the back of more adverse tariff assumptions". The forecast remains positive for the year. Last week, the business advocacy group called for making the Trump tax cuts permanent and pushing forward with regulatory reform in the energy, infrastructure and manufacturing sectors, areas of broad alignment with the Trump administration. But the group also urged "negotiators to redouble efforts to secure a path forward that swiftly removes the recently implemented tariffs. These tariffs, especially if they are long-lasting, run the risk of creating serious economic impact". The group said the White House and Congress should preserve the benefits of the North American free trade deal with Mexico and Canada signed during Trump's first term.

Title: As Mandatory Sustainability Reporting Dies, Advocates Push Voluntary Disclosure
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonmcgowan/2025/03/11/as-mandatory-sustainability-reporting-dies-advocates-push-voluntary-disclosure/
Time Published: 2025-03-11T21:36:00Z

ByJon McGowan ByJon McGowan , Contributor. Group of climate change demonstrators hold signs Within the past few years, sustainability reporting became a staple in business. As jurisdictions around the world developed mandatory reporting requirements, some companies rushed to be early adopters. It was a boom for the finance and sustainability industries, but the high costs caused businesses to push back. The trend towards mandatory reporting requirements has reversed, leaving activists and the sustainability industry pushing a new narrative for voluntary reporting. Whether businesses will buy the new line is still uncertain. The concept of sustainability reporting is not new, although the exact origins are difficult to trace. I have authored multiple legal journal articles on the topic, including a forthcoming one for UCLA Law, and every time I find a new origin story. Regardless of the tale, the premise is the same. A group of investors become concerned about a particular issue or action of a company. The investors decide that the issue they care about is more important than just financial returns. As a result, they invest or divest based on the non-financial consideration. In this case, climate change and environmental concerns. For an investor to make an informed decision on these other concerns, they need information. Most investors just look at financial statements. For non-financial considerations, investors have limited sources of information. Over the years, some socially conscious companies produced a form of sustainability report to attempt to appease the demand. However, following the 2015 Paris Agreement, international focus shifted to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. To accomplish this goal, countries needed the business sector to reduce GHG emissions. The starting point was gathering information. The push came from multiple angles, mostly originating from United Nations’ initiatives. Major investors had to be sold on the idea that climate change should be a consideration. That creates a demand. Major fund managers, like BlackRock, became actively engaged in the debate, influencing companies to start disclosing information and actions relating to an array of sustainability issues. By 2021, sustainability reports were common place in both publicly traded and privately held companies. They were trendy, but little more than marketing materials. No standardization existed. Some focused exclusively on environmental issues and climate change. Environmental, social, and governance reports took a broader approach, incorporating human rights issues and business ethics. In the U.S., ESG included diversity, equity, and inclusion as well as LGBTQ+ policies. There was a need for regulations to standardize the content. At the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP 29) in Glasgow, Scotland, the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation announced the formation of the International Sustainability Standards Board “to develop—in the public interest—a comprehensive global baseline of high-quality sustainability disclosure standards to meet investors’ information needs." IFRS creates financial reporting standards that are used in over 140 jurisdictions around the world. The U.S. uses their own financial standards known as GAAP. The IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards were released in June 2023. Based on the of Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, the ISSB created standards focused primarily on climate change and GHG emissions. The European Union was an early adopter and leader in the area of sustainability reporting. In November 2022, they adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requiring reporting by nearly all companies doing business in the EU. In July 2023, the EU adopted European Sustainability Reporting Standards to be used by companies reporting under the CSRD. The ESRS incorporated the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards for climate reporting, but also included other ESG reporting requirements. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed climate related disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies in March 2022. The SEC adopted the rule in March 2024, relying heavily on the TCFD recommendations. By the end of 2023, the standardization of sustainability reporting was occurring at an international level. Simultaneously, jurisdictions around the world started establishing timelines for mandatory disclosure by 2026 for fiscal year 2025. Sustainability reporting quickly became a requirement of businesses. The decline of mandatory sustainability reporting was swift. As the early adopter, the EU was also the first to run into issues. When the first round of ESRS were released, businesses struggled to learn and prepare for sustainability reporting. Implementation of an entirely new area of financial reporting was never going to be easy, but the EU was over ambitious in their own ability to enforce such a requirement. The EU quickly delayed broader implementation of the CSRD, choosing to focus on providing better guidance for larger companies. That was the first chink in the armor. The real blow back came during the 2024 elections. In June, the EU held elections for the European Parliament. The EU economy was faltering and the European People’s Party placed the blame squarely on the European Green Deal and the requirements placed on businesses. It worked. The EPP gained seats, while environmentally focused parties lost seats. The shift wasn’t drastic, but enough to change the balance and embolden the business community. In December, the President of the European Commission announced that new legislation will be introduced to reduce the regulatory burden imposed on businesses by the CSRD and other climate directives. In February 2025, the final proposal was released in the form of the Omnibus Simplification Package. The proposal removes mandatory sustainability reporting requirements for most companies, limiting it to large companies with companies with over 1,000 employees and €450-plus million in annual net turnover. It also limits what large companies can request from SMEs. That proposal will now work through the legislative process over the next few months. The U.S. faced similar setbacks. The SEC climate related risk rule was immediately met with legal challenges, resulting in the SEC pausing implementation while the challenges worked through the courts. Similar to the EU, the November 2024 elections brought a shift to the right with the election of President Trump and Republicans gaining control of the House and Senate. Trump took immediate action when he was sworn in on January 20, 2025, issuing an executive order removing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement. In February, the acting chair of the SEC announced the commission will rollback the climate related disclosure rule. State level action in the U.S. is facing similar struggles. In 2023, California adopted Climate Accountability Package, a pair of bills aimed at creating sustainability reporting requirements. In 2024, the drafting of reporting standards was delayed and the 2026 reporting requirement for fiscal year 2025 was pushed back at least a year. Similar legislation in other states has lost support. Mandatory sustainability reporting is dying as quickly as it rose. While some high level of reporting may continue for major companies, protections are quickly being put into place to protect SMEs from being required to report, either directly or indirectly through being in a reporting entities value chain - a key aspect of climate reporting. Climate activists and sustainability experts are not giving up the fight. While the debate over mandatory reporting continues, the focus has shifted to voluntary reporting. Sustainability experts say that companies will continue with voluntary reporting, citing surveys and public statements by companies. Advocates are pushing the notion that companies have a moral obligation to continue the reporting. However, the debate has changed in the past few years. Sustainability reporting, as well as ESG reporting, was easy until 2022. As noted earlier, they were little more than marketing materials, often created by the marketing department. Feel good statements about helping the environment with little data to back it up. Standardization through regulation brings complexity and cost. Most estimates put the cost of creating a sustainability report under the SEC climate disclosure rule around $1 million initially plus high annual costs. Similar estimates exist in other jurisdictions. That is the source of the push from the big accounting firms and associated providers. Sustainability reports is a financial boom for those industries, and those companies invested heavily gearing up for a demand driven my mandatory reporting. They are not quite ready to walk away from their investment. Therefore, they are pushing for voluntary reporting and creating a matching narrative. I have read multiple surveys over the past few months that show companies are going to continue with voluntary reporting, even if mandatory reporting requirements go away. I don’t believe them. The surveys primarily ask the opinion of chief sustainability officers, whose entire career is based on sustainability reporting. Of course they say their company will continue to do the reports. In late 2024, similar surveys were circulate about diversity, equity and inclusion. Three months into 2025, DEI officers are finding themselves out of work. This is driven by a number of factors, including that companies engaging in DEI in the U.S. are facing discrimination investigations by Attorney General Pam Bondi and state level AGs. Sustainability reporting is facing another legal issue that may provide the same result. In addition to the cost of producing sustainability reports, companies are now being challenged with lawsuits from both sides. Target was recently sued by Florida as a shareholder, stating that the company’s ESG and DEI policies reduced shareholder value. The evidence of this action includes Target’s ESG report. In Canada, Lululemon is facing a civil investigation for greenwashing based on claims made in their sustainability report. Around the world, climate activists are bringing civil claims against companies for GHG emission data and environmental claims made in sustainability reports. Overzealous and impatient climate activists may have jumped the gun in filing these suits, warning companies of the legal dangers of sustainability reports. The future of sustainability reporting is uncertain. There is a legitimate argument to be made that some companies should continue with voluntary reporting. Mandatory reporting may also face a revival. The EU has not officially stamped out the CSRD yet. State level reporting in the U.S. may get a renewed push. An outstanding opinion by the International Court of Justice on the Obligations of States in respect of Climate Change may find that countries are obligated to require climate related reporting to reduce GHG emissions. Regardless, sustainability reporting will most certainly face another rebrand. For now, expect a passionate debate.

Title: Bolt CEO Ryan Breslow explains his troubled $30M personal loan, announces new ‘super app’

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Bolt’s controversial co-founder Ryan Breslow, who returned as CEO earlier this month, spoke on Monday about the $30 million personal loan he took out of his company that sparked legal battles and contributed to his (temporary) ouster. Breslow also announced that Bolt will launch an “everything app” that will integrate one-click checkouts for everything from crypto to financial services “very soon.” The legal battle over the loan began in 2023, when Bolt investor Activant sued Breslow. Activant claimed Breslow saddled the startup with $30 million in debt by borrowing that amount and then defaulting, with company funds used to pay it back. The case was eventually settled, with Bolt agreeing to repurchase Activant’s shares for $37 million last year. Speaking at Fintech Meetup in Las Vegas yesterday, Breslow defended the loan, framing it as an act of loyalty to Bolt rather than the self-dealing the Activant lawsuit alleged it was. He said he opted for the loan instead of selling his stock in a secondaries transaction and that the loan was unanimously approved by Bolt’s board. “It was done to be pro-Bolt,” Breslow said. “I took it out instead of selling any meaningful secondaries. I wanted to show all of our investors that I’m keeping all my chips in, I believe so much in the stock that I’m not selling my shares.” Breslow said he thought he had plenty of time to pay back the loan and was waiting for Bolt to IPO to do so. He said that after he left the CEO role, the board called in the loan, which he viewed as “a bit of an attack.” Breslow, the outspoken founder of Bolt, stepped down as CEO in early 2022. In the years between then and his return this year, he has also faced allegations that he misled investors and violated security laws by inflating metrics while fundraising the last time he ran the company. On Monday, Breslow admitted he made “a ton of mistakes” — but said they were not the ones he was accused of. He viewed his main mistake as allowing people to join Bolt’s cap table that he “did not know very well” (without specifying who). Now that he’s back as CEO, he says Bolt will soon be launching a new “super app” that will integrate Bolt’s one-click checkout e-commerce experience across a wide array of services. “Instead of one-click checkout, we’re going to have one-click everything: financial services, peer-to-peer, crypto, cards, financial products, all in one app,” he said. Breslow compared Bolt to U.K. fintech Revolut, which was valued at $45 billion last year, claiming Bolt has 80 million “wallets” compared to Revolut’s 45 million, although he admitted Bolt has not “monetized our consumers yet.” Indeed, Bolt’s ARR stood at about $28 million with $7 million in gross profit as of the end of March 2024, tech publication Newcomer reported last year. That’s small compared to Revolut, which announced $2.2 billion in revenue and $545 million in profits (before tax) for 2023 alone. The big question remaining about Bolt is the status of its next fundraise. In August, news broke about a pending $450 million fundraise deal. But it raised questions over its unusual use of $250 million in “marketing credits” and lack of confirmation from an investor mistakenly identified as its lead. Some of Bolt’s investors, including BlackRock and Hedosophia, sued to block the round, Forbes reported, but that has been voluntarily dismissed by all parties, Bolt announced today. Breslow noted during his speech that “all” the legal cases against him are “fully settled, dismissed” but didn’t provide an update on the $450 million fundraise. He did comment, though, that he’s been “humbled” by his experience and has found a newfound determination to run Bolt after his faith and himself — and his startup — was challenged. “You know, I obviously make mistakes but I’ve got a very big chip on my shoulder,” he said. “I’m ready to take Bolt to really new heights.” BlackRock and Hedosophia didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Title: Greenlane’s flagship electric charging truck stop to open in April

Greenlane, which is building US-wide EV charging infrastructure for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, will open its flagship electric charging truck stop in Colton, California, next month. Builder and developer Mortenson is constructing the commercial EV charging facility in Colton, which broke ground last September. It will include more than 40 chargers when it comes online for heavy, medium, and light-duty EVs. In its next phase, Greenlane plans to deploy solar panels and battery storage to enhance grid stability, manage peak loads, and increase energy efficiency. Greenlane’s pull-through lane chargers will be equipped with Alpitronic CCS 400 kW dual-port chargers featuring oil-cooled cables. That means faster charging without the bulk—these cables stay lightweight and easy to handle. For bobtail charging, eFill CCS 180 kW chargers will be available, bringing smart energy management to keep fleet operations running smoothly. To keep everything in check, ABB’s SCADA system will handle remote monitoring and breaker management, boosting reliability and efficiency. Plus, Greenlane’s sites are built with Trenwa precast cable trench, making it easier to expand EV charging infrastructure and upgrade to megawatt charging as fleet demand grows. Greenlane, a joint venture between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock, also debuted its branded digital technology suite as part of its ongoing development of the I-15 Commercial EV Charging Corridor. The products will be rolled out in phases. Greenlane’s Chief Technology Officer, Raj Jhaveri, said, “Our technology helps maximize uptime and operational efficiency by ensuring vehicles are charged efficiently and ready to meet the demands of their freight schedules.” The tech rollout includes an app that allows drivers to check charger availability and make reservations in advance, a fleet portal that enables fleet managers and dispatchers to plan and manage routes for their electric fleets, and a new Greenlane website. I've never seen a charger site with such an expanse of solar panels. I think it is a very important message to send to to the public to pair solar panels with EV charging. Back of the envelope calculations, however, show that the panels can at best only provide a full charge for maybe 3-4 trucks per day. The vast majority of electricity must come from the grid (hopefully from giant wind/solar farms). Greenlane also now has OnRamp Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that integrate with existing fleet solutions, providing fleet managers and drivers access to optimized routes, efficient charging and refueling schedules, and related charging data and emissions savings.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. The Hanseatic Global Terminals (HGT) facility at the Port of Le Havre, France. Photo credit: France 2 via Hapag-Lloyd Hanseatic Global Terminals (HGT), the terminal operating subsidiary of ocean carrier Hapag-Lloyd, has acquired a 60% stake in CNMP LH, which operates the Atlantique container terminal in Le Havre, France. The acquisition strengthens HGT’s presence in one of Europe’s top 10 ports and marks another step in its ambitious terminal expansion strategy. The remaining 40% stake will be retained by Seafrigo Group, a specialist in temperature-controlled food logistics. The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Le Havre, France’s premier maritime gateway, handles approximately 3 million TEU annually and provides crucial connections to Paris. Industry analysts expect the CNMP LH terminal’s container throughput to increase in the coming years, particularly in the reefer container segment. HGT CEO Dheeraj Bhatia emphasized the strategic importance of the acquisition: “By acquiring a majority stake in the CNMP LH terminal in Le Havre, we are strengthening our position in one of our core European markets. At the same time, we are continuing to expand our global terminal portfolio while paving the way for targeted investments to enhance efficiency.” The acquisition aligns with HGT’s Strategy 2030, which aims to expand its terminal portfolio from its current 21 terminals to more than 30 by the end of the decade. HGT, operating from Rotterdam, currently maintains a diverse portfolio spanning 12 countries across four continents, including significant operations through SAAM Terminals in Latin America and Florida, as well as a strong presence in India through J M Baxi. Seafrigo Group President Eric Barbé welcomed the partnership, stating, “We are very pleased to have a strong partner at our side in Hanseatic Global Terminals, with whom we will continue to modernize the CNMP LH terminal in Le Havre.” The deal comes as HGT’s parent company, Hapag-Lloyd, the world’s fifth-largest ocean carrier, continues to expand its terminal operations. The company recently entered into the Gemini Partnership with Maersk, signaling a strategic shift in container shipping alliances. The latest acquisition reinforces the growing trend of major shipping lines investing in terminal infrastructure to secure their supply chains and enhance operational efficiency in key maritime gateways. Last week, a unit of Swiss-based MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company—the world’s largest ocean carrier—partnered with US-based BlackRock to acquire an 80% stake in Hong Kong-based Hutchison Ports Holding for $22.8 billion, marking the largest port terminal acquisition in history. The acquisition gives MSC control of and additional 43 container terminals outside China and Hong Kong, extending from Australia to the UAE, with a combined capacity of over 73 million TEU and a 2023 throughput of nearly 47 million TEU.

Title: How COVID Changed Hip-Hop Forever
URL: https://www.complex.com/music/a/dimassanfiorenzo/how-covid-19-lockdown-affected-hip-hop
Time Published: 2025-03-11T18:28:53Z
Full Content:
COVID-19 lockdowns changed the way we live, sparking various technological innovations that rappers quickly embraced. Five years later, has it changed rap for the better? I still remember the last concert I attended before it all went to shit. G Herbo was performing at Brooklyn Steel, a midsize, no-frills venue located in a dead section of Williamsburg. It was February 27, 2020, and the Chicago rapper was set to drop his third album, PTSD, at midnight—a release that would be overshadowed by another album coming out that evening, Lil Baby’s breakout My Turn. Random moments from that show still stick with me: the multiple tributes to Pop Smoke and Juice WRLD, both of whom had died in the past two months; the kinetic energy from one of the openers, a young street rapper named King Von; and appearances from A Boogie wit da Hoodie and Fabolous, the two patron saints of regional New York City rap. But the lasting image I have—the one I can still see the sharpest—is one solitary figure behind me, watching the show while wearing a surgical mask. On March 11, just 13 days later, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19—a virus that had been spreading in China since November and had reached the U.S. by January—a pandemic. Within days, schools, venues, movie theaters, bars, and restaurants all shuttered. If your job involved sitting at a desk and staring at a screen, you were ordered to stay home. Zoom became the most downloaded non-game app in the world. The enforcement of lockdowns, which were an attempt to control the spread of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, was a seismic event that, in some ways, permanently altered the way we live. Stuck at home with Wi-Fi, iPhones, and an abundance of time, technology became the intermediary for almost all of our interactions. Tech companies—at least those not named Quibi—leveraged this moment, accelerating us towards a future where technology has a hand in every aspect of human life. In the process, it changed our relationship with culture. No entertainers benefitted as much as rappers, who had already built a head start due to the agile, direct-to-consumer approach they’ve adopted over the years. Hip-hop might have started out in the park, but entering its middle-age years, it showed it could be adaptable to being stuck in the crib. Almost instantly, rap took over the pandemic, finding ways to eventize their presence, while also uncovering ways to innovate. But where has this left us five years later? Since the end of the lockdown, concerns within the genre have grown louder. In 2023, the year hip-hop turned 50, no rapper hit No. 1 on the Billboard album chart until the middle of July. Hip-hop’s market share has fallen for four consecutive years, dropping from 28.2 percent in 2020 to 24 percent in 2024. When you factor that in with the substantial growth of pop, country, and Latin, it’s hard to downplay the trend. This, compounded by a noticeable absence of younger rap stars, questions about the quality of the music, worries over stylistic shifts, and a lack of support from record labels, paints a concerning picture. Ironically, the genre's influence has never been more evident, with elements of hip-hop—its musical style, fashion, lingo, and distribution strategies—being adopted by nearly every other genre, from country to K-pop to regional Mexican music. (It's a somewhat fitting outcome, considering hip-hop became such a dominant force by borrowing from other genres.) The current hip-hop landscape has been shaped by trends that began in March 2020 and lasted until the spring of 2021, when vaccines became widely accepted. The question now is: Has this shift become permanent, or is it just an aberration—and is it all for the better or worse? A day before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, there was a warning that echoed louder than anything Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, “America's doctor,” had said up to that point. Cardi B, who had been sending out subtle warnings on various social platforms, went to Instagram and started ringing the alarm. “Coronavirus! Coronavirus! I’m telling you, shit is real! Shit is gettin' real!” That moment would be remixed, flipped, and turned into memes. But it also represents how ahead of the curve rappers were in recognizing the shifting times. While A-list celebrities were doing tone-deaf, cringe-worthy John Lennon covers—acting as if their presence alone made some sort of statement—rappers dove headfirst into the content frontlines, often meeting their audiences on their own terms. There were pandemic-era freestyles (Lil Uzi Vert), DJ sets (DJ Nice’s Club Quarantine), song battles on the 'gram (the first year of Verzuz), live sessions with artists just kicking it (Tory Lanez’s Quarantine Radio), rappers gaming on Twitch (Danny Brown), shouting matches on Clubhouse (everyone from 21 Savage to Meek Mill), and various TikTok attempts—remember Tyga’s “Bored in the House”? Speaking of TikTok, one of the first big challenges of lockdown was the #SavageChallenge, in support of Megan Thee Stallion’s single of the same name. “The pandemic was such a defining moment; it marked a clear difference between pre-2020 and post-2020,” Kojo Osei, senior director of digital marketing at Interscope, told me recently. At the time, Osei was doing digital marketing for 300 Entertainment, where before the pandemic he often saw old-school approaches still dominating. “Things are a lot more digitally focused now. Even artists are more tech-savvy. It’s a younger batch of artists coming up, compared to when I first started, when I’d have to coach some artists or give them new ideas that were foreign at the time. TikTok existed, but there weren’t many artists on it. It was a battle just to get them on there.” The era of mixtapes and freestyles—essentially illegitimate music—primed rappers in many ways to go all in, almost in a guerrilla fashion. For years, producers Mike and Keys, previously known as The Futuristics, got an education in branding and marketing by working closely with Nipsey Hussle, a master of direct-to-consumer distribution and innovative marketing tactics, like selling a mixtape for $1,000. Now, the duo, who recently cut tracks with burgeoning West Coast figures LaRussell and Lefty Gunplay, sees themselves thinking more entrepreneurially to stay ahead of the game. “You have to be a content creator,” Keys told me. “To keep it 1000, people forced us to do that, and we didn't want to do it at first, but I know things grow into something else. That's just how life is.” This mindset was honed during the pandemic and has now become the normal mode of operation. Why wait for a label when you can drop 100 gigs of shit on your own site? Got a new song? Throw it on the ‘gram, fuck it. Something controversial happens? Skip the journalist—go live and address it yourself. Want to know how I made a song? Watch me spend an hour with Plaqueboymax punching in vocals live on stream. Some rappers have expressed ambivalent feelings about this, like when ScHoolboy Q dismissively called modern rappers "content creators," or when Polo G joked about getting into streaming for monetary reasons. But the point remains: There are clear benefits to being in charge of the content you create. And, because of the surge of online content during the pandemic, audiences are now primed to engage with experiences that go beyond just music. Songs matter, of course, but there’s also lore, inside references, story arcs, leaks, and slang—all contributing to a more immersive, actively engaged experience. TikTok, which was originally Musical.ly, had been around for a couple of years before 2020. But TikTok culture in many ways started with the pandemic. The app saw 180 percent growth among people aged 15 to 25, partly due to TikTok's billions spent on user acquisition. The most obvious impact of the app has been the rise of the algorithmically driven "For You" page, a feature that has since spread to other popular social platforms, including X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Spotify. In the span of a decade, the way music is discovered has shifted from blogs to large editorial playlists, and now to algorithms, with listeners becoming their own tastemakers. This shift has made it easier for artists to connect with audiences and home in on a specific sound. “I feel like discovery is difficult, and once you do discover it, which is great, you end up in this pocket,” Sophie Ash, manager for Mike and Keys, told me. Ash started her career working with Nipsey Hussle and has had stops at Def Jam and Beyoncé’s Parkwood. “In order to have success in this industry now, I think you need to have very close relationships with your fans and take a [direct-to-consumer] approach with it.” While TikTok has often been framed as an app for discovering music—and, in fact, record labels have looked at it as a platform to launch hits—it hasn’t necessarily been a reliable venue for star-making in hip-hop. Sure, it’s been effective for achieving buzz quickly, but the platform has more or less settled into its role of churning out modern-day “turntable hits”—songs that capture attention and generate some revenue but don’t necessarily lead to sustainable careers. Meanwhile, rappers who have hammered away at one sound—e.g., the members of Griselda or Rod Wave—are finding ways to build engagement and build sturdy followings. "In this industry now, success really comes down to those close connections,” Ash said. “The current landscape feels vast, with no clear barriers to entry, but the communities are tighter.” The era of relying on editorial recommendations has been completely overtaken by algorithms that reward constant engagement, which in the process causes listeners to dive deeper into their own silos. As a result, micro-communities thrive and evolve, while mainstream artists struggle to keep up with the changing landscape. During the height of the lockdowns, pluggnb—an offshoot of the plugg music scene that emerged in the mid-2010s—exploded, with streams for the genre surging sixfold, according to SoundCloud. In 2020, the usage of the “pluggnb” tag tripled on the platform, before more than quadrupling the following year, partly due to the virality of artists like Summrs and Autumn!. From there, the scene splintered even more, evolving into microgenres like darkplugg, emoplugg, dreamplugg, and sadplugg. In the wake of lockdown, SoundCloud also reports spikes in internet-centric genres like jerk. From afar, these micro-scenes can look the same to a skeptic, but if you get closer, you start to see the details. You want to shit on drill? Fine. But which drill are you talking about? Philly drill (which is dramatic, slow-building, and epic)? DMV drill (spastic and intense)? Or maybe New York drill (which can either be party music or aggressive, depending on the borough)? Or you want to talk about underground rap? Cool. But what does that mean? Are we talking about older rappers creating dense, philosophical tracks like billy woods or Mach-Hommy? Or the kids making noisy, messy, rage-filled music? And if it's the latter, what underground sub sector are you speaking of? The New York-centric version that Xaviersobased represents? Or the aura, rockstar-adjacent corner Nettspend occupies? “Regional music is definitely making a comeback, especially since the pandemic. There are more defined sounds coming from New York, whether that's drill or the Slizzy sound, from Detroit rap, Atlanta, or the West Coast,” Osei told me. “But then, there’s also the boundaryless underground scene, where location isn’t the defining factor—the internet is the ‘location’ and the sounds are more creative and experimental.” In 2025, artists aren’t necessarily incentivized to reach the largest audiences possible. In fact, what makes young rappers so exciting is their apparent desire to subvert the need for mass reach, choosing instead to focus on cultivating their own dedicated fanbases. But how far can that strategy really take you? So far, the most successful new example is someone like Yeat, who took Playboi Carti’s rage soundscape and ran with it, essentially creating his own world with his own language and a loyal fanbase that has delivered him a No. 1 album. Yet, despite his success, he still finds himself in what feels like a kind of star purgatory. In this environment, the idea of a single rap king feels more outdated than ever. Last year, the Kendrick Lamar vs. Drake beef was the dominant unifying force in music. What often went unspoken was that this could be the last time we see something like this—two universally recognized rap all-time greats, in terms of both commercial success and artistic ability, vying for the top spot. “I felt like the whole ‘Big Three’ and all that beef was the last big, culture-defining moment from that class of rappers,” Osei said. “Because you talk to the new kids listening to the newer artists, they're not as diehard about it compared to the people over 25 or those with a more traditional take on hip-hop.” In exploring this topic and tracing trends from the pandemic to now, I wanted to get the perspective of someone who's been around for decades but still has some skin in the game. This led me to Rene McLean, who, alongside his wife, Lylette Pizarro McLean, co-founded Influence Media, the BlackRock-invested company who has bought catalogs from artists like Lil Durk and Future. Before that, he was a manager and veteran in the music industry, with stints at RCA and Elektra. While acknowledging that hip-hop is in a bit of a “transitional place” right now, he remains optimistic about the future. To put it bluntly: McLean has seen this shit before. And there is more he’s encouraged by, including the fact that rappers can age gratefully now, than he is dismayed about. “Right before the SoundCloud era, you had all this glossy rap with no new ideas, nothing fresh, nothing groundbreaking. But there was also a creative undercurrent that went counter to that. We got artists like XXXTentacion and Lil Uzi Vert, who emerged during that time, leading to the next generation,” McLean said. “So I just feel like we’re in that same time period now. We went through something similar 15 to 20 years before [that], when Wu-Tang showed up.” I tend to agree with McLean. These smaller scenes—which admittedly can be rough around the edges—is why I'm still bullish on rap. No other genre is as diverse as hip-hop. And rappers are finding ways to prosper in their own cocoons. Rap is messy but also hyperfocused, largely because that also describes the most engaged and invested fan. If the rap stars from the last decade were regional acts trying to transcend by aggregating other regional sounds—à la Drake and Kanye West—this decade feels like a correction, with regional, scene-representing rappers solidifying their place in their own lanes. This is the biggest way COVID-19 changed hip-hop: It was an event that triggered a flood of content, overwhelming the traditional mechanisms that once propelled certain artists to the top. The main innovation during that 16-month stretch was actually an evolution—a shift from communal, outward-facing spaces to more localized corners of the internet, where things became exclusive and harder to penetrate. To me, it’s not a coincidence that there was a surge in success for middle-class rappers making boom-bap-adjacent music, such as Freddie Gibbs, MIKE, and Boldy James. And as the lockdowns eased—with fans needing to release pent-up energy—you saw the rise of high-energy subgenres like Jersey Club and gnarly moshpit rap, thanks partially to the success of Carti’s magnum opus, Whole Lotta Red. “You got a lot of music that’s merged with hip-hop, that are part of subcultures of it, but not completely in the mainstream context of what rap is,” McLean said. “Carti, to me, is the illest shit in the world right now. The dude is number 43 in the fuckin’ world on Spotify, and the motherfucker hasn’t dropped a new album.” Five years after the pandemic, hip-hop is still large and important (I mean, Kendrick just performed at the Super Bowl). But it’s also more fragmented, a little stranger, and a bit all over the place. Ultimately, this is healthy for rap as a genre. I can’t speak for the industry, though. “Sometimes business doesn’t align with what needs to be done creatively, and then it all aligns,” McLean tells me. “They just have to realign.” Rolling Loud RL 10 Black Soccer Jersey Destroy Lonely LOVE LASTS FOREVER Exclusive Metallic Platinum Vinyl Rolling Loud RL 10 Year Mechanic Tan Jacket Quavo Quavo & Takeoff "Only Built for Infinity Links" Exclusive 2LP Follow On Discover Shop Work with us Sign Up for the Newsletter By entering your email, you agree to receive customized marketing messages from us and our advertising partners.

Title: BlackRock CEO Issues Inflation Warning, Says President Trump’s ‘Nationalistic’ Policies To Trigger Higher Prices

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is reportedly warning that President Trump’s new shift into nationalist-style economic policy may stoke a new wave of inflation. Speaking at the CERAWeek conference – and energy markets conference run by S&P Global – Fink says markets are currently discounting inflation, and that US industries will likely experience higher costs in the next six to nine months, Reuters reports. Fink suggests that the potential for millions of migrant workers to be deported and the subsequent shrinking of the labor supply could contribute to inflation. “I think if we all are becoming a little more nationalistic – and I’m not saying that’s a bad thing, you know, it does resonate with me – that it’s going to have elevated inflation.” Are we going to have enough workers to harvest this now? I’ve even told members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians that we need to build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough.” Commenting on the tariffs, Fink says, “When I go to Washington, when they talk about these policies, at what cost are you willing to tolerate that?” Fink’s comments come after BlackRock, the largest asset manager in the world with over $11.6 trillion in total assets, led a consortium to acquire CK Hutchison, a company that operates in over 43 ports across 23 countries, including the Panama Canal. The CEO has previously touted Bitcoin (BTC) as a legitimate inflation hedge, and earlier this year at the World Economic Forum (WEF) event in Davos, Switzerland, said the flagship crypto asset could run as high as $700,000 in the event that sovereign wealth funds start allocating. “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency or you’re frightened of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears. And so I’m a big believer in the utilization of that as an instrument, and so if that becomes true and you see that it could be a proper hedge against hope securities or equities, the question is, could you see it be a 2% or 5% allocation? I was with a sovereign wealth fund during this week and that was the conversation. Should we have a 2% allocation? Should we have a 5% allocation? If everybody adopted that conversation, it would be $500,000, $600,000, $700,000 per Bitcoin.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X, Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Title: WATCH: The stunning truth about China and the Panama Canal

Time Published: 2025-03-11T16:50:14Z
Full Content:
By David Kupelian March 11, 2025 Democrats in Congress hate it. “It’s bananas. It’s insane,” U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, D.-Conn., told CNN. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D.-Fla., agrees: “It is utterly preposterous to suggest that we are going to send our military into Panama to, quote, ‘take back the Panama Canal.'” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks for virtually all his congressional peers when he insists, “House Democrats believe that we are not sent to Washington to invade Greenland, rename the Gulf of Mexico or seize the Panama Canal by force!” But as President Donald Trump stated explicitly during his March 4 speech to Congress, the nation and the world: “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal – and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” The Panama Canal, Trump pointed out, “was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria, they died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work. They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die – the most expensive project also that was ever built in our country’s history.” Get the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet – delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts! Trump’s inaugural address: ‘China is operating the Panama Canal, and we didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.’ Concluded the 47th president: “It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” ‘Going to a battlefield’ The astonishingly gruesome process of constructing the Panama Canal – commenced by America in 1904 and completed a decade later – was undertaken to fulfill the centuries-old dream of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, thereby saving ships from 21-23 extra days at sea by being able to cross through what would become a 51-mile-long waterway. However, “the Panamanian isthmus proved to be one of the most difficult – and deadly – spots in the world in which to construct a channel,” explains History.com: Death could strike in the form of an 18-ton boulder or miniscule, malaria-carrying mosquitoes that bred by the millions in festering swamps and puddles. … “The working condition in those days were so horrible it would stagger your imagination,” recalled laborer Alfred Dottin. “Death was our constant companion. I shall never forget the train loads of dead men being carted away daily, as if they were just so much lumber.” The most dangerous work took place as laborers carved a ditch 45 feet deep and at least 300 feet wide through an eight-mile mountainous stretch known as the Culebra Cut.” Nicknamed “Hell’s Gorge,” the Culebra Cut was a cauldron of noise with roaring locomotives and belching steam shovels where risks of death ranged from drowning to electrocution. Workers blasted away at the mountains with upwards of 60 million pounds of dynamite, which could ignite prematurely in the tropical Panamanian climate. … Flooding regularly submerged equipment, and the unstable ground could give way at any instant. “The work of months or even years might be blotted out by an avalanche of earth,” lamented a senior U.S. administrator. Particularly for workers partially deafened as a side effect of drinking quinine to ward off malaria, the inability to hear made deadly railroad accidents a regular occurrence. In an oral history, George Hodges remembered a fellow worker who fell trying to hop on a train and the wheel of another train “cut his body right in two…as if he had been chopped with a machete.” As one laborer, Antonio Sanchez, explained, working in “the cut” was just like “going to a battlefield.” Fast-forward six decades. In 1976, Democratic presidential candidate Jimmy Carter, campaigning against Gerald Ford, publicly promised – as did Ford – that he would not support transferring the canal from U.S. ownership to Panama, an idea that was then popular with the elites, but not the American people. Yet when he won the presidency, Carter changed his mind and, in 1977, signed the Carter-Torrijos Treaties, transferring total control of the canal to Panama, to take effect on Dec. 31, 1999. Interestingly, during the 1980 presidential election, Ronald Reagan expressed his firm opposition to turning the canal over to Panama … and then defeated Carter in a historic landslide, with a staggering 489 Electoral College votes to Carter’s 49. “When it comes to the [Panama] Canal,” Reagan said, “we built it, we paid for it, it’s ours, and … we are going to keep it!” China’s plans for world domination Today, the big issue cited by Trump and other administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, is what has long amounted to the de facto control of the Panama Canal by the nation widely regarded as America’s most dangerous geopolitical adversary. How can that be, many wonder? What happened to the Monroe Doctrine, that revered 200-year-old foreign policy stance established by the fifth U.S. president, James Monroe, holding that any major intervention in the Western Hemisphere – i.e., North, Central or South America – by a foreign power constitutes a potentially hostile act against the U.S.? U.S.-based China expert Gordon Chang – author of several books about China’s barely disguised plans to dominate the world, including his 2024 bestseller, “Plan Red: China’s Project to Destroy America” – says the Panama Canal has long been a “chokepoint” that Beijing wants to control. And as Secretary of State Marco Rubio told SiriusXM’s Megyn Kelly on Jan. 30: “If the government in China in a conflict tells them to shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to. And in fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat.” Indeed, as WorldNetDaily reported in February, shortly after Rubio expressed to Panama’s leadership President Trump’s concerns over Chinese influence over the canal, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulina stated that he would not renew a 2017 “memorandum of understanding” by which Panama joined China’s “Belt and Road Initiative.” “Under that program, China funds the construction and development of infrastructure, such as ports, and then takes control of them for its own profit and empire building,” WND reported, adding: “In the case of the canal, [China] has worked on ports at both ends, creating the possibility that it could shut down the canal if it seemed in the best interests of the Chinese Communist Party. It also has been building bridges over the canal, which would offer the same option.” Rubio explained to Panamanian officials that “the United States cannot, and will not, allow the Chinese Communist Party to continue with its effective and growing control over the Panama Canal area.” And in Congress, a bill has been introduced directing the U.S. to negotiate the repurchase of the canal from Panama. Meanwhile, Trump’s March 4 prime-time announcement that “a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal” referred to BlackRock, the huge U.S.-based investment and asset-management firm. BlackRock purchased the critical ports from CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, officially described as a “Hong Kong-based and Cayman Islands-registered multinational conglomerate corporation” formed in 2015 by a merger of Cheung Kong Holdings and its main associate company Hutchison Whampoa. However, just as with most things concerning Communist China, massive subterfuge and deception are involved. For Hutchinson Whampoa – as a few reality-based media organizations have noted, including this RealClearHistory analysis from January – has been identified as “a front Chinese company that was owned by Chinese military intelligence.” In the report, author Miguel A. Faria succinctly demystifies China’s longtime control of the Panama Canal: The United States built the Panama Canal early in the 20th century with American sweat, toil and money, only to give it away to a leftwing Panamanian dictator via a dubious treaty. The Panamanians, in turn, ceded the Canal to Hutchison Whampoa, a front Chinese company that was owned by Chinese military intelligence. At about the same time, another Chinese front organization, the Hong Kong-based Hutchinson Port Holdings, obtained a 50-year lease to operate the two strategic ports at either end of the Panama Canal. Thus, in case of hostilities, U.S. shipping routes would be cut off and bottled up in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, encircled by the Chinese and their allies Cuba, Venezuela and Panama. To this day, the Chinese deny that they control the Panama Canal, and the American media seem to believe them. President-elect Donald Trump does not. Indeed, the American media have rarely if ever sounded the alarm over this serious threat to U.S. security located right in “America’s backyard” (as Central and South America are commonly referred to in the U.S. global security context). Legacy media stories today instead obsess over Trump’s supposed “expansionist agenda,” his “land grab” obsession and his dangerous vision of “a new U.S. imperialism.” There are a few exceptions, however, including WorldNetDaily, one of the only American media organizations that has sounded the alarm not just recently – but for decades. More than 25 years ago – before the canal was even turned over to the left-wing Panamanian government – WND founder Joseph Farah was passionately making virtually the same arguments Trump has been making during his second term as president. In “Clinton’s Panama Canal admission,” published Dec. 1, 1999, just weeks before Carter’s “gift” of the canal to Panama would take effect (one of many articles Farah wrote during the late ’90s warning about Chinese control of the vital waterway), he focused on then-President Bill Clinton’s public admission that, indeed, China was running the Panama Canal! Was it a Freudian slip? Was it a gaffe? Or was it President Clinton finally being honest about something for the first time in his life? I refer to the statement he made yesterday with regard to the Panama Canal transfer to a group of reporters in the Oval Office before leaving for the West Coast. … Here it is, folks. Hold on to your hats – especially all of you people who scoffed when I began telling you three years ago that the Communist Chinese were taking over the Panama Canal. “I think the Chinese will in fact be bending over backwards to make sure that they run it in a competent and able and fair manner,” Clinton said. That’s verbatim. Those are his words, not mine. Clinton, who has until now denied that the Chinese were to take control of the strategic canal, admitted it publicly. And, as if to underline his admission and seemingly to ensure there could be no misunderstanding of his words, Clinton elaborated. … He compared the operation of the canal to China’s campaign to win admission to the World Trade Organization, which sets the rules for global trade. “They’ll want to demonstrate to a distant part of the world that they can be a responsible partner,” the president said. “And I would be very surprised if any adverse consequences flowed from the Chinese running the canal.” Oh, absolutely. Responsible. Partner. Competent. Fair. Those are all words I readily associate in my mind with the totalitarian government in Beijing. Don’t you? Well, there you have it, folks. Goodbye Panama Canal. The Bamboo Curtain just moved into the Western Hemisphere – officially, that is. After all, I gave you this history long ago. I told you about the fact that a Chinese government company – a front for the military – Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., was to begin operation of the ports on both ends of the strategic waterway Jan. 1. It has been the Clinton administration and its many apologists in Congress and the press who have laughed, ridiculed the idea. Chinese military shill Alexander Haig suggested I should be jailed for making such accusations. And now the truth has finally come out through an unusually candid admission by Clinton. He is telling us now what has been obvious to anyone familiar with the transfer of the canal. He is admitting what former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Thomas Moorer stated in our pages some time back. Clinton says we can rely on the good intentions of the Chinese to maintain access to the canal. Doesn’t that reassure you? The Chinese, who, as we speak, are rounding up tens of thousands of religious dissidents and interning them, threatening to attack Taiwan and working overtime on developing military technology that could only be used to attack the United States, should be trusted on this Panama Canal deal because it’s a chance for them to show how responsible they really are. This is nuts! When are the American people going to wake up? Clinton is so embarrassed by this deal on the canal that he is not even going to attend the transfer ceremonies. Why? If he doesn’t have any second thoughts and believes giving away the Panama Canal to a hostile foreign power is still a good idea, why not go wave the flag next month at the ceremony? … If ever there was a time – an opportunity – to pressure the politicians to reverse what will someday be judged a historic blunder, it is now. If you really have the guts to stop this thing, America, wake up and take action now. You won’t have to risk your life to write a letter to your senators and representatives in Washington or fill out a simple online petition today. Your kids, however, may someday pay for our mistakes with their blood if you sit silent through this official treachery. The same day, Dec. 1, 1999, this writer published a detailed news article on WND, headlined “In 2000, it’s China Canal,” which included exclusive comments from former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Thomas Moorer, who assured WorldNetDaily that China’s takeover of the canal “would be catastrophic for the U.S.” Editor’s note: In these historic times, stay informed with fearless, hard-hitting, truthful journalism 24/7.

By DIDI TANG, Associated PressWASHINGTON (AP) — In only two decades, China has grown to be the dominant player in shipbuilding, claiming more than half of the world’s commercial shipbuilding market, while the U.S. share has fallen to just 0.1%, posing serious economic and national security challenges for the U.S. and its allies, according to a report released Tuesday by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.In 2024 alone, one Chinese shipbuilder constructed more commercial vessels by tonnage than the entire U.S. shipbuilding industry has built since the end of World War II.

At a congressional hearing in December, senior officials and lawmakers urged action.Last week, President Donald Trump told Congress that his Republican administration would “resurrect” the American shipbuilding industry, for commercial and military vessels, and he would create “a new office of shipbuilding in the White House.”“We used to make so many ships,” Trump said. “We don’t make them anymore very much, but we’re going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.”In February, the heads of four major labor unions called on Trump to boost American shipbuilding and enforce tariffs and other “strong penalties” against China for its increasing dominance in that sector. “What we are seeing now is a recognition of the strategic significance of shipbuilding and port security, and the related challenges posed by China,” said Matthew Funaiole, a senior fellow in the China Power Project at CSIS and a co-author of the report. Funaiole said concerns over shipbuilding are “a fairly bipartisan issue.”The report said that China’s shipbuilding sector went through “a striking metamorphosis” in the past two decades, transforming from a “peripheral player” to the dominant player on the global market, with efforts centered on one state-owned enterprise: China State Shipbuilding Corporation, or CSSC.At the same time, China has greatly expanded its navy.

Title: Stablecoins Aren’t For Banks—Here’s Why!

ByCharles Wayn ByCharles Wayn , Contributor. Golden USDC coins on dark background. 3d iluustration. Recently, we have seen a spate of institutions announce the launch of their own stablecoins, including Societe General, Revolut, and now Bank of America is considering weighing in. One has to question why, though? USDT and USDC - the biggest stablecoins in the industry already account for $200 billion of crypto’s AUM. Accepted widely across most blockchains, centralized and decentralized exchanges, Circle’s USDC and Tether’s USDT are serving the stablecoin market well. Far less volatile than other cryptocurrencies, they are allowing investors to move easily in and out of crypto and preserve their wealth in countries with hyperinflation. And so, why would a bank like Societe General need to launch its own stablecoin? The answer likely lies in the extremely attractive revenue model that stablecoins operate on. Tether, for example, made a cool $13 billion in profit last year - placing it in the gilded company of Goldman Sachs. This is very impressive and certainly something a large bank would resent. Why pay an upstart third party to settle your transactions when you can do it yourself? Yet, while this may be a perfectly sound business decision, dilution of the stablecoin market would quite literally defeat the object of its existence. Digital assets already suffer from a liquidity issue - with a market cap of around $3trn and the majority of that held in Bitcoin by long-term investors, crypto traders are often hamstrung by this lack. Having two well capitalised, liquid stablecoins is a big bonus in this market and one we should be careful to tinker with. Both USDT and USDC fought hard to win credibility and trust in the industry for many years. They have weathered some of the hardest financial storms while other coins haven’t even scratched the surface compared to the majors. While many stablecoins such as DAI, PYUSD, and Sky Dollar have emerged within the last few years, none have proved themselves at the level these two have. As such, many market participants continue to rely on these two tokens, with their dominance growing even in the face of rising competition. For reference (at the time of writing this), DAI’s market cap is at around 5.3 billion, while PYUSD has a market cap of roughly $741 million. While impressive, this doesn’t even scratch the surface of USDC’s $60 billion and USDT’s huge $142 billion market cap. Despite this, though - and this only goes to serve as a stronger argument as to why banks should stay out of stablecoins – USDT now finds itself in hot water as it is allegedly not complying with the European Union’s new rules on stablecoins. As such it is set to be delisted from major centralized exchanges like Binance, Crypto.com, Coinbase, and more for European customers. Some might argue that this is a great moment to open the stablecoin market to competition, but if USDT with its decade of experience and billions of dollars of AUM can’t get past the EU, what chance does a much smaller coin have? Granted, those coming out of banks will have an advantage, but they will still face regulatory hurdles that remain a moving target - especially in the US. Of course, in this war of regulation, USDC has been winning for some time. Circle’s laser focus on compliance and backing from institutional behemoths like BlackRock have made it the stablecoin of choice for traditional finance institutions (though crypto natives still view it with caution thanks to its willingness to bow to government sanctions). And, perhaps unsurprisingly, founder Jeremy Allaire holds a similar view on the stablecoin market. In a recent interview in Hong Kong, Allaire stated there really is no need for CBDC’s as the stablecoin market already exists. It is thriving, it is liquid and it is working. Rather, regulators should understand stablecoins and make better rules. Stablecoins must be easily tradable and liquid. This is where having just two majorly traded coins wins. There is no time of the day or night that any trader cannot buy or sell USDT or USDC on any kind of platform (well, for now, at least). If we start to see the market segment into various stablecoins that perhaps larger institutions insist must be used inside their ecosystems, this will impact liquidity, trading, and costs. Charges are likely to increase as without sufficient liquidity the cost of executing transactions tends to rise - as those who battled ETH gas prices in the summer of 2020 remember all too well. This can lead to an expensive, fragmented, and slow investor experience. This should not be the future the stablecoin market or the cryptocurrency industry at large is marching into. Rather than fragmentation we need cohesion and deeper liquidity in order for stablecoins to be treated as a legitimate asset within the financial ecosystem. That said, despite its dominance, USDT faces a fight for its life against new European regulation – Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). This regulation requires stablecoin issuers like Tether to obtain an e-money license to enhance anti-money laundering compliance. However, as mentioned previously, Tether has failed to comply with this regulatory guidance and is not standing down. This will ultimately give USDC the lead, with potentially another challenger entering the ring - at least in Europe. On the other hand, incoming US regulation may take a different view which could mean Europe isn’t such a big deal. Since President Donald Trump’s recent election win, stablecoin market cap has grown by a whopping $40 billion. Regardless of this setback, a plethora of bank-issued stablecoins is not the answer. Banks don’t like paying anybody fees, but – again – as we in the crypto industry know, fees are part of the game to maintain security and ensure smooth blockchain operations. Institutions should get used to that and enjoy liquid markets rather than try to hold onto $25 per transaction, which could create fragmentation and ultimately hinder the mass adoption of stablecoins.

Title: This Simple Investing Blunder Could Cost You 8%+ Dividends

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster , Contributor. Investing Mistake I recently got some reader feedback that made me realize something: When it comes to our favorite income investments—8%+ yielding closed-end funds (CEFs)—there are still a lot of misconceptions out there. It’s key that we put those right, because they’re causing some investors to miss out on CEFs, and the big (and often monthly) dividends they provide. And I know I don’t have to tell you that in turbulent times like these, high payouts like those are a lifesaver. This reader wrote in response to a recent piece I wrote about how CEFs can be better than ETFs, pointing out two things: Let’s address both of these concerns because they are valid—and both are often cited by financial advisors and the mainstream media as reasons to avoid CEFs and invest in ETFs, like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). Following that advice can cost you significant dividends: CEFs currently yield 8.5% on average, while SPY, the largest ETF by market cap, yields a paltry 1.4%. So, let’s dig into the first issue. I am not going to disagree with the feedback here, because it is true. On average, CEFs have management fees of 2.9%, which sounds very high compared to what you’d pay on the average index fund. I should note before we go further, though, that the two CEFs we’ll get into below (both of which appeared in the article)—the Virtus Artificial Intelligence & Technology Opportunities Fund (AIO) and the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK)—charge much less: about 2.7% for AIO and 1.1% for STK. The fees for the BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), the other fund mentioned in that article, are about the same as STK, at 1.09%, but we’re going to focus more on the other two funds, and the opportunity we have in them, today. Here’s where our reader picked up on a common misunderstanding about CEF fees, suggesting that these fees are taken out of the income and total returns these funds provide. In other words, if the fee were to be taken out of AIO’s dividend, its 7.8% yield would actually amount to 5.1%, net of fees. But this isn’t how CEF fees work. Let’s take the most important detail first: The fees that CEFs charge are taken out of the fund’s portfolio before distributing dividends. The fund will not remove it from the yield you receive: If AIO yields 7.8%, that means you will get $780 a year for every $10,000 you invest. The fees are taken care of on the back end, before AIO reports its capital gains and pays out distributions, so all the profits I’m about to show you are net of fees. Are the fees justified? In my opinion, getting $78,000 on a million-dollar nest egg is worth it, since the low-fee alternative offers $14,000 in dividends on that same million bucks. Also, I should point out that those CEF fees tend to remain as low as possible because of competition. The fees that CEFs charge are a combination of administrative fees, payment to fund managers (which is often the smallest part of the fund’s assets, typically around 0.07%), and payment for things like leverage costs (both of these funds typically borrow money to fund investments, and AIO is currently borrowing more than STK, which is why its fees are higher). In the end, though, this one chart is why I think the fees are justified, even without accounting for these funds’ much higher yields. CEFs Outperform Both AIO (in blue) and STK (in purple) have outperformed the S&P 500 since AIO’s inception (it was released in late 2019, which is why this chart goes only that far). And STK’s outperformance goes back much further. STK Total Returns Now, to be sure, these funds are weighted toward tech, but it is also worth pointing out that the S&P 500 has been increasingly weighted to tech stocks (now about 45% of the index), which explains some of the outperformance here. But with fees as “high” as the ones they’re charging, you’d expect SPY to be more competitive (again net of fees). To be sure, the SPY shareholder paid less in fees. But the SPY shareholder also missed out on $1.137 of profits for every dollar they would have put into STK when it launched. The second criticism also has some merit, although maybe not in the way the reader meant. Let me explain. CEF Premiums Both of these funds have a fixed number of shares they issue to the general public (this is fixed at the IPO). This is why the fund is called a closed end fund. While those shares trade on exchanges, like any stock, the issuer can’t issue new shares to grow the fund. The price of a share of a CEF will fluctuate according to supply and demand, which means its market price can drift up or down from the liquidation value of all of its assets on the open market, which is called the net asset value, or NAV. Above you can see AIO is trading at a 6.5% premium to NAV as I write this, while STK’s 1.5% premium is smaller than the 10%+ premiums it’s had in the past, and is pretty close to trading at par. So, yes, you can get Microsoft cheaper than you can by buying it with AIO (by the way, MSFT is 3.24% of AIO’s portfolio, its second-largest position). How? By buying STK! But of course, these are still both premiums. Lucky for us, we can do even better, by purchasing a heavily discounted CEF like the 9.4%-yielding Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), a recommendation of my CEF Insider service trading at a 7.9% discount to NAV, with Microsoft as its top position, at 4% of assets, followed by NVIDIA (NVDA) at 3.3%. And check this out. Swappable CEFs See how ASG (in blue) is at that 7.9% discount as of this writing, while AIO (in purple) is at a 6.5% premium, but in 2020, ASG traded at a premium and AIO traded at a discount? If you’re thinking there’s an opportunity here to buy ASG when it’s discounted, sell when it’s at a premium, then buy AIO when it’s at a discount and do the opposite trade when AIO swings to a premium, you’re right. This isn’t just what some niche hedge funds do. It’s also the kind of move we’re always looking to make at CEF Insider. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

More Info The Panama Canal is considering an idea to build a pipeline to ship liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) across the key trade chokepoint to potentially bring gas from the U.S. to Japan, according to the canal administrator Ricaurte Vasquez. “We're exploring the possibility of rolling out infrastructure with the capacity to move up to a million barrels per day (bpd), but the market is much larger,” Vasquez told Reuters. The canal authorities see moving gas through Panama as a top priority, but it’s also highly complex, according to Vasquez. The canal administrator cited initial studies pointing out that the possible capacity of LPG traffic through the Panama Canal could reach 2 million bpd in a decade. The administration of the Panama Canal expects to decide over the next year whether it would proceed with the plan, Vasquez told Reuters. The idea to move gas through the canal comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. Administration and Panama, after President Donald Trump said America should take back the canal it had helped build. Earlier this month, a consortium led by BlackRock bought two ports on either side of the Panama Canal just a few weeks after President Trump threatened to use force to restore U.S. control over the energy chokepoint. The deal was worth $22.8 billion and also involved a few dozen ports around the world. The finance major paid $19 billion for the ports of Balboa and Cristobal to CK Hutchinson, which is owned by one of Asia’s wealthiest individuals, Hong Kong billionaire investor Li Ka-Shing.

But what could it mean for China’s trade relations with Latin America, in particular the US’ largest trade partner Mexico? Midway through last week, as the economic reverberations from Trump’s latest round of tariffs spread around the world, the Hong Kong-based (and Cayman Islands-registered) conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings caught global markets off guard. Straight out of the blue, the company announced that it was selling 80% of its subsidiary Hutchison Port Holdings, including its 90% stake in the Balboa and Cristobal docks at either end of the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock, the world’s largest investment manager. An Associated Press article reported that the sale effectively puts “the ports under American control after President Donald Trump [had] alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.” In a speech to the US Congress on March 4, Donald Trump bragged: To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal. And we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals. CK Hutchison’s decision to sell up its port holdings company in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, gives the BlackRock consortium control over dozens of ports in more than 20 countries. They include the Panamanian ports of Balboa and Cristobal, four ports in Mexico, 13 in Europe, 12 in the Middle East and Africa, and 11 in East Asia and the Pacific. Unsurprisingly, Hutchison will retain control of its 10 docks in China, including two in Hong Kong. It is debatable just how good a financial deal this was for the BlackRock-led consortium. As Yves points out in the comments below, participation in the Panama Canal could prove to be more of a curse than a blessing, especially given Panama’s ongoing water crisis. The canal already experienced a 29% drop in ship transits during fiscal year 2024 due to severe drought conditions, according to the Panama Canal Authority (ACP). The decision to sell the canal was driven primarily by geopolitical concerns, as reports the South China Morning Post: CK Hutchison Holdings’ decision to sell its port operations in the Panama Canal and elsewhere is to mitigate against geopolitical risks even though it framed it as a purely commercial move, analysts and sources said, urging Hong Kong’s other major companies to also prepare for unparalleled global uncertainties. From a geopolitical perspective, the deal represents a victory for the Trump administration and a setback for China’s belt-and-road ambitions given that some 6% of global trade passes through the Panama Canal. There could be alternative express trade routes connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans some time in the not-too-distant future, however. Nicaragua, a close ally of China and Russia, has recently revived plans to build its own canal, though it will take years to complete, assuming it ever is. There is also Mexico’s Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT), a multibillion-dollar project that connects the port of Salina Cruz, on Oaxaca’s Pacific coast, with Coatzacoalcos, on the Gulf of Mexico with both freight and passenger rail travel (h/t upstater). As we reported in 2023, the project, if well-executed, could hold the key to hedging the global economy’s dependence on the drought-hit Panama Canal. And the good news is that the project is relatively close to completion. Money has been pouring in from all sides, including up to $2.8 billion from the Inter-American Investment Bank. The south-eastern region of Mexico across which the CIIT will eventually criss-cross is one of Mexico’s poorest, but both the AMLO and Sheinbaum governments have prioritised its economic development. The region has also been receiving significant Chinese investments over the past decade while US companies have largely neglected it, preferring to focus on Mexico’s northern border regions, according to a 2023 report by Mexico Business News. Whether that trend continues time will soon tell. Back in Panama, China will presumably continue to have sway over the economy. But there’s no denying that the BlackRock-led consortium’s takeover of the canal’s two main ports signifies a clear shift toward closer realignment of Panama with Washington’s interests. It also represents a major milestone for BlackRock’s global infrastructure ambitions, as Benjamin Norton notes in his Geopolitical Economy Report: BlackRock is the world’s biggest investment company. It managed a record high of $11.6 trillion in assets in the fourth quarter of 2024. (The top 500 investment managers on Earth together held $128 trillion in assets at the end of 2023.) The Associated Press reported that the BlackRock-led consortium now controls at least 43 ports in 23 countries. The Wall Street giant’s subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners was central to the US government-sponsored Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI), which was launched by the Joe Biden administration and the G7. BlackRock’s billionaire CEO Larry Fink was invited to sit with Western heads of state at the G7 summit in Italy in 2024, where he called for “public-private partnerships” to help Wall Street firms buy up global infrastructure, especially in poor, formerly colonized countries. BlackRock has enjoyed a very close relationship with the US government, under both Democrats and Republicans. Fink said before the US presidential election in November 2024 that it “really doesn’t matter” who wins, because both parties would benefit Wall Street. Bloomberg reported that Fink personally called Trump and asked him to help BlackRock purchase the Panama Canal ports. The financial media outlet noted that the billionaire CEO bragged of BlackRock’s deep links with governments worldwide, stating, “We are increasingly the first call”. Trying to Halt a 25-year Trend As we have documented in numerous posts since the summer of 2021, the US’ apex strategic rival, China, has not only gained a foothold in the US’ backyard in the past three decades but has even begun to win the race for economic supremacy in the region. China is already South America’s largest trade partner, and as we saw with the recent opening of the Chinese-funded and controlled mega-port in Chancay, Peru, its Belt and Road Initiative promises to further cement that position. Besides Hutchinson’s controlling stake of Panama’s two main ports since 2015, the Trump administration’s main bone of contention with the Central American nation was the fact that its government, like most governments in Latin America, had signed the Belt and Road Initiative. In fact, Panama was the first Latin America country to do so, in 2017. Since then, 20 other countries in the region have signed the initiative, including Venezuela, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Perú, Nicaragua and Argentina. To placate Washington’s demands, the Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino said he would not renew Panama’s Belt-and-Road membership when it comes up for review, becoming the first country in the region to leave Beijing’s global infrastructure initiative. He also mentioned the possibility of his government reconsidering the concession granted to Hutchinson Ports. The move sparked an unusually sharp rebuke from Beijing slamming Washington’s “Cold War mentality” in Latin America. From Al Jazeera: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China on Friday hit out at the United States for sabotaging the global infrastructure programme. Beijing “firmly opposes the United States using pressure and coercion to smear and undermine Belt and Road cooperation,” said Lin Jian in a statement. “The US side’s attacks … once again expose its hegemonic nature.” Referring to a visit this week to the region by Marco Rubio, Lin said the US Secretary of State’s comments “unjustly accuse China, deliberately sow discord between China and relevant Latin American countries, interfere in China’s internal affairs, and undermine China’s legitimate rights and interests”. A Different Vision of Multipolarity With Trump back in power, the US may have finally accepted the multipolar reality of today’s world but, as Conor noted in his recent post, The Empire Rebrands: Foreign Policy Under Trump 2.0, the Washington’s vision of multipolarity differs markedly from the one envisioned by China, Russia and other countries in the so-called “Global South”: As many have pointed out, the US seeks win-lose transactions, and this is nothing new under Trump. As Glenn Diesen states: In a multipolar world, security is enhanced by reducing the security competition between the great powers, while a mutually beneficial peace can exist under a balance of power and acceptance of the status quo. Even small- and medium-sized states can obtain more political autonomy from the great powers by cooperating with all great powers to diversify their economic connectivity. However, the US appears to be attempting to defeat China as its main rival, and coerce small and medium states into spheres of influence to ensure political and economic obedience. This is now playing out in Latin America. It is no coincidence that the US’ new Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s first international tour was to the five Central American countries of Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica. Officially speaking, Rubio was visiting these countries for three main reasons: to stop mass illegal immigration to the US; to fight the “scourge of transnational criminal organizations and drug traffickers”; and “to counter China, and deepen economic partnerships to enhance prosperity in our hemisphere.” As a trading power, the US continues to holds significant sway over Central America. Pound for pound, it is still Latin America and the Caribbean’s largest trading partner. But that is predominantly due to its huge trade flows with Mexico, which account for a whopping 71% of all US-LatAm trade. As Reuters reported in 2022, if you take Mexico out of the equation, China has already overtaken the US as Latin America’s largest trading partner. Meanwhile, China’s trade with Mexico, as with most parts of Central America, is growing fast, or at least was. And it is this trend that the Trump administration wants to halt, or even reverse. In order to achieve that, Trump 2.0 is, according to the Washington Post, “reviving” the two-centuries old Monroe Doctrine: Long-attuned to U.S. slights both perceived and real, few [policy makers in the region] missed Trump’s throwaway line during his signing of executive orders just hours after his inauguration. Relations with Latin America “should be great,” he told reporters in the Oval Office. “They need us much more than we need them. We don’t need them.” “What is the point of saying that?” asked the senior South American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid drawing unwanted attention to his country. “It’s destroying trust. … Instead of inviting us to a new vision, he doesn’t invite anybody. There are only threats.” Of course, the Monroe Doctrine never went away, it has just waxed and waned. During the first two decades of this century, it took a back seat as Washington focused on executing its War on Terror in the Middle East. As it squandered trillions of dollars spreading mayhem and death and breeding a whole new generation of terrorists, China began snapping up Latin American resources, in particular food, petroleum and strategic minerals like lithium. But even during this time Washington was able to organise a failed coup d’état against Hugo Chavez’s government in Venezuela (2002) and a successful coup against Manuel Zelaya’s government in Honduras (2009). There was another unsuccessful coup against Venezuela’s Chavista government in 2019 as well as a successful one in Bolivia. The partly self-inflicted downfall of Peru’s socialist leader Pedro Castillo in 2022 also got the prior blessing from Washington’s ambassador in Lima and former CIA agent, Lisa Kenna . By the early 2020s, it was clear that Washington had begun rejigging the Monroe Doctrine, a 202-year old US foreign policy position that opposed European colonialism on the American continent, in order to apply it to its most important strategic rivals of today, including China, Russia, Iran and even Hezbollah. Just this past week, a bipartisan bill titled the “No Hezbollah in Our Hemisphere Act” was introduced to the US Congress seeking to counter the Lebanese terrorist group’s influence in the region. But it is China’s rapid rise in the US’ own “backyard” that is of greatest concern in Washington. Unlike the US, Beijing offers win-win trade and investment deals to national governments in the region. It also does not tend to meddle in internal politics, or at least hasn’t until now, preferring to let the money do the talking. As the former US Treasury Secretary Laurence Summers once admitted, “When a Latin American head of state asked me for something, I lectured them. While I was preaching, the Chinese were building airports.” When it comes to international trade, win-win strategies tend to work far better than the zero sum games pursued by Washington. As China’s influence in the region has grown, it is the US military that has done a lot of the talking. In January 2023, General Laura Richardson, the then-Commander of US Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM), reminded the Atlantic Council of just how important Latin America’s resources are as well as the need to “box out” China and Russia from them. In other words, despite what the Washington Post may claim, the Trump Administration’s attempted shakedown of small and mid-sized Latin American countries does not represent the revival of the Monroe Doctrine. That said, it does represent a significant escalation in that trend, and one that many countries in the region and beyond will be keeping a close eye on — including, of course, China. This time around, China’s government is taking a much harder line against Trump’s aggressive foreign and trade policy, including on the American continent. Last month, the country’s foreign minister Wang Yi warned that Latin America is not the “backyard” of any country amid attempts by the Trump administration to browbeat reengage with countries in the region. “Latin America is the home of the Latin American people, not the backyard of any country,” Wang told Sosa, according to a statement released by Beijing. “China supports Latin American countries in defending their sovereignty, independence, and national dignity.” If anything, China is seeking to intensify its strategic relations with countries in the region, particularly in South America. As the Mexican expert in international relations Brenda Estefan recently wrote last month for American Quarterly, the US may have notched up an early victory in Panama but convincing other countries, particularly in South America, to leave China’s orbit is likely to be more challenging: Beijing currently maintains “strategic partnerships” with 10 of the 11 South American nations it engages with, with Guyana being the only exception, as it maintains only standard bilateral relations… In January, during a visit to Beijing, I met with Chinese business leaders whose inclination to deepen their investments in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, was unmistakable. Our discussions revealed China no longer perceives Latin America as a resource supplier but as a pivotal part of its ambitious global economic agenda… … Brazil—Latin America’s largest economy—is largely a lost cause for Washington, as it has significantly deepened its ties with Beijing. Chinese firms have invested in major infrastructure projects ranging from ports and railways to power grids. China is now Brazil’s largest trading partner, absorbing most of its exports, including soy, beef, coffee, and iron. In 2023, bilateral trade reached a record $181 billion. Moreover, Brazil and China have strengthened their geopolitical ties through BRICS, further complicating Washington’s ability to exert influence. Of all the countries in the region, Peru draws the highest level of Chinese investment relative to GDP. The most significant of these investments was the recently inaugurated deep-water port at Chancay, which is intended to serve as a direct trade link between China and South America. After Trump’s electoral triumph, one of his advisors even proposed imposing tariffs on goods passing through Chancay. Argentina is another interesting case. Before coming to power in late 2023, President Javier Milei talked openly about cutting all ties with China’s “murderous” dictatorship, only to backtrack once in office. There was a simple reason for this: since 2009 Argentina has had a currency swap arrangement with Beijing which has helped to ensure some degree of exchange rate stability for Argentina while also deepening trade between the two countries. Given the sorry state of Argentina’s finances, Milei was in no position to turn his nose up at any outside financing. Indeed, by October 2024, almost exactly a year after telling Tucker Carlson that he would never trade with China due to its government’s left-wing, authoritarian proclivities, Javier Milei had nothing but fond words for the US’ main strategic rival today. “China is a very interesting trading partner,” said Javier Milei, who just a year earlier had described the Chinese government as as “assassin.” They “do not make demands, the only thing they ask is that they not be bothered.” Mexico, Between a Rock and a Hard Place There can be no doubt that the US’s main priority is to drive a very large wedge between Mexico, its largest trade partner, and China, its second largest. According to Norwegian logistics firm Xeneta, the Mexico-China trade route is now the fastest-growing in the world, as China has sought to use Mexico’s fast-growing industrial base as a stepping stone for the US market. Given the extent of economic integration between the US and Mexico, Washington is determined to put an end to this trend. And so far, Mexico has buckled each time the US has applied pressure. Last April, the AMLO government announced hundreds of “temporary” tariffs on imports from countries with whom it does not have a trade agreement. The tariffs were imposed on 544 imported products, including footwear, wood, plastic, electrical material, musical instruments, furniture, and steel, and ranged from 5% to 50% in size. They had one clear target in mind: imports from China though the word “China” was not mentioned once in the decree. While the growing deployment of protectionist measures in Mexico, largely at the behest of the US, has elicited rare criticism in the Mexican business press, it seems that the Claudia Sheinbaum government is poised to continue this policy. From Bloomberg: Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her country would review tariffs on Chinese shipments, a move that could give the Trump administration a win in its push to build a “Fortress North America” that blocks shipments from the Asian nation. “We have to review the tariffs that we have with China,” Sheinbaum said at a press conference Thursday. She pointed to Mexico’s problems in textile and shoe production, saying: “Much of the entry of Chinese products into Mexico caused this industry to fall in our country.” The comments come after President Donald Trump offered major reprieves to Mexico and Canada, the US’s two largest trading partners, by exempting goods from those nations that are covered by the North American trade agreement known as USMCA from his 25% tariffs. There’s a clear logic behind this. For a start, the economies of Mexico and the US are already so intertwined that trying to disentangle them will be an ungodly task. A staggering 83% of Mexico’s exports, many of which are goods assembled by US manufacturers in Mexican maquiladoras, go to the US. If a large part of those supply chains was threatened, the result for Mexico would be a deep economic crisis with millions losing their jobs, which in turn would endanger the ruling party MORENA’s entire economic project. As I’ve noted in previous pieces, Mexico is caught in the middle of a titanic duel between the world’s two rival economic superpowers. While Brazil’s Lula may have invited Claudia Sheinbaum to the next BRICS meeting, the chances of Mexico becoming a BRICS nation any time soon is still razor thin, even as the Trump administration does everything it can to dynamite the USMCA trade deal, and its constituent economies. For one thing, it will take years for Mexico to pivot its economy away from the US. Also, as AMLO said last year, Mexico’s geographic reality simply means it has little choice in the matter: We cannot shut ourselves off, we cannot break up, we cannot isolate ourselves. It is a fact that we have 3,800 kilometres of shared border, for reasons of geopolitics (presumably in reference to the US’ invasion, occupation and appropriation of more than half of Mexico’s territory in the mid-19th century). With all due respect, we are not a European country, nor are we Brazil. We have this neighbourhood and, furthermore, if we agree on things, as we have done, we can help each other out… However, helping out the US essentially means hitching Mexico’s economy to a declining superpower that appears to be on the verge of inflicting upon itself — and by extension, large parts of the world — a severe economic crisis while at the same time adopting an increasingly belligerent approach to adversaries and allies alike. This time around, however, China is adopting a tougher response to US and broader Western provocations. Just a few days ago, Beijing imposed a 100% tariff on Canadian rapeseed oil, oilcake and peas and a 25% tariff on aquatic products and pork from Canada as a retaliation for Ottawa’s escalating tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars and other products. While Mexico’s exports to China are negligible, representing just over 2% of the total, a chill on diplomatic and commercial relations with China will mean even greater dependence on the big neighbour to the North as well as loss of influence in the Global South, which is just how Washington wants it. BlackRock’s Takeover of Panama Canal Is First Major Victory for Trump’s “Americas First” Policy, It is also a major victory for Wall Street. So the obvious, to me, is to ask the question victory for whom? “America First” you say, Wall Street? Are the two the same or divergent? That There can be no denying it: the deal is a major geopolitical victory for the Trump administration… I’m ready to concede if it is the U.S. flexing its military/financial/ political influence in this hemisphere viz-a-viz China. A victory for those Americans on Soc. Sec. and under a insufferable burden of debt, living precariously from day-to-day, victory? ah…not so much. Woodrow Wison wrote: “Since trade ignores national boundaries and the manufacturer insists on having the world as a market, the flag of his nation must follow him, and the doors of the nations which are closed against him must be battered down. Concessions obtained by financiers must be safeguarded by ministers of state, even if the sovereignty of unwilling nations be outraged in the process. Colonies must be obtained or planted, in order that no useful corner of the world may be overlooked or left unused.” It is, in much the same terms, Lenin’s theory of imperialism. In whatever terms, both Trump and Xi understand this. Yes, and of course the most notorious period of Latin American intervention was the post WW2 Cold War when our FP elites were allegedly fighting communism–a mere idea–rather than a trading rival. Many of us thought back then that Reagan was doing in Latin America what he and the MIC would do in this country if they could get away with it. Perhaps one explanation for today’s world wide elite tolerance of massacres in the ME and Africa is that they keep the colonialist dream alive in the spirit of Pizarro and Cortes and even Columbus. As Madeleine Albright said, “why do we have this giant military if we aren’t going to use it?” Why indeed. Trump of course is waxing nostalgic for the even older McKinley period when the Philippines gained our benevolent attention. But American imperialism was always a mere me too version of what Europe had been doing. After all it was Spain and Portugal who created all those Latin American countries. With luck buying a few ports will satisfy Trump’s urge for territorial glory. Multipolarity is a rational and desirable thing but it is not the historical trend. We couldn’t hardly wait to grant independence to the Philippines just after WW2, that’s how important it was to us, Puerto Rico (‘Rich Door’ in Spanish) is somewhat of a basket case, Cuba has been our sworn enemy going on 65 years now, leaving us with Guam for the win, of our circa 1898 territorial conquests. We weren’t very good at colonialism as it turns out. Europe, on the other hand… You’re forgetting the 1898 imperial-colonial elephant in the room — the annexation of Hawaii. https://www.qwant.com/?q=hawaiian+pear+is+fully+ripe+golden+hour+pluck+it Not for nothing has Woodrow Wilson been called one of America’s most evil Presidents. Right down there with Clinton, Cheney (bush) and Obama. Yes, but give Wilson his due. Wisdom resides in changing the things we can change, accepting the things we can’t change, and making money off of the rest. While reading this post, one line stuck out which said ‘the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries.’ I have read this before but I am now wondering how far back that Blackrock has been acquiring ports. Thing is, as soon as Trump got in he was talking about the US seizing places that had shipping lanes go through them (Panama) or had vital shipping lanes go by them (Greenland) and of course the US is setting up bases on places like the Galapagos Islands which also have trade routes go by them. So when you think about it, if you have the government trying to seize control of the world’s shipping routes while at the same time you had US Blackrock buying up strategic ports, it seems that the new strategy of the deep state government is to control the world’s shipping routes to strangle any country that they did not like. So this must be one of those public-private partnerships that you keep on hearing about. /sarc Please stop the hyperventilating. China has been buying up ports. So now the US is catching up? The only difference it is the Trump noisemaking. CK Hutchison Holding is probably laughing all the way to the bank. Panama is in the midst of a crisis over water. Not enough for the canal and local farms, to the degree that it was causing local unrest. So now America which I believe also has a base there gets to be the bad guy water hog. Sure China is buying up ports if not building them and perhaps that reflects the number of engineers in their National People’s Congress. They are all about infrastructure after all. But the point I was trying to make was the combination of controlling trade routes and controlling the ports that they stop off at. Trump wants Greenland for control of shipping routes coming out of the Arctic. All those mineral resources to be mined there would be just to pay for it all. I doubt that this is all a Trump idea but somebody for years now has been feeding him such plans about controlling the world’s shipping routes and ports. If global warming turns the Panama Canal into a dry empty ditch, it won’t even be a shipping route anymore. A railway, perhaps? control as in managing or actual ownership. The ownership can be much murkier and less transparent than this. Read somewhere that from the 11 Trill managed by BlackRock only a fraction is in fact owned by the company. Is it true? CK Hutchinson Holdings is owned by the influential Li family. The patriarch, Li Ka-Shing, who is now retired was once known as the Superman of Asia and had deep links to the Communist Party of China. The Holdings company also still has a very substantial presence in Hong Kong (for example the ubiquitous Watsons shops) and Mainland China. I have a hard time reading this one, because the family knows that it has to stay on the right side of the Communist Party and if the later really wanted these ports, they could have one of the State Owned Companies gobble them ports up, so I think this sale was actually approved by the Chinese government and the next obvious question is to what purpose? To make some money before global warming makes the Panama Canal dry and worthless? ( Dumm Trump doesn’t ” believe in global warming ” so Dumm Trump could never imagine the Panama Canal running out of water). The headline is acrid male bovine faeces of the ilk agent orange loves spouting. BlackRock has not taken over the Panama Canal(s), it only purchased two out of the five port terminals in the country In order to do this BlackRock had to purchase 43 port terminals in a score of countries and seems to have overpaid for a package it cannot even operate because it lacks the expertise. Swiss based MSC will operate these terminals. BTW 38.000 US citizens did not die building the first Panama Canal, only a few hundred. Most were probably mormons who refused to live pissed on gin tonic. Point taken, Mangy Cat, and it’s an important one. Title has been changed. Thanks for the eloquent feedback. Thank you! Yellow fever – the major killer in Panama – is not listed as a disease treated by quinine at drugs.com. I don’t know if it has any such efficacy equivalent to that of malaria. Unlike its effect on plasmodium malariae, the parasite causing malaria, you are correct that quinine is not a treatment for yellow fever. However, like caffeine, quinine is a mosquito repellent, these critters being the vectors of both diseases. I have no data on the epidemiology while the US built the canal but during the De Lesseps venture both malaria and yellow fever were severe problems. In the generation between the French and US ventures the mosquito was found to be the vector. Together with the decision to build lacks rather than at sea level contributed to the success of the canal. Thank you, Nick. The Partnership on Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI) link caught my attention. Some, but not all, of the private sector attendees are involved with the British government’s attempt to reboot, really privatise, the UK. Sometimes, a storied UK firm is invited as a token, like Schroders a fortnight or so ago, but these US giants are in the driving seat. This is why I think the UK will continue to triangulate between the EU and US. In addition, with an election defeat not unlikely in 2029, Labour politicians will need a golden parachute. They have to suck up to US big finance. There is no doubt in my mind that CK Hutchinson believe the have sold Blackrock a pig in a poke. I doubt they would have been allowed to make the sale by the CCP if the latter believed it was AT WORST geopolitically neutral. As Yves pointed out above, Panama is hurting badly for water, and China is better positioned to operate without the Canal. Expect to see more >Panamax ships sliding out of Chinese shipyards soon. Mexico launches Interoceanic Train service Trains More recently Sheinbaum dramatically increased funding: The story was different, however, for the Isthmus of Tehuantepec rail project, which seeks to develop an overland rail alternative to the Panama Canal [see “Mexico launches Interoceanic Train service,” Trains News Wire, Dec. 23, 2023]. Reflecting that project’s potential economic and logistic benefits, its funding saw a 703.5% increase, from 3.9 billion pesos ($190 million) to more than 31.5 billion pesos ($1.53 billion). Double tracking the line and running double stack container trains could easily handle several million containers a year with efficient sorting at either end. With Panama’s water problems, increased transit tolls and Blackstone running the ports, this project may have promise for Mexico. Thanks for bringing this up, upstater. We actually covered this story back in 2023. Have added a couple of additional paragraphs to this piece on the issue as well as a wee hat-tip in your direction. Since it is acknowledged that most of the fenanyl comes in by ship, does this mean Blackrock will face 25% tariffs unless they get it under control? In the medium and long run, if Chinese ships use the North East Route to reach the North Atlantic and then go down the eastern seabord of Americas, do theyyy even need the Panama Canal. What are the distances involved, and the dangers for chocking for one traditional route (passing the island chains around China into Pacific and then the Pacific into Panama and Atlantic) compared to the other (NER under Russian security umbrella then down to North Atlantic and so on? I have the feeling that Yves is quite right and Hutchinson Holdings is laughing on their way to the bank… re: There can be no doubt that the US’s main priority is to drive a very large wedge between Mexico, its largest trade partner, and China, its second largest. Until Canada actually becomes the 51st state, I believe it’s the USA’s largest trading partner, before Mexico. Nick Corbishley – thanks for a very informative article. One also wonders if Blackrock will manage the Ports for trading efficiency, or strip mine the port’s value and assets while neglecting maintenance – the typical VC maximizing profit approach, eventually leading to much higher costs for the nation’s (and loss of competitiveness) that sold them the ports. You can’t make this up, Blackrock CEO Larry Fink sounds the alarm on the economy After buying a couple of lemons he’s just realized that he would not be able to turn them into lemonades.

Editor Economy Bryan Lutz, Dollar Collapse “I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations, which dare already to challenge our government to a trial of strength and to bid defiance to the laws of their country.” ~ Thomas Jefferson Written by Bryan Lutz, Editor at Dollarcollapse.com: The corporate world is a fascinating one. Contrast it with the political one and you can find a new, curious perspective. Much of the political world pretends to own corporations, but in reality corporations tend to run the world. Here’s how it works: Governments like to regulate industries, make claims on natural resources, and force the ownership of certain operations. But in the end, it is the corporations that are producing the work. Governments do not produce. However, there is one trick governments use to claim some part in the production of real things… It is to claim ownership over the currency. Once the government becomes the person defining trade and the value of a currency they have much more control over what private corporations can and cannot do. They essentially make any demand they want because corporations must operate using their currency. But things change if one of these two things happen: Imagine if corporations started buying gold and then they put that gold on their balance sheet. Eventually, corporations would have a valid reason to start trading outside of the State currency. And then there’s the other radical alternative… Some corporations, Blackrock for example, are buying Bitcoin and other crypto to place it on their balance sheet. Recently, BlackRock made some interesting changes to their portfolio buying up a lot of Bitcoin for themselves, and investing in their own iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF during Bitcoin’s latest dip. BNN Bloomberg reports: BlackRock Adds Its Bitcoin ETF to Model Portfolio for First Time “The world’s biggest asset manager is finally allowing Bitcoin into its $150 billion model-portfolio universe. BlackRock Inc. is adding a 1% to 2% allocation to the $48 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) in its target allocation portfolios that allow for alternatives, according to an investment outlook viewed by Bloomberg… …The move by BlackRock comes as Bitcoin prices crater alongside stocks, with a toxic brew of economic concerns and trade tensions weighing on risk appetite. The cryptocurrency is currently trading around $83,000, after reaching nearly $110,000 last month. Bitcoin’s famed volatility is a core reason why the asset manager mapped out a 1% to 2% weighting as a “reasonable range” in a December paper from the BlackRock Investment Institute. At the time it added that anything beyond 2% would sharply increase crypto’s share of overall portfolio risk.” Only a few days later, Trump announces a “Strategic Crypto Reserve.” And that launched Bitcoin back up another 10%. That is not only a favor for American freedom (as marketed to the public)… It is an effort on the US federal government’s part to control emerging currencies and therefore, the corporations that operate with them, but… Who really benefits from Trump’s Strategic Crypto Reserve? CNBC reports: Trump announces strategic crypto reserve including bitcoin, Solana, XRP and more “Cryptocurrencies rallied on Sunday after President Donald Trump announced the creation of a strategic crypto reserve for the United States that will include bitcoin and ether, as well as XRP, Solana’s SOL token and Cardano’s ADA. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,” he said in a post on Truth Social. “I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World.” “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable Cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve,” he said in a follow-up post. “I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” XRP surged 33% after the announcement while the token tied to Solana jumped 25%. Cardano’s coin soared more than 60%. Bitcoin rose 10% to $94,343.82, after dipping to a three-month low under $80,000 on Friday. Ether, which has suffered some of the biggest losses in crypto year-to-date, gained 13%.” So who benefited from the Strategic Crypto Reserve the most? Those corporations that hold Bitcoin, and other cryptos… And those corporations that are also big enough to own a whole lot of real things. For example, Larry Fink’s BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager. BlackRock’s power, wealth, and control continue to grow to staggering heights. Here’s their most recent purchase… Bloomberg reports: BlackRock’s Ports Deal Marks New Reach, Hands Win to Trump “BlackRock Inc. led one of the biggest acquisitions of the year in a deal that marked both the firm’s expanded reach in infrastructure and a win for US President Donald Trump, who had raised concerns over control of key ports near the Panama Canal. The world’s biggest asset manager led a consortium that will buy a controlling stake in Panama ports that had become a political lightning rod and a larger unit that has operations across 23 countries. CK Hutchison, the conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, said it would receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion from the sale. CK Hutchinson shares jumped as much as 25% in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the most in 27 years. The deal is a major victory for Trump, who had argued that China had taken over the critical waterway, without providing evidence, and that the US was paying too much for the passage of ships. He previously demanded the fees charged on US naval and merchant ships be lowered, or else Panama should return the canal to the US.” Can you see now? Trump’s “America First” policies and business like administrative style are putting corporations, especially BlackRock First. If you’re still not seeing what’s happening here… Bloomberg exposes: Fink Phoned Trump Directly to Pitch BlackRock’s Panama Deal “Donald Trump promised on Day 1 to seize the Panama Canal. “We’re taking it back,” the US president declared in his inaugural address. Within weeks, Wall Street billionaire Larry Fink was on the line with the White House. His pitch: Fink’s investment company, BlackRock Inc., was interested in buying the ports on either side of waterway, shifting them into American hands, according to people familiar with the discussion. And with that, there would be no need to have the US take the century-old canal by force. So went days of whirlwind negotiations that now are set to deliver control of those ports to a consortium led by BlackRock, the $11.6 trillion investment giant Fink has run for almost four decades.” Economy Economy Economy Receive the latest and greatest by subscribing to our newsletter

Title: Equator closes $55M fund to bring more private capital to African climate tech | TechCrunch

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us African venture capital firm Equator has raised $55 million for its first fund, which will back climate tech startups through one of the most difficult and often overlooked phases in their journey: the early stage. Climate tech startups in African countries have to navigate a tougher funding landscape than their counterparts in more developed economies, where governments often subsidize companies working on greener technologies. They have to instead rely heavily on development finance institutions (DFIs), foundations, and endowments, making them especially vulnerable to shifts in global capital flows. As aid and development finance budgets shrink, DFIs deploy less capital, which adds to the pressure on African startups. The situation is worse for climate tech companies, which require more capital than traditional tech startups. With its fund, Equator feels it can bridge this gap and back scalable solutions that can attract private capital. “We are needed more than ever to invest in technology and scalable ventures tackling fundamental climate challenges,” said the firm’s managing partner, Nijhad Jamal. “These investments will help reduce dependence on aid and instead bring more global private capital into the region.” That’s a lofty goal to aim for, but like many Africa-focused funds, Equator’s base of limited partners still is composed of the very institutions it aims to wean startups off. Its backers include DFIs such as British International Investment (BII), Proparco, and IFC, as well as foundations and endowments like the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (funded by IKEA, Rockefeller, and Jeff Bezos’ Earth Fund) and the Shell Foundation. Equator plans to invest the fund in 15 to 18 startups, writing $750,000 to $1 million checks for companies at the seed stage and $2 million for those at Series A. Aside from capital, the firm wants to help founders figure out unit economics, governance, and regional expansion. The fund wants to also reserve capital for follow-on investments and later-stage rounds, and aims to mobilize its LPs as co-investors to bring in equity, debt, or blended financing. “In several of our portfolio companies, we’re the only Africa-focused investor on the cap table — that’s the role we see ourselves playing in this ecosystem,” Jamal said. “Until our most recent investments, we had a 100% success rate in bringing our investors directly into the ventures we backed.” Africa accounts for less than 3% of global energy-related CO2 emissions but bears some of the harshest climate impacts. Equator wants to address that, saying it invests in ventures “addressing economic and sustainability challenges emerging from these impacts.” When we covered the firm in 2023 after it had reached the first close for this fund, Jamal stressed the importance of backing technical founders building in the energy, agriculture, and mobility sectors. At the time, investments in climate tech had surged, making it Africa’s No. 2 VC sector after fintech. The market has changed since then, however, and investor conversations have evolved alongside those changes. Initially, founders and investors mainly focused on impact; now, Jamal says, the emphasis is shifting to sales — climate solutions must deliver clear economic value to customers with purchasing power. Listing examples of such solutions, Jamal pointed to electric vehicles that cost less than fuel-powered ones; climate insurance that accurately covers extreme weather; or AI-powered logistics optimization for businesses. Some of Equator’s portfolio companies, Roam Electric, Ibisa, and Leta, are building these solutions. “The narrative has shifted,” Jamal said. “It’s no longer just about development and impact. It’s about mobilizing private capital for scalable ventures that solve problems. The focus today is even more on things like unit economics and the path to profitability, because people know there isn’t just [enough] capital to throw at ventures to scale without thinking about monetization, real economics, profitability, or exits.” Jamal feels climate tech startups today are different from their first-generation clean tech counterparts like Sun King, M-KOPA, and d.light, which raised billions and are now looking ready for IPOs. These new startups, he said, operate in a more mature ecosystem, allowing them to use capital and time more efficiently — key factors in becoming attractive acquisition targets. Rather than billion-dollar IPOs, Jamal anticipates $100 million exits, saying that can still deliver strong returns for investors. The space is already seeing some consolidation, though most of it is undisclosed. We did see notable M&A, like Bboxx’s acquisition of PEG Africa in 2022, and more recently, Equator-backed SteamaCo merged with Shyft Power Solutions last year. As the sector hopes to see more exits, Jamal stressed the importance of capital structuring. Climate tech attracted the most debt financing last year, and he argues startups need the right mix to avoid excessive equity dilution. “If equity is used for everything, including working capital, dilution will be too high for investors or founders to see meaningful returns. But as debt and other financial instruments become more available, we’ll start seeing commercial exits, even if they’re more bite-sized,” he said. Jamal previously held roles at BlackRock and impact investor Acumen Fund, where he led the clean tech group. He later founded Moja Capital, a personal fund through which he made early-stage investments aligned with Equator’s current strategy. He runs Equator alongside partner Morgan DeFoort. One of Jamal’s early bets was SunCulture, a Kenya-based, off-grid solar company backed by the Schmidt Family Foundation, which Equator has since supported. Equator has also invested in other growth-stage startups like SoftBank-backed Apollo Agriculture and Odyssey Energy Solutions.

One of these was a solar module manufacturer named Solarium Green Energy, and the other a battery maker—Maxvolt Energy Industries—with the combined valuation at a modest $18 million. For context, 2024 saw a total of 14 listings in transition sectors. In the second half of the year alone, the Indian market saw transition IPOs worth over $2.3 billion. Bloomberg quoted unnamed sources as saying the immediate outlook for transition IPOs was not too bright, with bankers recommending valuations up to 30% lower than the numbers sought by company executives. “Growth is slowing,” Edward Lees, co-manager of BNP Paribas’ Emerging Markets Environmental Solutions fund, told Bloomberg. “People are just less tolerant of this idea of having to pay a green premium.” Also, Lees said, investors are paying more attention to the profitability of such companies now than they used to. In India specifically, there are also other problems that are turning into obstacles to IPO activity. One of these is failure on the part of alternative energy developers to secure long-term deals with buyers. Bloomberg again reported earlier this month that a growing number of wind and solar installations were having trouble securing offtake agreements with regional grid operators, as established by climate change outlet the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. As much as 35 GW worth of new projects were waiting to sign such offtake agreements with grid operators amid bureaucratic delays and expectations that wind and solar power prices would be on a consistent downward curve. Even so, the outlook, at least per BloombergNEF, is bright, with new installations this year expected to break a record.

Title: Eric Schmidt named CEO of a rocket startup. It could put him in competition with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.

Another billionaire has entered the rocket race. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has provided "substantial financial backing" and has become the CEO of rocket startup Relativity Space, its outgoing leader Tim Ellis said Monday. The company, which was the first to send 3D printed rockets into space, is building reusable flight hardware and has a long-term goal of building an industrial base on Mars. Schmidt, who led Google from 2001 until 2011 and was Alphabet's executive chairman until 2017, joins as the company aims to launch its Terran R launch vehicle in the next couple of years. The company said in a YouTube video posted Monday the vehicle is now in the design process. It launched its Terran 1 rocket in 2023, but it failed to reach orbit. Relativity Space declined to comment further when reached by Business Insider. "I know there's no one more tenacious or passionate to propel this dream forward," Ellis, also the cofounder of the company, said in an X post on Monday, adding that he'll transition to the company's board. Some of the company's eventual ambitions run parallel to those of Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. Under Schmidt's leadership, Relativity Space's rockets could compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy and Blue Origin's New Glenn and New Shepherd rockets, as Relativity Space aims to create reusable rockets. The company, which was founded about a decade ago, is also known for using 3D printing to produce its rockets. In 2023, Relativity Space made history by sending the first rocket that was mostly 3D printed into space, though it did not reach orbit. The company has since expanded its focus beyond 3D printing and is also incorporating more traditional methods to produce its rockets. Relativity Space was valued at more than $4 billion in 2021, with investors that included BlackRock, Fidelity, and Mark Cuban. Jump to

Title: Panama Canal weighs pipeline to move gas, with eye on Asian clients

Business FILE PHOTO: An aerial view shows cargo vessels docked at Balboa Port, operated by Panama Ports Company, at the Panama Canal, in Panama City, Panama, February 1, 2025. REUTERS/Enea Lebrun//File Photo (C) By Elida Moreno PANAMA CITY : The Panama Canal is exploring the construction of a pipeline to move liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) across the trade passage, canal administrator Ricaurte Vasquez said on Monday, with Japan seen as a top potential client for gas coming from the U.S. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT The canal, one of the world's busiest maritime trade passages, is looking to diversify its operations after getting the greenlight in a court ruling last year. A drought limited crossings and canal officials are planning to build a reservoir nearby. Japan is one of the world's largest LPG customers, using the fuel for domestic and industrial use. KEY QUOTE "We're exploring the possibility of rolling out infrastructure with the capacity to move up to a million barrels per day (bpd), but the market is much larger," Vasquez told Reuters following a press conference. "Meeting the needs for growing volumes (of gas) through Panama is of the highest priority, but also of the highest complexity," Vasquez said. CONTEXT The move comes amid a backdrop of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Panama, sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's claims about reclaiming the Panama Canal.
