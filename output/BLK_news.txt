Crypto pundit Pumpius is drawing attention to what he calls the “XRP Endgame,” saying all the key pieces are falling into place for Ripple and its token. According to him, these shifts put XRP in a rare position to rise above other digital assets. Global rules and banking standards are also moving in Ripple’s favor at the same time. Pumpius stresses that Ripple’s victory in its long fight with the SEC is not just a legal win but a turning point. After years in court, XRP now has the strongest legal clarity of any cryptocurrency in the U.S. He also points to Ripple’s launch of RLUSD, its enterprise stablecoin backed by reserves at BNY Mellon. Pumpius notes that this connection matters because BNY Mellon safeguards trillions in assets for global giants, including BlackRock and the U.S. Treasury. Tying a stablecoin to XRP’s payment rails creates what he calls a “stable reserve army” that strengthens trust in Ripple’s network. On the banking front, Pumpius explains that Ripple is not only licensed as a money service business but has also applied for the highly difficult New York banking charter. He adds that Ripple has taken it a step further by applying for a Federal Reserve master account, the highest privilege in the U.S. banking system. If granted, Ripple would not just compete with banks but effectively act as one, placing XRP at the center of financial settlements. Pumpius notes that nearly 20 XRP spot ETFs are awaiting approval. If greenlit, these funds could open the doors to trillions of dollars from institutional investors and push XRP into the ranks of Wall Street assets overnight. Another major shift is the migration to ISO 20022, a global messaging standard that all major banks must adhere to by November. Pumpius points out that XRP has been ready for this for years, meaning RippleNet can easily connect with traditional banking rails the moment the change takes effect. Additionally, he notes that XRP is in the liquidity tokenization plan of DTCC, the world’s largest settlement utility. At the same time, he notes that the DNA Protocol is quietly developing biometric and genomic identity tools on the XRP Ledger. This step could solve Know Your Customer checks at the deepest level, blending finance and digital identity in a way no other blockchain has achieved. Ripple benefits as he notes the rise of a supportive political environment. A pro-crypto administration is pushing laws that fit Ripple’s long-term playbook. With regulators and policymakers leaning in the same direction, he believes the stage is set for XRP to move into its endgame.

Δ This collaboration will see the companies launch trading and lending solutions powered by tokenized money market funds and stablecoins, Ripple announced Thursday (Sept. 18). “2025 has been marked by a series of industry-firsts when it comes to traditional financial institutions moving onchain — and the linkup between Ripple, DBS and Franklin Templeton to enable repo trades for a tokenized money market fund with a regulated, stable and liquid mode of exchange such as RLUSD is truly a game-changer,” said Nigel Khakoo, vice president and global head of trading and markets at Ripple. “Investors can also seamlessly rebalance their portfolios between a stablecoin and a yield-generating money market fund, all within a single, trusted ecosystem, unlocking real-world capital efficiency, utility and liquidity that institutions demand.” According to a Ripple news release, the partnership will see DBS’s Digital Exchange list sgBENJI — the token of Franklin Templeton’s tokenized money market fund — alongside Ripple’s RLUSD. This setup lets DBS clients trade RLUSD for sgBENJI tokens, allowing them to “rebalance their portfolios into a relatively stable asset 24/7 and within minutes, while earning yield during periods of volatility,” the companies said. As the partnership progresses, DBS will explore helping customers unlock liquidity by using their sgBENJI tokens as collateral, the release added.

Title: Trump Pals The Ellison Boys Gonna Save CBS And TikTok From Woke Bias!

Time Published: 2025-09-18T15:02:02Z

Sounds like President Trump is inching closer towards his wish to be king of all media and star of every stage! He coyly hinted on his shitty web platform on Monday: The big Trade Meeting in Europe between The United States of America, and China, has gone VERY WELL! It will be concluding shortly. A deal was also reached on a “certain” company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!! President DJT And Trump’s sherpa of deals/ mean drunk/ Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there was a “framework for a deal” for a TikTok sale, though he has said the words “framework for a deal” eleventy-hundred times. Through the months of Trump’s insane pingponging deals with China we have learned that “framework” and “deal” are two very different things. Though at least this is better than the “handshake for a framework” Howard Lutnick said they had back in June. So on Friday are Trump and Scott Bessent really, finally going to get that deal from China on those rare earth minerals, the ones US tech companies need to make all of their AI chips, planes, and high-tech gadgets that Trump screwed them out of by self-embargoing the US? It’s concepts of a framework for maybe! Subscribe! But anyway, word on the street, aka CBS and the Wall Street Journal, is that the deal old Pappy was going on about up there is the potential sale of TikTok to Oracle, whose CEO is his close pal Larry Ellison, and some private equity firms. If the name rings a bell, it’s because Larry Ellison’s son David is the new chairman and CEO of Paramount, after completing a merger between Paramount (CBS’s parent company) and Ellison’s company, Skydance. And both father and son are longtime Republican donors. And father Larry may be richer than Elon Musk now! At least he’s not in on the deal. Oh, and now Paramount Skydance is reportedly in talks to buy Warner Brothers Discovery, too, the parent company of CNN. Those Ellison boys are making the kind of cross-platform Republican media control that Project 2025 once only dreamed of! How long until somebody greenlights that immigration reality show that Kristi Noem denied she was workshopping? TikTok being forced under his thumb has apparently long been a wish of Trump’s, at least since app users first ground his gears back in 2020 by registering to attend his rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with no intention of showing up, causing his delicate ego embarrassment when the yuge surging crowd he was expecting turned out to be a mere trickle. He raged for TikTok to be BANNED, because something something Chinese spies, and Congress passed an act that banned the app unless its algorithm was put under the control of a US company. And Joe Biden signed it! Remember that extra-stupid hearing with TikTok’s CEO Shou Chew, with Tom Cotton refusing to accept that he is from Singapore, which is a whole different country than China, and how embarrassingly pig-ignorant the senators were about the basics of how the Internet even works? But, the Chinese government doesn’t and has never owned TikTok. A Chinese man founded it and is still 20 percent of the board, but the company was never incorporated in China. There has been no evidence that the Chinese government ever had access to user data, much less that they were using it to spy on dissidents or Americans making cucumber salads. TikTok is owned by ByteDance Ltd., which is headquartered in the Cayman Islands, and TikTok Inc. is headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore. And its servers — ORACLE servers, in fact — dish out its secret-sauce algorithm from Virginia. Sixty percent of ByteDance is currently owned by non-Chinese global institutional investors including Susquehanna International Group (majority shareholder Jeff Yass), the Carlyle Group, General Atlantic, KKR, BlackRock, and Tiger Global Management; 20 percent of the firm is owned by Beijing-based founder Zhang Yiming, and 20 percent is owned by employees. But Congress and Biden decided to ban the app anyway, after Trump had said it was a CHINESE SPY EMERGENCY. And then some curious things happened! Jeff Yass, the managing director of Susquehanna International Group, the company that is also the largest shareholder of TikTok’s parent company, bought two percent of Digital World Acquisition Corporation, which merged with Trump Media & Technology Group, making its share price surge 140 percent, defibrillating Trump’s flatlining company. And then right before the ‘24 election, the TikTok algorithm underwent a noticeable shift, and Trumpy content began appearing in people’s feeds when it hadn’t before. And TikTok CEO Shou Chew attended Trump’s inauguration in January. And after his win, Trump credited TikTok with helping him win more young voters, so he loved it again and decided to save it, even going to the Supreme Court to try to stop them from enacting the ban he himself had asked Congress to pass. The deadline for a sale has since been extended four times already, and has now been pushed off until December 16. The Wall Street Journal has more details of the prospective deal: The company’s board would stay the same, except that Zhang Yiming’s stake would be reduced to less than 20 percent, and a consortium of US companies, including Susquehanna International, KKR, General Atlantic Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz would control 80 percent of the company. A new US entity would be created, with a board with one member designated by the US government, which is unheard of. And the US company would license the magic algorithm, putting it into a new US version of the app, so that the Trumpy board would be able to customize it and make it massage everybody’s feed this way and that, promoting the reach of some accounts and limiting access to others. Meanwhile, CBS under control of its new owner Paramount has a whole other vibe. Paramount Global and CBS CEO George Cheeks hasn’t been fired (yet), but he obeyed in advance. The Late Show with Stephen Colbert was cancelled before the deal even went down, and Trump’s claims against 60 Minutes for making Kamala Harris look too smart got settled for a $16 million donation to his presidential library before the merger was approved. And CBS News employees say Ellison the younger broke his promise not to politicize their news reporting almost immediately, reportedly entering talks to buy The Free Press, owned by anti-woke “free speech” crusader Bari Weiss, who got her start ratting out professors for being pro-Arab, for “well above” $100 million and installing her into some kind of a senior leadership role to tone-police the reporting at CBS News. PREVIOUSLY! And Ellison brought on a conservative thinktanker from the Hudson Institute, Kenneth R. Weinstein, to be an ombudsman rooting out any “complaints of bias” that might aggrieve conservatives at CBS. But it all doesn’t go far enough for everybody on the Right, of course. Now at least one Federalist Society weirdo is proposing that the government shut down Bluesky, and Discord too. But social media sites, they’re not just for cat memes! Businesses do about $15 billion in sales a year on TikTok. And TikTok and Discord have been critical to documenting human rights abuses, and organizing protests, such as recently in Nepal. There’s many times more young people in the US and around the world on Discord (614 million users) and on TikTok (2 billion users) than who are watching 60 Minutes (about 8 million viewers) so, of course the dominionists want to dominate it. And whatever other platforms they can get their filthy paws on, to better control every sphere of American life. Oh did they throw Jimmy Kimmel off the air, “indefinitely”? They did that last night too, with the FCC threatening that ABC’s broadcast license was in danger after Kimmel criticized the regime’s response to the assassination of Charlie Kirk.

Title: Best Crypto To Invest In As Ethereum Eyes $5.5K Ahead Of $XRP ETF Launch
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-invest-in-ethereum-eyes-5500-october/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T13:22:26Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum ($ETH) is under the spotlight after Fundstrat’s Tom Lee reiterated his bullish stance, stating that $ETH could reach $5.5K by mid-October. He further added that both Bitcoin and Ethereum could make a ‘monster move’ in the next three months. Lee explained that the driver for this price rise will be the Federal Reserve’s expected monetary easing, including the 0.25% rate cut. He believes that this liquidity injection will primarily benefit Bitcoin and Ethereum, making them the biggest winners of the Fed’s new policy. Alongside $ETH, $XRP is also drawing attention, with the upcoming launch of the REX-Osprey $XRP ETF (under the ticker XRPR). Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, says XRPR will be a ‘litmus test’ of investor demand for traditional spot $XRP ETFs. These developments also highlight why early opportunities in emerging projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) place them among the best crypto to invest in now. On September 17, 2025, the SEC approved rule changes that simplify the listing process for spot crypto ETFs, marking a significant regulatory milestone that opens the door for spot ETFs. Before this rule, every exchange had to file an individual 19b-4 rule change application for each new spot crypto ETF, resulting in long timelines and delays. This made matters more complicated for smaller players as issuers and exchanges needed legal teams and months of lobbying to get approvals. The new SEC rule paves the path for $XRP ETF approval, which was in regulatory limbo despite strong market demand. On the other hand, Fundstrat MD and Head of Technical Strategy Mark Newton’s bullish forecast of $ETH reaching $5.5K was absorbed by the market, alongside news of the SEC’s ETF rule change, which strengthened the positive momentum. Moreover, these developments lower barriers for retail on-ramps, reduce regulatory friction, and create opportunities for emerging altcoins like $BEST and $SUBBD – and OGs like $ETH – to shine. Read on to discover why these are the best crypto to invest in now. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the core power behind the Best Wallet app, a next-generation, multi-chain, non-custodial crypto hot wallet designed to dominate Web3 and beyond. As a utility token, $BEST offers an edge, giving real cost savings, presale access, and iGaming-fueled rewards all within the Best ecosystem. USPs of $BEST include: $BEST is currently priced at $0.025655, while the listing price has been set at $0.0225. So the presale gives early adopters a competitive edge. If you invested $100 in $BEST today, it could grow to approximately $137.26 by the end of 2025 through price appreciation. When factoring in the token’s generous 83% staking APY, you could reap roughly $251.19, a 151% gain by year-end. The presale has already raised $15.9M+, with traction already proving a strong demand and high staking returns. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) offers one of the most attractive upside profiles among utility tokens this year. $SUBBD powers an AI-driven Web3 content creator platform, providing fans with access to premium content, exclusive drops, and direct creator interactions. Considering the content creator economy could reach $480B by 2027, according to Goldman Sachs estimates, this gives $SUBBD the potential to be among the strongest plays of 2025. SUBBD is a platform for creators and fans alike, with attractive perks for both. As a creator, you’ll have access to an AI assistant for chats, scheduling, editing, and monetization. The ecosystem enables frictionless global payments in crypto and fiat, and cuts out the need for costly middlemen – like agents. Meanwhile, as a fan, holding $SUBBD means AI-enhanced interactions, discounts, and access to exclusive content, as well as AI tools. You can also stake your tokens for 20% APY and unlock rewards, beta features, and more. That attractive blend of AI and content creation has seen $SUBBD raise $1.1M+ through its presale, with no signs of momentum slowing. $SUBBD’s current price is $0.05645, although the next price rise is expected in less than three days. Early adopters can also secure a fixed staking APY of 20% for the first year, after which staking transitions to a platform benefit model, rewarding active ecosystem participation. According to our $SUBBD Price Prediction guide, $SUBBD could reach $0.438 by the end of 2025, representing an upside of around 676% for early adopters. If you invest $100 in $SUBBD today, that investment could grow to around $775.90 by the end of 2025 purely from price appreciation. Additionally, the 20% staking APY would yield an extra $20 in rewards, bringing the total to approximately $795.90. Learn how to buy SUBBD Token here. This combination of explosive growth potential, steady staking returns, and early-stage entry makes SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) one of the most compelling high-upside crypto opportunities in 2025. Currently trading at around $4.5K, Ethereum ($ETH) is predicted to reach $5.5K by mid-October. Analysts attribute the price drive to rising institutional inflows, increased ETF demand, technical breakouts, and a high percentage of $ETH supply being staked. $ETH’s trading volume has shot up by 27% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47.6B, and its market cap is up by 1.6%, reaching $552B. CoinMarketCap users are also considering an upside of $4.7K to $4.8K for Ethereum, if it holds at $4.5K. BlackRock buying $25.4M Ethereum is also fueling a potential market rally for $ETH, and we’re likely to see more upside in the near future. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors like the Fed rate cuts, regulatory clarity, and accelerating stablecoin adoption could add to the bullish momentum. Buy your $ETH on Binance and other leading exchanges, while $BEST and $SUBBD can be bought from their official websites. This isn’t financial advice. The cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile. Always do your own research before making any investments.

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has expanded its global executive committee by adding 20 top leaders, reported the Financial Times. Among the new appointees are Sarah Melvin, head of the European business, and Mike Pyle, an investment strategist. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more The appointments also include BlackRock deputy COO Stacey Mullin, and Jaime Magyera, head of the US wealth and retirement unit. The asset manager also established a formal management committee, which includes senior executives such as COO Rob Goldstein and CFO Martin Small. “This group will help define BlackRock’s long-term vision, strategy, culture and principles,” as detailed in a letter from CEO Larry Fink and president Rob Kapito seen by the publication. Both Fink and Kapito are members of this newly formalised group. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. The changes come as BlackRock aims to increase its market value over the next five years. At the end of June 2025, the firm managed assets totalling more than $12.5tn. Fink has recently overseen the acquisition of several firms, positioning BlackRock to capitalise on the growing private markets sector. Martin Small’s new role as co-chair of the global operating committee, alongside Rob Goldstein, signals their potential as successors to Fink, the FT noted. Meanwhile, vice-chair Mark McCombe is set to retire in the upcoming year. BlackRock has not provided a statement regarding these internal changes. “This expansion reflects our commitment to evolving with purpose and unlocking the full potential of talent across the firm,” Fink and Kapito wrote. “We view this as part of an ongoing refinement of our leadership structure — one that ensures we remain responsive to our clients, our people and the opportunities ahead.” Earlier this month, BlackRock secured the necessary approvals to operate in Kuwait.

Title: From $2 Trillion To $400T? CEO Sees Bitcoin Exploding 200x – Here’s More

Jack Mallers, co-founder and CEO of Twenty One Capital, told NYSE TV that he expects Bitcoin to climb much higher from current levels. According to Mallers, the size of global wealth available for savings gives Bitcoin room to grow in a big way. He made the bold remark that Bitcoin could be “100 to 200 times from here,” and his firm’s buying behavior appears to follow that view. According to Mallers, total global wealth across assets like stocks, property, gold and art is about $900 trillion. He argued roughly $400–500 trillion of that is used mainly as savings. Right now, Mallers said, Bitcoin’s market value sits near $2 trillion. At the price cited in reports — about $115,570 per coin — he sees a path for dramatic expansion if Bitcoin captures only a slice of that savings market. Jack Mallers says, “#Bitcoin will 200x from here.” “Bitcoin is going after a $400-500 trillion market, and it’s only $2 trillion.” pic.twitter.com/urpR8HelFO — Maestro (@GoMaestroOrg) September 16, 2025 Reports have disclosed that since April, Twenty One Capital has acquired 43,514 BTC, a haul worth roughly $5 billion at current prices. The firm has backing from players such as Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank, and it plans to merge with SPAC Cantor Equity Partners to pursue a public listing. Mallers’ team has been buying aggressively, and the stash already exceeded the firm’s initial target by about 1,500 BTC. Several high-profile figures have also made bullish calls, and their forecasts are often cited alongside Mallers’ views. According to public remarks, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has suggested Bitcoin could reach $700,000. Anthony Scaramucci of SkyBridge has said he expects Bitcoin to hit about $200,000 by the end of 2025. Bill Barhydt, CEO of Abra Global, has outlined a base-case of $350,000 and a more aggressive scenario as high as $700,000. These estimates differ in timing and method, but they share a common theme: large upside is possible if demand and adoption keep rising. Based on reports, Mallers’ firm is joining a larger group of companies that hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Michael Saylor’s Strategy has accumulated 638,985 BTC — a figure that dwarfs most other corporate treasuries and is valued near $74 billion. Mining companies such as MARA Holdings hold about 52,477 BTC. One important contrast is funding approach: Strategy leaned on debt to build its position, while Twenty One Capital has avoided that route so far.

A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Tether, Tokenization Pioneers Unveil STBL Protocol Splitting Principal From Yield
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/09/18/tether-tokenization-pioneers-unveil-startup-focused-on-genius-aligned-digital-dollars
Time Published: 2025-09-18T10:21:38Z
Full Content:
Traditional finance has long had a way of splitting capital from coupons, allowing investors to separate interest-payment flows from the principal. Now, a team of stablecoin and blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) pioneers is doing the same for tokenized assets. A new startup, STBL, emulates TradFi's zero-coupon strip structures by converting digital assets into a dollar-pegged stablecoin and yield-bearing non-fungible token (NFT). Just as with the traditional equivalent, the components can be held separately, allowing investors to keep the part that appeals to them and sell the other bit to counterparties with different attitudes to risk. The product, currently in beta testing, goes beyond just packaging risk into different tranches. It also widens the stablecoin issuance model. With regular stablecoins, like USDT, the issuing company, in this case Tether, keeps the returns on the Treasuries they hold to maintain the token's peg to the dollar. It's profitable business, Tether reported $4.9 billion net profit in the second quarter. With STBL, whoever deposits a tokenized asset into the system becomes the minter and keeps the returns. “Our mission at STBL is to evolve stablecoins from corporate products into public infrastructure,” said STBL co-founder Reeve Collins, who was also a cofounder of Tether. “For the first time, minters, not issuers, retain the value of reserves. This is the defining shift of Stablecoin 2.0: money that is stable, compliant, and built to serve the community.” When a yield-bearing on-chain asset — this could be any yield-bearing RWA, such as Franklin Templeton’s BENJI, BlackRock’s BUIDL or Ondo’s USDY — is deposited and locked into the STBL protocol, it splits into a stablecoin (USST) that can circulate and serve as collateral or reserves in decentralized finance (DeFi) and a separate, yield-accruing non-fungible token (NFT) called YLD. The design is intended to remain a non-security in spirit and align with the U.S. GENIUS Act and other regulatory frameworks by separating principal from yield, said CEO Avtar Sehra, who is also a co-founder of the project and was CEO and founder of Kaio (formerly Libre Capital). “When a user who’s already whitelisted with a Franklin Templeton or BlackRock fund locks that asset into STBL, they receive an NFT that controls the vault,” Sehra said in an interview. “You hold the NFT and accrue interest, while the stable asset can be used as collateral, as reserves, or to mint an ecosystem-specific stablecoin aligned with GENIUS Act requirements.” In the year or so before STBL started up, Sehra and Collins were looking at how RWAs or tokenized securities could be used in DeFi; asking how they worked as collateral; how money market funds became the reserves for minting stablecoins, and so on. There had been a view that wrapping an asset, that is taking a tokenized security and placing it into a vault, meant the asset no longer counted as a security as far as U.S. regulations were concerned. But it's not clear that wrapping something "deviates from or extracts the security-like essence" of the asset, Sehra said. To ensure the USST stablecoin component isn't viewed as a security required a mechanism to maintain the dollar peg. This is achieved by ensuring it is slightly over collateralized coupled with an incentive system related to mint fees and burn credits should deviation happen in a volatile market. Sehra referred to STBL's peg-maintenance system as “synthetic” rather than “algorithmic.” “The reason I call it a synthetic is because, even though it has this interest-rate algorithmic component to it, it is 103% over collateralized with pure money market assets,” he said. “As a result of this novel structure, eligible participants that hold permitted RWAs can mint and burn compliant stablecoins. So while minters can hold the yield, the stable asset can be openly used without breaking the non-yield bearing requirements of the GENIUS Act. That's exactly how STBL operates.” The protocol’s decentralized governance token, also called STBL, has been added to Binance Alpha, Binance Futures and Kraken Spot, and will list on other spot exchanges soon, Sehra said. The Sept. 16 debut of the STBL governance token has been lauded as one of the most successful token generating events of 2025, Sehra added. It launched at $100 million fully diluted value, and demand pushed it over $1 billion. It is currently at $1.3 billion, having hit an all time high of about $2.3 billion within 24 hours. The next steps involve a $100 million minting using Franklin Templeton’s BENJI token, Sehra said, and also the announcement of several other partnerships, including with a U.S. based payments firm. The protocol is due to open to the public in the fourth quarter.UPDATE (Sept. 19, 11:46 UTC): Rewrites headline to remove ambiguity.

Title: K.M., the power brokers, the KasseloNikolakis clan and the Piri Reis, drought in Athens (right before elections?), Blackrock and its interest in PPC and Hellenic Railways

Hello, Mitsotakis was very careful yesterday in his first interview after the Thessaloniki International Fair on Antenna (with Hatzinikolaou). He dropped the line, for good measure, that it is the people who elect the prime minister and not the power brokers, but I would say he should rather be hoping that… the power brokers do the electing. Because that seems to be the only sure way for him to get re-elected, since these so-called brokers have an unfailing instinct for making the wrong choice! Since 2023 we’ve seen the “ready-made Nikos,” then Kasselakis, now Tsipras stepping down and Dendias stepping in; generally, necessity becomes virtue. I noted carefully that he said nothing about Karamanlis and Samaras, because as we said yesterday…softly, quietly, as they say. KYSEA – Piri Reis M.M. didn’t much like the warlike tone of the leaks about the joint forces exercise of the Armed Forces, which started, as usual, without prior notice, and was linked to the Piri Reis, which still hasn’t left the port of Smyrna. And he especially didn’t like it because it set a harsh tone ahead of the Mitsotakis–Erdogan meeting next week in New York. That meeting seems to be one of the most critical of this period, since it doesn’t have a concrete “deliverable,” unlike other encounters. It remains to be seen whether it will extend (a little) the calm waters, or mark the start of a new escalation phase. A different tone Of course, just before Dendias left M.M. and delivered the quip about how old the Piri Reis is, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Lana Zochiou, who was briefing diplomatic correspondents, was adopting the diplomatic language: “we are monitoring the issue closely” and “Greece safeguards its sovereign rights.” In short, (once again) a different climate between Vasilissis Sofias Avenue and the Pentagon… Let me note two things: first, these little vessels like the Piri Reis were never aircraft carriers for us to fear them, but we all know what their real job is. And second, be careful not to get burned during the warm-up. Ideas about Libya I understand that in yesterday’s KYSEA discussion, when the issue of flows from Libya toward Crete was being analyzed, Plevris among other things said that the scenario of a more dynamic show of force at sea should be evaluated, if arrivals continue. The central idea is that the images of dinghies arriving in Gavdos and Chania are not flattering, so the government may revise its strategy. No decision was taken, and of course it’s not an easy one. Let me also tell you that the minister responsible for the Coast Guard, Vassilis Kikilias, was absent from yesterday’s session due to a scheduled trip abroad. Gerapetritis and the “blue” MPs Around 17:30 yesterday, a friend of mine saw a lot of movement and many cars at New Democracy’s headquarters on Piraeus Street. I asked and found out that Foreign Minister Giorgos Gerapetritis had called, in coordination with ND’s general director Giannis Smyrlis, the ND MPs who sit on the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. Participation was almost universal, with 1–2 justified absences, and the discussion lasted more than two hours covering everything. Greek–Turkish relations and Turkey’s broader role, Libya after the announcement of resuming EEZ talks with Tripoli, energy issues, the situation in the Middle East, and the role of the U.S. were all on the table. I’m told the conversation took place in a good climate. After all, if there’s one thing that can be credited to Gerapetritis, it’s that he regularly briefs the parties and, in this case, ND’s MPs. Drought – nightmare – elections Let’s leave current affairs aside now for an issue that, as it unfolds, if not properly assessed and addressed in the next 12–18 months, will explode in the government’s hands, right in the middle of the election period. This is the drought, mainly in the capital. Even with the most optimistic estimates and forecasts—meaning, if it rains or snows more than it did this year and last year—we will just barely make it through 2026, but not 2027. According to experts, the problem is dire. The government has held some talks about whether PPC should take over municipal water companies (or share responsibility), but beyond this the major issue is Athens itself. Immediate solutions are needed there, because as I’m told, they won’t know what to do. Water rationing in Athens in 2026—or 2027? Blackrock and PPC and Athens Airport Let’s leave behind the unpleasant and move on to the pleasant, which are business-related, though they may not materialize, since we’re talking about multibillion-euro deals — and such deals are never easy. So, during these days when Blackrock representatives were in Athens and met with many key officials, they expressed serious investment interest in both PPC (Public Power Corporation) and Athens International Airport “Eleftherios Venizelos.” I find both prospects difficult, not least because they’re not strictly government matters, but still, note the strong interest of a powerful investment organization like Blackrock, which maintains excellent relations with the Trump system in the U.S. The businessmen who go to Dubai for… stem cells And since Piri Reis, drought, Blackrock, etc. are heavy topics, let me switch to something lighter. The entire social scene of Athens, along with certain well-known businessmen, has recently been traveling feverishly to Dubai. Not to enjoy the luxuries the Arab destination has to offer, but because in Dubai they administer stem cell treatments freely, without much procedure or bureaucracy. Stem cell therapies are said to rejuvenate the body and, in any case, are believed to help with everything from baldness and cataracts to osteoporosis and diabetes. Gossip has it that, from the business world, the most frequent travelers to Dubai for stem cell treatments are two prominent and successful businessmen, both residents of the southern suburbs, both known from time to time for their fondness for the opposite sex, and who happen to have very (very) young wives. One is highly successful in the shipping sector and impresses with how well he maintains himself past seventy. The other, nearing seventy, is very successful in commerce and retail, although his company’s stock performance has disappointed shareholders. The U.S. Interior Secretary, Elefsina, and the Great Port The visit of U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum to Greece last week — the first official visit by a member of the new Trump administration to our country — continues to leave ripples. Beyond the official announcements and smiling photo ops, there was also a hidden agenda behind closed doors. Because, as Konstantinos Karamanlis used to say, “there are things that are said but not done, and things that are not said but are done.” Moving on. In small meetings, I hear the American Secretary put on the table the issue of the Port of Piraeus and the Chinese company Cosco. This matter has been simmering for some time, and Doug brought it to the attention of the relevant authorities. I hear the Americans are looking for alternative solutions in logistics and supply chains. It may not be a coincidence that, as we recently reported, the U.S. state development bank DFC, which has already approved a €125 million fund for investments in those shipyards, will also be putting more money into further developing Elefsina. In light of the new perspective on Piraeus, the Americans’ aim through DFC is to make Elefsina a hub supporting shipping, the energy transition through cutting-edge technologies, the allied fleet, and the development of strategic logistics for commercial shipping, defense, and energy. The new Executive Chairman at PPA By the way, I hear from my sources that if not today, then in the coming days, the new Executive Chairman at PPA (Piraeus Port Authority) will be announced. He is already in Greece and intends to sort out outstanding issues at a peculiar time for the port and Cosco, with the Americans lying in wait. I’m also told that the contractually mandated investments have been delayed, and that may well become the next episode in U.S.–China relations. We’ll see. The “renaissance” of Stadiou Street brings Primark The large property on Stadiou Street — once home to the Fokas department store and later earmarked by Brown for conversion into a hotel — has apparently become a “bone of contention.” According to a fashion industry entrepreneur, the Israeli group backed out, leading e-EFKA to plan a restart of the leasing process. Since a hotel-use permit was ultimately not granted for the building, it is considered certain that the potential buyer will come from the broader clothing–fashion sector. This aligns with the “renaissance” of the area (starting from the beginning of Stadiou Street), with the upcoming opening of the Food Center/Arsakeio expected in early December, and the full renovation of Alpha Bank’s buildings (towards Klafthmonos Square) — developments that have not gone unnoticed by entrepreneurs. The same goes for 2–3 foreign brands investing in promoting Athens as a city-break destination and looking for buildings and facilities in the area. Indeed, according to the same entrepreneur, the well-known retail chain Primark has shown investment interest in entering the Greek market, specifically in central Athens (Syntagma–Omonia). The “clouds” and rebranding for Vardas The historic clothing company Vardas is facing a… barrage of foreclosures. Just yesterday, Wednesday, three auctions for company properties (offices, shops) in Pikermi, Chalandri, Kantza, and Thessaloniki were posted on the electronic platform. These auctions, initiated by private creditors (not banks or servicers), are scheduled for October 1 and 30, though they may be suspended before then. More broadly, the emblematic company, active since the late 1930s, is burdened with serious financial problems, like much of the sector due to successive crises. It should be noted that the foreclosures target General Clothing Construction S.A., which is in “liquidation,” with long-time head Theodoros Vardas as liquidator. According to its 2023 financial statements, the company had accumulated losses of €17.13 million, negative equity, and total liabilities of €46.8 million. It “faces liquidity problems and has overdue obligations to the State, which have been restructured and are being paid in installments totaling €1.36 million, while it has exhausted borrowing options since it is heavily indebted, under new agreements, but is not servicing that debt.” Moreover, on September 9, 2024, the company was served with a European Payment Order from the Wedding District Court in Berlin, Germany. “Following this, the company’s bank accounts were frozen and all staff dismissed. Despite this, management intends to continue operations through consignment sales via third parties,” it is stated. At the same time, however, the historic brand recently unveiled new signs as part of its own rebranding and continues to maintain a presence in the market under the name Varda, essentially through N & T Vardas IKE, run by the next generation — Theodoros Vardas’ daughters, Natalia and Tatiana. The company has 12 stores and an e-shop, and reports positive financial results with rising turnover and profits. 110 analysts and fund managers More than 110 analysts and fund managers — a record number, apparently — participated yesterday in an investor call for GEK TERNA’s new bond. It will have a 7-year maturity and is expected to offer an interest rate slightly above 3% (while today Greece’s 7-year sovereign bond yields 2.9%). The company aims to raise €350–500 million, with the public offering starting on Monday, September 23, and the bond scheduled to trade on the Athens Exchange on September 30. The bonds, with a nominal value of €1,000 each, will be covered 30% by retail investors. G. Gouroukos and the €1 million house in “the Village” A friend who was in Kimolos a few days ago overheard a conversation about shipowner Giorgos Gouroukos. According to what he told me, G.Y. bought a large house — a mansion, really — in Chorio. When I asked what the village was called, my friend explained that Kimolos is the only Cycladic island where the Chora (the capital) is referred to as Chorio (“village”). The price is said to have exceeded €1 million. The shipowner appears to have fallen in love with the island. He immediately made socially-minded donations, covering the costs for the restoration of parts of the main school building, while also donating all the air conditioners. I was also told he reached out to the Afentakeio Foundation of Kimolos, which is soon expected to open a Day Care Center for the Elderly. Aegean: The Israelis and cash flow One of Eftichis Vassilakis’ remarks stood out at the close of yesterday’s Aegean conference call with analysts. After stressing that he remains cautiously optimistic about performance in the coming quarters, he focused on the airline’s cash flows. The reference was clear, as Aegean’s stock came under pressure yesterday (closing down 2.84%) because some investors gave more weight to operating performance (flat sales year-on-year, EBITDA -2% annually), which was affected by competition (capacity increase by a significant number of airlines flying to Greece) and the crisis in the Middle East (suspension of flights to Israel, Lebanon, and Jordan in May–June), rather than the net result, which rose 24% year-on-year — mainly due to €22 million in FX gains from the euro’s appreciation against the dollar and lower fuel prices. It should be noted that according to results, net operating cash inflows amounted to €253 million at the end of June, while excluding lease liabilities, the group showed net cash reserves of €424 million at the end of June, up from €385 million at the end of 2024. The key point, however, is that Aegean has ahead of it the traditionally very strong third quarter, which — besides the strengthening euro and low fuel prices — includes peak summer season and, of course, the routes to Tel Aviv, Beirut, Amman, and Erbil, which were gradually restored from mid-July onward after being suspended in Q2 due to events in the region. To give an idea of scale, the airline’s CEO mentioned that Aegean had nine daily flights to that region, plus various connections from Athens to other destinations, all of which were lost during the suspension. Despite the difficulties, Aegean managed revenue growth above the market average in Q2 and now faces what looks like a strong Q3. Demand remains at satisfactory levels, with load factors at 85% in July–August, while average revenue per flight is expected to be only marginally lower in Q3. In this context, NBG Securities maintained its €19.20 price target for Aegean shares with an “outperform” recommendation — about 40% above current levels. Investments in port infrastructure – Priority on Alexandroupolis The newly established Hellenic Innovation & Infrastructure Fund (HIIF), which will act as the investment arm of the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP), has the advantage of enabling the government to push forward major projects implemented by market players and institutions. According to reliable sources, HIIF’s first major move will be in port infrastructure, especially the Port of Alexandroupolis, which seems to be heading towards a major Hub tender. This means the tender will not only include investments in the port but also in the airport and land for logistics. With initial capital of €303 million, HIIF aims to mobilize a total of €1 billion in investments. Why Credia Bank’s stock slipped The Malta Stock Exchange (MSE), headquartered in Valletta at the “Garrison Chapel” in Castille Place, saw HSBC Malta shares fall to an 18-month low of €1.31, as some expected 70% of the bank to be sold for €300 million. The fall of the Maltese bank does not explain yesterday’s sharp drop (-7.64%) in CrediaBank, which had actually managed to pay €200 million for that 70% stake in HSBC Malta. Additionally, Hellenic Bank’s stock is highly concentrated: 57.6% of its share capital is controlled by Thrivest and 36.16% by the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF). Since these two shareholders (93.7%) have no reason to sell and are not generally active in the market at present, yesterday’s decline likely had very short-term goals. After all, CrediaBank’s stock has gained +102% in the past quarter and +128% since the start of the year. TITAN is not doing well It could be due to the sharp slide in the dollar exchange rate (€1 = $1.1850). Or investors’ displeasure at a €75 million net profit loss from the sale of its Turkish subsidiary. Or the unfavorable international geopolitical environment. The fact remains: since February 10, when TITAN’s share hit a high of €45.8, things have worsened. On April 7 (“Black Monday” for markets), the stock plummeted to €35.6, later climbed back to €42.3 on May 28 when it cut a €3/share dividend, but never recovered — now hovering at €36.5. Meanwhile, on the derivatives market, more than 400 contracts are giving an additional discount of about 1% or more. Operating profits for H1 rose slightly (+2%), but group net profits fell sharply due to the loss from selling Adocim in Turkey, higher depreciation, and increased minority rights (Titan America). TITAN has slipped to 14th place on the Athens Stock Exchange in terms of market capitalization (€2.8 billion). A lesson in hesitation and insecurity A sudden order to buy 2.6 million Alpha Bank shares appeared at the end of yesterday’s session and then…disappeared from the terminals within seconds. This is indicative of the mood that prevailed yesterday at the Athens Stock Exchange. Tomorrow marks a triple witching day in the Derivatives Market (September triple witching — futures and options on indices and stocks expire simultaneously). With a lack of strong buying interest from abroad, the market is focused on short-term tactical moves and covering basic needs. Trading activity was high, at €245 million, of which €47 million were pre-agreed block trades. The General Index held the 2,020-point level, closing at -0.67%, but during the session it had alarmed the market with a drop of -1.17%, below 2,010 points. At the close, no banking stock was in positive territory, while among large-cap stocks notable declines included: Aegean -2.84% to €13.7, Ellaktor -1.96%, PPC -1.27% to €14, Elvalhalcor -1.25% to €2.76, Jumbo -1.08% to €31.4, and OPAP -0.97% to €19.48. Metlen reacted with gains of +0.60% to €52.7. The burden of private debt weighs on the Trump administration The U.S. federal debt exceeds $37 trillion. Household debt, however, has reached a record $18.7 trillion. This means that each adult in the U.S. owes about $63,000. Official data show that consumer loans surged by $16 billion in July, reaching $5.06 trillion. Over the past five months, consumer credit has increased by $103 billion. Revolving debt (credit cards) rose by $10 billion to $1.31 trillion, the highest since November 2024. Non-revolving credit, which includes auto loans and student loans, rose by $6 billion, reaching a record $3.75 trillion. The proportion of loans more than 90 days past due is increasing, especially in credit card and student loan debt. Notably, 10.2% of total student debt is over 90 days delinquent, based on Q2 2025 data. Explore related questions

Title: Why It’s Hard for Activists and Blockholders to Make a Difference in Banking

Full Content:
Activist investors and blockholders are unable to restructure and turnaround poorly performing banks, making it unlikely that they can enhance bank performance and contribute to financial stability. We argue that regulation and supervision hinder the flow of information needed to price risk effectively and as a result weaken the incentive and ability of activists and blockholders to turnaround poorly performing banks. We identify bank opacity due to regulation and supervision as the main cause of weak market discipline by banks (see Mehran and Spatt, 2024).[1] In a previous post, we noted that the regulatory environment in banking interferes with information production as disclosure of some information may be perceived by regulators as potentially causing bank runs. Weak market discipline due to regulation and supervision fuels the control market in bank restructuring, thus leading to larger institutions. In this post, we draw on examples of large investors in the banking industry. In 1989, American businessman Laurence Tisch and his family acquired 8.9 percent of the Bank of Boston. In 1990, they made further disclosures of large investments in Continental Bank, Baybank, and Equimark. Each of these institutions had lost nearly 70 percent of its value following the savings and loan (S&L) crisis.[2] The share acquisitions by the Tisch family were the largest percentage investment in large, regional banks by individual investors and institutions at the time. The media reported in 1991 that the family reduced its investments in two of the banks,[3] selling the investments at a loss. The Tisch family was not the only sophisticated investor to incur losses investing in bank stocks during a crisis. American hedge fund manager Bill Ackman invested about $1 billion in Citigroup for his firm, Pershing Square, following the 2007–2009 financial crisis. He concluded that Citigroup had already written down its bad loans and thus the bank’s stock price might be fair or even undervalued. Yet, the investment produced a loss of $400 million (see Partnoy and Eisinger, 2013).[4] The Tisch and Ackman losses were not exceptions.[5] Investments in bank assets during crises are often underperforming (see Baron et al., 2021).[6] Bank charter value can dissipate when banks are in difficulty, even outside a crisis. Surprisingly, quickly restoring value even by a capital infusion or by changing the bank’s management is not easy. (The demise of the New York Community Bank provides a recent example.) Once risk is priced and opacity is partly removed, even government protection is not likely to bring back a bank’s lost charter value (at least in the short term). Equally important is that news of large, sophisticated investments in banks often has a muted price impact. While blockholders have invested in weak banks, their presence is uncommon, and their impact is inconsequential. This is contrary to the view that, to protect their stake, large investors could be effective monitors and might exert pressure on management in poorly performing firms and influence firm corporate policies (see Shleifer and Vishny, 1986).[7] Yet, investors have little influence on corporate restructuring and other bank policies, particularly during a crisis period. The focus of corporate restructuring is often about assets, capital structure, and labor, approaches which are not mutually exclusive. Any change in these methods, particularly in acquisition and disposition of assets, takes time and could require regulatory approval (see Adams and Mehran, 2003).[8] Potential acquirers are likely to opt out if they think that they might face regulatory opposition on quick asset restructuring. Blockholders also are less willing to invest in a share of a bank if they cannot get a fair assessment of the value of the company. The loss-sharing agreement of failed banks between acquirers and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) supports this argument (see Bennett and Unal, 2014).[9] Bank valuation is hardly accurate as risk often is not effectively priced. Remaining unclear is whether regulators are aware of bank weak spots and, if they are, whether they would undertake corrective actions [see (Gallemore, 2016)[10] and (Mehran and Spatt, 2024)[11]]. Thus, the nature of bank assets and the role of regulation and supervision imply that very few blockholders invest in banks and attempt to turn around banking firms while they are in difficulty. The implication is that market discipline in banks would not benefit from the presence of sophisticated activist investors, unlike for non-financial companies (see Haubrich and Thomson, 1998).[12] Another regulatory hurdle might seem to weaken the ability of blockholders and activist investors to control the banking firm’s operation. The reason was noted in the Tisch family disclosure: The purpose behind acquiring a large block of shares in the banks was purely for investment and not for control. The statement of purpose for investment was intentional as the banking rule at the time prohibited investments of more than 5 percent if the intent were to control the bank. Also, blockholders were required to contact the Federal Reserve Board for any additional investments beyond 5 percent. Investment beyond 5 percent with control intent effectively invites supervision of the investors by the Federal Reserve. Allowing regulators to examine investors’ financial data and being subject to supervision arguably is a big deterrent to becoming a large blockholder in a bank, particularly when it might be difficult to prove the intent as discussed later. The cutoff, while set arbitrarily, was intended to ensure the stability of bank operations in the presence of activist investors. Ensuring operational stability and preventing potential abuse through ownership control is also an issue in other settings, as when thrift institutions convert from mutual to stock ownership (see Cole and Mehran, 1998).[13] Thus, blockholders’ ability and incentive to pressure management is limited, and the reward from doing so might be insufficient partly due to the banking rule on control. The 5 percent cutoff could be considered small, if investors’ desire to redirect the bank’s strategic direction or force out the management team. The Federal Reserve Board changed the cutoff to 10 percent on January 30, 2020.[14] The objective was to improve the flow of investment in bank equity and thus enhance banking firms’ capital. In the same spirit, following the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC allowed private equity firms to invest in equity of distressed banks (see Ross, et al., 2021).[15] Overall, which group of banks, large versus small, is most likely to be affected by the control rule, if at all, is unclear. To study the market assessment of lifting the ownership cutoff to 10 percent, we conducted an event study. An announcement effect was estimated for listed banks from March 29 to March 30, 2020. Five groups were created based on bank book-asset size at the end of the last quarter of 2019, and announcement returns were calculated for banks in each group. If weaker banks were insulated from market discipline, lifting the control threshold to 10 percent would make it easier for activists to influence governance of banks, and the gain would likely to be captured in equity prices. The announcement effect for the three groups with the largest book-assets is significant and positive, while banks in the two small asset groups suffered losses. Explaining the findings is difficult, particularly in the case of small banks. If the rise in the cutoff would have increased the likelihood of acquisition of small banks, then their stock price should have increased due to the present value of the acquisition premium. The loss then could be the result of interference on bank operations by future activist investors. The gain to large banks is likely due to potential merger and acquisitions and new investments in bank equity. Although there are reports of block acquisitions in small and community banks since the 2020 relaxation of the control role, there is little evidence of significant share acquisitions of large banks. Also, while 217 instances of activism were reported between 2019 and 2024, only a few large institutions were a target, such as Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, and State Street. Bank of America agreed to some minor changes in its governance. The other institutions are in effect custodians with very little commercial banking activities, and they agreed to some cost cutting (see for example, Benoit, 2014).[16] Activist investors have little influence in large banks in Europe as well (see Sweney and Makortoff, 2021).[17] Overall, most activist investors have targeted small and community banks (see Graf, 2023).[18] As expected, most of the demands of activist investors are for changes in governance rather than operations of banks (see Graf and Clark, 2024).[19] Thus, in light of the influence of regulators and supervisors on bank governance, the potential impact of activist investors on bank performance and stability is likely limited. This is not the case for activist investors in non-financial firms (see Gow, et al. (2023).[20] Thus, activist investors in banking probably are just as uninformed about their ability to influence bank governance as they are about the potential for windfall gains in distressed bank stocks, at least in the short term. The takeaway is that regulation and supervision are the most likely reasons that large investors are unable to influence bank operations. Institutional investors hold most of banks’ equity, and the trend is continuing. For example, at the end of 2024, institutions held about 76 percent of the shares of large banks in the U.S., and the percentage is higher for the largest commercial banks. Among the largest holders are BlackRock and Vanguard, which hold large blocks of shares in major banks, such as JPMorgan Chase. Vanguard held 9.74 percent, and BlackRock 6.89 percent at the end of 2024, according to a 2025 proxy filing with SEC. Both institutions held more than the control threshold of 5 percent in the bank at the end of 2019. While below the 10 percent threshold, these holdings raised concerns among regulators about the potential influence of large institutional investors to control and thus direct bank governance in ways that might be anticompetitive or even adversely affect the goal of financial stability. The FDIC, for example, reached an agreement with Vanguard on investment passivity last year.[21] The consequences of high institutional ownership on bank conduct are complex. Institutional ownership induces common ownership. While common ownership is considered very large in the banking industry, there is no evidence that it is anticompetitive (see Gramlich and Grundl, 2020).[22] Further, the evidence suggesting that institutional holdings induce anticompetitive behavior outside the financial industry is inconclusive (see Gerardi, et al., 2023).[23] Thus, much more work on the topic in the banking sector might be needed to draw public policy lessons. For example, common ownership has been shown to prompt more disclosure by non-financial firms (see Park et al., 2019).[24] But, it is unlikely to enhance more disclosure by banking firms for a number of reasons: presence of a significant amount of soft information in banks, proprietary nature of borrower information (see Bhattacharya-Chiesa, 1995),[25] risk sharing (see Dang et al., 2025),[26] and reluctance of banks to disclose any information without knowing how it would be perceived by supervisors and regulators. A potential area of financial stability concerns that has not received attention by regulators and academics is concentration of holdings of bank credit by institutional investors (see Mehran and Mollineaux, 2012).[27] How institutions would manage their bank credit holdings is an important financial stability issue, particularly in a crisis period. To our knowledge, this issue has not been studied by regulators. To underscore the benefit of effective banking activism on financial stability, we also focus on banks rather than investors. Due to weak economic conditions in New England following the S&L crisis, the Bank of Boston (established in 1784) and Baybank were forced to merge in 1996 to operate more effectively. The new entity, BankBoston, was acquired in 1999 by FleetBoston Financial. That, too, was absorbed, by Bank of America in 1999, an entity that exists today due to the financial protection of the U.S. taxpayers because of its size. Thus, when activism does not exist or has little impact in the banking industry, particularly in a crisis period, the control market could function as a substitute. However, the control market produces bigger institutions with larger supervisory challenges, a result that is also favored by regulators and supervisors as it transfers the assets of weaker institutions to stronger banks, thus lowering potential cost of the FDIC fund in the short term (see Prescott (2024) for an example).[28] However, larger institutions impose a higher cost on the economy in the event of their failure. Thus, fostering effective activism could reduce the extreme events that increasingly seem routine. Regulation and supervision have weakened the influence of activist investors and blockholders on bank governance and conduct as well as on financial stability. Further, no evidence yet exists that an increase in the permitted level of block ownership from 5 percent to 10 percent has had any measurable impact on bank conduct. While more activism has been evident in the past five years, instances were not likely to be related to changes in 2020 control ownership, as a similar trend existed outside financial firms. Moreover, increased activism in the banking sector was mostly targeted at smaller institutions and with no clear evidence of having made banks more valuable or healthier. Arguably, activism and block ownership are critical to the functioning of the U.S. capital market and businesses. But bank supervision and regulation have made these tactics ineffective. More disclosure and more timely disclosure by regulators could lift the imposed opacity and could make activism more vibrant (see Mehran and Spatt, 2024). This post comes to us from Hamid Mehran, a financial economist, and Chester Spatt, the Pamela R. and Kenneth B. Dunn Professor of Finance at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Media startup Minute Media, backed by BlackRock BLK and Goldman Sachs GS is betting big on that trend with its Sept. 9 acquisition of VideoVerse, an Indian AI company valued between $200 million and $250 million. The deal gives Minute Media, owner of sports content brands The Players' Tribune, Sports Illustrated, and 90 Minutes, access to technology that automatically extracts highlights and builds content packages from live sports footage. According to TechCrunch, VideoVerse's platform already works with the Indian Premier League, Women's Premier League Cricket, FIFA+, Nippon TV, and Cubber TV. Don't Miss: Founded in Mumbai in 2016 by Vinayak Shrivastav, VideoVerse initially built AI tools for industries outside sports. One early product flagged smoking and drinking scenes for India's film certification board, while another identified objects for e-commerce platforms. Shrivastav said that the turning point came in 2016 when Hotstar, now owned by Jio, sought solutions to detect action points in cricket matches. "In 2016, Hotstar [which is now owned by Jio] was growing, and they were looking for a solution that could identify certain action points in sports and primarily in cricket," Shrivastav told TechCrunch. Over time, the company abandoned its other projects and focused entirely on AI tools for sports broadcasters. VideoVerse now operates as a software-as-a-service platform, charging clients based on the hours of footage processed. Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share. The company has grown to $65 million in revenue with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization margins between 35% and 40%, according to TechCrunch. VideoVerse Chief Strategy Officer Prateek Sharma told TechCrunch that the company has launched new AI tools that enable clients to define custom highlight rules. For example, a broadcaster can create automated clips of every three-pointer made by a specific player in a basketball game and instantly publish them to social media, TechCrunch reported. The platform also added AI-powered translation features to help leagues and broadcasters expand global fan engagement. While some processes incorporate third-party models, Sharma said VideoVerse relies on its proprietary model to identify the most important moments in matches. See Also: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years — This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It Minute Media CEO Asaf Peled told TechCrunch that the acquisition is the largest in the company's history in terms of both size and value. Minute Media has raised $260 million, reaches more than 200 million monthly users, and supports nearly 500 publishers through its business-to-business content distribution platform. "With the VideoVerse acquisition, we can go to customers and pitch the AI suite, which is helpful for content creation. Then we can add our distribution and monetization capabilities on top of it to get more value out of the content," Peled said. Peled added that the company wants to target U.S.-based leagues with VideoVerse's tools to meet rising demand for highlight-driven mobile sports coverage. Reports, like an IBM study, indicate that sports fans are consuming games differently. While the company is not currently raising capital, Peled said it may look to secure additional funding in the coming quarters to pursue further acquisitions.

This topped the rumored numbers when word leaked in July that Groq was raising. At that time, reports suggested that the raise would be about $600 million, at near a $6 billion valuation. Groq, which also sells data center computing power, previously raised $640 million at a $2.8 billion valuation in August 2024, making this more than double the valuation in about a year. Groq has now raised over $3 billion to date, PitchBook estimates. Groq has been a hot commodity because it is working on breaking the chokehold that AI chip maker Nvidia has over the tech industry. Groq’s chips are not GPUs, the graphics processing units that typically power AI systems. Instead, Groq calls them LPUs, (language processing units) and calls its hardware an inference engine — specialized computers optimized for running AI models quickly and efficiently. Its products are geared toward developers and enterprises, available as either a cloud service or an on-premises hardware cluster. The on-prem hardware is a server rack outfitted with a stack of its integrated hardware/software nodes. Both the cloud and on-prem hardware run open versions of popular models, like those from Meta, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral, Google and OpenAI. Groq says its offerings maintain, or in some cases improve, AI performance at significantly less cost than alternatives. Groq’s founder, Jonathan Ross, has a particularly relevant pedigree for this work. Ross previously worked at Google developing its Tensor Processing Unit chip, which are specialized processors designed for machine learning tasks. The TPU was announced in 2016, the same year Groq emerged from stealth. TPUs still power Google Cloud’s AI services. Groq says it now powers the AI apps of more than 2 million developers, up from 356,000 developers when the company talked to TechCrunch a year ago. The new round was led by investment firm Disruptive, with additional funding from BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, and others.

Title: UK shows Trump how much they need ‘special relationship’ with US

The British monarchy cranked up the pageantry for President Trump Wednesday, paying tribute to the “Special Relationship” between the US and UK at its most fraught point in more than half a century. On the first full day of Trump’s unprecedented second state visit across the pond, he and first lady Melania Trump got the royal treatment in the form of a personal greeting from King Charles III; Queen Camilla; Prince William, the heir to the throne; and Catherine, Princess of Wales — followed by the largest military ceremonial welcome ever. From a carriage procession to a 200-piece military band and an extravagant banquet in 11th century Windsor Castle, Wednesday’s agenda seemed tailor-made to please Trump, a well-known admirer of both the British royals and pomp and circumstance. “A lot of things here warm my heart,” President Trump told reporters after landing in London on Tuesday, describing King Charles, who is undergoing cancer treatment, as “my friend.” Forgotten, at least for one day, was recent sparring between Washington and London over trade relations, free speech, Big Tech, how to deal with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the response to Israel’s invasion of Gaza to destroy Hamas. Morning Report delivers the latest news, videos, photos and more. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. But reality will be waiting when Trump holds a closely watched bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the latter’s country residence, Chequers, on Thursday. The presidential visit is the climax of a charm offensive begun seven months ago, when Starmer presented Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to the UK at a time when the alliance seemed strained over the war in Ukraine. Since then, Starmer has been further damaged by controversy over immigration and political scandal, having fired Ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson just last week following the emergence of embassaing emails between the envoy and late convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Top of the agenda will be economic relations, after a proposed agreement to eliminate tariffs on British steel exports to the US was put on hold hours before Air Force One touched down at Stansted Airport. Wednesday’s state banquet invitees included the CEOs of British economic mainstays Rolls-Royce, BAE and GSK, along with American executives Tim Cook of Apple and Larry Fink of BlackRock, highlighting again the important business ties between the two countries ahead of the crunch talks. The UK hopes to secure deals worth more than $10 billion during Trump’s two-day visit, but may have to swallow some scoldings in exchange. Both Trump and Vice President JD Vance have attacked British laws on free speech grounds, slamming the UK’s Online Safety Act and warning publicly that freedom in Europe is “in retreat.” “If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you,” Vance told a room of stunned diplomats at the Munich Security Conference in February. In recent weeks, the UK has seen fresh protests, with more than 100,000 joining a weekend anti-immigrant “Unite the Kingdom” rally in London, at which Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk appeared via video link to call for Starmer’s ouster. “You can’t – we don’t have another four years, or whenever the next election is, it’s too long. Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of Parliament and a new vote held,” Musk said, warning that the British public are “scared to exercise their free speech” today. “You’re in a fundamental situation here. Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth I think.” Advertisement

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, a newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Ben Kamisar breaks down the split among prominent New York Democrats on Zohran Mamdani, seven weeks out from the mayoral election. Plus, Andrea Mitchell examines how Britain laid out the red carpet (and more) for President Donald Trump. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Zohran Mamdani scored endorsements this week from key members of the New York Democratic establishment in his bid for mayor, but he’s still waiting on two of the biggest names from his city. Gov. Kathy Hochul and state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie announced their support for Mamdani in recent days, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — both New York Democrats — are continuing to keep some distance from the democratic socialist. The split shows how the Democratic Party’s leaders haven’t fully settled on how much to embrace the energy bubbling up among progressives in New York City and elsewhere, after Mamdani scored an upset victory in the June primary. Mamdani’s newfound backers have in part framed their support as a sign of the party coming together. In a New York Times op-ed, Hochul wrote that while she’s had “frank conversations” and “disagreements” with Mamdani, she believes he is focused on the key issues that matter to New York City residents. As he endorsed Mamdani today, Heastie cast him as an optimist promising a better direction for New York City. “I do think this city is clamoring for something new and different,” Heastie said. “He has a romantic view of what this city can be and should be. And sometimes people want to be romanced.” Meanwhile, the lack of support from Schumer and Jeffries for Mamdani has rankled some progressives. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland blasted the non-endorsements during a recent address to Iowa Democrats, leading Jeffries’ spokesperson Justin Chermol to tell The New York Times that “confused New Yorkers are asking themselves the question: Chris Van Who?” Schumer told reporters yesterday that he met with Mamdani last week for a “good conversation.” And Jeffries downplayed any potential concerns from the left. “I haven’t had a conversation with any member of Congress who’s expressed frustration to me as it relates to the New York City mayoral race,” he told reporters. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., told NBC News in an interview that the lack of an endorsement from Democratic leadership is “a little perplexing.” “Look, it is hard for me to understand how the Democratic leadership is not supporting the candidate who won the Democratic primary, or the candidate who has gotten 50, 60,000 people volunteering for his campaign, has created enormous excitement, gotten new people to register to vote. How do you not support that candidate?” Sanders said. Read more from Ben → In the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, President Donald Trump and his allies have threatened to bring the weight of the federal government against what they refer to as the “radical left.” But the suggestion that a secret network of violent left-wing extremists was behind the killing stands in contrast to the evidence that law enforcement officials presented on Tuesday in Utah, where Kirk was fatally shot. There was no indication presented that the suspect, Tyler Robinson, was a member of a group or that he fell under the sway of a particular leader. The investigation is ongoing. Experts told NBC News that the Trump administration appears to be using Kirk’s assassination as an excuse to crack down on left-wing individuals and groups. While administration officials have yet to detail their plans, statements by Miller and others raise questions of who exactly would be targeted, how, and what effect this might have in stifling political dissent. Read more → In a relationship strained by tariffs, the war in Ukraine and starvation in Gaza, America’s British cousins rolled out more than just a red carpet. President Donald Trump’s second state visit, a special honor rarely, if ever, accorded a foreign leader, began with a ride in a horse-drawn carriage, a military parade and a “flypast,” as the Brits call an Air Force “flyover.” During a tour of Windsor’s historic artifacts, a clearly awestruck president declared, “That’s the real deal.” The palace laid out a white-tie state dinner on a table more than 51 yards long decorated with 139 candles, 1,452 pieces of cutlery and five crystal glasses at each setting. The president could be forgiven for occasionally breaking protocol by patting King Charles on his back and walking in front of the monarch while reviewing the troops, as he did with Queen Elizabeth in 2019. He also told Princess Kate on their first greeting, “You’re beautiful, so beautiful.” The serious business of the visit is business. The pomp and circumstance was aimed at softening up Trump to improve the U.K.’s tariff deal with the U.S. Invitees to the lavish dinner included the CEOs of BlackRock, Apple, Nvidia, the Blackstone Group, Bank of America and OpenAI. What Great Britain can offer that few other countries can is the royal touch. That’s especially important with a prime minister, Keir Starmer, who is adept at flattery but less in line with Trump’s politics than Nigel Farage, leader of the rival Reform UK party. The Windsor grounds were also a relatively safe space for a visit uninterrupted by thousands of anti-Trump demonstrators in London, except for the projection of Trump-Epstein images on the castle walls on the eve of the president’s arrival. It’s a high bar for other trading partners planning their own state visits for Trump. One such competitor is China’s Xi Jinping, next in line for a possible Trump visit. The two are planning a call on Friday when an invitation to Beijing is expected to be proffered and quickly accepted. That worries some foreign policy experts, including a former U.S. national security adviser and prominent foreign diplomat. They note that Xi can parade even more military might than Great Britain. Who knows what economic benefits could result. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner and Bridget Bowman.

These deals will create more than 7,600 high-quality jobs, revitalise communities, and accelerate growth in sectors of the future. These 7,600 jobs will be in all areas of the United Kingdom: 1,000 new jobs in Belfast and 6,000 more roles from Glasgow to Warrington, the Midlands and the North-East. This investment surge will deliver real opportunities for working people — from apprenticeships in clean energy to careers in biotech and AI. This unprecedented package reflects the scale of ambition shared by both nations and the UK’s position as a global leader in the future-facing industries prioritised under the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy. It comes alongside the world leading Tech Prosperity Deal, which will be signed tomorrow [Thursday] and a new major deal to turbocharge the build-out of new nuclear power in both countries. A £100 billion investment pledge from Blackstone over the next decade into the UK £3.9 billion investment from world leading investment firm, Prologis, to strengthen its current investment at Cambridge Biomedical Campus and including a major upgrade to Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal, supporting growth in life sciences and advanced manufacturing and creating local jobs in surrounding areas including Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire. Palantir to invest up to £1.5 billion to help make the UK a defence innovation leader and create up to 350 new jobs. £150 million investment from American company, Amentum, creating more than 3,000 jobs across Glasgow to Warrington and the Midlands, expanding its UK workforce by over 50%. US Engineering firm, STAX, has committed £37 million to expand their UK operations and pioneer emission reducing technology at ports around the country. When we back British brilliance, champion our world-class industries, and forge deeper global alliances — especially with friends like the US — we help shape the future for generations to come and make people across the country better off. These investments are a testament to Britain’s economic strength and a bold signal that our country is open, ambitious, and ready to lead. Jobs, growth and opportunity is what I promised for working people, and it’s exactly what this State Visit is delivering. These record-breaking investments will create thousands of high-quality jobs across the UK — from clean energy to advanced manufacturing. It’s a huge vote of confidence in our economy and a clear sign that our Plan for Growth is delivering for working people. Working closely with the US strengthens our global position and delivers real results for British businesses. Tomorrow [Thursday], at Chequers, major UK and US investors will meet the Prime Minister and President Trump to discuss how both countries can go further to deepen economic ties and unlock new opportunities for collaboration. This State Visit marks the largest investment package ever associated with a visit of its kind, surpassing previous records set by the Chinese and Korean State Visit in 2015 and 2023 respectively. The UK-US relationship is economically balanced and mutually beneficial. Alongside the record-breaking inward investment package, today UK companies are also making significant commitments to invest the US market. Leading British pharmaceutical company, GSK, are investing nearly £22 billion ($30 billion) into US R&D and manufacturing over five years, including $1.2 billion in new facilities and AI, creating hundreds of skilled jobs and strengthening UK-US life sciences ties. UK tech company, Urenco and US nuclear company, Radiant, signed a £4 million deal to supply advanced HALEU fuel to the US market. BP plans to invest over £3.6 billion ($5 billion) annually in the US for the next five years, building on $160 billion already invested and supporting 30,000 jobs nationwide. UK tech giant, Sage, committing £1.6 billion ($2.3 billion) in operational spending in the US over three years, reflecting strong market growth and 40% US investor ownership. OakNorth are investing over $5 billion into the US market over the next three years, helping create thousands of new jobs across the country. Rothesay, the UK’s largest specialist pensions insurer, has invested over $10 billion in the US across sectors including US Public Finance (including healthcare and higher education), Residential and Commercial Real Estate and Infrastructure Revolut is set to invest over $500 million in the United States over the next 3-5 years to accelerate its expansion and support its ambition to scale as a bank for American consumers. Our investment ambitions for the expansion of Cambridge Biomedical Campus and Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal are backing two of the UK’s most critical sectors: life sciences and logistics. This demonstrates our commitment to fostering innovation and delivering the sustainable infrastructure that underpins the UK’s long-term economic growth. The US State visit reflects the unique strength of the UK-US partnership and our shared determination to drive economic growth and prosperity. The energy resilience and national security of both nations depend on continued leadership and advances in energy and technology – the focus of this visit. Commitments by both governments to back and invest in these industries help drive Amentum’s continued growth and investment in innovation, jobs and skills on both sides of the Atlantic. These investments will not only create jobs but also boost productivity, drive regional development, and equip people with the skills needed for the industries of the future. The “record-breaking” investment pledge of £150 billion refers to the largest total value of new confirmed inward investment commitments ever announced in connection with a UK state visit. It includes forward capital commitments by US firms including £90bn from Blackstone which is in addition to the £10bn that they have previously announced that they will deploy in the UK to support datacentres but which they have reaffirmed as part of a total investment pledge of £100bn over the next decade. However, if we take into consideration commitments from UK firms, banks and financial institutions to invest into the US, alongside UK Central Government commitments to buy around £60 billion ($82 billion) from US companies over the next five years then the overall total commercial package amounts to around £280 billion. Please see below for a list of all the investments announced as part of the State Visit: US to UK commitments X-Energy and Centrica plan to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors with a follow-on UK-wide programme targeting a fleet of 6GW of nuclear power.

Title: U.S. Healthcare System Seriously Threatened by Private Equity Takeover
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/u-s-healthcare-system-seriously-threatened-by-private-equity-takeover/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T20:00:00Z

Editor Health Paul A. Philips The health of many Americans is seriously under threat because private equity firms are taking over hospitals. These private equity firms have taken over some 450 hospitals across the United States. Private equity firm Steward had acquired over 37 hospitals in the United States alone. Besides hospitals, reports state that the takeover has extended into the acquisitions of 750 nursing homes, 200 emergency set-ups, 5,779 doctor’s practices and two-thirds of the country’s air ambulances. In this growing takeover trend, over the last 10 years, these private equity investors have paid out around $1 trillion in the last 10 years. Succinctly put by Massachusetts State Senator Cindy Friedman: “Private equity is the complete opposite of the delivery of healthcare…” She goes on to say “… make money, leave, make it however you want, make it for people who are interested in making money, and then you have got healthcare, which is all about delivering care to people. The cost is not the first thing. The delivery care is the first thing. And those two things do not mesh.” In other words, because of an increase in financialization, the effectiveness of healthcare has been significantly compromised due to private equity involvement, making a number of cost-cuts in healthcare services that, in effect, put profits over the genuine welfare concern of patients. The increase in financialization overseen by its financial actors with main street corporations has been allowed to happen due to deregulation that had taken place decades ago. -This is one of a number of examples whereby corporations ‘eat each other up’ through takeovers and buyouts. Eventually there’s only a tiny handful of giant corporations left who practically own everything through monopolization. Consider the likes of behemoth corporations like BlackRock, Blackstone and Vanguard… -As a result, the services, as in healthcare, are not as good due to cost-cutting and there’s little in the way of competition to choose from as an alternative provider. For instance, some financial overseers might work out that in a ward the number of nurses could be cut from 9 to 6 to save money or make more profits… and that’s not the only thing they would be looking at to cut back… The reports on specific incidents in relation to this are astounding: Taking the cases of three Connecticut hospitals, Manchester Memorial, Rockville General and Waterbury Hospital. Each hospital had been bought up by private equity backed Prospect Medical Holdings. Staff members of these hospitals had come forward and were interviewed. From interviewee responses a pattern unfolded. All staff repeatedly said that Prospect Medical Holdings did everything they could to save money, to the point of extremity and in every aspect. Patient care deteriorated as a result of a lack of spending on essential resources. For example, Romana, a staff member working in an operating room commented on how medical supplies had been halted. The supplies grew scarce, to the extent that the staff were left scrambling to find essential equipment at the operating theatre. There were incidents where some staff ended up purchasing equipment. Staff had also bought food for their patients or otherwise that would have gone hungry… Anne-Marie has worked as a nurse at Manchester Memorial for more than 3 decades. She told her interviewers that it was the total dedication of her colleagues that kept the hospital from falling apart. Carmen, working as a secretary at Waterbury Hospital, said that Prospect Medical Holdings ignored advice on maintaining buildings. -Because of the years of neglect, there were incidences where ceilings had literally come apart, resulting in buildings coming down. Fortunately, no one was harmed. Other appalling conditions had been reported. For instance, in a trauma room, because of structural neglect, buckets had been placed to catch water drips from ceilings at offices where computers were just missing the falling drips… Patient care deterioration at Waterbury was evidenced by having recorded the highest rates of patient readmissions in Connecticut state 2019. These three hospitals have now been stripped. They have come to their death and demise: Leonard Green & Partners (who had owned Prospect at the time) had sold off the land where the three hospitals resided as a real estate investment. The leasing company who then took over leased the land at a much higher rate, resulting in “debt and destruction” in the wake of this. For example, Rockville Hospital started losing so much money that they couldn’t afford to fully take care of their outpatients. As a consequence, Prospect, still holding on to these hospitals, has filed for bankruptcy. The future of these three hospitals will now be decided by a Texan bankruptcy judge. -This scenario is not atypical as it is happening to a number of hospitals all over the United States, as reported by Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy. In other words, these private equity firms are sucking the life out of hospitals and resources to financially take care of their investors, while patients and affected communities are left stranded. They then go on to destroy the hospitals. Wall Street Apes @WallStreetApes made a recent post claiming that in recent times around 50 hospitals nationwide have fallen victims in the above way. No doubt there will be the demise of more hospitals to come. Finally When this is allowed to happen, you can be pretty sure that it’s because of a corrupt system. -A case where moral bankruptcy precedes financial bankruptcy. Nothing is more important than your health. It’s the greatest investment you could ever make, but private equity sees things differently. The politicians allow it to happen because they have an involvement. Welcome to the ‘donor class!’ They bankrupt hospitals and line their pockets with millions of dollars as a result. Not just with hospitals and healthcare, there are other cases where Private Equity is not your friend. Take the case of Private Equity’s involvement with the buyout of utilities. The result for the people of America is that their utility bills go up by hundreds of percent, as it has, for example, in California. Then there’s a decrease in energy efficiency, while more blackouts occur, public buildings such as schools have been known to suffer more power cuts… Private Equity continues gutting the country, while lining the pockets of the select few investors.

Title: Honeywell, Caterpillar CTOs say AI can ease labor, skills gaps in manufacturing
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/09/17/honeywell-caterpillar-ctos-say-ai-can-ease-labor-skills-gaps-in-manufacturing/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T18:57:21Z
Full Content:
John Kell is a contributing writer for Fortune and author of Fortune’s CIO Intelligence newsletter. Honeywell says that 20% of the company’s software code is written by GitHub Copilot and other AI-assistant coding tools. But, does that mean that the industrial giant’s embrace of AI has corresponded with a 20% reduction in that team’s workforce? No, according to Suresh Venkatarayalu, the chief technology officer and president of the company’s software-focused division, Honeywell Connected Enterprise. “What has changed is the type of developer skill sets,” said Venkatarayalu at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference held last week in Park City, Utah. With less time needed to write code, Honeywell’s software developers can perform more complex work, including spending more time in the field with customers to solve their system integration needs. For decades, the industrial sector has been embracing automation technologies that have made it easier to move goods across the factory floor, perform quality control inspections, and monitor machinery to predict when a fix may be in order before any breakdowns occur. Workers have also gotten more access to AI-enabled tools, helping recommend when supplies need reordering, predict demand from customers, and help handle repetitive back-office tasks. AI represents yet another new way to rethink manufacturing automation. Many are still early in their adoption journey, with only 29% using AI or machine learning at the factory or network level, and just one out of four having deployed generative AI at that scale, according to a survey of 600 executives from large manufacturing companies by consultancy Deloitte. Jaime Mineart, SVP and CTO of construction and mining equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, joined Venkatarayalu during the panel discussion and shared leaders need to change how their workers engage with technology. That might include classes in prompt engineering, so they know how to get the most out of large language models, specialized training in how to work alongside robots, or lessons on how to glean insights from the data streaming from a more connected manufacturing ecosystem. “It’s huge change management,” Mineart said. The biggest challenges that they will need to solve will be related to both labor capability and labor availability, she added. Venkatarayalu sees things slightly differently. In the U.S. and other developed markets, he believes that there is a labor shortage. But in higher growth regions, the problem is more focused on the skills gap. “The only way to offset the labor shortage and a skills shortage is to augment with something, and that something is AI,” said Venkatarayalu. A survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers last year found that nearly 60% of manufacturers report that their inability to attract and retain employees is their top challenge. A separate study by Deloitte and The Manufacturing Institute last year showed that 1.9 million U.S. manufacturing jobs could go unfilled over a decade if the talent woes aren’t addressed. Meanwhile, the median tenure of a manufacturing worker has slipped from 5.9 years in 2014 to 4.9 years in 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mineart said automation and AI can help move workers away from less safe, duller, and more repetitive tasks. “Those are jobs that robots, robotics, and technology can really do very, very well, alongside that human capability and that human creativity to get more productivity and safer work sites,” she said. Caterpillar and Honeywell share some similarities in that they are both over a century old and are on the Fortune 500 (Caterpillar at 64, Honeywell at 119). But their AI journeys are evolving in different ways. Honeywell, which is in the process of splitting itself into three different companies, has launched new generative AI features for customers including an AI assistant to automate tasks for operators and production workers and has inked partnerships with Google, Chevron, and Qualcomm to collaborate more on AI innovation. Caterpillar’s revenue is getting a boost from the data center boom that’s leading to stronger sales of the company’s generators. It has also pledged $100 million over the next five years to upskill workers on evolving technologies, including AI. “When you think about bringing manufacturing back into the United States, we have to reimagine how we are going to do that,” said Mineart. John Kell Send thoughts or suggestions to CIO Intelligence here. Momentum continues to build for quantum. While the most promising advancements for quantum computing look to be at least a few years away, excitement for the developing field is accelerating as seen by a Wall Street Journal report last week that quantum computing startup PsiQuantum raised $1 billion from investors including BlackRock and Nvidia’s venture-capital arm to bring the company’s total valuation to $7 billion. There’s been quite a bit of funding action in the space in recent weeks, with Honeywell’s quantum computing company, Quantinuum, and Europe’s IQM Quantum Computers both disclosing funding rounds earlier this month. WSJ also separately reported on IBM’s efforts to lead in the space, which includes a partnership with chip maker AMD to develop “quantum-centric supercomputers.” Automation is more popular than augmentation for Anthropic’s Claude. Anthropic, the AI startup whose CEO warned that the technology could wipe out 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs in five years, published a broad report this week that found that 77% of enterprises’ usage of Claude AI software was focused on automation, with just 12% for augmentation (which includes improved collaboration and learning). Peter McCrory, head of economics at Anthropic, told Bloomberg that it wasn’t clear whether the increase in automation was due to “new model capabilities that are expanding the set of things that get automated, or if it’s people being more comfortable with large language models and becoming more willing to delegate certain tasks to Claude.” As OpenAI spends big, questions begin to swirl on the startup’s monetization strategy. Wall Street cheered the news of Oracle’s $300 billion cloud deal last week, an OpenAI halo that’s also lifting the valuations of key investor Microsoft, AI chip maker Nvidia, and Broadcom, the latter seeing a stock pop after it was reported that OpenAI placed a $10 billion order for its custom AI chips. The thesis of all this investment is that enterprises and individual customers will spend on AI at exponentially higher rates than they are today, to justify the hundreds of billions of dollars that OpenAI is putting into AI infrastructure. That’s not necessarily a guarantee, with studies and surveys beginning to call into question the success of generative AI pilots and very few paying individual customers. While nearly two billion individuals use AI, only 3% of them are paying for premium services, which includes ChatGPT, according to a study by Menlo Ventures. AI skills are becoming a job requirement A report on the Group of 7 nations found that 78% of all tech roles now include at least some AI skills and that seven of the 10 fastest-growing tech roles are related to AI. The highest in-demand roles that saw the largest year-over-over growth are AI risk and governance specialist (234%), NLP engineer (186%), AL/ML engineer (145%), AI business consultant (134%), and AI infrastructure engineer (124%), according to a study published by the AI Workforce Consortium, a group of ten large employers that includes Google, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, and SAP. Beyond merely hiring new talent for those roles, AI Workforce Consortium is also advocating for more upskilling, saying that tech skills like prompt engineering, conversational AI, and generative AI require “immediate” intervention to cater to the job market demand. “I think there has been a gap, for quite some time, between higher education and corporations,” Fran Katsoudas, Cisco's chief people, policy and purpose officer, tells Fortune. Those gaps were initially focused on soft skills, including learning how to collaborate on a project or respectfully disagree. Now, corporations will need to take that same college-to-work skills gap playbook and apply it to AI. “Part of the challenge is when companies think about training or education, we make it very individualized,” adds Katsoudas. “Enterprise education has to be more team- and roll-based.” Courtesy of The AI Workforce Consortium Hiring: - Jefferson Center for Mental Health is seeking a CIO, based in Wheat Ridge, Colorado.

Title: End Quarterly Earnings Forecasts But Not Quarterly Reporting
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelposner/2025/09/17/end-quarterly-earnings-forecasts-but-not-quarterly-reporting/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T18:53:00Z

ByMichael Posner, Senior Contributor. President Donald Trump has proposed reducing the frequency of corporate financial reporting requirements from four reports a year to two. He made the same suggestion in 2018. Trump justifies this idea by saying, “This will save money and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies.” He is only half right: the reduced reporting will indeed save companies money. But at the same time, it will reduce transparency, denying investors, government regulators, and the public access to essential information that is of broad public concern. This is yet another example of the administration’s efforts to roll back data collection and dissemination on a wide range of topics. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has required publicly traded companies to file quarterly financial reports since 1970. These reports provide a snapshot of financial performance, a collection of unaudited financial statements, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. These numbers help investors assess a company's growth, profitability, and financial health. But in the wake of the president’s announcement, the SEC now says that it is prioritizing his proposal “to further eliminate unnecessary regulatory burdens on companies.” This is the latest in a series of administration steps aimed at reducing government oversight of corporate actions. It’s important to separate the two different aspects of the corporate reporting process. The first is the role these reports play in generating data that investors use to make quarterly earnings forecasts. These forecasts reinforce the investment model for many on Wall Street, prioritizing the maximization of short-term shareholder profits at the expense of a company’s long-term value. Extending the reporting period from three to six months will do very little to correct this investor-driven short-termism, which disincentivizes C-suite executives who wish to invest in environmental and social safeguards. In 2018, Jamie Dimon and Warren Buffett wrote an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, which rightly called for the end to quarterly earnings forecasts. They wrote, “in our experience, quarterly earnings guidance often leads to an unhealthy focus on short-term profits at the expense of long-term strategy, growth and sustainability.” But they also stressed that this “should not be misconstrued as opposition to quarterly and annual reporting.” Rather, they emphasized that, “[tr]ansparency about financial and operating results is an essential aspect of U.S. public markets.” Dimon and Buffett are not alone in this assessment. FCLTGlobal, a non-profit that began as a joint initiative of BlackRock, McKinsey, the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Fund, and others, also promotes longer-term thinking in finance. A report they published in 2017 argues that the publication of “[q]uarterly earnings remains essential in providing investors with the transparency they need and in keeping management teams accountable for their performance.” FCLTGlobal suggests that instead of reducing reporting requirements, companies should be encouraged to incorporate long-term goals in their public reporting and to discuss the progress they are making toward these goals each quarter. The second reason for doing these reports, called 10-Q filings, is to provide investors and the public with information on a range of topics that enhance corporate transparency and provide a measure of accountability. This is more important than ever in the current political moment, when the Trump administration is relaxing federal ethical standards and enforcement of laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. On their own, quarterly financial reports cannot reverse this current trend, but they can provide a hedge against the most egregious conduct. To paraphrase former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, “Sunlight is the best disinfectant.”10-Q reports are divided into two parts. The first includes financial statements, disclosures about market risks, analysis of the company’s financial situation by management, and discussion of its internal controls. These disclosures give individual and institutional investors the information they need to make informed investment decisions. The second part of these reports covers a range of other topics that helps investors and the public identify potential risks, such as whether there are legal or default proceedings pending against the company, or the unregistered sales of equity securities. Not surprisingly, this is information that company leaders often are not eager to disclose. Under the law, they must. This provides all of us with an important source of accountability. As the Wall Street Journal has reported, the President’s proposal is likely to meet resistance from investors. The Journal wrote, “Institutional investors such as pension funds and hedge funds typically crave more information on the companies they follow, not less.” And as T. Rowe Price has observed, even longer-term investors benefit from quarterly reports, “because these short-term progress reports increase our confidence in our ability to predict a company’s long-range outcome.” In an era of increasing corporate power and declining regulatory oversight, maintaining robust quarterly reporting requirements isn’t just good policy—it’s essential for market integrity and public accountability.

The two firms plan to create a suite of investment products focused on broad diversification across public and private markets and multiple asset classes. These investments will be available as either stand-alone options or as parts of defined contribution plans and insurance portfolios. “Given our unique position as an insurance-backed asset manager and one of the top global asset managers for defined contribution plans, we are well-suited to provide solutions that are differentiated and scalable across various client segments,” said Stuart Parker, head of global wealth at PGIM, in a statement. “Our partnership with Partners Group deepens our firm’s ability to provide clients with market-leading, innovative and comprehensive multi-asset investment solutions that meet their evolving needs.” A statement from David Layton, CEO of Partners Group, noted: “Today, we combine our transformational investing approach with the ability to tailor flexible portfolio solutions to meet a broad range of investor requirements. This partnership with PGIM stands testament to that and is another important step in broadening access to private markets for a range of end clients.” Related:Wealth Management Invest: The Role of Secondary Markets in Private Wealth with Coller Capital’s Jonathan McEvoy The partnerships add to a trend of asset manager team-ups to deliver products that blend exposures to public and private assets. Last fall, Partners Group formed a partnership with alternative asset manager BlackRock to launch a model portfolio encompassing private equity, private credit and real assets. Those models were aimed at investors with qualified purchaser status. Other asset managers, including Goldman Sachs and T. Rowe, KKR and Capital Group, Blackstone and Vanguard, have teamed up over the past year to build and launch model portfolios, SMAs and evergreen funds that combine public and private market exposure. This is happening as both private wealth investors and their financial advisors increasingly see alternative assets as a must-have in clients’ investment portfolios—a report by FUSE Research Network published in January projected that by 2029, alternative assets in the U.S. wealth management channel could rise to $3.03 trillion, or at an annualized compound growth rate of 17%.

Title: Rick Rieder Overhauls BlackRock Bond Team as HPS Clout Grows

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is revamping its massive fixed-income division around new investment strategies and artificial intelligence, as the unit’s leveraged finance business moves under an executive team from the firm’s newly acquired HPS Investment Partners. The changes mark a new vision for the group and reflect the credit market’s “dramatic and transformative” evolution, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in an internal memo seen by Bloomberg. The move also underscores the growing clout of the private financing solutions group led by HPS’s top executives — a key business for the firm as it expands in private and alternative credit and competes with the likes of Blackstone Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc. BlackRock’s leveraged-finance business will remain under the stewardship of David Delbos and Mitch Garfin, but will be folded into the PFS business from global fixed income, according to the memo. The PFS franchise is overseen by Scott Kapnick, Scot French and Michael Patterson, the HPS leaders who completed the $12 billion sale of the private-credit specialist to BlackRock in July. A representative for the company declined to comment. It’s the latest move in a sweeping plan to re-wire BlackRock. Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink is staking a big part of his company’s future on private markets and his ability to combine them with the public stock and bond strategies and ETFs that have powered the firm’s rise. BlackRock has spent billions to become a major player in alternative and private assets and data, and the HPS purchase turned it into a private-credit behemoth nearly overnight. Rieder, who met last week with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about the role of Federal Reserve chair, laid out new investment plans for BlackRock’s fixed-income group in the memo. It will build out core fixed-income portfolios and plans to develop a so-called core-plus-related solution that is “more powerful,” he said. As part of the changes, Rieder said Russ Brownback will become deputy CIO of global fixed income. David Rogal, meanwhile, has informed the company that he intends to explore opportunities outside the firm, Rieder said. Bank of America Corp.’s David Koh will join BlackRock in a newly created role as chief investment strategist, he added. Rieder’s group plans to start a fixed-income hedge fund dubbed TriaXial, he said. It also intends to develop a higher-income version of BINC, a popular active bond ETF with $12.3 billion in assets that Rieder manages. He is responsible for roughly $2.4 trillion in total, according to the firm’s website. “Technology will be a significant part of the work,” said Rieder. “The ability to use AI, machine learning and new data” will help develop new tools to improve investment returns. --With assistance from Laura Noonan and Jeremy Hill.

Editor Crypto CoinDesk, Helene Braun The world’s largest asset manager is exploring putting exchange-traded funds on chain, sources told Bloomberg. BlackRock is exploring how to bring exchange-traded funds (ETFs) onto public blockchains, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The sources said the asset manager is weighing tokenizing funds tied to real-world assets such as stocks, though any rollout would depend on regulatory approval. The discussions follow BlackRock’s first experiment with tokenization last year. The firm introduced the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, also known as BUIDL. The fund, which is backed by short-term U.S. Treasuries, repurchase agreements and cash, has quickly grown into the world’s largest tokenized Treasury product, managing nearly $2.2 billion. Tokenizing ETFs would represent a deeper step into blockchain-based financial products. In practice, it would mean that shares of the funds — traditionally traded on stock exchanges during market hours — could be issued and transacted as tokens on chain. Proponents argue this shift could bring clear benefits. A tokenized ETF could be traded around the clock, rather than only during exchange hours. Settlement, which often takes two business days in traditional finance, could be completed within minutes. Investors in markets where ETFs are not easily accessible might gain exposure through blockchain rails. The products are pending a green light from regulators, the people said. BlackRock’s exploration underscores a wider trend across finance, as banks, fintechs and asset managers test blockchain rails for bonds, private credit and now mainstream equity funds.

80 applicants in less than 5-minutes show the high demand for affordable homes. Stock image Property prices rose in the 12 months to July this year, up 7.5pc compared to the same time a year ago, but the pace of increases has moderated. In the 12 months to the end of June, prices were up 7.9pc. The latest Central Statistics Office (CSO) data shows the greatest slowdown was in Dublin. House prices in the capital were 6pc higher at the end of July than a year earlier, versus up 6.8pc in the 12 months to the end of June. The CSO Residential Property Price Index shows property prices outside Dublin were 8.7pc higher in July 2025 when compared with a year earlier, a slight decrease, from 8.8pc in the year to June 2025. Dublin city prices were up 7.7pc at the end of July. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which has some of the highest average prices anywhere, the pace of increase has moderated significantly, with a rise of 4.7pc in 12 months. However, double-digit price hikes are still being felt outside Dublin. House prices in the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) are up 10.9pc, and the Mid-West (Clare, Limerick, and Tipperary) they rose 10.3pc. Both the South-East, which comprises Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford, and the South-West (Cork and Kerry) had an 8.1pc rise in house prices. 80 applicants in less than 5-minutes show the high demand for affordable homes. Stock image Today's News in 90 Seconds - September 17th Households paid an average price of €374,999 for a dwelling on the residential property market in the 12 months to July 2025, the CSO said. The region with the highest median price in the year to July was Dublin, with median prices of €490,000. Within Dublin, the most expensive area was Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where the average price was €675,000. The least expensive region within Dublin was Fingal at price of €460,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive region over the last 12 months was Wicklow, with a median price of €451,000. The second most expensive region was Kildare, the CSO said. The least expensive regions over the last 12 months were both Donegal and Leitrim, where the standard price paid for a dwelling was €195,000. In the year to July, the Eircode area with the highest price for household dwelling purchases was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin), with an average price of €795,000. The Eircode area with the least expensive median price within Dublin was D10 (Dublin 10), where the median price was €314,000. Outside of Dublin, the most expensive Eircode area over the last 12 months was A98 (Bray, Wicklow), with a median price of €549,999. The least expensive Eircode area over the last 12 months was F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon), coming it at €150,000, the CSO said. The total value of dwelling purchases by households at market prices filed with Revenue was €2.1bn in July 2025, representing a 6.6pc increase compared with the €1.9bn worth of purchases in July 2024 and a 20.8pc increase compared with the €1.7bn worth of purchases in June 2025. “While the slight fall in the rate of annual house price growth will be welcomed by aspiring buyers, this is not unusual for the summer, often a quiet time for house sales,” said Trevor Grant, chairman of Irish Mortgage Advisors. “However, this easing could be short-lived and we could well see the rate of house price growth pick up for September and October, often busy months for house sales.” The price indices for new and existing dwellings are produced on a quarterly basis and at the national level only.

Title: Annual property price growth slips to 16-month low - CSO
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0917/1533940-cso-residential-property-prices/

Eleanor Burnhill Dublin City Council has said it is working with the Department of Housing, the Land Development Agency and Approved Housing Bodies to build as many homes as possible for first-time buyers and those on the housing waiting list. Assistant CEO for Housing at DCC Mick Mulhern said the council is "working to deliver as many homes as possible in the quickest time frame possible" and is now working across 100 different sites to deliver 12 thousand homes, which he said could take a number of years. He said of the 169 new homes launched today at Rathborne Crossing close to Ashtown station, DCC would take 86 of those. "There'll be social houses in one and two beds as part of this new development, which also includes a new creche and amenity space." It comes as residential property price growth slipped to a 16-month low of 7.5% in July, down from 7.9% in June, new figures from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) show. The CSO said that property prices in Dublin rose by 6% in July and prices outside Dublin were up by 8.7% compared with the same month last year. Lord Mayor of Dublin Ray McAdam said there was a significant pipeline of development by Dublin City Council in terms of housing delivery taking place in the city at the present. "But obviously I fully acknowledge that we need to do more, and we are doing more." He said a decision would be taken before the end of this year in terms of reviewing who gets priority from the council's housing list. He said the Strategic Housing Policy Committee was looking at this. He acknowledged there were too many families and individuals experiencing homelessness and he said: "What we're working to do is to ensure that we ramp up supply, to ensure those, those families, have an opportunity to move in, into permanent accommodation." Reacting to the figures, the Minister for Housing James Browne said supply was key, but the Government was working to deliver as many homes as possible. "I'm very conscious that's a very significant increase. It is affecting affordability. "We need to get the apartments and the homes built. People need to be able to afford them, and that's why we're taking as many measures as we can. "But the key to getting house prices stabilised, and actually at an affordable price, is supply. That's why everything I've been doing for the first six months as Minister for Housing is making those key decisions, often difficult decisions, often decisions are being criticised, but they will actually deliver the supply that we need." In terms of numbers, he said there had never been a 50,000 target for delivery. "There won't be 50,000 this year, but it was never intended to be 50,000 homes this year. "What we want to see is an increase in the homes last year, and continue to build on the momentum that is there. In the last government we went from 19,000 homes to well over 30,000 homes actually in the lifetime of Housing For All, we actually exceeded the targets." 'Significant step change' - Browne Speaking today, Minister Browne said the government is starting from further behind this year in terms of delivering housing that would have been expected. He said he expected to see housing targets and delivery accelerate as the years go on but he would not be drawn on how many houses will be delivered by the end of this calendar year. "We accept there has to be a significant step change," he said. He said a little over 30,000 homes were delivered last year but the hope was that would have been higher. "That was a real disappointment and it does mean this year and in the near future we're probably starting from further behind what we would expect," he said. He said important decisions were being taken to accelerate delivery including making the country a national rent pressure zone, giving more security of tenure to tenants and what he hoped would be more certainty for international investors. "We need international finance to finance the construction sector in this country to deliver," he said. He said with the ebb and flow of construction, a few apartment blocks being completed in December, slipping into January could fundamentally change annual numbers. "I've never been in the business of forecasting but my business is to ensure we maximise every opportunity to deliver as many homes as possible." In terms of homelessness figures he said this was being looked at a granular level to look at the different reasons for it and trying to address those. Asked about a downturn in planning applications and comments from the Labour Party that he was seeking to blame local authorities for this, he said: "We've seen a 35% increase in building delivery in the second quarter. You're always going to have when you're dealing with something like building variations of commencements, planning, the delivery." He said he will keep an eye on looking at how more planning we can be accelerated working with the local authorities, ensuring they have the resources they need. "It also means having the land zoned that we need as well. "This is not about the blame game. This is about ensuring that we have the homes delivered where we need to build, the communities that everybody deserves," he said. Housing Activation office 'up and running' Minister Browne says the new Housing Activation Office will have a lead or a head, but will not have a housing 'tsar'. "All of the specialists from utility companies are now in place, and the specialists from the local authorities as well. "We are engaging with local authorities, writing out to them soon to identify the key areas. So that work is ongoing, and we will be identifying that lead. I don't give it any particular moniker, but it will have a lead, and we're making that final decision as to how exactly that would be implemented," he said. The CSO figures show that house prices in Dublin rose by 6.2% while apartment prices increased by 5.3%. The highest house price growth in Dublin was in Dublin City at 7.7% while Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown saw a rise of 4.7%. Outside Dublin, house prices were up by 8.7% and apartment prices rose by 7.5%. The region outside of Dublin that saw the largest growth in house prices was the Midlands (Laois, Longford, Offaly, and Westmeath) at 10.9%, while the South-East (Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford, and Wexford) and the South-West (Cork and Kerry) both saw increases of 8.1%. The median price of a home bought in the 12 months to July 2025 was €374,99, the CSO added. Today's figures show that the highest median price for a home in the 12 months to July was €675,000 in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, while the lowest median price was €195,000 in both Donegal and Leitrim. Meanwhile, the most expensive Eircode area in July was A94 (Blackrock, Dublin) with a median price of €795,000, while F45 (Castlerea, Roscommon) had the lowest price of €150,000. Today's CSO figures also show that a total of 4,712 home purchases were filed with Revenue in July, a decrease of 0.2% when compared with the 4,723 purchases in July last year. The total value of transactions filed in July was €2.1 billion - made up of 3,567 existing homes with a value of €1.5 billion, and 1,145 new homes with a value of €550.7m. Today's figures mean that Dublin residential property prices are 6.8% higher than their February 2007 peak, while residential property prices in the Rest of Ireland are 23% higher than their May 2007 peak.

Title: Vanguard Adds Long-Overdue Junk Bond ETF at Tricky Time

The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Need an active, fixed-income ETF? Vanguard just checked both boxes. The firm launched the High-Yield Active ETF (VGHY) today in its latest push into actively managed bond products. CEO Salim Ramji has prioritized the expansion and said last year that Vanguard was in a prime position to make its mark on a segment that he called antiquated and expensive. The new ETF is not a copy of Vanguard’s $25 billion High-Yield Corporate Fund, a mutual fund, but the ETF has broader coverage for credit quality, going as low as CCC (the mutual fund is focused on BB and B). “Both products will be well-supported, and investors will have the choice across our lineup,” said Rebecca Venter, senior fixed income product manager at Vanguard. “We’ve also seen over time that the high-yield corporate bond market has shifted quite dramatically since the Great Financial Crisis.” The traditional high-yield credit market has moved up in quality as a result of more lower-quality issuance in the bank loan and private credit markets, Venter said. Today, BB-rated debt accounts for over half of the high-yield market, she noted. Here’s how VGHY compares to the mutual fund: The fund, the ninth in Vanguard’s line of active bond ETFs, follows numerous other fixed income launches this year. In July, for example, the firm added three Treasury ETFs, following its addition of the Multisector Income Bond ETF in April. The company also rolled out two fixed income model portfolio options the same month. Junk Sale: It’s about time that Vanguard had a high-yield ETF, but the surprise in this launch is that the fund is actively managed, said Jeff DeMaso, editor of The Independent Vanguard Adviser. In an analysis he published today, DeMaso rated the ETF as a “buy,” but he also discouraged people from buying it, at least for a while. The reason for that? Spreads are tight, he said, with yields on corporate junk bonds being about 2 percentage points higher than yields on intermediate-term Treasurys, which is significantly below the long-term average of over 3.5 percentage points. “It’s about time Vanguard filled this gap,” DeMaso said. “But the launch comes at the wrong time. For now, patience — not bold moves — is the smarter play.” The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. As new ETFs launch at breakneck speed, expensive products are raking in revenue. The firm’s founder claims a new ETF using fundamentals beyond market-cap weighting to determine holdings is the next big thing. Funds holding large financial institutions have significantly outperformed broad market indices this year. The exchange could start offering tokenization of securities, including exchange-traded products and stocks, next year. Amid a reversal in tax incentives that had started to buoy clean energy technologies, investors have pulled money from linked ETFs. The company, which sponsors a nearly $5 billion Bitcoin ETF along with ARK, is nixing the three other ETFs in that partnership. The SEC and CFTC recently issued a rare joint statement encouraging applications for new spot crypto products. Disney is the comeback kid of Wall Street, and other streaming giants are following suit. The company’s new U.S. Equity Total Return ETF invests in other exchange-traded funds in a way that minimizes dividend payments. If approved, Tuttle Capital Management would buck an industry trend in the options it uses, according to the company’s CEO. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Reckoner Capital Management, which added its Leveraged AAA CLO ETF in July, has aspirations of building out a global credit business. Emile Hallez emile@thedailyupside.com Without being koi, sometimes it’s nice to be a big fish in a small pond. Richard Hoge, a former COO of Janus Henderson’s ETF business, recently landed at Reckoner Capital Management, and has been tasked with building out its exchange traded fund suite (currently, the firm has one). The firm, which launched in February backed by RedBird Capital Partners, rolled out its $33 million Leveraged AAA CLO ETF (RAAA) in July. ETFs are a central piece of the company’s plan to build out a global credit platform, CEO John Kim said. “The aim is to bring alternative assets to various client bases in very easy-to-access wrappers,” he said, adding that the ETF market “is the most easily accessible for the vast majority of investors.” The ETF business is booming, continually breaking sales records, while a flood of new products come to market. But it’s dominated by a few massive players (ahem … BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street), and finding a niche for differentiation is becoming harder. Reckoner’s broad requirements for new ETFs are that they be strategies that belong in the format and aren’t the latest iterations of products that already exist, said Kim, who prior to the company’s founding was CEO and CIO of Panagram Structured Asset Management. On the first point, private credit is a no-go, given the liquidity constraints, he said. “We are very conscious of daily liquidity.” Hoge’s background could help with that: Let’s Get Real: Hoge, who has backgrounds in law and taxation, “knows the ETF market extremely well,” Kim said. “He has a lot of different viewpoints that he can bring to bear on new product creation… We need someone to be the realist in the room.” The New York-based firm is planning to launch some of the first tokenized ETFs, according to a report. The company filled a hole in its fixed-income ETF line — but the timing may not be ideal, given relatively low yields in junk bonds relative to Treasurys, one observer said.
