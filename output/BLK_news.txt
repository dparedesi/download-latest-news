In a warning issued on the Bristol, UK-based investment platform's website, the company said that crypto in general "shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals." Hargreaves Lansdown, which administers £170 billion ($226.8 billion) in assets, did add that it would allow qualified clients to invest in the new British crypto exchange-traded notes. "Bitcoin is the largest and most widely held cryptocurrency," the firm's statement read. "While longer-term returns of Bitcoin have been positive, Bitcoin has experienced several periods of extreme losses and is a highly volatile investment—much riskier than stocks or bonds." "The HL Investment view is that Bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn't be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals,” it added. Hargreaves Lansdown added that crypto in general "has no intrinsic value." The firm's stark warning contrasts with other financial services companies around the globe. BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, changed its view in recent years regarding Bitcoin after its CEO admitted he came around to understanding the asset. The firm shook the crypto and traditional finance world in 2023 when it applied for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Then, in 2024, the SEC approved its product—along with 10 other crypto funds—and it had the most successful launch in the history of ETFs. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has since said that the asset has a place in portfolios of investors seeking uncorrelated returns, calling it "a legit financial instrument." Meanwhile, hedge fund legend Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates said in July that investors should allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold and Bitcoin as a hedge against macroeconomic risks. Still, others in the traditional finance world have continued to criticize Bitcoin and the crypto industry, with JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon perhaps being the most prominent Wall Street skeptic. "I'm not personally a believer in Bitcoin itself, but you're the customer, I don't like to tell customers what they can and can't do with their money," he said earlier this year. The price of Bitcoin tumbled Friday as President Trump threatened "massive" tariffs on China, echoing a drop in stock markets. Bitcoin is currently down more than 2% on the day and trading below $118,000. Amid the Friday dip, Myriad users have become more bearish on Bitcoin's prospects of rising to a new all-time high of $140,000 before it can dip back to $110,000. As of this writing, traders give it a 44% chance, down about 11% over the last day. (Disclaimer: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Title: Is The XRP Bottom In? Pundit Claims ‘Sellers Are Exhausted’
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-the-xrp-bottom-in-sellers-exhausted/
Time Published: 2025-10-10T16:00:45Z
Full Content:
Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Crypto commentator Zach Rector argues that XRP’s months-long malaise is nearing a turning point, contending that selling pressure has largely run its course and that a fresh wave of institutional demand is lining up on the other side of the ledger. “XRP sellers are exhausted,” Rector said in a video analysis published late on October 9, adding that “the downside action and the consolidation that we’ve seen over the past few months is coming to an end and the suits are now getting ready to sell it with slideshow presentations.” Rector’s central thesis is that structurally constrained float and prospective exchange-traded products could catalyze a supply squeeze. He framed the timeline around a US government shutdown, asserting that approval activity would not resume until after a reopening: “ETFs are set to go live for XRP as soon as the government shutdown ends. No, I am not anticipating the SEC to approve the ETFs while the government is shut down.” He characterized the post-shutdown period as a potential “tidal wave of XRP, crypto, and other related ETFs,” while acknowledging that the precise sequencing depends on regulators returning to normal operations. Pointing to what he sees as a template in other assets, Rector highlighted a recent trading episode he attributed to BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF. In his telling, “Jane Street… spark[ed] a massive momentum ignition selloff just in time for BlackRock’s ETF to buy the most Ether in 2 months,” with $437 million of inflows arriving on a day of heavy price weakness. “While they’re hitting the sell button, panicking… the investors at BlackRock are saying, ‘Thank you very much,’” he said. He extrapolated from this to XRP, claiming “the suits have the champagne on ice cuz they know that they’re about to go break records with the XRP ETFs.” Beyond the ETFs, Rector emphasized on-chain and DeFi dynamics that he believes reduce liquid supply. He cited activity around Flare’s FXRP mechanism, describing wallet flows and escrowed balances as visible on public ledgers: “So far, Flare has already locked up almost $60 million worth of XRP. That’s equivalent to about 20 million XRP.” Rector broadened his supply-tightening thesis to digital asset treasury (DAT) companies, asserting they had “already actually acquired 10% of the overall Ethereum supply” and were now “coming for XRP.” He also alluded to tokenization and payments initiatives he associates with Ripple and the XRP Ledger, asserting that “they really are going to tokenize on the XRP Ledger” and bring “flows of liquidity that are valued in the trillions of dollars” onto the network. As evidence of institutional momentum, he pointed to European and Middle Eastern developments. Citing a post from VanEck’s Matthew Sigel, he said “Luxembourg becomes the first EU sovereign wealth fund to buy Bitcoin with a 1% position via ETF,” and noted recent meetings between Ripple executives and Luxembourg’s finance minister. He also referenced Ripple’s expansion in the Middle East, including Bahrain, as reinforcing an institutional pipeline. On market structure, Rector said the recent intraday push lower found support above a level he is monitoring. “I zoomed out… to when we last back tested $2.70 just to show you… support,” he said, noting a visit to “about 2.77… people are front running that $2.70 level… we’re up to $2.81.” For investors worried that a peak is already in, he pushed back: “Was that the end of the XRP bull run? Did I just miss the top at 3.66? Absolutely not… imagine thinking that now’s the time to sell when Wall Street’s about to start selling it for you.” Rector’s explicit forward targets were sweeping. He said newcomers could “still… triple it up at least by next year,” and that a “10x” remained plausible under his “$20 to $30 base case,” characterizing “double-digit XRP” as “easily done.” Throughout, he tied the outlook to a cluster of catalysts—“ETFs, digital asset treasury companies, and institutional adoption”—and to what he regards as a steady constriction of tradable float via DeFi lockups. “That’s what leads to a supply shock,” he said. “This party’s just getting started.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.815.

For more information, please contact: Sequana Medical Investor relationsE: IR@sequanamedical.com T: +44 (0) 797 342 9917 About Sequana Medical Sequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload, a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease, heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality, repeated hospitalizations, severe pain, difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care, they become ineffective, intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options, resulting in poor clinical outcomes, high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing "diuretic resistant" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload, and are intended to deliver major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients, while reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company received US FDA approval for the alfapump System for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis in December 2024, following the grant of FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in 2019. In Sequana Medical's POSEIDON study, a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada, the pivotal cohort of 40 patients implanted with the alfapump showed at 6 and 24 months post-implantation the virtual elimination of therapeutic paracentesis and an improvement in quality of life.1,2 Sequana Medical has commenced US commercialisation through a small specialty salesforce initially targeting US liver transplant centers – 90 of these centers perform more than 90% of US liver transplants annually. CMS has approved the New Technology Add-on Payment for the alfapump when performed in the hospital inpatient setting as of October 1, 2025. Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure published in European Journal of Heart Failure in April 2024 support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE, a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study, have been successfully treated with DSR, resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.3 The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients, which is dependent on securing additional financing. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent, Belgium. For further information, please visit www.sequanamedical.com.

Title: Fortress Co-CEO’s Unexpected Death Rattles $53 Billion Debt Firm

(Bloomberg) -- Well before they became co-chief executive officers, Drew McKnight and Josh Pack were known for their close partnership within Fortress Investment Group. The pair had worked together for two decades, and Pack had followed McKnight in moving his family to Dallas from California during the pandemic. They established Texas as a new power center for the Manhattan firm, and then in 2023, were instrumental in a Mubadala Investment Co.-backed buyout of the company that led to their ascent to the top job. But last week, McKnight was suddenly on his own. He faced the firm’s staff on a conference call and cried as he delivered stunning news: Pack had just died. The 51-year-old left behind a wife, four children and a perch at the top of a $53 billion debt investing giant. His death — just after he moved to London from Dallas to spearhead a Europe expansion — has rattled a roughly 900-person, tight-knit company. McKnight and Pack had embarked on an ambitious plan to double assets in a half-decade and become the face of Fortress’ aspirations to move beyond its distressed roots. Now Fortress must navigate a leadership shock, rally the firm’s grieving employees, and stick to the growth plan Pack helped craft. “While we have a giant hole in our hearts for Josh that will never be filled, we also have a team and a culture that Josh helped shape and cultivate,” McKnight said in a statement. Fortress elevated managing partner Jack Neumark as co-CEO after Pack’s death. Neumark was among Fortress’ four largest individual investors in the Mubadala buyout, along with Pack. Key backers got the news about Pack from Fortress employees on Monday, Sept. 29. Hours after those calls, an email went out to the firm’s wider investor community letting them know Pack had died, without providing further details, said a person familiar with the matter. It has sought to reassure them about the overall state of the business, according to another person. The New Mexico State Investment Council had been finalizing a commitment of up to $250 million with the asset manager. While it isn’t walking away from the deal, the state sovereign wealth fund is now taking more time to review the situation, according to people familiar with the matter. A New Mexico State representative declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for Mubadala. The Pack family declined to comment through Fortress. Distressed Bets Founded in 1998 by a group of executives including former BlackRock Inc. partner Wes Edens, Fortress was known for taking on messy bets — including indebted private railway Brightline, the Trump Organization and now-incarcerated Elizabeth Holmes’ biotech startup, Theranos. Fortress went public in 2007 before being taken private under Softbank Group a decade later. Viewed by colleagues as even-keeled, Pack, a self-described “day one employee” of the credit business, built his reputation on deals like supermarket chain Albertsons and Alamo Drafthouse, a struggling movie-theater chain that Fortress bet on during the depths of the pandemic and later sold to Sony Pictures. Pack shaped key parts of the firm along the way, including its real estate arm. Under him, the net-lease business — which acquires properties from firms that then lease them back — deployed $19 billion since 2002 and had been expanding into Europe. The late co-CEO was “always a man full of great ideas, very collaborative, very humble,” said Ike Suri, chairman and CEO of fintech FundingShield, who has known Pack since his days at Wells Fargo & Co. “People looked up to him, and that’s a very sad thing to see him go this soon.” As Pack and McKnight pursued their goal of hitting $100 billion under management, they had the tricky task of managing some of the firm’s legacy bets on unloved assets. Some of these exposed the firm to volatility and negative headlines — including private railway Brightline, whose struggles in Florida have rippled through the municipal bond market. Fee-related revenue declined about 20% in 2023 because of a decision to terminate a management contract on a legacy permanent capital vehicle, according to people with knowledge of the matter. (Not including that contract, gross management fees increased about 6% in 2023 from the prior year.) Through it all, the pair aimed to establish Fortress’ presence around the globe. This year, Pack was posted to London to spearhead the firm’s expansion in the region and its business with wealthy individuals. It opened a new office in Abu Dhabi in May and secured $1 billion from Mubadala to pursue opportunities in credit and other strategies. Even as the firm expanded around the globe, Pack kept a lower profile than many of his peers atop large asset managers. Employees remain stunned by the loss of their leader. He always appeared to be in good health in client and internal meetings, according to people who were present. For now, they continue the work that Pack started. Fortress is setting its sights on closing $3 billion across various funds in October. “The ability of our team to adapt over the past 10 days is exactly what we would expect after working together for decades,” Neumark, the newly appointed co-CEO, said in a statement. “And that’s part of what we learned from Josh.” More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: UK lifts retail ban on crypto ETPs, unlocking access to a £800B market

With ISA approval looming, the market could see billions in untapped demand for crypto exposure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The UK has taken a decisive step toward mainstream crypto adoption after the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) lifted its three-year ban on retail trading of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). The decision, announced on Oct. 8, reverses a January 2021 restriction that prevented retail investors from accessing crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) over volatility and consumer-protection concerns. As a result, trading on approved UK exchanges such as the London Stock Exchange is expected to begin on Oct. 16, marking a new phase for regulated crypto investment in Europe’s largest financial market. According to the FCA, eligible ETNs will initially cover Bitcoin and Ethereum, and all trading will occur through authorized UK-based investment exchanges with consumer safeguards in place. The FCA’s decision arrives at a pivotal moment for the market, as it’s as both a policy breakthrough and a pipeline catalyst for new inflows. Bradley Duke, Bitwise’s head of Europe, called it “incredibly positive,” emphasizing that the UK remains Europe’s largest investment base. The entry of retail capital, he said, “unlocks a deep pool of demand that has been sitting on the sidelines since 2021.” The impact of the FCE’s move could extend beyond access alone. The HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) confirmed that crypto ETNs will become qualifying investments for the Innovative Finance ISA from April 2026. This means UK investors can now hold crypto ETPs in tax-advantaged accounts such as Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) and pension schemes. This could also reshape retail participation, as the UK’s 12 million crypto users would be incentivized to hold Bitcoin in their pension. According to a report from UK authorities, Britons held roughly £872 billion in ISA accounts. If even 1% of that capital is allocated to crypto ETPs, it would represent over £8 billion (equivalent to more than $9 billion) in potential inflows, which is more than enough to shift the global market share of crypto exposure. However, skepticism about the industry still remains. Hargreaves Larsdown, the largest investment platform in the UK, has decried this potential surge in investment. According to the firm: “The HL Investment view is that bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income and shouldn’t be relied upon to help clients meet their financial goals. Performance assumptions are not possible to analyze for crypto, and unlike other alternative asset classes it has no intrinsic value.” Despite these concerns, momentum around crypto investment products continues to accelerate globally. In the US, spot Bitcoin ETFs have accumulated $62.8 billion in inflows since their launch in 2024, with net assets reaching $164.7 billion, according to SoSo Value data. Additional data from CoinShares showed that global crypto funds have attracted $45.5 billion in new capital this year. These numbers are likely to climb significantly as traditional financial institutional giants like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley advise investors to allocate their funds to the top crypto.

Title: Morgan Stanley opens crypto investments to all clients

Share this article Morgan Stanley will allow all clients, including those with retirement accounts, to invest in crypto funds starting October 15, CNBC reported today. The leading wealth manager, which oversees more than $8 trillion in client assets, began allowing its financial advisors to offer Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to high-net-worth clients last August. However, eligibility was limited to investors with a net worth of at least $1.5 million, an aggressive risk tolerance, and taxable brokerage accounts, excluding retirement portfolios. The bank will rely on an automated system to monitor client portfolios and guard against concentrated exposure to crypto. For now, advisors can recommend only Bitcoin funds from BlackRock and Fidelity, though Morgan Stanley is considering expanding offerings to include Ether or Solana products. Morgan Stanley is deepening its crypto strategy to meet growing client demand and stay competitive. The bank’s global investment committee recently recommended a maximum initial crypto allocation of up to 4%, varying based on investment goals. Morgan Stanley’s decision to remove restrictions on client crypto access comes just weeks after it announced plans to enable direct trading of Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana through its E-Trade platform.

VANCOUVER, BC, Oct. 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Gold shattered the $4,000 barrier for the first time in history earlier this week[1], driven by persistent inflation concerns and safe haven demand amid economic uncertainty. So far in 2025, mining stocks are already soaring 135%[2] as companies capture extraordinary margin expansion while production costs stabilize, creating unprecedented profit leverage[3] that positions well-managed exploration and development companies to capitalize on this historic environment, including Rush Gold Corp. (CSE: RGN) (FSE: B6H), PPX Mining Corp. (TSXV: PPX) (OTCPK: SNNGF), Austin Gold Corp. (NYSE-American: AUST), K92 Mining Inc. (TSX: KNT) (OTCQX: KNTNF), and Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE-American: IDR). Wall Street heavyweight Goldman Sachs raised its forecast to $4,900 per ounce by late 2026[4], citing sticky demand from Western investors and continued central bank buying that shows no signs of slowing. The convergence of accommodative monetary policy, geopolitical tensions, and institutional diversification away from traditional reserve assets creates compelling timing for investors to establish positions in mining companies before the next wave of institutional capital flows into the sector. Rush Gold Corp. (CSE: RGN) (FSE: B6H) recently released a corporate update highlighting significant momentum in its first 90 days as a publicly traded company, with a completed financing and strategic land consolidation positioning the explorer in one of Nevada's most historically productive silver-gold districts. The Vancouver-based company is advancing two adjacent properties in the Republic Mining District, Nye County, Nevada, a region that produced high-grade silver in the early 1900s but has seen limited modern exploration until recent years. The district sits along Nevada's Walker Lane structural corridor, which has hosted numerous major discoveries and continues to attract significant exploration investment. "As we mark our third month as a publicly traded company, Rush Gold Corp. is proud of the strong foundation we've built as a U.S.-focused mineral exploration company," said Anthony Zelen, CEO of Rush Gold. "We are incredibly excited about the potential of our flagship Skylight property in Nevada, and the recent acquisition of the Legal Tender silver property which further strengthens our portfolio." The flagship Skylight property spans 330 acres and covers what geologists believe is a well-preserved epithermal gold-silver system, a geological environment where hot, mineral-rich fluids deposited precious metals underground and subsequent erosion has not removed the mineralization. Newmont Mining and Rimfire Minerals Corporation explored the ground as part of a joint venture in the 2000s, identifying it as one of their highest-priority targets before the partnership ended and the claims eventually lapsed. Their limited drilling intersected gold in three of six holes, including 10.67 meters grading 0.49 grams per tonne gold, but the core target beneath a preserved silica cap remains largely untested. Recent technical work has added validation to the geological model. ASTER satellite imaging revealed a 1.2-kilometer alteration footprint at Skylight, precisely the type of large-scale geochemical signature that characterizes significant epithermal systems in Nevada. The technology identifies surface minerals associated with gold-silver mineralization, effectively mapping the hydrothermal system's potential extent. The Walker Lane corridor has emerged as a major exploration focus following the discovery of over 16 million ounces of gold near Beatty. Blackrock Silver has defined significant silver resources at Tonopah to the south, while Fortitude Gold is advancing the County Line Project toward production just north of Rush Gold's position, with numerous other explorers actively acquiring ground and initiating work throughout the district. "Following the spectacular discovery of over 16 million ounces of gold near Beatty, exploration activity along Walker Lane has accelerated significantly," said Zelen. "We feel Rush Gold is strategically positioned within a highly prospective exploration corridor." Rush Gold has consolidated its district footprint through the recent option agreement for the Legal Tender property, located just three kilometers north of Skylight. The historic project covers most of the Republic Mining District and includes several early 1900s mine workings. Historic sampling has returned selective grab samples including 1,875 grams per tonne silver and 4.94 grams per tonne gold from old mine dumps, confirming the district's high-grade mineralization potential. Coming off of closing its upsized private placement at $500,000, Rush Gold now has the capital to advance targeted field programs. Near-term work will focus on refining targets from ASTER satellite data and 3D geophysics at Skylight, while conducting systematic follow-up at Legal Tender's historic workings. The company's phase-gated exploration approach is designed to preserve capital while testing the highest-priority targets identified by previous operators but never properly drilled. With gold trading above $4,000 per ounce for the first time in history, exploration projects in proven districts with strong technical merit and major company validation are attracting renewed attention. Lower-grade zones that were marginal at lower price levels can screen as economic at today's elevated prices, expanding the potential scope of viable targets. Nevada remains one of the world's top mining jurisdictions according to the Fraser Institute, offering established infrastructure, favorable permitting pathways, and a mining-friendly regulatory environment. Rush Gold listed on the CSE on June 23, 2025, raising $450,000 through its initial public offering at $0.10 per share. The company also trades on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under symbol B6H, providing access to both North American and European investors as it advances toward field programs at its Nevada properties.

(TSXV: PPX) (OTCPK: SNNGF) has executed a binding Letter of Intent with Glencore Peru S.A.C. to advance its Igor Project through a strategic equity investment at C$0.237 per unit, representing a 15.4% premium to the 30-day VWAP and delivering Glencore a 9.99% ownership stake. The agreement includes a life-of-mine offtake arrangement for 100% of precious-metals concentrates produced from Igor, ensuring guaranteed sales through Glencore's global marketing network. "Signing this binding LOI with Glencore is a significant milestone for PPX," said Brian Imrie, Executive Chairman of PPX Mining. "The combination of strategic equity, a life-of-mine offtake framework, and access to Glencore Technology provides a strong platform to advance Igor responsibly and efficiently while aligning our financing and commercialization pathways." Up to 25% of proceeds will fund plant construction, commissioning, and start-up working capital, with the remainder supporting exploration, permitting, and development of Igor's sulfide areas. The transaction includes technical collaboration through Glencore Technology for tailings retreatment optimization and operational enhancements at PPX's CIL and flotation plant. Austin Gold Corp. (NYSE-American: AUST) has designed a detailed CSAMT geophysical survey at its Stockade Mountain Project after determining that historical gradient-array IP-resistivity data was unsuitable for imaging potential vein-hosting structures at target depths of 200-300 meters. The company's 2024 soil sampling program at Lone Mountain revealed significant enrichments of arsenic, antimony, and thallium over large areas associated with gold anomalies up to 0.128 g/t. The company has received permission from the Oregon Water Resources Department to drill a water well for exploration activities, planned for Q4 2025. Austin is deferring its RC drilling program until 2026 to incorporate CSAMT survey results into drill targeting while continuing geological mapping and geochemical sampling at Lone Mountain. K92 Mining Inc. (TSX: KNT) (OTCQX: KNTNF) delivered strong Q3 2025 production of 44,323 ounces gold equivalent, comprised of 42,244 oz gold, 1,323,538 lbs copper and 34,831 oz silver, with the company processing 137,172 tonnes at a head grade of 11.2 g/t AuEq. The operation achieved record total material mined of 353,770 tonnes with multiple daily records in late September, including 6,404 tonnes on September 29, demonstrating increased productivity from commissioning the first material pass combined with surface trucks operating in the twin incline. "The third quarter marked another strong period of progress for K92 both in terms of production and continued execution of the Stage 3 Expansion," said John Lewins, CEO of K92 Mining. "With the commissioning of the new 1.2 million tonnes-per-annum Stage 3 Expansion Process Plant nearing completion, this marks an exciting period in the Company's history as K92 transitions into a Tier-1, mid-tier producer." Construction of the new Stage 3 Expansion Process Plant is complete and was delivered under budget, with ore already introduced into crushing, grinding and flotation circuits keeping first gold pour and concentrate production on track for the first half of Q4 2025. With 90% of Stage 3 growth capital spent or committed and remaining on budget, K92 maintains its 2025 production guidance of 160,000-185,000 oz AuEq after achieving more than 80% of the lower end in the first three quarters. Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE-American: IDR) reported high-grade gold intercepts within broader mineralized zones at the Red Star area of its Golden Chest Mine, highlighted by drill hole GC 24-276 returning 5.13 g/t over 13.5 meters including 14.72 g/t over 2.3 meters in drilled thickness, as the company was also added to the VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) effective September 19, 2025. The completion of underground drill stations at the 941-level now allows for better-oriented drilling to estimate true thickness and delineate the shape of mineralized zones at this discovery announced in October 2024. "The Red Star area is a unique prospect at the Golden Chest compared to the typical veins we've mined and explored previously," said John Swallow, President and CEO of Idaho Strategic Resources. "Traditionally, at the Golden Chest our operations have centered around narrow, high-grade veins within waste rock. The Red Star is unique in that there are broad zones of lower grade mineralization surrounding the higher-grade intercepts." The newly developed drill stations are strategically located to target other priority areas north of existing operations including the Claggett and Popcorn veins in the footwall of the Idaho fault. Idaho Strategic plans for the underground drill and one surface drill to continue working through year-end, with the underground program targeting the Red Star area while the surface drill focuses on resource delineation at the Paymaster.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is getting close to $100B milestone

BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is rewriting ETF history, nearing the $100 billion mark faster than any fund ever launched. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF is pulling in cash at a speed never seen in the fund industry. After another $4 billion streak of inflows this week, IBIT now holds more than 800,000 BTC, worth roughly $98 billion, and is within striking distance of a milestone that no ETF has ever reached this quickly. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart estimate IBIT now generates over $240 million a year in revenue from its 0.25% fee, making it BlackRock’s most profitable product across its global lineup of more than 1,000 ETFs. That’s a stunning outcome for a fund launched less than two years ago and one that has already redefined what “mainstream adoption” looks like for Bitcoin. IBIT’s scale is unmatched. According to Bloomberg data, the fund has taken in $37 billion in its first year and another $26 billion so far in 2025. With more than $70 billion in assets ahead of its nearest competitor, BlackRock’s Bitcoin fund has effectively consolidated Wall Street’s control of the crypto ETF landscape. Farside data shows total spot Bitcoin ETF holdings now exceed 1.3 million BTC, with IBIT accounting for more than 60% of that supply. The growth has been powered by a feedback loop of price and inflows. Bitcoin reached a new ATH of $125,000 over the weekend, extending a 70% rally since Donald Trump’s election win in November. His administration’s push for broader crypto integration, including friendlier custody and ETF frameworks, has unlocked a wave of institutional demand that mirrors the early days of the gold ETF boom two decades ago. Every uptick in price brings in fresh money from allocators eager to gain exposure without dealing with wallets or private keys. Balchunas and Seyffart noted that IBIT is on track to hit $100 billion in assets about five times faster than any ETF in history, a record that puts it in a league of its own. The world’s largest ETFs (SPY, QQQ, VOO) all took years to cross that threshold. IBIT could do it in under 24 months. “The fact that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product is extremely impressive,” Seyffart told Bloomberg, recalling that even their “most bullish expectations” have been surpassed. Behind the scenes, this surge reflects both marketing muscle and timing. BlackRock used its retail distribution network and institutional relationships to channel demand into a single flagship product. According to Kaiko’s Adam Morgan McCarthy, the “digital gold” narrative gained new traction earlier this year, especially after the US tariff announcement in April triggered a rush into perceived inflation hedges. ETF data supports that view. Over the past two weeks alone, IBIT added nearly $4 billion in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors, bringing its Bitcoin balance above 800,000 BTC. That’s roughly 4% of the entire Bitcoin supply and more than what MicroStrategy and the next nine largest corporate holders combined possess. At its current growth rate, IBIT could soon hold one out of every 20 Bitcoin ever mined: an unprecedented concentration of BTC in a regulated product. BlackRock has declined to comment publicly, but the message to competitors is clear: scale wins. Fidelity’s FBTC, the second-largest spot ETF, remains roughly $70 billion smaller. Even if the rest of the market sees healthy inflows, the center of gravity is now fixed around one ticker. IBIT’s rise has turned Bitcoin into a fully financialized asset: not just a hedge or an experiment, but a cornerstone product of the world’s biggest asset manager. Whether that’s bullish or concerning depends on perspective. Bitcoin’s decentralization was built on independence from institutions. Yet the market now finds itself cheering a fund whose success depends on them. Either way, the $100 billion mark could be just a few trading sessions away.

Title: ‘Cascade’ Price Warning Puts Bitcoin On The Brink Ahead Of Imminent BlackRock $100 Billion Turning Point

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 10/10 update below. This post was originally published on October 09 Bitcoin has surged into October, with traders strapping in for a market “frenzy” in coming months. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has hit a fresh all-time high over $126,000 per bitcoin, giving it a market capitalization of around $2.5 trillion amid fears of a Federal Reserve-fueled U.S. dollar crisis. Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump floats the idea of a $2,000 Covid stimulus check-style tariff dividend, BlackRock’s market-leading spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on the verge of crossing $100 billion in assets under management—on track to hit the milestone far faster than any other ETF in history. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock’s IBIT, which launched in January 2024 to huge fanfare, has surged thanks to massive inflows over the last few months and the increase in the value of the bitcoin price itself. The fund now has assets of $98.6 billion and could cross the psychological line in a matter of days. 10/10 update: The bitcoin price has dipped as the crypto market rally comes off the boil, even as the Federal Reserve looks all but certain to cut interest rates again later this month. “Bitcoin volatility is poised for a breakout. Implied volatilities across 14, 30, and 90-day expiries have surged to their highest levels in the past 30 days, pointing to increased anticipation of big moves ahead," Sean Dawson, head of research at leading onchain options platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “This spike comes as markets price in a near-certain 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month, with Polymarket odds currently sitting at 90%. Following a 3% dip from $123,000 to $120,000, bitcoin has recovered to $121,600. According to Coinglass data, a dense band of short positions is at risk of liquidation just above this level. A modest push upward could trigger a cascade of liquidations and propel BTC back toward $125,000 and beyond." Bitcoin and crypto traders remain bullish despite the latest bitcoin pull back, with analysts pointing to a mismatch between current price action and the underlying market. “Bitcoin is up 7% in October, perfectly matching its seasonal pattern — but this time, the rally feels different,” 10x Research analysts led by chief executive Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note. “Despite trading near all-time highs, momentum is fading, and what once looked like a clean breakout now sits in no-man’s-land. Beneath the surface, the story unfolds differently: institutional whales are buying aggressively, while early adopters quietly sell into strength.” Bitcoin ETFs could add another $20 billion worth of inflows before the end of the year, according to some market watchers, with the lion's share of that likely to go to BlackRock's bitcoin fund. “Following the recent rally over the first weekend of ‘Uptober’, which saw bitcoin’s price surge to a new all-time high above $125,000, record-level ETF inflows totalled above $3 billion across the first week of the month,” Dom Harz, cofounder of bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) platform BOB, said in emailed comments. BlackRock’s IBIT is on track to hit the $100 billion milestone about five times faster than any other ETF in history, according to a report from Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, with it also “by far the youngest” of the 20 largest ETFs. BlackRock's flagship S&P 500 ETF took 25 years to reach its current revenue levels, while IBIT has achieved higher profitability in less than two years. The fund, charging a 0.25% fee, is thought to bring in annual revenue of $240 million for BlackRock, becoming the most profitable BlackRock ETF when it surpassed BlackRock’s IWF and EFA funds in July. “The fact that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product is extremely impressive," Seyffart, who added that BlackRock’s bitcoin fund—and rival crypto-tied ETFs—faced a lot of criticism ahead of their launches last year, told Bloomberg. “We were very bullish on the amount of demand and flows that we thought would come into the bitcoin ETFs, but even these numbers have blown away our most bullish expectations.” The BlackRock bitcoin fund has become the de facto route for traditional finance to gain bitcoin exposure, with the surging popularity of the "debasement trade" this year catapulting bitcoin higher along with gold. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “While it’s very possible that gold will continue to outperform other assets for the foreseeable future, it has certainly become a crowded trade,” Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. "That means there is more risk involved in initiating exposure at this point. After more than a 50% rally in the gold price year-to-date, attention may now turn to other alternatives that express a similar view. These include other metals and commodities, tokenized real assets, and bitcoin, which remain undervalued against gold. These alternative assets can all play a similar role in portfolios—a hedge against future inflation and political intervention, and an alternative to the U.S. dollar and other debasing currencies.” Crypto ETFs more widely drew record inflows of almost $6 billion globally last week, according to data from CoinShares. "This level of investment highlights the growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty," James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, wrote in the weekly report.

Title: Bitcoin’s 55% short skew sparks debate: Hedge or hype?

Shorts stack, liquidity piles – BTC’s weekly drama unfolds. Shorts are piling up, but spot demand remains strong. With liquidity building, fading Bitcoin here is bold. However, the setup could trigger a short squeeze. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF is soaking up 84% of this month’s $5 billion inflows, contrasting mid-August outflows, making leveraged shorting a risky play. Is it still too early to move against Bitcoin [BTC]? Weekly, BTC’s showing classic post-ATH behavior. The last two ATHs at $123k and $124k in Q3 both printed red candles, averaging a -1.5% pullback. A similar pattern appears to be repeating. After kicking off the week with the longest wick stretching to a $125k ATH, the candle is already 1.3% in the red, with the lowest wick reaching $119k. In short, betting against Bitcoin could be a strategically sound move. Source: Coinglass Backing this up, derivatives remain skewed to the short side, with 55% of positions betting against Bitcoin. In fact, that’s a +4% jump from the previous day, marking the steepest short skew we’ve seen in a month. Moreover, nothing underscores this more than AMBCrypto’s recent report, highlighting a massive $420 million short opened by an OG BTC whale at $120,678, showing smart money is bracing for a repeat post-ATH flush. However, with BTC trading at $121,600 at press time, that position is sitting on a 0.76% unrealized loss. That’s roughly $3.2 million bleeding on the books, reiterating the question: Is it still too early to bet against BTC? Institutional outflows are hitting BTC ETFs as fear creeps in. That said, BlackRock’s IBIT spot ETF is still racking up straight inflows, taking 84% of this month’s $5 billion. Technically, that’s nearly $4.2 billion flowing in, making IBIT a key bid and a major catalyst for Bitcoin. Notably, that’s a sharp divergence from mid-August, when IBIT made up 70% of $800 million in outflows, which slammed two weekly reds and sent Bitcoin down 9% from its $124k all-time high. Source: SoSo Value Against this backdrop, stacking leveraged shorts is a risky play. Analyst Aixbt echoed the same view, calling shorting into heavy ETF inflows and low profit-taking a “bold move,” with greed pushing traders to bet on a quick pop rather than sustained downside. In fact, $120.96 million in short liquidity is stacked around $121.8k, showing how much near-term juice is piled up. However, with bids still solid, BTC’s consolidation is shaping up as a bullish setup for a potential short squeeze.

Title: Billions “vanish” in First Brands bankruptcy as creditors demand independent probe

First Brands Group, an auto parts supplier, filed for bankruptcy with liabilities between 10?50 billion amid allegations of extensive debt rehypothecation. Creditors claim up to $2.3 billion has "simply vanished," raising suspicions of collateral pledged multiple times. Major financial players, including UBS, Millennium Management and Jefferies, face hundreds of millions in losses. Jefferies, the companyâs long-time banker, faces reputational damage as its role in opaque financing deals comes under scrutiny. Creditors demand an independent examiner, questioning the integrity of First Brandsâ internal investigation. 10?50 billion amid allegations of extensive debt rehypothecation.

Creditors demand an independent examiner, questioning the integrity of First Brandsâ internal investigation. Creditors demand an independent examiner, questioning the integrity of First Brandsâ internal investigation. The sudden implosion of First Brands Group, an Ohio-based auto parts supplier, has sent shockwaves through Wall Street, exposing what creditors allege is one of the most chaotic corporate bankruptcies in recent memory. With liabilities estimated betweenÂ 10?50 billion, the companyâs collapse has left financiers scrambling to locate billions in missing fundsâraising urgent questions about fraud, regulatory oversight and the hidden risks lurking in private credit markets. First Brands filed for Chapter 11 protection in late September in Texas, but the real story lies in the tangled web of off-balance-sheet financing, rehypothecated debt and potential double-pledged collateral that creditors say has left them empty-handed. Trade finance firm Raistone, owed millions, claims $2.3 billion has "simply vanished," while emails between lawyers reveal alarming gaps in accountability â including admissions that segregated accounts meant to protect creditors hold "$0." The fallout has ensnared some of financeâs biggest names, from UBS OâConnor ($500M exposure) to Millennium Management ($100M loss) and Jefferies, whose decade-long relationship with First Brands now faces intense scrutiny. Wall Streetâs winners and losers While most creditors brace for steep losses, a few savvy investors emerged unscathedâor even profited. Apollo Global Management and Diameter Capital Partners had shorted First Brandsâ debt before its collapse, a rare but lucrative bet in private credit markets. Jefferies, however, finds itself in the hot seat. The bank not only arranged risky loans for First Brands but also had deeper ties through its Leucadia Asset Management unit, which held $715 million in receivables linked to the company. When lenders paused a $6 billion refinancing deal in Augustâspooked by irregularities in First Brandsâ accountingâthe company spiraled into bankruptcy within weeks. Now, Jefferies faces reputational damage as clients question its due diligence. BlackRock has already requested partial redemptions from a Jefferies-linked fund exposed to First Brandsâ receivables. The shadowy world of off-balance-sheet financing First Brandsâ downfall highlights the dangers of opaque financing structures like factoring and supply-chain financeâmethods that allow companies to borrow against future cash flows without clear disclosures. The company reportedly factored 70% of its revenues, meaning it sold unpaid invoices to investors for upfront cash. But creditors allege these invoices may have been pledged multiple times as collateralâa practice akin to selling the same house to multiple buyers. Charles Moore, First Brandsâ restructuring officer, admitted investigators are probing whether assets were "commingled" or pledged "more than once." If true, it would mark a stunning breakdown in financial controlsâand potentially fraud. Systemic risks beyond first brands The First Brands debacle underscores broader vulnerabilities in todayâs credit markets, where private lending has surged with minimal oversight. CLOs & private credit funds: Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) and private lenders, including Blackstone and PGIM, hold chunks of First Brandsâ debtânow trading at 15 cents on the dollar. Regulatory blind spots: Unlike publicly traded bonds, private credit deals often lack transparency, leaving investors in the dark about a companyâs true leverage. AI bubble distraction: With markets fixated on AI-driven stock rallies, few noticed the rot beneath the surfaceâuntil it was too late. Judge Christopher Lopez, overseeing the bankruptcy, remarked: "I donât think since my time on the bench Iâve seen anything like this." A warning sign for markets First Brandsâ collapse is more than a corporate failureâitâs a cautionary tale about the hidden risks in todayâs financial system. As creditors demand an independent probe, the case could expose deeper misconduct, from accounting fraud to lender complicity. For Wall Street, the lesson is clear: When debt is piled atop debt, and collateral disappears into a "black box," even the most sophisticated investors can be left holding the bag. And with private credit markets ballooning to $1.7 trillion, First Brands may be just the first domino to fall.

Apollo Global Management and Diameter Capital Partners had shorted First Brandsâ debt before its collapse, a rare but lucrative bet in private credit markets. Jefferies, however, finds itself in the hot seat. The bank not only arranged risky loans for First Brands but also had deeper ties through its Leucadia Asset Management unit, which held $715 million in receivables linked to the company. When lenders paused a $6 billion refinancing deal in Augustâspooked by irregularities in First Brandsâ accountingâthe company spiraled into bankruptcy within weeks. Now, Jefferies faces reputational damage as clients question its due diligence. BlackRock has already requested partial redemptions from a Jefferies-linked fund exposed to First Brandsâ receivables. The shadowy world of off-balance-sheet financing First Brandsâ downfall highlights the dangers of opaque financing structures like factoring and supply-chain financeâmethods that allow companies to borrow against future cash flows without clear disclosures. The company reportedly factored 70% of its revenues, meaning it sold unpaid invoices to investors for upfront cash. But creditors allege these invoices may have been pledged multiple times as collateralâa practice akin to selling the same house to multiple buyers. Charles Moore, First Brandsâ restructuring officer, admitted investigators are probing whether assets were "commingled" or pledged "more than once."

For Wall Street, the lesson is clear: When debt is piled atop debt, and collateral disappears into a "black box," even the most sophisticated investors can be left holding the bag.

Title: ‘AI will change the way we work. But it will take time, and then it will go fast’

Wall Street is hedging its bets. While the S&P 500, the world’s most followed stock market index, keeps hitting record highs every other day amid a three-year bull run, gold, which usually moves in the opposite direction to shares, has been on a tear of its own. The price of the safe-haven asset has jumped more than 50 per cent so far this year to breach $4,000 (€3,443) an ounce for the first time. Reasons for the gold rush abound. Many market strategists say the precious metal is being used as a hedge against economic uncertainty caused by Trump administration tariffs. Some point to a fall this year in the value of the dollar, the currency in which gold is priced. And others say gold is a safe bet in case the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has been fuelling the stock market starts to fizzle out. But, for Ron O’Hanley, chairman and chief executive of State Street – a leading administrator to the global investment management industry and one of the biggest asset managers in its own right – the reason for the anomaly may be more simple. [ ‘Gold-plated Fomo’ powers bullion’s record-breaking rallyOpens in new window ] “In some ways, gold is an indicator of what investors’ beliefs are about long-term inflation prospects,” O’Hanley says, speaking to The Irish Times in Dublin this week. There are good reasons to be concerned about rising inflation over time. “If you look at government debt levels, there’s been a fundamental change if you think about the ’08 period to where we are now,” he says. “The pandemic proved quite costly in the taking on of government debt.” Global government debt surged from 58 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 to 93 per cent last year, or almost $100 trillion, driven by the borrowings to support businesses and households during Covid lockdowns, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some investors believe central banks may, eventually, tolerate higher inflation to reduce the real burden of public debt. So, why is the equity market continuing to rise? “In aggregate, consumer debt levels are in pretty good shape relative to where they were in the past. Corporate debt levels are also in pretty good shape,” says O’Hanley. “That is a good signal to the equity market.” The impact of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have driven the S&P 500 in recent years – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – is now starting to broaden to other companies, he says. Official interest rates are continuing to decline. Meanwhile, corporate earnings are, for the time being at least, also holding up well – with the consensus forecast among analysts pointing to 10 per cent earnings per share growth this year in the US – even as many industries are absorbing much of the impact of tariffs, rather than passing them on to customers. A survey published by KPMG last week found that just a fifth of US businesses have passed on over half of new tariff expenses. O’Hanley, whose group has $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration (almost the equivalent of the US and EU economies combined, measured by GDP), is on the fence – publicly at least – on the long-term effects of US president Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. “That’s the $64,000 question that everybody’s asking. And probably the entity that is asking it the most is the Federal Reserve. There is a school of thought that the tariffs are a one-time price reset and they shouldn’t actually reset inflation expectations. Others say this has a rolling impact that will be cumulative – and in a way that we just don’t know.” The biggest challenge is ongoing uncertainty, as many tariffs are still not finalised, he says, more than six months after Trump’s Liberation Day speech. The broader question is the future of globalisation. “Whether you call it deglobalisation or a reordering of globalisation, we’re going to see change – and national interests become much more prominent,” he says. “We’re in a period of adjustment. And the biggest challenge to investors and companies is that it’s very hard to make a decision that has long-term implications when you’ve got this kind of uncertainty.” It must be disorienting to ponder for someone whose career began at the dawn of the era of hyperglobalisation. Following the completion of a master’s in business administration (MBA) at Harvard Business School in 1986, Hanley joined management consultancy McKinsey, where he would end up as a partner and head of the firm’s investment management practice worldwide. [ ‘You’d have to have been a turkey not to have made money in venture capital in 1997’Opens in new window ] He subsequently joined Mellon Financial Corporation in 1997 and went on, following the group’s 2007 merger with Bank of New York, to serve as the wider BNY Mellon group’s asset management arm. Hanley also spent a four-year stint in a senior role at Fidelity Investments before joining State Street in 2015 as head of the investment management arm. State Street traces its roots back to 1792 as Union Bank in Boston. Fifty years ago it shifted its focus from commercial banking to the plumbing work that takes place after shares and bonds are traded – like clearing, settlement and custody – as well as asset management. State Street set up an Irish operation in 1996 and has since become one of the largest international financial services employers in the State, employing about 2,300 people in offices in Dublin, Kilkenny, Naas, Co Kildare, and Drogheda, Co Louth. Almost a decade and a half ago, the investment arm bought Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM), once the crown jewel of the Irish bank. BIAM had €26 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the time. The US group had $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of the end of June. Its asset management arm, rebranded as State Street Investment Management this year, had $5.12 trillion of AUM. While O’Hanley’s appointment as incoming CEO of State Street in November 2017 marked the culmination of his career, a report in The Boston Globe the next day drew attention to a less flattering episode from his distant past. It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023 ... we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years It reported that he withdrew from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1983 after admitting to plagiarism as editor-in-chief of the Vanderbilt Law Review. A day after the report, he issued an email to staff, acknowledging that “as a student I made a big mistake”. State Street stood by O’Hanley. A spokeswoman said at the time that he had fully disclosed the matter and the organisation supported him “unequivocally”. His “track record as a corporate leader and his achievements both at State Street and in his previous roles speak for themselves”, she added. Under O’Hanley’s tenure as CEO, which officially began in January 2019, the group’s assets under custody and administration have jumped 55 per cent, while assets under management have more than doubled. While the softly-spoken executive is a lower-profile figure than many other bosses of top US financial institutions – such as JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of BlackRock or Jane Fraser at Citigroup – he is well regarded in the asset management and administration world. Last year, Global Custodian, the go-to publication for the industry, gave him a lifetime achievement award. The past three years have seen State Street take out $1.3 billion of running expenses, driven by the use of AI to do more mundane tasks normally carried out by entry-level workers, O’Hanley told a conference in June. He said the underlying global headcount fell by 4,000 last year – even as the headline figure jumped 13 per cent to 53,000 as it consolidated an Indian joint venture into the group. “It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023,” he says now. “But we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years.” [ AI’s replacement of humans in HR is emblematic of what could happen across the workplaceOpens in new window ] Machine learning has long been used for one of the most important daily tasks of State Street: calculating the net asset value (NAV) of tens of thousands of funds. “Fifteen or 20 years ago, markets would close and a flurry of activity would start to work out what happened in a fund that day – the buys, the sells, the corporate actions, the dividends paid and received – to come up with a net asset value. It typically took an hour and a half to produce and send on to clients. “What’s happening now, with machine learning, is that the NAV is being calculated transaction by transaction every day. That was, if you will, a prior generation of AI.” State Street is currently teaming up its software engineers with what he calls “AI buddies”. And it is encouraging employees to continually think differently about how AI can be used at work. “I’m often amazed at some of the ideas that come up. Some you might think of as trite, but they’re actually changing work in a fundamental way. The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem “For example, take the end of a financial period. Again, that’s a time when a lot of people spring into action. All that work has now shortened. Is it reducing the number of people? Not really. But time that was spent on identifying ‘what happened’ is collapsing. That’s created more time for the ‘so what’ of what’s happened – the analysis around it.” Most importantly, it’s left time to consider the ‘now what?’ – what are we going to do next?” he says. “AI will change the way we work. But, like a lot of change, it will take time, and then it will go fast.” Will AI lead to dystopian scenario of the robots taking over white-collar jobs, or create a future where people are free to enjoy greater leisure and personal fulfilment? “I think neither is going to happen. For the most part, it will change the nature of work for the positive,” he says. “It’ll put new requirements on employees. It will also have implications for the education system. We need to move away from a way of thinking, where people go, ‘I know exactly what my child needs. They need to go to coding camp and be prepared to be an electrical engineer.’ In future, you need to be a problem solver and you need to be a lifelong learner.” O’Hanley (68) says he spends about 60 per cent of his working life away from Boston. He has been in Ireland this week for a series of meetings and to speak at a convention in Dublin on Thursday. He has Irish roots on both sides of his family tree. Forebears of his mother, whose family name was Fagan, moved to the US in the 18th century. “The O’Hanley’s were famine emigrants from Roscommon in the late 1840s,” he says. “They took the classic journey, with a couple of generations in Canada before making their way down to the Boston-Rhode Island area.” O’Hanley also speaks about State Street’s commitment to regional Irish towns and cities, even as rival BNY Mellon recently decided to close its offices in Wexford and Cork – affecting hundreds of jobs – to improve “operational efficiency”. Dublin’s position at the epicentre of a national housing crisis makes it more important to spread the company’s Irish operations to attract and keep “talent”, O’Hanley says. [ Dublin is becoming a place of extremes, home to only the very richest and the poorestOpens in new window ] “The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem.” The CEO says he’s “actually quite encouraged” by Government efforts to boost housing supply. While economists say the Government faces major challenges meeting its target of delivering 300,000 new homes by 2030, home builders have concluded that Budget 2026 measures aimed at rebooting apartment building – together with new apartment construction guidelines unveiled during the summer – have moved the dial significantly and will help narrow the viability gap for apartment construction. “But, like everybody else,” O’Hanley says, “we’d like to see more, faster.” Name: Ron O’Hanley.

Title: In Bankruptcy Court, First Brands Creditors Demand Explanation for ‘Vanished’ Cash

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/09/2025 4:36:21 PM PDT by CFW Since it filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 29, auto-parts supplier First Brands has come under intense scrutiny for alleged accounting malpractice, opaque financing agreements, and late payments to suppliers. In an effort to shed light into the company’s murky finances, one of First Brands’ largest creditors filed an emergency motion in bankruptcy court on Wednesday calling for an independent investigation into the beleaguered firm’s books. As much as $2.3 billion in short-term financing has “simply vanished,” wrote Richard Jacobsen, counsel for Raistone, a fund that is partly owned by O’Connor, a UBS hedge fund. Raistone said it was owed at least $172 million. The Department of Justice also opened an inquiry into the collapse, The Financial Times reported on Thursday. For years, First Brands had received funding through a short-term lending strategy known as “factoring.” After the supplier delivered products to customers including Walmart and O’Reilly Autoparts, it sold the right to the customer invoices to outside investors, including units of UBS and Jefferies. The arrangement allowed First Brands to receive cash upfront, smoothing its inflows, while giving lenders the opportunity to earn interest. Factoring, part of a broader credit strategy known as trade financing, isn’t unusual. Yet First Brands allegedly borrowed billions of dollars of the short-term loans, with much of the money kept off-balance sheet through a network of separate corporate entities. It may also have sold certain invoices more than once, according to court filings and transcripts. [snip] When asked in court on Oct. 1 where roughly $2 billion of factoring cash was located, Sunny Singh, a lawyer for First Brands, said: “It’s not here. We don’t have it. Zero dollars. There’s $12 million in the bank account today. That’s it. There’s nothing else.” (Excerpt) Read more at msn.com ...

Raistone said it was owed at least $172 million. The Department of Justice also opened an inquiry into the collapse, The Financial Times reported on Thursday. For years, First Brands had received funding through a short-term lending strategy known as “factoring.” After the supplier delivered products to customers including Walmart and O’Reilly Autoparts, it sold the right to the customer invoices to outside investors, including units of UBS and Jefferies. The arrangement allowed First Brands to receive cash upfront, smoothing its inflows, while giving lenders the opportunity to earn interest. Factoring, part of a broader credit strategy known as trade financing, isn’t unusual. Yet First Brands allegedly borrowed billions of dollars of the short-term loans, with much of the money kept off-balance sheet through a network of separate corporate entities. It may also have sold certain invoices more than once, according to court filings and transcripts. [snip] When asked in court on Oct. 1 where roughly $2 billion of factoring cash was located, Sunny Singh, a lawyer for First Brands, said: “It’s not here. We don’t have it. Zero dollars. There’s $12 million in the bank account today. That’s it. There’s nothing else.” (Excerpt) Read more at msn.com ...

The money trail would start there. Or a few invoices multiple times. Just noticed both First Brands and Tricolor were Texas bankruptcies. A Texas bankruptcy insider mentioned the other day that bankruptcy volume was way up. “Chu’s Tricolor Auto Group had recently opened a 258,000-square-foot maintenance center outside Phoenix to repair and recondition the used vehicles it sold to its core market of Spanish-speaking immigrants. Thanks for posting that. Most of those names are very familiar in the Shade Tree Mechanic community, especially the trailer hitch/controller outfits. “Here is First Brands:” Crazy, isn’t it? “apparently the financial “geniuses” at some of the biggies like JP Morgan Chase just shovel billions into black holes with little to no due diligence ..” Which is why I take their economic forecasts and financial recommendations with a grain of salt....and then ignore them.

Title: Dem Influencer Who Called Trump ‘Dementia-Addled’ Cheers Violent Rioters at BlackRock

Jack Cocchiarella, a Democrat social media influencer with over 1.25 million YouTube subscribers who recently appeared on CNN and interviewed California Gov. Gavin Newsom, expressed support on social media for protesters involved in an unruly demonstration at BlackRock headquarters. Cocchiarella posted on X, “Fuck BlackRock free Palestine it’s that simple,” in response to footage of violent pro-Hamas rioters attempting to storm BlackRock headquarters in New York City. Cocchiarella, known for his political commentary, appeared on CNN last week, where he described President Donald Trump as “kind of this dementia-addled, really nursing home patient in the White House right now.” During the same exchange, Cocchiarella criticized Trump’s approach to policy negotiations, claiming the president “doesn’t seem interested in negotiating” and instead uses his time “to go out to golf” or “maybe remodel some more parts of the White House,” taking pleasure in “the traumatizing of federal workers.” Cocchiarella’s claims fall short on the facts. Just six months into his second term, President Trump brokered roughly one peace deal or ceasefire per month, a level of achievement the president Cocchiarella supports could not match in four years. In September 2024, RNC Research reported that President Joe Biden had “spent a total of 532 days (40.3% of his presidency) on vacation.” Cocchiarella conducted an interview with Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) in August, where the two discussed national politics and the Republican Party’s future leadership. Cocchiarella said: We talk a lot in our party right now about rebranding. We need to fix the brand of the Democratic Party. We do. But I think in this moment, we also have to focus on the brand of the Republican Party. These people don’t want lower taxes, more freedoms. JD Vance doesn’t care about that. JD Vance wants to take his lifestyle and impose it on you and then not live it himself. This guy’s a squish. He’s weak. He’s desperate for power. Newsom responded by warning “This is not just about Trump. This is about something much more insidious, much more alarming,” urging viewers to “pay attention” to figures like JD Vance and Stephen Miller, “The folks around Trump and those that are perpetuating, promoting Trumpism, and sometimes to your point, running circles around Trump in many respects.” He added, “JD Vance is a unique one, because he’s complete weakness masquerading as strength.” Cocchiarella’s admiration for Newsom contrasted sharply with the governor’s own record. Gavin Newsom spent $250 million on a special election to gerrymander California’s congressional map while blaming Donald Trump for a lack of wildfire aid, even as displaced residents waited for relief. Newsom called a November 4 special election under the “Election Rigging Response Act” to eliminate Republican seats in Congress, claiming he was “saving democracy” despite questions over the law’s constitutionality. Despite boasting that California’s economy rivals Japan’s, Newsom presides over surging homelessness, rising poverty, and a $68 billion budget deficit that indicate widespread mismanagement within his administration. These examples are far from exhaustive. The California governor praised Cocchiarella’s growing online platform, saying, “Let’s see the growth of your podcast, bro, what you’re doing with this YouTube channel. It’s like blowing up. That just gives you hope, and it inspires other people.” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting. Copyright © 2025 Breitbart

Title: Cardano’s Hoskinson Says Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle Is Dead, Predicts Lower Price Spikes And Dips

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has theorized that the concept of a four-year cycle for Bitcoin is fading away after holding sway for nearly 13 years. Hoskinson noted that financial heavyweights like BlackRock and Fidelity wading into BTC will reduce the volatility typically associated with the asset. In an interview with CNBC, Hoskinson noted that Bitcoin’s four-year cycle will no longer hold sway in the coming years, given the entry of new players into the space. According to Hoskinson, new institutional money and complex financial products like synthetics and derivatives will be the death of the four-year cycle. The Bitcoin four-year cycle refers to a historical market pattern revolving around the Bitcoin halving event, marked by price surges and drawdowns. The pattern begins with the accumulation phase, usually one year after the halving event, with long-term investors making sizable purchases. By the second or third year in the cycle, Bitcoin typically breaks its previous all-time high to trigger retail FOMO. The third or fourth year in the cycle is marked by sharp corrections, with previous pullbacks accumulating to 85% in losses. “I don’t think we’re gonna see those kinds of cycles anymore because there is too much money in the space and there is too much market structure,” said Hoskinson. Furthermore, Hoskinson added that new capital inflows and complex products will play a significant role in reducing Bitcoin’s volatility in the coming years. For Hoskinson, there will be “stronger floors and less volatility,” noting that large price jumps will be a thing of the past. He noted that reducing the volatility will play a significant role in boosting Bitcoin’s adoption to the “next half a billion people.” Hoskinson also added that regulations in the space will introduce new players with a specialty in stability and risk management, justifying his stance on lower volatility levels. Despite predicting the end of the four-year cycle for Bitcoin, Hoskinson disclosed that altcoin season will still exist in the near future. However, the Cardano founder opined that rather than a random price spurt for altcoins, key narratives will shape the ecosystem. For example, Hoskinson noted that the altcoin season of the last cycle was focused on the next Ethereum killer, leading to the rise of Solana and Polkadot. Hoskinson disclosed that the fourth-generation altcoin season will be dominated by privacy-focused projects, with the Cardano founder tipping Midnight for success.

Title: Wes Edens is selling his sprawling $35M penthouse — located in a famed architect’s only NYC building
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/10/09/real-estate/wes-edens-is-selling-his-sprawling-35m-penthouse/
Time Published: 2025-10-09T18:02:11Z
Full Content:
Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens has found a buyer for his trophy Manhattan penthouse, which was last asking $35 million. The posh perch overlooks the High Line at the curvaceous 520 W. 28th St., the only residential building in New York designed by the late architect Zaha Hadid — the first female architect to win the Pritzker Prize. And it’s about as far from Edens’ upbringing on a rural ranch in Montana as one could reasonably imagine. If the deal closes near that price, it would be a win for Edens, a co-founder of Fortress Investment Group and founder of New Fortress Energy, a liquefied natural gas company. As the sale is in contract, there’s no word yet on how much he’s selling it for — and who the new owner is. Edens, who got his start at BlackRock and Lehman Brothers, is also co-owner of Aston Villa Football Club and owns the e-sports franchise FlyQuest. In addition, he founded Brightline, a high-speed passenger rail system connecting Miami to Orlando at 125 miles an hour. Brightline also plans to connect Southern California and Las Vegas at speeds of about 200 miles per hour. The deal was first reported in the weekly Olshan Luxury Market Report. Edens bought the penthouse for $20.2 million in 2020 — four years after it hit the market for $50 million, and renovated it in 2022, according to the listing — from Clayton Orrigo and Stephen Ferrara, of Compass, who declined to comment on the pending deal. The 6,618-square-foot aerie comes with five bedrooms and seven baths, and features its own internal three-story sculptural staircase and private elevator — along with 2,500 square feet of outdoor space. The home opens to a great room with 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling glass windows and views over the High Line. The room is further anchored by a large gas fireplace, custom lighting and a three-story chandelier. The main floor also comes with a chef’s kitchen, a media room, a library and a private balcony. Upstairs, a main bedroom suite comes with two walk-in closets, a spa-like bath, a sitting area and a private balcony. There are also an additional three bedrooms and a wet bar. Finally, a landscaped rooftop, “rebuilt from the studs” includes a sauna, a custom hot tub and cold plunge, a barbeque and an indoor wet bar. Amenities in the building — which was completed in 2017, a year after Hadid’s death of a heart attack at age 65 — include a 75-foot sky-lit pool, robotic parking and a private IMAX theater.

Title: Analysis:'Every electron counts': Why renewables stocks are back in play

Business MILAN :A return of fund inflows into renewable energy stocks is helping to breath new life into these companies' shares, powering their strongest quarterly rise since the sustainability boom early this decade. After two years of bearish sentiment and relentless redemptions that made the sector a short-sellers' hotspot, a fundamental shift in the U.S. power demand outlook and greater policy certainty are luring investors back. U.S. President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" and the subsequent move to direct the U.S. Treasury to restrict tax credit rules have hit the renewables industry. But money managers say the outcome was not as bad as many feared, and offers enough certainty for investors to engage and companies to resume projects. "Valuations were so disconnected from the fundamentals that even confirmation of negative news became a positive catalyst, said BlackRock portfolio manager Alastair Bishop. "It allowed investors to start focusing on the fundamentals." Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday. This service is not intended for persons residing in the E.U. By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp’s partners. Loading With the outlook improving, Bishop said outflows from BlackRock's active clean-energy strategies had slowed.Robeco portfolio manager Roman Boner said flows into the company's Smart Energy strategy had recently turned positive after sustained outflows. Lipper data shows alternative energy funds had their first net monthly inflow in June, after 25 straight months of outflows totalling around $24 billion. Investors pulled out money again in July before inflows returned in August and neared $800 million in September, the largest since April 2022. Quarterly data from Morningstar shows outflows from Clean Energy/Tech have shrunk to their lowest since the last recorded inflow in Q2 2023. These green shoots coincide with double-digit gains in clean energy indices, ETFs, and a surge in individual stocks across the sector — from producers to infrastructure plays. Bloom Energy is a prime example, teaming up with Oracle to deploy fuel cells at data centres. Its shares have rallied 300 per cent in four months to become the biggest weight in the iShares Clean Energy ETF, a jump some investors view as over-exuberant.The Federal Reserve's dovish tone has also helped. Capital-intensive renewable projects benefit from lower borrowing costs, though rates remain well above the ultra-low levels seen during ESG's heyday.PRIVATE EQUITY MOVES IN LOOKING FOR VALUEPrivate equity is also moving in, ignoring political noise to focus on long-term value. Global Infrastructure Partners is reportedly in talks to buy AES, potentially one of the largest deals involving a Wall Street power company. The MSCI Global Alternative Energy Index has halved since its January 2021 peak, but rose 17 per cent in the three months to September — its strongest quarter since end-2020 and more than double the broader market's gain.The rally, from a record-low base, has extended into October and is not purely U.S.-centricFirst Solar, a U.S. solar bellwether, climbed about 33 per cent over this period. Portuguese renewable energy company EDP Renovaveis rose 18 per cent.SHIFT IN MARKET FROM SUBSIDIES-DRIVEN TO DEMAND-LEDDriving the rally is rising electricity demand from Big Tech's rapid AI data centre build-outs, electrification of transport and industry, and the upgrading of grid infrastructure to handle new loads.U.S. power consumption, stagnant for over a decade, is forecast to grow sharply. With gas turbines in short supply and nuclear years away, solar-plus-storage is emerging as the only scalable short-term solution."Data centres need electricity in two to three years. People will just add as much renewables as they can. It's not only the cheapest source, but also the fastest to build," said Boner. These trends show renewable energy is morphing from a sector driven by policy and subsidies, to one shaped primarily by market forces, where strong demand requires all forms of energy."Every electron counts," Boner added.Cumulative new U.S. power generation demand is seen at 450 gigawatts by 2030, based on data presented by renewables developer NextEra. Of that, only 75 GW is projected from gas-fired plants, around 40 GW from deferred coal retirements, and limited nuclear contributions. Jonathan Waghorn, who manages both sustainable and fossil fuel funds at Guinness Asset Management, sees renewable earnings picking up, noting electricity demand forecasts have surged eightfold in just a few years."That's starting to get earnings momentum into the companies, especially those with AI, data centre, and grid-building exposure. The industry has just started to get going again, and the market is reacting."Waghorn's fund holds stocks involved in electrifying the energy mix like Eaton and Legrand. He also likes European names like cable maker Prysmian and grid services company Spie.Bishop expects earnings upgrades, typically supportive of price performance, and sees room for valuations to rise. At 14.6 times forward earnings, MSCI's Alternative Energy Index trades at a 40 per cent discount to world stocks, vs a 10-year average premium of 7.4 per cent, based on LSEG data, illustrating how the sector is currently valued well below the broader market despite historically commanding a premium. There are still risks - including higher-for-longer interest rates, policy reversals, and speculative retail excitement in unprofitable areas like new-generation nuclear - but some managers say unwinding bearish bets could help sustain the rally."There are still shorts to be squeezed out of the renewable space," said Luca Moro, CIO at SpesX, an energy transition fund.

More Info As we approach the end of the 2025 financial year, the U.S. stock market continues its defiant rally, shrugging off concerns about job losses, a partial government shutdown, and geopolitical instability. While the S&P 500 has surged with a roughly 14.2% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled largely by the relentless AI-driven investment boom—a phenomenon reshaping capital flows from semiconductors to energy infrastructure—the overall Energy sector is lagging badly. With a mere 4.5% YTD gain, it holds the third-lowest spot among major sectors, as oil and gas producers contend with softer commodity prices, the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts, rising costs, and elevated tariffs. Yet, beneath the surface of this underperforming sector, a significant transformation is taking hold.... A rebound in clean energy has seen the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) rise nearly 40 % this year, with demand tied to AI data centers and electrification is driving new investing patterns. Solar stocks are also benefiting, bolstered by policy support and tax incentives preserved (in part) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). One recent Oilprice article warns that OBBBA “gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects” and warns the bill’s impact on solar could worsen over time. The U.S. Senate’s July passage of OBBBA without last-minute excise taxes on solar that some lawmakers had proposed also helped stabilize investor sentiment in domestic solar and storage. The removal of those tariffs lent clearer direction to the U.S. clean energy supply chain and gave developers greater confidence in the viability of long-term projects. This shared agenda of capital rotating toward electrification, AI-driven power demand, and policy stability is creating room for a diverse set of energy names to outperform. These winners are not all pure-play renewables. They include integrated power operators, utilities reinventing themselves, and grid-tech enablers. Below are five off-the-radar energy stocks quietly outperforming their peers. Market Cap: $2.20B YTD Returns: 161.4% Israel-based smart energy SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) has been one of the best performers in the solar sector, alongside the broader Israeli stock market, with SEDG up in the triple digits thanks to the company’s improving business fundamentals. SolarEdge returned yet another healthy quarterly scorecard on Tuesday, with second quarter revenue of $289.4M (+9.0% Y/Y) beating the Wall Street consensus by $14.91 million, while non-GAAP EPS of -$0.81 beat by $0.03. According to SolarEdge CEO Yehoshua Nir, Trump’s OBBBA "validates our multiyear strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. by preserving the 45X advanced manufacturing credit for the next 7 years. We intend to manufacture in the U.S. and to ship U.S.-made SolarEdge products both domestically and across the globe for years to come." SolarEdge’s gross margins continued to improve, increasing 310 basis points sequentially to 11.1%. The company reported that the ongoing supply chain optimizations will cut gross margins by ~ 2%, down from a previous forecast of 4% to 6%. SolarEdge also issued upbeat guidance, with third quarter revenue in the range of $315 million to $355 million, representing 28.4% Y/Y growth at the midpoint while non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 15% -19%, including the 2% of new tariff impact. Market Cap: $165.0B YTD Returns: 83.7% GE Vernova (NYSE:GE) is one of the youngest energy companies, having been spun off by industrial giant General Electric (NYSE:GE) in 2024. GE Vernova is a global energy company that develops and provides products and services for generating, transmitting, and orchestrating electricity. With a market cap roughly half that of its parent company, GE Vernova is one of the largest renewable energy companies, with its GE Renewable Energy division offering a broad portfolio of wind, hydro, storage, and solar technologies. GEV shares have increased more than five-fold from their IPO price, thanks to rising global demand for the company’s services, strong backlog growth and multiple tailwinds from electrification and decarbonization. However, the wild runup has lately attracted some downgrades from Wall Street, with RBC Capital recently trimming GEV price target from $631, with the bank saying the company’s strong outlook is already reflected in the valuation. Market Cap: $113.8B YTD Returns: 60.1% Constellation Energy Corp. (NYSE:CEG) produces and sells energy, including electricity and natural gas, along with sustainable energy solutions to commercial, industrial, residential, and public sector customers. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric power, with a total capacity of approximately 31,676 megawatts. CEG shares have been on a tear after the company unveiled an agreement in June to sell more than 1,100 MW of nuclear power to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) from its Illinois nuclear plant for 20 years. According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal is the first deal of its kind for an operating nuclear plant in the United States, and closely mirrors a similar deal Constellation signed with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. The Microsoft deal is a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will see Constellation Energy restart its undamaged reactor in Three Mile Island, which was undergoing decommissioning. Neither deal will draw power from the main grid. However, Meta appears to have secured a better deal, with Citi’s Ryan Levine estimating that the 20-year PPA is priced in the $70-$95/MWh range, considerably cheaper than Jefferies' estimate of at least $110/MWh for Microsoft's PPA, because Meta’s deal “...does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power”. Levine has projected that ~70% of Constellation's existing nuclear plants could secure comparable datacenter deals at ~$80/MWh. Market Cap: $67.9B YTD Returns: 44.8% Irving, Texas-based Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated power generation company that generates and sells power to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across the United States. The company operates a diverse portfolio of power generation facilities, including natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage, and serves customers through retail brands like TXU Energy and Ambit Energy. VST shares have easily outpaced their energy brethren thanks to the company recording increased power demand from AI data centers and strong results from recent PJM capacity auctions, which are creating a favorable market environment for Vistra's generation and retail operations. Vistra’s diversified fleet, strategic positioning in the nuclear power sector through the Harbor Energy acquisition, and focus on long-term growth and customer-tailored solutions also contribute to investor confidence. Market Cap: $10.3B YTD Returns: 12.7% The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a Virginia-based power generation and utility company that operates in the United States and internationally. AES is actively transforming into a leader in renewable energy, focusing on solar, wind, and energy storage solutions to accelerate a greener energy future. AES shares have been rallying following a report by the Financial Times that BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners plans to acquire the utility company soon, in what would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers on record. The deal would value AES at ~$38 billion, AES’ $29 billion in debt. Global Infrastructure Partners, which BlackRock acquired a year ago, has a history of utility mergers, including a $6.2 billion deal that took public utility company Allete private.

Title: BlackRock’s Bitcoin Empire Nears $100 Billion — But What’s the Real Endgame? | US Crypto News

Written byLockridge Okoth Edited byMohammad Shahid Welcome to the US Crypto News Morning Briefing—your essential rundown of the most important developments in crypto for the day ahead. Grab a coffee to read how a single fund is rewriting the rules of finance, blurring the line between crypto and traditional markets. With it, concerns arise that its next milestone could change how power itself moves through money. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is closing in on a historic milestone of $100 billion in assets under management (AUM), just 22 months after its launch. According to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the fund has already surpassed legendary funds like VIG. It is now ranking 19th overall in AUM, signaling how fast Bitcoin has embedded itself into institutional finance. IBIT WATCH: lost a bit of aum yesterday bc of btc price decline but made it up w inflows. Still at $99b. So close yet so far. Just passed $VIG (an etf legend) to take the 19th spot in overall aum. pic.twitter.com/w5Lto2OaTP According to Onur, a Near Protocol ambassador and popular user on X (Twitter), IBIT’s $245 million annual fees reflect the extraordinary pace of institutional adoption. It now outpaces every other BlackRock ETF, some over a decade old. With $1.8 billion inflows last week alone and a path to $100 billion faster than any fund in history, IBIT shows how deep institutional adoption runs when Bitcoin rallies. This milestone is not happening in isolation, coming as part of a larger shift in how capital moves through crypto markets. Analysts increasingly argue that net inflows now matter more than fundamentals or narratives. “The only thing that matters in crypto right now is flows…net inflows (buy pressure) are infinitely more important than…fundamentals or narrative,” said analyst Miles Deutscher. That observation aligns with IBIT’s dominance in ETF flows. Over the past week alone, IBIT accounted for $3.5 billion in inflows, roughly 10% of all ETF flows across the US market. Even long-time laggards like GBTC saw inflows, a signal, Balchunas noted, that “the fish are hungry.” Behind these flows sits a staggering accumulation of Bitcoin. As of this week, BlackRock controls more than 802,000 BTC, following a fresh purchase of 3,450 coins. 🚨Blackrock Buys 3450 BitcoinNow Holds 802,200 BTC1M Bitcoin Soon. pic.twitter.com/NBEjRTrd12 At the current trajectory, the asset manager could soon hit 1 million BTC holdings, a figure representing a seismic shift in Bitcoin ownership concentration. A recent US Crypto News publication highlighted that the asset manager is nearing Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin stash. However, it is worth noting that other factors significantly affect BlackRock’s prospective $100 billion milestone. For perspective, Balchunas first anticipated BlackRock’s IBIT reaching $100 billion in July, which was over three months ago. “I wrote last week that IBIT could hit $100 billion this summer, but hell, it could be this month. Thanks to recent flows + overnight rally, it’s already at $88 billion,” Balchunas wrote at the time. Factors such as fluctuating flows and Bitcoin price volatility have been at play, derailing the landmark target. Notwithstanding, this fast-paced accumulation is intensifying questions about who ultimately controls Bitcoin’s future. While ETFs are expanding access, they are also centralizing custody and decision-making power in the hands of financial giants. Based on this, some critics see BlackRock’s ambitions extending beyond Bitcoin. Investigative journalist Whitney Webb warns that Larry Fink’s vision involves tokenizing and financializing natural assets on a “universal ledger” that would allow unprecedented tracking and control. “BlackRock being able to unlock and take control of as many natural assets as possible… is obviously a way for them to expand their control not just over people and the existing financial system, but really over the natural world as well,” Webb said in a recent interview. The convergence of Bitcoin ETF dominance and broader asset tokenization plans suggests a new financial infrastructure where Bitcoin could serve as both a liquidity magnet and a building block in a far more centralized global ledger.

BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) now holds a staggering 800,000 Bitcoin (BTC), according to Glassnode data, and has accumulated $98 billion in assets under management in less than two years since its debut in January 2024. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, now holds 802,200 BTC in its IBIT ETF, according to Apollo co-founder Thomas Fahrer. The fund had amassed 798,747 BTC as of Oct. 7, per BlackRock’s own iShares website. IBIT’s purchase of 3,510 BTC (worth $426.2 million) yesterday was enough to push its total holdings above the 800K milestone. The market-leading ETF now holds roughly 3.804% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. IBIT accounts for over 55% of the total BTC held in US spot Bitcoin ETFs, data from Bitbo shows. Additionally, the BlackRock ETF holds more than Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, which boasts a 640,031 BTC stockpile (valued at roughly $78 billion). The recent Bitcoin milestone comes amid reports that IBIT has become BlackRock’s most profitable ETF, surpassing the revenue of its flagship S&P 500 fund, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, which debuted in 2000. Meanwhile, IBIT has led the charge in weekly inflows among all U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs, as pointed out by Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. “IBIT is #1 in weekly flows among all ETFs with $3.5 billion, which is 10% of all net flows into ETFs,” Balchunas wrote in a Wednesday X post. “Also notable is the rest of the 11 OG spot BTC ETFs all took in cash in the past week, even GBTC, somehow; that’s how hungry the fish are. Two steps forward mode. Enjoy while it lasts.” On Monday, the dozen BTC ETFs pulled in their biggest daily inflow since crypto-friendly President Donald Trump secured the presidency against Kamala Harris as institutional appetite for crypto exposure continues to build. These funds have now posted cumulative net inflows of $63 billion since their launch, with IBIT taking in $65 billion, offset by net outflows from Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).

Title: Bitwise ‘Not Playing Around,’ Proposes Low Fee For Its Solana Staking ETF As Official Launch Nears
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitwise-not-playing-around-proposes-low-fee-for-its-solana-staking-etf-as-official-launch-nears/

Crypto fund manager Bitwise designated a 0.20% fee for its Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund, which has a staking component, as asset managers inch closer to securing a green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their crypto-based ETFs. In a Wednesday amendment to its registration statement, Bitwise formally renames its fund to the “Bitwise Solana Staking ETF,” while including language that enables it to “seek to provide exposure to the value of Solana held by the Trust.” By adding staking, the funds would earn small rewards from helping secure blockchains like Solana or Ethereum. Those rewards flow back into the ETF, providing investors with an opportunity to earn additional income from the same assets, rather than relying solely on price gains. The firm also stated that it would charge a 0.20% unitary management fee, a single charge that covers all fund operating costs, waived for the first three months on the first $1 billion in assets. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, this incredibly low fee could be a sign of how competitive the investment vehicle could get among ETF issuers. “Bitwise not playing around, plans to charge just 0.20% for their spot Solana ETF,” Balchunas postulated. “Thought we’d see higher first, need war to get this low.” At that rate, the proposed fee undercuts most competing crypto ETFs, which often fall between 0.15% and 0.25%, and matches the lowest levels seen among greenlighted crypto products. “Low fees have near perfect record of attracting investors so good sign for inflow potential,” Balchunas explained. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF (SSK), the US’s first Solana staking ETF, ended its first day of trading with $12 million in inflows. The annual management fee for the SSK stands at 0.75%. According to Balchunas, Bitwise’s proposed offering is cheaper, has better tracking, and is 100% physically backed by Solana’s spot assets. “SSK is riddled with tracking issues like a futures ETF. It trails spot Solana by 12% — although it got better in the past month,” he opined. Despite leading the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has yet to submit paperwork with the SEC for an SOL ETF. In August, Bloomberg’s ETF analyst James Seyffart suggested that it would be “messed up” if BlackRock were to file a last-minute application to debut its own SOL product simultaneously with other bidders, after those firms had already spent so much time working with the U.S. regulator to get the paperwork right. Nonetheless, analysts have predicted that several applications for Solana ETFs with staking could win the SEC’s regulatory blessing in the course of this month.

ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. 10/10 update below. This post was originally published on October 09 Bitcoin has surged into October, with traders strapping in for a market “frenzy” in coming months. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market The bitcoin price has hit a fresh all-time high over $126,000 per bitcoin, giving it a market capitalization of around $2.5 trillion amid fears of a Federal Reserve-fueled U.S. dollar crisis. Now, as U.S. president Donald Trump floats the idea of a $2,000 Covid stimulus check-style tariff dividend, BlackRock’s market-leading spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is on the verge of crossing $100 billion in assets under management—on track to hit the milestone far faster than any other ETF in history. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock’s IBIT, which launched in January 2024 to huge fanfare, has surged thanks to massive inflows over the last few months and the increase in the value of the bitcoin price itself. The fund now has assets of $98.6 billion and could cross the psychological line in a matter of days. 10/10 update: The bitcoin price has dipped as the crypto market rally comes off the boil, even as the Federal Reserve looks all but certain to cut interest rates again later this month. “Bitcoin volatility is poised for a breakout. Implied volatilities across 14, 30, and 90-day expiries have surged to their highest levels in the past 30 days, pointing to increased anticipation of big moves ahead," Sean Dawson, head of research at leading onchain options platform Derive.xyz, said in emailed comments. “This spike comes as markets price in a near-certain 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month, with Polymarket odds currently sitting at 90%. Following a 3% dip from $123,000 to $120,000, bitcoin has recovered to $121,600. According to Coinglass data, a dense band of short positions is at risk of liquidation just above this level. A modest push upward could trigger a cascade of liquidations and propel BTC back toward $125,000 and beyond." Bitcoin and crypto traders remain bullish despite the latest bitcoin pull back, with analysts pointing to a mismatch between current price action and the underlying market. “Bitcoin is up 7% in October, perfectly matching its seasonal pattern — but this time, the rally feels different,” 10x Research analysts led by chief executive Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note. “Despite trading near all-time highs, momentum is fading, and what once looked like a clean breakout now sits in no-man’s-land. Beneath the surface, the story unfolds differently: institutional whales are buying aggressively, while early adopters quietly sell into strength.” Bitcoin ETFs could add another $20 billion worth of inflows before the end of the year, according to some market watchers, with the lion's share of that likely to go to BlackRock's bitcoin fund. “Following the recent rally over the first weekend of ‘Uptober’, which saw bitcoin’s price surge to a new all-time high above $125,000, record-level ETF inflows totalled above $3 billion across the first week of the month,” Dom Harz, cofounder of bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi) platform BOB, said in emailed comments. BlackRock’s IBIT is on track to hit the $100 billion milestone about five times faster than any other ETF in history, according to a report from Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, with it also “by far the youngest” of the 20 largest ETFs. BlackRock's flagship S&P 500 ETF took 25 years to reach its current revenue levels, while IBIT has achieved higher profitability in less than two years. The fund, charging a 0.25% fee, is thought to bring in annual revenue of $240 million for BlackRock, becoming the most profitable BlackRock ETF when it surpassed BlackRock’s IWF and EFA funds in July. “The fact that IBIT is now BlackRock’s most profitable product is extremely impressive," Seyffart, who added that BlackRock’s bitcoin fund—and rival crypto-tied ETFs—faced a lot of criticism ahead of their launches last year, told Bloomberg. “We were very bullish on the amount of demand and flows that we thought would come into the bitcoin ETFs, but even these numbers have blown away our most bullish expectations.” The BlackRock bitcoin fund has become the de facto route for traditional finance to gain bitcoin exposure, with the surging popularity of the "debasement trade" this year catapulting bitcoin higher along with gold. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “While it’s very possible that gold will continue to outperform other assets for the foreseeable future, it has certainly become a crowded trade,” Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in emailed comments. "That means there is more risk involved in initiating exposure at this point. After more than a 50% rally in the gold price year-to-date, attention may now turn to other alternatives that express a similar view. These include other metals and commodities, tokenized real assets, and bitcoin, which remain undervalued against gold. These alternative assets can all play a similar role in portfolios—a hedge against future inflation and political intervention, and an alternative to the U.S. dollar and other debasing currencies.” Crypto ETFs more widely drew record inflows of almost $6 billion globally last week, according to data from CoinShares. "This level of investment highlights the growing recognition of digital assets as an alternative in times of uncertainty," James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, wrote in the weekly report.

Title: How Asset Managers Can Eliminate Child And Forced Labor From Their Portfolios

ByBhakti Mirchandani, Contributor. Child labor is a large and growing problem in the United States. With child labor violations in the US up 79% year-over-year following an 140% increase over the past decade, detecting and mitigating child labor violations is material for all investors. This is the second article in a series on child and forced labor due diligence and monitoring. The series draws from guides for asset owners and asset managers that Kathy Hahn and Juho Rana Kim from Casey Family Programs, Jerome McCluskey of Latham & Watkins, and I co-authored following consultations with and/or contributions from over 100 experts, ranging from Save the Children to Neuberger Berman and from UNICEF USA and its Impact Fund for Children to BlackRock. This one-page child and forced labor due diligence guide for asset managers consists of six due diligence questions for asset managers to use when underwriting portfolio companies. If the answers to all of the questions immediately below are no, the process is complete. If the answer to any of the questions below is yes, asset managers would proceed with the longer questionnaire that follows further below. Alternatively, questions may be adapted and put to management or the compliance team of a target on a legal due diligence call. This guide is designed to be intuitive enough for any team member to use and brief enough for investment team members to hang in their cubicles as a reference to use while underwriting and monitoring portfolio companies. The following tables present a four-page child and forced labor due diligence questionnaire for asset managers to use with higher risk portfolio companies. If answers to any of the questions in the Standard Questionnaire immediately below are unclear or suggest a higher level of risk, parts or all of the Detailed Questionnaire should be applied based on the responses to the Standard Questions. As Human Rights Watch Senior Researcher Jim Wormington notes, optimal use of the Detailed Questionnaire would require in-house sector expertise, external partners, or both, and asset managers should consider resource requirements. Asset managers would naturally vary the number of questions from the Detailed Questionnaire that they ask based on position size, whether the position is a controlling interest, potential risks involved, and what change they are trying to drive in their portfolio and/or across the industry. Where the answer to any of the above questions is unclear or suggests a higher level of risk, please use parts or all of the below Detailed Questionnaire based on the responses to the Standard Questionnaire. The next article and final in this series presents a longer list of due diligence questions for asset owners to use if answers to any of the three Heightened Risk Scenario questions from the first article in this series is unclear or suggests a higher level of risk. Note: Special thanks to the organizations with team members who generously took the time to contribute to this work, listed here. The views of this series of articles should not be construed as reflecting the views of these organizations.

Title: What Will It Take to Actually Get Alts in More Portfolios?

The key to greater acceptance may be using them in more traditional products, like mutual funds and ETFs. Griffin Kelly griffin@thedailyupside.com It’s the first rule of finance: Don’t invest in what you don’t understand. While access to alternative assets is expected to broaden under the Trump administration’s Securities and Exchange Commission, led by Paul Atkins, mass affluent clients, and even advisors, aren’t overly familiar with the investments, including venture capital, infrastructure or real estate deals. The key to greater alt acceptance may lie in introducing them through more traditional products, like certain kinds of mutual funds and ETFs. “If you’re going to introduce a new asset class to the market, people will need time to become comfortable,” said Eric Pan, CEO of the Investment Company Institute. “I’m not advocating for direct sales of private assets to retail, but using [40 Act] funds.” One way to introduce alts to retail investors or mass affluent clients is through target-date funds, Pan told Advisor Upside at a Financial Times conference in New York City this week. Such funds automatically adjust asset allocations over time and are already popular in 401(k)s. While alternatives often carry higher costs and potential risk, the biggest hurdle for retail investors is illiquidity, Pan said. “If it’s a piece of infrastructure, it may take you 20 years to build a bridge,” he said. “If it’s real estate, you can’t sell that overnight.” He suggested closed-end funds, which are less liquid by design, as another solution. Some firms are already using these vehicles to reach retail investors: Another big piece of the equation is transparency. If firms want to attract more clients to alternatives, private market products are going to have to become more transparent. “That’s a requirement to unlock everything else,” BlackRock COO Rob Goldstein said during a panel discussion at the conference. “The more transparency you provide on private markets, I actually think you’ll see an increase in allocation of capital to the private market.” Not So Fast. Some industry leaders remain skeptical, though. While PIMCO has launched private credit funds geared toward wealthy retail investors, company CEO Emmanuel Roman said the firm is “paranoid” about illiquidity risks, and that investors need to be compensated for locking up their investments long term. “You really have a burden of proof in terms of having a product, which delivers double-digit returns and offers what it says on the box in terms of liquidity,” he said during the conference. “It’s hard to make liquidity out of nowhere.” Advisors and clients haven’t been chasing returns, though, instead smartly choosing to stay diversified. Tax-law and human behavior are complicated, but there’s a method to mitigating past investment mistakes. In the long-running bull market, it’s not hard to make a case against risk-parity funds. But it’s harder to make one against Ray Dalio and his massive hedge-fund firm Bridgewater Associates. The opportunities to invest are expanding, but due diligence is key. Advisors are taking a variety of approaches in fixed income, stocks and alternatives. Allocations today have a striking resemblance to where they stood in 2023, according to new Goldman Sachs data. Investing $1 billion in T. Rowe may be more efficient for Goldman than building out its own channel. Mixing politics and investing is like mixing emotions and math: It rarely adds up. They’re going to have to adapt to not only younger clients’ approach to finances, but also their communication styles and social preferences. Rules-based investments are appealing, but even index-fund investing comes with limitations. With assets reaching new heights, advisors need to inform clients about what exchange-traded funds can — and can’t — do. The hype for expanded access to alternatives is real, but are they in the best interests of clients who may not understand how they work? © 2025 The Daily Upside

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla is weeks away from a monumental shareholder vote on CEO Elon Musk’s potential $1 trillion pay package at its annual investor meeting, and the EV maker is pulling out all the stops to push the measure through. Last year, Tesla rallied thousands of mom-and-pop retail investors to vote their shares of stock in favor of Musk’s billions in pay. Now, Tesla is teeing up retail holders for another vote on Nov. 6 that would set Musk on the path to becoming the world’s first trillionaire by granting him up to 12% of Tesla’s outstanding shares divided into 12 tranches through a restricted stock grant. The first tranche starts at $2 trillion, and the final tranche is $8.5 trillion. If he hits all the goals in the plan, he’ll have brought Tesla to a market cap of $8.5 trillion, and his stake would be worth more than $1 trillion. Much of the playbook for 2025 is similar to 2024: a slick investor website, a bevy of posts, and engagement on X about how investors can vote shares on specific brokerage platforms, and even a special video with Optimus humanoid robots explaining voting in between taking a sauna and overseeing platters of bagels and cream cheese. Tesla’s Annual Meeting is coming up on November 6 & we need your vote!Voting is quick and easy – you can vote online, by mail, by QR code or by phone@Tesla_Optimus can show you how pic.twitter.com/OM5UwtkJWx— Tesla (@Tesla) October 6, 2025 Tesla is clearly dedicating resources to communicating with its individual retail investors and informing them about how to vote, independent activist investor Michael Levin told Fortune, a feat that is difficult to accomplish in the U.S. Given how Tesla pulled it off last year, this year’s vote to approve Musk’s new award isn’t nearly as in doubt as it was in 2024, he said. Plus, Tesla has the same playbook to work from this year. “The result of 2024 gives a very strong clue about how 2025 will work out—and that passed with 72% of voters supporting it, and that’s pretty comfortable,” Levin said. “This year, it’s sort of a version of the same thing: A comp plan going forward with these insane, ambitious goals, and people are fine with that and don’t mind him being a trillionaire.” Thousands of retail investors and Tesla loyalists have pledged their support in favor of Tesla and Musk’s stratospheric new pay plan, but a growing coalition of pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are speaking out about what they see as red flags: a comp package that is too large, a lack of independence on the board, and the potential for other founders and controlling CEOs to follow in Musk’s footsteps. The latter would be disastrous for an economy that is already tilted too favorably in the direction of billionaires like Musk while employees writ large are battling inflation and lackluster pay raises, sources said. “It’s not only the magnitude, it’s the way in which the pay package is sort of a ransom aimed at shareholders,” New York City Comptroller Brad Lander told Fortune. “It’s a megalomaniacal trip of bizarre proportions that is all about Elon’s ego and not about the financial health of the company or its stakeholders and shareholders.” Lander, who signed a letter with other investors urging shareholders to vote against Musk’s pay plan and to oppose the reelection of three Tesla board members, oversees more than $1 billion invested in Tesla on behalf of New York City’s pension funds. Similarly, New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli, who oversees about $1.4 billion invested in Tesla on behalf of the state’s pension funds, called Musk’s pay “excessive,” and said it “waters down the holdings of other shareholders, and gives a captive board unwarranted discretion.” DiNapoli said he plans in coming weeks to lobby other investors to vote against the plan and all directors with reelection bids on the board. The vote will be a pivotal moment—not just for Tesla, but for all those who oversee invested assets on behalf of shareholders and retirees, New Mexico State Treasurer Laura Montoya told Fortune. “If we don’t hold them accountable you’re going to have so many others who are going to try and follow suit,” Montoya said. “This is a precedent that could be damaging to our economy, not just today and tomorrow but in our children’s future.” The Tesla meeting agenda includes investor votes on 14 proposals, but the two that are keenly relevant to Musk’s compensation include a proposal to approve his 2025 CEO performance award, and a second proposal that would include the creation of a special reserve of 208 million equity shares for Musk. The vote authorizing more shares will also replenish the equity pool of 60 million shares available for employees and directors that companies typically use to compensate executives. “All the action is in those two proposals,” said Levin, who holds a small investment in Tesla and plans to oppose the pay proposals. The pay plan up for a vote this year comes after a Delaware judge rescinded Musk’s previous moonshot award in January 2024, a decision that prompted Tesla to hold an investor vote to ratify his pay package a second time in 2024 and to authorize a move from being incorporated in the state of Delaware to Texas. The 2024 ratification vote and the move to Texas were enormous victories for the EV maker, even though the same Delaware judge rescinded Musk’s pay package a second time following the vote. Since then, the Tesla board has given Musk an interim award of 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at about $24 billion. Musk’s proposed 2025 award involves the CEO hitting both market capitalization and operational goals that could potentially see Tesla reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion if Musk successfully unlocks all 12 tranches. He’ll have to stick around at Tesla for a minimum of 7.5 years and up to 10 years for his shares to vest. The board claimed during negotiations that Musk “raised the possibility that he may pursue other interests” if he does not get paid for his past work at Tesla and receive at least a 25% voting interest in the company. The new award requires him to “participate in the board’s development of a framework for long-term CEO succession,” one of the provisions states. All told, Musk could become the world’s first trillionaire, and he would hold 28.8% of Tesla if he hits all the goals in the moonshot plan. He would also become the first and only CEO to hit a moonshot hat trick—three back-to-back pay packages. The Tesla board told investors the pay package is key to keeping Musk focused on Tesla and motivated to grow the company. “In light of the AI talent wars, Tesla’s internal efforts to develop and expand its product offerings within the AI industry, the absence of a comprehensive plan to address the compensation that remains outstanding for Musk’s past performance, and the lack of any go-forward incentive to motivate Musk to keep his focus aimed at Tesla long enough to achieve meaningful results that will transform Tesla over the long term, we believe there is a pressing need to retain and incentivize Musk immediately,” the board told investors last month. In their criticisms, pension funds and Democratic state fiduciaries are taking aim not only at the size of Musk’s potential pay package but the Tesla board, chaired by Robyn Denholm. Pension leaders have said Denholm and the board are letting investors down by failing to properly oversee and challenge Musk when needed and ensure that he stays focused on Tesla. “In our view, the board’s failure to limit Mr. Musk’s outside endeavors while rewarding him with unprecedented pay packages for only a part-time commitment strongly indicates a lack of true independence by management and jeopardizes long-term shareholder value,” states a letter from SOC Investment Group, signed by a dozen fiduciaries and investors. “The board has permitted Mr. Musk to be overcommitted for years, allowing him to continue as CEO while taking time-consuming leadership roles at his other companies, xAI/X, SpaceX, Neuralink, and Boring Company.” The letter noted that the level of compensation paid to the Tesla board members could also compromise the board’s impartiality. Average comp paid to S&P 500 board members in 2024 was $327,096, the letter states. Denholm’s average compensation per year has been $62 million. Denholm has repeatedly denied that her objectivity has been clouded by the wealth she’s made selling Tesla stock over the years. Still, some investors are planning to send a message to the board by voting against the three directors up for reelection this year: Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson. Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman told Fortune her concerns about Tesla as a fiduciary were based on the board’s governing track record and the lack of accountability by directors overseeing Musk in his role as CEO. “This is one of those circumstances where somebody has to say, ‘Enough is enough,’” said Lierman. Despite the organizing by pension funds, the battle to sway the vote is an uphill climb, although that is no reason not to speak out, noted Lierman. Tesla appears positioned to win approval of Musk’s new moonshot pay plan based on Musk’s ownership, the voting history of large institutional investors, and the company’s track record with individual holders. According to the proxy statement, owned by Musk—and his brother and board colleague Kimbal Musk—can be voted for the two key comp proposals. Meaning there is no majority-of-minority requirement, a corporate governance mechanism where a transaction or proposal has to be approved by a majority of shareholders who are not involved in the transaction. Currently, Musk holds about 20% of the company, and Kimbal Musk holds about 1.5 million shares, less than 1% of Tesla’s outstanding stock. In addition, large institutional investors BlackRock and Vanguard hold close to 13% of Tesla between them, and both voted in favor of Musk’s pay ratification in 2024. According to FactSet, retail shareholders equate to approximately 34% of outstanding shares. Last year’s ratification vote saw 72% of all votes cast in approval of his pay, which excluded shares connected to Musk and his brother. Given the level of insider control plus Tesla’s command over its retail base, proxy advisory firms like ISS and Glass Lewis aren’t going to be a determinant even if they recommend investors oppose the pay proposals, said Levin. Similarly, BlackRock and Vanguard don’t disclose their votes in advance, but they may not be much of an issue even if they suddenly reverse course on Musk’s pay this year versus last year. Still, Musk is unlikely to leave anything to chance, said Levin, given his ownership stake in Tesla. And if Musk left Tesla it would be terrible for investors; the stock would likely immediately plummet. “Maybe it’s a risk this board doesn’t want to take,” said Levin. “But I think the cost of avoiding that risk is way too high—it’s a trillion dollars of equity.” Tesla’s shareholder meeting is slated to take place on Nov. 6 at its headquarters in Austin. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Crypto-Focused AMINA Bank of Switzerland Offers Regulated Staking of Polygon Token

Swiss-regulated crypto bank AMINA has become the first bank worldwide to offer institutional clients regulated staking access to POL, the native token that powers the Polygon blockchain. The launch allows qualified participants, including asset managers and corporate treasuries, to earn staking rewards while supporting network security in compliance with financial regulations. As part of this collaboration, AMINA clients can receive up to 15% in staking rewards. This rate combines AMINA’s base yield with an additional incentive from the foundation. The move expands the bank’s existing POL custody and trading services, giving institutions a compliant path to participate in blockchain infrastructure relied on by firms like BlackRock, JPMorgan and Franklin Templeton for their tokenization efforts. Myles Harrison, AMINA’s chief product officer, said the service bridges traditional finance with “the networks that matter.” AMINA Bank (previously known as SEBA Bank) holds a license from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”), and also has nods to offer crypto services from regulators in Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. Polygon Labs CEO Marc Boiron called the development a sign that institutions “aren’t just buying tokens anymore — they want to participate.” Polygon, an Ethereum overlay blockchain which processes transactions for less than a cent and settles them in under five seconds, has become one of the main networks for on-chain finance. It now hosts over $1 billion in tokenized real-world assets and nearly $3 billion in stablecoin value. The POL token had a market cap of $2.5 billion at press time.
