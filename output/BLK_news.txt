(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is parting ways with one of the world’s biggest climate-investor groups after being targeted by Republican politicians for its efforts on global warming. Most Read from Bloomberg What Robotaxis Brought San Francisco NYC Condo Owners May Bear Costs of Landmark Green Building Law Ambitious High-Speed Rail Plans Advance in the Baltic Region NYC’s Subway Violence Deters Drive to Bring Workers Back to Office Dutch Central Bank Restores Amsterdam’s ‘Ugliest Building’ The money manager has decided to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, it said in a letter to clients on Thursday. Membership in the group “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials,” the New York-based firm said. BlackRock, which oversees more than $11 trillion, has been the subject of attacks from GOP lawmakers for embracing what conservatives call “woke” policies. Most recently, BlackRock was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging breaches of antitrust laws due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production. And with President-elect Donald Trump headed for the White House, Wall Street is bracing for more attacks on climate finance. “BlackRock has hung in there as long as it could, but the pressure has become too great, and the reputational and legal risks too high, just before Trump takes office,” Hortense Bioy, head of sustainable investing research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said in an emailed comment. And it “won’t be the last financial organization to quit a net zero initiative,” she said. BlackRock was mentioned, along with firms including State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group Inc., in a report last month from the House Judiciary Committee that said it found “evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior” by the financial industry to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. Over the past month, a climate coalition for lenders, the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, has seen a mass exodus of US members. Since early December, NZBA lost Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The moves reflect Wall Street’s desire to shield itself from increasing GOP pressure. And there are signs the strategy is working. Earlier this week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off the lenders from municipal-bond deals after they quit NZBA. “Our participation in NZAMi didn’t impact the way we managed client portfolios,” BlackRock said in Thursday’s letter, which was signed by Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand and Helen Lees-Jones, global head of sustainable and transition solutions. “Therefore, our departure doesn’t change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios.” BlackRock said it managed more than $1 trillion in sustainable and transition investment strategies as recently as September and “our commitment to helping our clients achieve their investment goals remains unwavering.” NZAMi is a group of roughly 325 asset managers, overseeing about $50 trillion, that are committed to achieving net zero alignment by 2050. State Street Global Advisors, the world’s third-biggest asset manager, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that it remains a member of NZAMi. Vanguard, the second biggest, left the group in 2022. In its statement, BlackRock said its fund managers “continue to assess material climate-related risks, alongside other investment risks, in delivering for clients.” About two-thirds of the firm’s largest clients, including all of its biggest customers in Europe, have made net zero commitments, the money manager said. BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had been a champion of environmental, social and governance strategies, devoting large parts of his annual letters to urging corporate bosses to pay attention to climate change and other societal issues. But then he came under attack from Republicans and some states collectively pulled billions of dollars from BlackRock. In response, Fink has said he no longer uses the ESG label because it’s become too politicized. Listen on Zero: How to Stop Banks’ Funding of Fossil Fuels, No Protests Required “BlackRock is under political pressure to exit climate groups and from shareholders who are unhappy with the loss of business from state investment funds that object to the agendas of climate groups,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. --With assistance from Frances Schwartzkopff.

(Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline.

Title: BlackRock Exits UN-Backed Net-Zero Climate Pact
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/blackrock-exits-un-backed-net-zero-climate-pact-5789222
Time Published: 2025-01-10T05:58:45Z
Full Content:
BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager overseeing approximately $11.5 trillion in assets, has decided to withdraw from a climate pact backed by the United Nations (UN) that advocates for aggressive de-carbonizing of the economy. Membership in the climate pact did not affect the way BlackRock managed client portfolios, according to the spokesperson, but it did lead to confusion about the company’s practices and subjected it to legal inquiries from public officials. Despite the NZAM exit, BlackRock remains committed to sustainable investing. Republicans, particularly from energy-producing states, have criticized the participation of banks and asset managers in net-zero coalitions as part of a progressive agenda and have accused them of antitrust violations. “Texas will not tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda. BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street formed a cartel to rig the coal market, artificially reduce the energy supply, and raise prices,” Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. “This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” BlackRock has rejected the allegations, stating that the lawsuit undermines investments in essential companies that consumers depend on. “If they want to invest in hydrocarbons, we give them every opportunity to do it–the same way we invest roughly $138 billion in energy transition strategies for our clients,” Fink wrote. “That’s part of being an asset manager. We follow our clients’ mandates.”

Title: Cryptoverse: Next wave of US crypto ETFs already in the pipeline

By Suzanne McGee (Reuters) - What a difference a year makes. Rewind the clock to early January 2024, and the asset-management industry was anxiously watching to see if the much-anticipated debut of U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds could live up to expectations they would pull in as much as $30 billion in their first year. Today, those issuers are cracking open the champagne. That first wave of bitcoin ETFs attracted a whopping $65 billion in 2024, helping to propel the price of bitcoin from $43,000 to more than $100,000. The largest of those new products, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s iShares Bitcoin Trust, has become the most successful debut in the ETF industry's 35-year history. But that's just the start of the party, cryptocurrency denizens believe. Shortly after those products celebrate their first anniversary on Jan. 10, President-elect Donald Trump - who has pledged to be a crypto president - will be sworn in for the second time, igniting what cryptocurrency fans believe will be a new golden era for the digital asset class. Applications for new, and often novel, crypto products are already piling up in regulators' inboxes. "Everyone is now aware of how much money there is to be made, and with a new, more friendly administration, there's no reason not to go ahead and file your best ideas with regulators," said Joe McCann, founder and CEO of digital assets hedge fund Asymmetric in Miami. While Gary Gensler, Biden's crypto-skeptic Securities and Exchange Commission chair, was forced to approve the first spot bitcoin ETFs - and similar ethereum products - after losing a court challenge, he continued to warn that cryptos are highly volatile and beset by scams and manipulation. Paul Atkins, Trump's appointee to succeed Gensler, is widely seen as a supporter of digital assets. As of late November, companies including VanEck, 21Shares and Canary Capital had seized upon those expectations of an increasingly crypto-friendly tone in Washington by filing at least 16 applications to launch exchange-traded products tracking crypto indices or tokens such as Solana and Ripple's XRP, according to SEC filings and industry sources. LIGHTER REGULATION EXPECTED The push to launch the next wave of crypto products began in earnest weeks before the election, with many in the industry anticipating a lighter regulatory touch regardless of whether Trump or his rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, won. "Since it takes several months to get regulatory approvals and bring an ETF to market, many issuers began making a calculated bet that this year, the climate would be different, and wanted to have their products in the queue ready to go," said Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets research at VanEck, which hopes to launch a Solana ETF in 2025. In addition to XRP and Solana, which are the fourth- and sixth-largest coins by capitalization, according to CoinGecko, Canary has filed to launch products tied to Litecoin and HBAR, less widely held coins, SEC filings show. "The last piece of the puzzle was seeing who the new SEC chair would be - that's what we were banking on," said Steven McClurg, who led the launch of the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund in January and went on to launch new crypto asset manager Canary Capital in October. "Now, it's off to the races," he added. The looming crypto ETF gold rush is about more than just products tied to single coins, however. New derivative products are poised to make their debut within days of Trump's inauguration, and new kinds of multi-asset or hybrid products are waiting in the wings. Several issuers, including Calamos Investments, Innovator ETFs and First Trust, have filed for new funds that would use recently-launched bitcoin ETF options to shield investors from losses on bitcoin itself. The first ones of those products are expected to debut on Jan. 22, issuers say. The SEC approved options on some of the bitcoin ETFs late last year, including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, and gave CBOE Global Markets the green light to launch options tied to the Cboe Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index - clearing the way for this batch of new ETFs. Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business for digital asset manager 21Shares, which has launched U.S. bitcoin and ethereum ETFs, in addition to a wider array of offerings in Europe, predicted other new products could include listed funds tied to baskets of cryptocurrencies or that track a mix of alternative assets, such as bitcoin and gold. "Product innovation in the U.S. is just getting started," he said. To be sure, such novel products are still a gamble. While bitcoin ETFs have outperformed, ETFs launched in July tied to the world's second-largest token, ether, have attracted relatively meager inflows of $12.8 billion, according to Paris-based TrackInsight. While bitcoin's price more than doubled in 2024, ether lagged that pace, gaining 53%. Because less widely-held coins are still in their infancy, factors that drive returns and volatility aren't always clear, said Todd Sohn, ETF analyst at broker-dealer Strategas. While trading in bitcoin and ethereum futures and futures-based ETFs has existed for several years in the U.S., so far those are the only coins for which a futures market exists. Sohn said the existence of futures trading has given regulators confidence in the breadth and depth of both bitcoin and ether. It also remains to be seen how rapidly Atkins will embrace the most novel of the proposed products, given not only the potential risks but the lingering debate over whether or not these tokens are securities that fall within the SEC's purview. Still, that regulatory uncertainty is not dampening the enthusiasm of the crypto asset-management industry. "The only limit on what products emerge will be human creativity," said VanEck's Sigel.

Title: BlackRock Stares Down FDIC Before Deadline Over Bank Stakes

(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc. is resisting the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s demands that the world’s largest asset manager submit to new oversight of its stakes in US banks, seeking to delay negotiations into the Trump administration. The FDIC had set a Jan. 10 deadline for BlackRock to sign an agreement. But in a letter to the agency, the company asked for an extension until at least March 31, saying it had only two weeks to review a proposed pact that risks hurting its ability to serve clients. “We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period,” Ben Tecmire, head of US regulatory affairs at BlackRock, said in the letter obtained by Bloomberg News. The FDIC didn’t immediately provide comment on the letter. BlackRock has opposed FDIC efforts over the past year that seek to keep large asset managers from potentially swaying banks in which they have sizable stakes. It has argued that the plan would upend index funds that dominate many investor portfolios, make it more costly for banks to raise capital and disrupt the economy. Fed Agreement The company said it already has a similar “passivity agreement” in place with the Federal Reserve. FDIC board members Jonathan McKernan, a Republican, and Rohit Chopra, a Democrat and director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, have pushed repeatedly for more oversight of the index fund giants, arguing that their size and concentrated ownership could give firms undue influence over the management and strategy of US banks. BlackRock’s agreement with the FDIC was expected to be similar to Vanguard’s pact announced in late December. In 2019, Vanguard committed to a “passivity agreement” when its funds held more than 10% of the outstanding shares of certain banks. But the latest agreement is more expansive, requiring external and internal audits to verify that Vanguard is not seeking to influence the management or control the board of directors of a lender. It also would cover a broader group of banks. Industry trade groups and BlackRock have said that existing oversight, including by the Fed, already provides assurance that index funds are acting passively rather than exercising control of banks. BlackRock has said the FDIC should coordinate any new scrutiny with the Fed, which already has a passivity agreement in place with the firm. At the end of September, the asset manager had almost $7.8 trillion in exchange-traded funds and index funds. BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. are regularly among the top shareholders in publicly traded US companies, and their index funds’ popularity has boosted their stock ownership, including in banks. Some lawmakers and regulators have warned that the growing scale of these firms allows too much influence over public companies, a view that money managers reject by citing their voting records in support of company management in most situations. In October, BlackRock called on the FDIC to withdraw a proposed rule on asset managers’ stakes in lenders, arguing it presented “significant risks” and could upend how index funds are managed and make it more expensive for banks to raise capital. Less buying interest in bank stocks might hurt the liquidity of their shares and push down their prices, the firm said. (Updates fourth paragraph with outreach to FDIC.)

Subscribe Today's print edition Home Delivery BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the latest Wall Street firm to depart an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion, said that with two-thirds of its global clients committed to cutting emissions to net zero, it had made sense to join groups like the organization known as NZAMI. "However, our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," leading to the departure, according to a client letter.

By Suzanne McGee and Ross Kerber (Reuters) -BlackRock has asked the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to extend its deadline to reach an agreement on how the agency would oversee the giant asset manager's investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations from Friday until March 31, according to a letter the firm sent to regulators on Thursday and obtained by Reuters. The letter is the latest move in a months-long tug of war between the FDIC and the biggest managers of index-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds over the rules governing their passive investments in FDIC-regulated banks. In late December, Vanguard Investments hammered out terms of such a passivity agreement with the FDIC, which immediately afterward asked BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) to sign a very similar agreement by the Friday deadline. "We are not aware of any imminent or ongoing issues that would warrant hastening the finalization of a completely new regulatory framework in a two-week period," wrote Ben Tecmire, head of U.S. regulatory affairs at BlackRock, in the letter to the FDIC. That is especially true, he added, since "all the banks that would be covered by your proposed agreement with BlackRock are subject to regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve." In the letter, Tecmire said BlackRock wants to avoid "inconsistent and uncertain requirements" that might result from the firm's bank holdings being overseen by multiple bank regulators. He said in the letter that BlackRock's understanding is that the agreement between the FDIC and Vanguard was reached only after several months of negotiation. An individual familiar with the matter said BlackRock's attempts in the final months of 2024 to meet with FDIC officials had been rebuffed. The FDIC did not respond to a request for comment on the letter or the negotiations. GETTING TOO BIG? BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) now collectively control some $26 trillion in assets. Since the financial crisis of 2009 investors have poured money into their low-cost index funds, catapulting the three firms into the ranks of the largest owners of most large U.S. corporations. But their size and clout have raised worries the holdings could diminish competition among the companies they commonly own. Even Vanguard's late founder Jack Bogle voiced concern. Because of the firms' influence on corporate governance, they also have faced political attacks on issues like their treatment of greenhouse gas emissions or workforce diversity. On Thursday, BlackRock said it plans to leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. So far academic studies paint a mixed picture. A 2023 U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta review for example, found "relatively little evidence" of such problems. Some of the issues the FDIC is grappling with now have also been hashed out in front of the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Trade group Edison Electric Institute cautioned the FERC that its actions have the potential to hamper or delay much-needed capital investments. However, FERC has moved at a much slower pace to consider challenges to the big stakes that the passive funds own in major utilities. One objection is that new limits by regulators could divert investments away from portfolio companies, be they banks or utility firms. Jeff DeMaso, who writes a newsletter for Vanguard investors, said via e-mail that regulators should "tread lightly" before putting new limits on passive mutual funds or ETFs. "We are trying to sort through the unintended consequences of indexing and the concentration of ownership. Before (potentially) damaging that clear good, we should clearly know the problem we are solving," he said.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) stands against the other growth stocks. Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries. Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that "AI is the prevailing theme" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people. The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially. Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A senior banker shaking hands with migrant customers in a corporate boardroom. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29 Share Price as of January 8, 2024: $23.21 Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) is a financial services company that allows people to send and receive money online from the United States. The company has a motive to help immigrants in the United States support their families back home, enhancing the sentimental value associated with the brand. In addition to that, the company also funds charities and programs to enhance the financial and social position of immigrants in the United States and their families. Over the years, the company has expanded to Europe, partnered with prominent names, and urged state organizations to enhance the financial and social inclusion of immigrants. Aligning with its goals, Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) is leveraging machine learning to prevent fraud and minimize interventions. The company uses ML models to assess and detect thousands of transactions every hour, allowing them to prevent identity theft and credit card fraud with precision. In 2023, the company has been able to reduce the rate of fraud by more than 25% compared to 2022. At the same time, the company saw a 30% decline in its rate of transaction loss. Similarly, on December 10, the company launched a Trust and Safety Center in partnership with Get Safe Online to educate users on fraud and scams online. Investors are bullish on the stock because of its fundamentals, expanding market share, and a solid growth trajectory. Night Watch Investment Management stated the following regarding Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “The US consumer has been in a 2-year affordability crisis. As a result, there are many quality consumer businesses available at very attractive prices. However, we don’t currently see a reason why US consumer spending should rebound from its current depressed level. We will therefore limit ourselves to companies with company-specific growth drivers. An example is Remitly Global, Inc. (NASDAQ:RELY) which we acquired around $13 after the stock sold off excessively on an earnings miss in Q1, despite the 30% growth on the back of market share gains. Valuation is very attractive when considering that marketing expenses are a discretionary reinvestment into the business.” Overall RELY ranks 6th on our list of the best growth stocks under $25 to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of RELY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RELY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024.

Title: Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Technology Stock to Invest In for the Long Term

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Technology Stocks to Invest In for the Long Term. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other technology stocks. On January 1, King Lip, BakerAvenue Wealth Management's chief strategist and partner, joined CNBC's 'Closing Bell' to discuss market outlooks as we enter 2025. His focus was on the impressive performance of tech stocks in 2024, with expectations for a second consecutive year of double-digit gains. Lip was against the prevailing sentiment among investors that big tech has peaked and that funds should rotate into smaller stocks or other themes. He argued that the recent weakness in the tech sector is largely due to technical rebalancing rather than a fundamental downturn. He emphasized that cash is likely to flow back into leading tech stocks, as they are projected to deliver the highest earnings growth in 2025, with an anticipated earnings increase of over 20%. Discussing high valuations in the tech sector, particularly for large-cap stocks trading at forward earnings multiples between 32 and 35 times, Lip countered that many valuations remain within one standard deviation of their historical norms over the past decade. He pointed out that the MAG7 have consistently provided strong returns and are well-positioned for future growth. Lip identified Broadcom as a top stock, praising its management under Hock Tan and its unique role in the market as a provider of custom AI chips. He noted that the company operates at a lower earnings multiple while benefiting from substantial growth. Lip also discussed Palantir, which has garnered attention for its profitability and positive cash flow since becoming profitable two years ago; despite its high valuation exceeding 50 times revenue, he believes it is well-positioned to benefit from government spending cuts and AI initiatives. While acknowledging concerns about insider selling and high valuations for the company, Lip remains optimistic about its future potential, suggesting it could be more appealing if it drops to the mid-$60 range. Lip is bullish on tech stocks in 2025 that will be driven by strong earnings growth and ongoing investments in AI infrastructure. The NASDAQ 100 index has performed remarkably well, achieving a return of 27% in 2024 following a staggering 53.8% return in 2023. This reflects a broader trend where major tech companies have outperformed traditional indices significantly, and with that being acknowledged, we're here with a list of the 12 best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. To identify the best long-term tech stocks according to media, we sifted through financial media reports and watched Wall Street analysts' appearances on the news. We compiled a preliminary list of 25 stocks first and then selected 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 158 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company known for its consumer electronics, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watches, and AirPods. It has a loyal customer base, and its subscription services, including Apple Music and Apple TV+, are experiencing significant growth. While China has historically been a significant market for the company, it experienced a 7.7% year-over-year sales decline in FY24. India, on the other hand, achieved record revenue in FQ4 2024. Despite headwinds, its strong brand loyalty and continuous innovation efforts position it well for long-term growth. Apple's Services revenue reached an all-time high of $25 billion in FQ4 2024, a 12% year-over-year increase, particularly attributed to the App Store. This diversification lessens its dependence on hardware sales. Still, the launch of the iPhone 16, with its AI-powered features, is anticipated to fuel significant demand. Analysts project 90 million units of the iPhone 16 to be sold in 2025. Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed AAPL stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here's what is said regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company’s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple’s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.” Overall AAPL ranks 7th on our list of the best technology stocks to invest in for the long term. As we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BlackRock Exits Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative

Time Published: 2025-01-09T21:11:29Z

BlackRock will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, an investor group committed to achieving net-zero portfolios by 2050 or sooner across all assets under management, a spokesperson for BlackRock confirmed to CIO. The initiative counts more than 325 signatories representing $57.5 trillion in AUM. BlackRock joined the NZAM initiative in March 2021. In the firm’s 2030 net-zero statement, BlackRock anticipates at least 75% of its client assets under management to be invested in “issuers with science-based targets or equivalent.” “We are disappointed to see any investor withdraw, but as a voluntary initiative, we respect any individual decisions signatories take,” a spokesperson for the Net Zero Asset Manager initiative said via email. “Climate risk is financial risk. NZAM exists to help investors mitigate these risks and to realize the benefits of the economic transition to net zero.” The exit comes as similar climate investing groups have seen scores of members leave. The Net-Zero Banking Alliance has seen nearly all major U.S. banks, including JPMorganChase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs leave the initiative. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert daily newsletter.  The Climate Action 100+ investor network had also had dozens of high-profile departures, including State Street, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, PIMCO, Franklin Templeton, Nuveen and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, among others. A pushback against environmental, social and governance-based investing and principles is likely to blame for the exodus. Opponents of ESG investing, including many Republicans in Congress and state-elected officials, say the focus of investment managers should be to maximize returns on their investments and that such ESG targets are not aligned with fiduciary duty to their clients. This view has led to a number of states banning their public funds from making ESG investments. In December, the Ohio Legislature banned pension fund and university endowments in the state from making “investment decisions with the primary purpose of influencing any social or environmental policy or attempting to influence the governance of any corporation.” The legislation also bans funds from engaging in shareholder activism. BlackRock has been a frequent target by Republican politicians over what the politicians say is an overcommitment to ESG. A number of states have divested from BlackRock over these concerns, including Texas and the Texas Permanent School Fund, which divested $8.5 billion in assets from the firm. In December, 11 states filed a complaint against BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, accusing the trio of conspiring to suppress the coal market through their significant ownership of coal stocks. That complaint also cited the three firms being signatories to the NZAM initiative and accused the trio of pursuing ESG strategies in non-ESG funds. Last month, BlackRock was terminated as a nearly $1 billion fixed-income manager by the $46 billion Indiana Public Retirement System; under Indiana law, state pension funds cannot invest in managers or service providers determined to have made an ESG commitment. BlackRock’s status as a signatory to the NZAM initiative was cited by Indiana State Treasurer Dan Elliott as such a commitment. “NZAM has successfully helped raise the level of ambition across investors globally and supported their progress as they have sought to navigate their own individual paths toward a decarbonizing economy in line with their long-term financial objectives and fiduciary duties,” the NZAM spokesperson said. “We look forward to continuing to play this constructive role.” Related Stories: Vanguard Withdraws from Net Zero Group After State Pressure Institutional Investors Reaffirm Support for Climate Action 100+ Following Departures Indiana Fund Narrows Finalists to Replace BlackRock Tags: BlackRock, ESG, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, NZAM « Northwestern Mutual to Take Stake in Sixth Street, Form Investment Partnership

Title: Is Visa Inc. (V) the Best Blue Chip Stock to Buy for 2025?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-best-blue-210434489.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stands against other best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025. Both conservative and risk-tolerant investors favor blue chip stocks due to their solid business models, impressive track records, and attractive risk-reward profiles. These stocks are backed by companies with strong brand names and reputations that generate dependable earnings and consistent dividends, which provide stability and passive income during turbulent market conditions. In recent years, Wall Street has become reliant on the best blue chip stocks. While the S&P 500 was up by about 24% in 2024, most of the gains were driven by gains in seven of the biggest blue chip stocks. The “Magnificent 7” stocks, which include seven of the biggest companies by market cap, accounted for a 13.7% point gain in the S&P 500. Therefore, investors who focused on these stocks ended up generating significant gains. READ ALSO: Billionaire Israel Englander’s Top 10 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025 and 15 Stocks Targeted By Activist Hedge Funds. The trend is not expected to change in 2025. Blue chip companies should be the biggest beneficiary as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates and the new administration under Donald Trump pushes for fewer regulations. The easing of regulatory pressure that has taken a significant toll on tech giants should be a boon to see blue chip stocks edge even higher. David Miller, co-founder at Catalyst Funds, expects blue chip stocks to continue leading the way in 2025. “The Mag 7 stocks are generating significant growth in terms of revenue and earnings power,” he said earlier this month. “These companies are massive monopoly businesses with strong fundamental tail winds. I have no reason to believe that the Mag 7 names won’t continue to dominate the S&P in 2025.” Valuations among the blue-chip stocks have gotten out of hand after two years of blockbuster gains amid the artificial intelligence frenzy. Blue chip companies boast significant profits and a competitive edge to back their valuations up, however. “The Magnificent Seven are not pie-in-the-sky companies: They’re generating “tremendous” revenue for investors”, said Fitzgerald, principal and founding member of Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo. “How much more gain can be made is the question,” he added. Therefore, any well-diversified investment portfolio should include some of the best blue chip stocks. It’s the only way investors can take advantage of the market rally that’s driven by various factors, including the artificial intelligence frenzy, robust economic growth and friendly monetary policy. To make our list of the 10 best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025, we analyzed the market, focusing on large market cap companies (more than $100 billion) with well-established, financially sound businesses. We then examined their performance over the past year, focusing on the underlying fundamentals that make them stand out. Finally, we ranked these companies in ascending order based on their 12-month return in 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a credit card being swiped on a payment terminal, reflecting the company's payments technology. Market Cap as of January 8: $605.34 Billion Past Year Gain (2024): 19% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 165 Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is a payment technology company that offers VisaNet, a transaction processing network that enables authorization, clearing, and settlement of payment transactions. While the company operates in a highly cyclical sector susceptible to varying economic conditions, its stock has remained resilient. The competitive edge stems from the company’s focus on payment facilitation and operating the world’s biggest credit card network. It collaborates with 14,500 financial institution partners and powers 4.5 billion cards globally. The massive network allowed the company to process almost $16 trillion in payments last year. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) generates significant revenues in fees regardless of prevailing economic conditions. In contrast, its other peers that engage in lending suffer immensely during recessions on having to cover for loan losses and delinquencies. Additionally, Visa’s edge stems from expanding its footprint across the globe. It remains one of the best blue chip stocks to buy, as the company has enjoyed sustained double-digit growth in cross-border volume in emerging markets. Since going public in 2008, the company has distributed dividends. It currently distributes a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share, translating to a 0.73% yield. Although the yield might not seem impressive, Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) has a solid dividend-raising history, 15 years and counting. Montaka Global Investments stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Montaka owns several duopolists in the financial services industry, including Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard in payments; and S&P Global in credit ratings and financial data services. These businesses have competitively protected and reliably growing core businesses. But they also have newer, high-probability adjacent opportunities. The market, however, is underappreciating this powerful combination, in our view. Overall, V ranks 9th on our list of best blue chip stocks to buy for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of V as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than V but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Private Lenders Set to Take Over Alacrity in Debt Restructuring

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Direct lenders including Antares Capital, Blue Owl Capital Inc and KKR & Co are preparing to take over insurance claims manager Alacrity Solutions, the latest restructuring in the private credit market, according to people with knowledge of the matter. BlackRock Inc. is set to hand over control of the company to its lenders less than two years after it purchased a 70% majority stake in the firm from Kohlberg & Co., said the people who asked not to be identified as the details are private. BlackRock’s existing equity investment will be completely wiped out, the people said, adding the firm invested about $560 million in equity at the time through its Long Term Private Capital strategy. Alacrity’s debt load, which was already in place when BlackRock purchased the stake, includes a roughly $1 billion unitranche from direct lenders and a more than $500 million junior capital piece from Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the people said. Alacrity, which handles insurance claims through a network of adjusters, struggled as weather-related claims dwindled, Bloomberg reported. More insurance companies have also brought adjusting services in-house, curtailing the company’s client base. Now, those same lenders are ready to become the owners. First-lien holders will end up owning around 90% of the company under the restructuring plan, while the junior-capital provider GSAM will get the remaining piece, the people said. Antares, Blue Owl, KKR and the other lenders will convert about half of their loan into equity, while also providing about $175 million of new debt in the form of a revolving credit facility and a delayed-draw term loan, they said. Alacrity’s capital structure will include an about $450 million term loan and $250 million of preferred equity. Alacrity said it’s in a new financing accord with existing financial partners in a press release. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter, while operations will remain unaffected in the interim, according to the statement. An Alacrity spokesperson declined to provide further details on the financing. Representatives for Antares, BlackRock, Blue Owl and GSAM declined to comment. KKR didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment on the additional financing details, but had declined to comment on the deal previously. It’s the latest large restructuring to come to light in the private credit world in the past 12 months, as companies continue to grapple with higher rates and private credit managers struggle to stay ahead of potential losses. Pluralsight Inc., an educational-software company, restructured last year and lenders took the keys to the business. Some market participants have warned of increased stress, as interest-rate relief keeps being pushed back. Private lenders are often able to stay ahead of restructurings and defaults by quietly amending loans and finding other solutions. However, even those back-door strategies have been put to the test in recent months. BlackRock is working with Evercore Inc., while Centerview Partners and AlixPartners are advising Alacrity, Bloomberg previously reported. The unitranche direct lenders are being advised by Latham & Watkins and FTI Consulting Inc. (Updates starting in second paragraph with further financing details.)

Title: As Los Angeles Burns, Conspiracy Peddlers Lie About—and Celebrate—the Danger We’re Living Through
URL: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/01/los-angeles-fires-conspiracies/
Time Published: 2025-01-09T20:39:10Z
Full Content:
Mother Jones illustration; Getty For the last two mornings, I’ve woken up from broken sleep in my house on Los Angeles’ east side in a blind panic, the smell of smoke permeating the air. The light slanting in is a horrible, eerie orange, illuminating the white kitchen cabinets like a nightmare projection screen. When I climb onto the roof, the air in every direction is full of dark, low, menacing clouds fed by smoke, blocking out the mountains and trees even just a few miles away. Every wildfire is accused of not being a wildfire, but a planned attack to further sinister ends. Our car is packed. Our important documents are in a tote bag by the back door. Every ping from the Watch Duty app, which sends out real-time fire alerts, sends me scrambling for my phone. I’m anxiously scrutinizing the perimeter of the Eaton fire, which has destroyed the homes of friends and community landmarks I love, willing it not to jump the 134 highway, praying today will be the day that helitankers will be able to slow the spread. I watch helplessly as the other fires across town engulf homes, businesses, send pets and livestock fleeing alone, reduce lives and memories to ash. I pray the death toll doesn’t mount higher. I watch friends and acquaintances on Instagram reporting from where they’ve evacuated, haggard and blank-faced with shock in hotel rooms and packed cars. I don’t know what kind of city we’ll have waiting for us on the other side of this. Naturally, then, as a journalist who’s covered conspiracy theories and disinformation for many years, it’s been reassuring to learn that the disaster threatening my safety can be blamed on false flag attacks, Democrat plotting, the evils of diversity, and—say it with me—the Jews. A disaster is a ripe moment for conspiracy peddlers to ply their wares, and a historic series of fires threatening a major city—especially one filled with Democrats, non-white people and wealthy celebrities—has sent the machine into overdrive. The theories being spread about the Los Angeles fires, as Nitish Pahwa wrote yesterday, are a mix of climate change denialism and attempts to pin the disasters on their usual and preferred villains. Perhaps most disturbing of all, they also contain an ugly dose of celebration and schadenfreude. “The Hollywood Hills are on fire,” are burning, tweeted an account associated with the network of Stew Peters, a far-right and deeply antisemitic podcaster. “It’s almost poetic.” Some of the themes emerging are consistent: pretty much every wildfire is accused of not being a wildfire at all, but a planned attack meant to further some sinister end. This serves two purposes: casting doubt on the established science of climate change, and finding a more politically useful target to pin a disaster on. Conspiracy peddlers blamed the devastating 2018 wildfires in Northern California on “directed energy weapons,” a tidy mix of climate change skepticism blended with endless paranoia about what the government is capable of perpetrating on its own citizens. Typically, proponents’ “evidence” for this will be claiming that the fire is displaying unusual or suspicious behavior, unlike a “normal” fire. Those ideas quickly surfaced this week: Stew Peters, for instance, claimed that in some firestruck areas “none of the bushes and trees were disturbed at all” and the “lawns are still green,” adding, “the government wants to kill you and then they want to steal your land.” (This is, needless to say, simple bullshit: landscaping, brush, hedges and lawns have all been very much “disturbed” in fire-damaged areas.) “[O]ur Government who is working hand in glove with the WEF and Blackrock, is PURPOSELY setting fires using Military grade DEWs in these areas to initiate a MASSIVE LAND GRAB,” read another post representative of the theory, made on X by someone calling himself The Patriot Voice. Their account is verified, meaning that the user pays for Twitter and thus has the visibility of their posts and replies boosted on the site. The post has so far been viewed 180,000 times. The other common target from far-right conspiracists has been “DEI initiatives,” as a way of pushing the idea that Los Angeles’ fire and emergency services are somehow too woke to effectively fight fires, with characters like Chaya Raichik of Libs of TikTok devoting endless tweets to the fact that the Los Angeles Fire Department chief Kristin M. Crowley is a lesbian. As with a lot of conspiracy theories, the particular line of attack has been repeated by other more mainstream sources, including the Daily Wire, ex-Fox host Megyn Kelly, and the Federalist, who proclaimed that the LAFD is “DEI-crazed” and thus “made the fires worse.” Blogger Beth Brelje objected to the fact that the LAFD’s strategic plan didn’t use the word “hydrant” but talked about diversity and sustainability. While the plan doesn’t use that particular word and does include such projects, it discusses a wide range of goals in the sprawling department, including wildfire fighting preparedness. Fire hydrants near the Pacific Palisades fire didn’t run dry because of diversity; they ran dry because of an enormous demand for water to fight fires. Infowars and a variety of other conspiracy sites also claimed that the LAFD was flat-footed because “most of their supplies were sent to Ukraine,” a claim repeated by Donald Trump Jr. In fact, the LAFD sent surplus equipment to Ukraine three years ago, part of a national effort by fire departments to send aid. The “hoses, nozzles, turnouts, helmets, body armor, and other associated personal protective equipment” scrounged up, per the release, was packed up into just five pallets of gear, per a news story at the time—an amount irrelevant to what’s been needed to battle the current, devastating blazes. Some longtime conspiracy peddlers opted to take a more blanket approach, throwing out a list of buzzwords rather than pin responsibility for the fires on any one source. “Communist China sabotage teams?,” tweeted far-right personality and Pizzagate promoter Mike Cernovich. “Druggies? Random criminals doing arson? In Soros County LA, you can never know who is lighting these fires.” Despite the ugliness that I see every time I look at my phone for too long, out in the real world, there have been moments of beauty and solidarity. I’m on a text chain with my closest neighbors, which has been full of advice, gentle check-ins, and moments of delirious celebration: when work crews got our power turned back on we joked about who’d be the first outside to meet them with a bottle of tequila. (They vanished before I could dig out the good stuff, sadly.) Astonishingly, we’ve gotten regular mail deliveries; our mask-wearing mail carrier cheerfully greeted me with some letters, and told me, “I’m just pretending like it’s snow,” gesturing at the ash falling on our heads. Friends and acquaintances and family and total strangers have checked in, some offering their addresses as places to go. My brother-in-law offered to get in the car and drive to me. In the midst of a disaster, there are always moments of genuine warmth and solidarity. But none of them come from the people who are in the business of peddling fear and panic.

Title: Is PG&E Corporation (PCG) the Best Utility Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Utility Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) stands against the other utility stocks. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is putting an unprecedented strain on the power grid. One of the primary concerns is the unpredictable nature of AI demand. Unlike traditional industries, AI companies are experiencing exponential growth, making it difficult for utilities to forecast and plan for energy demand. This uncertainty is further complicated as the regulatory framework governing utilities is also a significant obstacle to addressing the energy crisis. Utilities are required to petition regulators for approval to invest in new infrastructure, which can be a time-consuming and uncertain process. This has led to a situation where utilities are unable to invest in the infrastructure needed to support the growth of AI, exacerbating the energy crisis. Read Also: 15 Energy Infrastructure Stocks That Are Skyrocketing and 12 Best Middle East and Africa Stocks To Buy Right Now. In an interview with CNBC on December 6, Nicholas Campanella, Senior Equity Research Analyst at Barclays, discussed the growing demand for power to support the increasing needs of data centers and the tech industry. Campanella forecasts that the US would face a shortage of resources to meet this demand, making nuclear power an attractive option. Campanella cited the fact that gas turbines are largely sold out between now and 2029, and limited ability to bring on new renewables between now and 2026-2027. Campanella emphasized that the growing demand for power from data centers and hyperscalers would drive up demand for nuclear energy. Given the recent surge in their price, Campanella highlighted that investors should still buy stocks in utility and independent power-producing companies involved in nuclear power, citing the growing mismatch between supply and demand for power in the late decade. According to Campanella, utility companies that have nuclear assets are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, particularly those with early site permits or Combined Operating Licenses. Campanella pointed out that the last nuclear renaissance had left several sites with existing permits, which could be leveraged to expedite the development of new nuclear facilities. He forecasts that additional large-scale and Small Modular Reactor (SMR) commitments will be made in 2025. The growing energy demands driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence and data centers present opportunities for investors, particularly in utility companies. With that in context, let’s take a look at the 12 best utility stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Our Methodology For this article, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the 40 largest utility companies. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders, as of Q3 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Brightly-lit nighttime view of an electricity power grid with distribution lines and transmission substations. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49 PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG), headquartered in San Francisco, is the parent company of Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The company serves approximately 16 million customers in Northern and Central California. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) generates electricity through a mix of natural gas, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable resources. PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is actively expanding its capital investment plan to meet the growing demand for energy infrastructure in California. The company recently added $1 billion to its five-year capital plan, bringing the total to $63 billion through 2028. This additional investment is a direct response to the increasing customer demand for electrification, from housing developments to electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, data centers, and commercial projects. The capital is designed to enhance the reliability and resilience of the company’s infrastructure while ensuring that these investments are affordable for customers and accretive to the company's earnings. Additionally, PG&E Corporation (NYSE:PCG) is exploring innovative solutions to leverage new load in ways that benefit the grid. One notable example is the partnership with the Open School District and Zoom to deploy the nation's largest bidirectional electric school bus fleet. This fleet is equipped with vehicle-to-grid technology, allowing the buses to return energy to the grid when not in use. Overall PCG ranks 5th on our list of the best utility stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of PCG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PCG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: CA Tax Loophole Benefits Oil and Gas Companies, Undermines Firefighting Revenue

California’s oil and gas companies avoided paying billions of dollars in taxes that could have been used to fight the inferno. Fossil fuel companies are profiting off an obscure state tax break depriving California of up to $146 million of annual tax revenue that could be used to combat climate change-fueled wildfires, according to a new report released amid an inferno tearing through Los Angeles. The tax break has persisted for decades in the Democrat-controlled state even as California has faced deficits and cuts to wildfire preparedness — including recent cuts to the Los Angeles Fire Department’s budget. During the first night of the fires, firefighters struggled to obtain water from fire hydrants in Pacific Palisades, a neighborhood that had been set ablaze in western Los Angeles. A city council member who represents the Palisades neighborhood blamed the lack of water on “chronic underinvestment.” Just sign up below for a free subscription to The Lever to get access to this story and much more.

Title: BlackRock quits climate group in Wall Street's latest environmental step-back

By Ross Kerber (Reuters) - BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it will leave the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the latest Wall Street firm to depart an environmentally focused investor group under pressure from Republican politicians. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion, said that with two-thirds of its global clients committed to cutting emissions to net zero, it had made sense to join groups like the organization known as NZAMI. "However, our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," leading to the departure, according to a client letter reviewed by Reuters. Its departure, BlackRock said, "does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios." The firm said its active portfolio managers "continue to assess material climate-related risks." NZAMI members pledge to support the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, using influence such as how they vote their proxies at corporate meetings. The group currently counts more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion, according to its website. Major Wall Street lenders have left a similar climate organization for banks in recent weeks ahead of the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and as his fellow Republicans take control of Congress. While the departures may not have a direct effect on lending or share purchases, the companies' participation was seen as a marker of investors' environmental priorities. In December the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee sought information from BlackRock and dozens of other asset managers involved with NZAMI. In November BlackRock and rivals were sued by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states that claimed their activism cut coal production and boosted energy prices. BlackRock has denied wrongdoing and said the lawsuit "discourages investments in the companies consumers rely on." BlackRock's exit so far has not prompted others to follow. Representatives for two of its rivals, the asset management arms of State Street (NYSE:STT) and JPMorgan, said on Thursday they remain NZAMI members. Another major passive fund manager, Vanguard, left the group in 2022. A NZAMI spokesperson via email called any investor withdrawal disappointing. "Climate risk is financial risk. NZAM exists to help investors mitigate these risks and to realise the benefits of the economic transition to net zero," the spokesperson said. Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Funds, oversaw her firm's departure from NZAMI in 2023 even though it avoids oil and coal stocks. On Thursday she called the departures by bigger firms "disheartening" since their memberships showed investors want lower-carbon portfolios. "This is short sighted given the stark realities of climate change and the need to push for environmentally responsible actions in corporate America," Samuelrich said. CLEANING THINGS UP Efforts such as NZAMI, which was created in 2020 and boosted by a 2021 United Nations climate conference, began without controversy as world leaders looked for ways to harness capital to transition the world to cleaner energy sources. But U.S. Republican officials, many from energy-producing states, have disparaged the efforts as "woke capital" claiming they violate antitrust laws. In a statement sent by a representative, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan called BlackRock's departure "a huge win for freedom and American prosperity. All U.S. financial institutions should follow suit and abandon the climate cartel and woke ESG policies," using an acronym referring to investor consideration of environmental, social and governance factors. In its client letter, BlackRock said its sustainable-investment efforts are "driven by the needs of our clients and our continued investment conviction that the energy transition is a mega force shaping economies and markets."

Title: AVITA Medical, Inc. (RCEL): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avita-medical-inc-rcel-bull-190456504.html
Time Published: 2025-01-09T19:04:56Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL) on Substack by Steve Wagner. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on RCEL. AVITA Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCEL)'s share was trading at $8.94 as of Jan 8th. A doctor interacting with a patient, discussing the progress of their treatment. Avita Medical (NASDAQ:RCEL) has recently secured FDA approval for its new RECELL GO mini, a disposable cartridge designed specifically for treating smaller wounds up to 480 square centimeters. This innovative product fills a critical gap in the wound care market, particularly for high-volume, smaller wounds typically encountered in trauma and burn centers. Unlike the standard RECELL GO, which is capable of treating wounds up to 1,920 square centimeters, the mini version uses the same multi-use processing device but with an optimized cartridge for smaller skin samples. This adjustment leads to reduced resource consumption and waste, making the product more cost-effective, a key consideration for hospitals facing budget constraints. The RECELL GO mini approval is a strategic move for Avita, allowing the company to expand its reach into a segment of the market previously underserved by its standard offering. This smaller version targets trauma centers that previously could not justify the use of the standard RECELL GO due to the size of their patients' wounds. By providing a more versatile, smaller-scale solution, Avita aims to lower the barriers to adoption, encouraging trauma centers to integrate the RECELL GO platform into their treatments. This should drive increased product uptake, particularly in facilities that treat smaller wounds, which are common in trauma and burn cases. Avita plans to begin rolling out the RECELL GO mini in Q1 2025, aligning the product launch with hospital budgeting cycles. This timing could expedite adoption, as healthcare facilities often make purchasing decisions at the start of the fiscal year. With the U.S. burn care market alone valued at over $2 billion, Avita is positioning itself to capture a larger share of the market by offering a solution that covers a wider range of wound sizes. The mini cartridge’s efficiency, which reduces waste and optimizes resources, should help hospitals manage costs while improving patient care. For Avita Medical, the approval of RECELL GO mini is expected to drive significant revenue growth by attracting new customers and expanding sales within existing accounts. By offering a more practical, size-specific solution, the company stands to improve its margins through more efficient use of resources, while increasing adoption across trauma and burn centers. This strategic product expansion enhances Avita’s market positioning, and as the company continues to roll out the RECELL GO mini, it is likely to see positive financial results, making it an attractive investment opportunity.

Title: Funding Rates Down: Is Bitcoin Heading For A $90K Correction?

Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations have left investors in a state of uncertainty, as the cryptocurrency has seen a dramatic decline from its peak of nearly $107,000 to around $94,550. This volatility raises essential questions about the ability of Bitcoin to maintain its rally and whether it can regain its footing in the coming weeks. CryptoQuant analyst Shayan has had something important to say about current conditions in Bitcoins. According to him, the price is trying to stabilize right above the value of $92,000 level, which he further says is a key support. He notes that Bitcoin is stabilizing near the $92,000 mark, which he identifies as a crucial support zone. If Bitcoin breaks below this level, it could trigger a wave of long liquidations and push prices down toward the 100-day moving average of $81,000. Also, this line has been performing as a real dynamic support by attracting buying inflows and can also cushion prices during further descent. Shayan underlines the role of market sentiment and technical indicators. At present, Bitcoin is fluctuating at significant support levels which are created in the $90K level and Fibonacci retracement levels at $87K and $82K. If the above-mentioned levels do not hold, there could be further selling pressure with corrections. Amidst this uncertainty, renowned cryptocurrency analyst Crypto Rover has expressed a bullish outlook for Bitcoin. He recently compared today’s price action with historical patterns, suggesting that January could see positive trends for Bitcoin. #Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. January will turn green. You’ll regret not buying more here. pic.twitter.com/DCssLNMGh6 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) January 8, 2025 In a tweet, he stated, “Bitcoin history is exactly repeating. January will turn green. You’ll regret not buying more here.” His analysis indicates that if Bitcoin can break through the critical resistance level of $100,000, it could potentially barrel past $107,000. Rover’s positivity is strengthened by the huge capital inflows in Bitcoin ETFs, which attracted more than $900 million of inflows from institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity. Increasing institutional interest also signals confidence in the long-term prospect of Bitcoin. However, he also cautions that failure to close above the $100,000 mark will lead to a pullback to $92,000 or even lower. The broader cryptocurrency market is feeling the strain too. This decline comes in tandem with Bitcoin’s failure to stay afloat, and other cryptocurrencies such as Ether and Solana have fallen by more than 7%. Even the traditional stocks of the crypto sector, such as MicroStrategy and Coinbase, have been down sharply. Funding rates falling within the derivatives market adds yet another layer of bearish sentiment around Bitcoin. According to Shayan, the decreasing funding rates had reflected dipping demand for derivatives, which also played a pivotal role in maintaining price trends.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: This 14.3% Dividend Could Double In Trump 2.0

PHOENIX, ARIZONA - DECEMBER 22: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump smiles during Turning Point USA's ... [+] AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center on December 22, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. The annual four day conference geared toward energizing and connecting conservative youth hosts some of the country's leading conservative politicians and activists. (Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is an intriguing everything-proof stock for Trump 2.0. The company specializes in cutting-edge surgical devices and regardless of what the Fed or President-Elect Trump does in 2025, we know that Americans will continue to have surgeries. Human surgeons are expensive and prone to mistakes, so the big trend in the surgery room is towards robotics. Intuitive created the da Vinci system, the most widely used surgical robot in the world. Business is booming. The company anticipates 12% to 16% year-over-year demand growth for da Vinci. Its technology is less invasive and more precise than humans, which leads to faster recovery times for patients. The company just launched da Vinci 5, which has already been used in over 12,000 procedures. ISRG shareholders had a field day during Trump 1.0. The stock returned 179%. Why wouldn’t history repeat, or at least rhyme, and reward investors with another double or better? The bummer for us dividend investors is that Intuitive doesn’t pay one. Now, we could manufacture a payout by buying the stock and selling covered calls. But that is a pain. Today, call options with strike prices just above ISRG’s current price fetch a $10+/share premium. They expire later this month. So we could buy the stock, sell (“write”) those covered calls, and pocket the 2% premium. Then, we rinse and repeat in February. And March. And so on. We know this strategy. But it is a grind. Why not outsource it to, say, a fund manager? Rather than spending the rest of our lives writing covered calls, we are going to explore a “backdoor” payout play on ISRG. It nets us a 14.3% yearly dividend, paid monthly. Better yet, there are no monthly check-ins from our side. We buy the fund once and manager Dr. Erin Xie and her team do the rest of the work. All we do is buy the closed-end fund (CEF) BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (BMEZ). ISRG is Dr. Xie’s top holding at 4.6% of the portfolio. What a pick! The doctor’s fund BMEZ must be rallying in anticipation of Trump 2.0, right? Wrong! On the contrary, the fund sits in the bargain bin, believe it or not. BMEZ trades at a 9% discount to the value of its assets. In other words, we are able to snag this high-yield bounty for just 91 cents on the dollar. We’re “up” 9% without breaking a sweat. Why the sweet dividend deal? On the campaign trail, Trump said he was going to let former candidate turned supporter Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “go wild on health.” A big “uh oh” for healthcare stocks? The Wall Street suits didn’t wait around to find out. They have dumped anything and everything healthcare since the election and especially since RFK was nominated to run the Department of Health and Human Services. Big pharma has especially been a hot potato because Trump also said of RFK at a rally: “I’m going to let him go wild on medicines.” But Intuitive is not a medicine peddler. It is a surgical robotics innovator. Emotional investors will throw out an entire sector willy-nilly. So, the BMEZ selloff makes exactly zero sense. The same logic extends to BMEZ’s top five holdings. Check out how they performed as a group during Trump 1.0! BMEZ Top Holdings These are all companies that benefit from less regulation. They returned 126%, 141%, 179%, 227% and over 1,000% during the first four years under Trump! BMEZ is a neat way for us income investors to buy the basket, plus some. Dr. Xie’s team sells covered calls on its holdings to generate additional cash. Better BlackRock than us! We don’t need the monthly options headache. Nor the long separate tax bill! The covered call income powers the big payout. Plus, we have price upside via a potential “rhyme” of Trump 1.0 for stock holdings like Intuitive. The healthcare sector-at-large is cheap and BMEZ is a straight-up bargain at just 91 cents on the dollar. Not only that, but also investors just received a modest dividend raise. BMEZ dished a $0.17809 dividend in December, raising the fund’s yield to 14.3%. Again, that is paid monthly. (The raise was part of BlackRock’s managed distribution play for the fund, which targets an annualized 12% payout—mission accomplished, BR.) BMEZ Dividend This contrarian income delight flies under the radar in CEFland. Sign us up for the big dividend and generous discount.

An aerial view of a bustling international airport terminal. Shares of Edison International (NYSE:EIX) dived by 10.18 percent on Wednesday to finish at $69.50 apiece, its largest decline since September 2022, after news that its subsidiary Southern California Edison, implemented a power shutdown affecting 114,000 customers due to ongoing wildfires in the region. Multiple large fires are burning around Los Angeles aggravated by strong winds. According to a report by Associated Press, tens of thousands of people have been ordered to evacuate and at least two people have died. While the company did not provide any timeline as to when electricity service will be restored, it said that the shutdown was part of its precautionary measures to prevent further wildfire-related damages. Overall, EIX ranks 8th on our list of tech, energy stocks are Wednesday's worst performers. While we acknowledge the potential of EIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

In this article, we will look at the performance of some of the worst-performing companies and explore the factors behind their decline. We considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume to come up with Wednesday’s top losers. Shares of Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) dropped by 11.46 percent to finish at $26.12 each on Wednesday after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang’s recent statement that very useful quantum computers may still be more than 15 years away. Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO), along with other nuclear energy counterparts, all posted declines. According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, investors have hoped that the boom in artificial intelligence and data centers would fuel the growth of nuclear energy companies. In other developments, the sell-off was also partly due to profit-taking after the company rose to an all-time high on Monday, reaching $28.34 each.

While the crypto world is eager for another monumental bull run, the spotlight is shifting to a promising newer platform: DTX Exchange. With a presale price of just $0.14, this platform is turning heads and gaining traction daily. Analysts are hailing DTX as a hidden gem with the potential to disrupt the decentralized finance (DeFi) market and deliver significant gains. This article discusses how DTX Exchange is poised to be the best ICO of 2025 and the largest altcoin movement yet. DTX Exchange (DTX): A Game-Changer in DeFi Space The crypto market is full of numerous investment promises. DTX Exchange aims to redefine the trading landscape focused on versatility and user-friendliness. This best ICO bridges the gap between the financial markets and cryptos, empowering users with access to over 120,000 instruments (stocks, forex, bonds, and commodities). DTX Exchange could also bring true real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, where users can invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other tangible assets. This integration will potentially attract institutional investors and boost its value to the upside. Another innovative feature that sets DTX apart is its 1000x leverage feature. Here, it offers traders unmatched profit potential while maintaining privacy through KYC-free trading. Unlike many platforms that compromise between centralization and decentralization, DTX blends the advantages of both, making it a pioneer in hybrid trading. DTX’s Staggering $11.3 Million Presale Makes It The Best ICO The trading platform is built on its proprietary blockchain, VulcanX, which helps foster innovation within the DTX ecosystem. Interestingly, its blockchain testnet has demonstrated remarkable performance, reaching over 100,000 transactions per second. Regarding its presale, DTX Exchange has amassed over $11.3 million in funding. With DTX tokens available at $0.14, this project represents an incredible value proposition. Analysts predict that the token could easily surpass $1 shortly after listing, with long-term targets projecting a potential 10x to 50x increase after presale. A major milestone for DTX Exchange is its CoinMarketCap listing, a move that has increased visibility and trading volume. Following this listing, experts suggest DTX’s market capitalization could skyrocket to $1 billion, aligning it with top-tier altcoins. Moreover, whispers of partnerships with industry giants like BlackRock hint at significant institutional backing. Such collaborations could amplify DTX’s credibility and pave the way for listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. What Sets DTX Apart In A Crowded Market? While the crypto space is teeming with altcoins, DTX Exchange distinguishes itself through innovation, practicality, and strategic execution and becomes the best ICO. Its focus on bridging traditional and crypto markets and features like high leverage and tokenized RWAs could make it uniquely positioned to thrive in 2025’s bullish landscape. Additionally, the platform’s commitment to decentralization resonates with the ethos of the crypto community. Its secure infrastructure may appeal to institutions seeking reliable blockchain solutions. Key Takeaways The crypto market thrives on early opportunities, and DTX Exchange might be a compelling prospect this year. Its presale price of $0.14 offers a chance to get it early before it skyrockets into a multi-billion-dollar venture. Interestingly, DTX Exchange has all the ingredients for long-term success, from its innovative hybrid trading model to its ambitious global expansion plans- making it the best ICO of the year. As this best ICO gears up for its top-tier exchange listing, investors may need to act now and get in at what experts call a steal.

Title: Private equity wants a piece of your 401(k) — and hopes Trump can make it happen

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Private equity firms are hoping that the new Trump administration makes it easier for them access to something they have long wanted: your 401(k). Wall Street investment giants view Main Street retirement savings as a way to boost demand for non-listed illiquid bets that aren’t traded on any public exchange. Such investments include real estate funds, private credit, and leveraged buyouts of companies. Typically, private equity firms such as Apollo (APO), Blackstone (BX), and KKR (KKR) pool money from high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors such as endowments and public pensions to make these bets. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) What they have long wanted to tap is more than $12 trillion currently housed in defined-contribution plans that workers rely on for their retirement nest eggs, such as 401(k)s. The Biden administration has not warmed to that idea, but industry watchers expect that to change under Donald Trump's second term. He is expected to broadly loosen regulations that affect the world of financial services. "We’ll make the case for a pro-growth regulatory regime that supports small businesses and provides more opportunity to everyday investors," said Drew Maloney, president and CEO of private equity lobbying group American Investment Council. The argument for such a change is that private equity funds could give everyday investors more diversification away from public markets and a shot at bigger returns — in exchange for some illiquidity. Read more: How much should I contribute to my 401(k)? The reasoning aligns with broader concerns many investors have over the historically high valuation of the current stock market and the concentration of Big Tech stocks. Of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 index (^GSPC), all but Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) are tech giants. Together those 10 account for 37% of the index. Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo, has argued that too many investors are relying on the performance of too few public companies. "Should we get access to 401(k) through broad-based reform or regulatory change or regulatory encouragement, I believe that would be upside not just for us but for the entire industry," Rowan told analysts in November. Today, both private and public assets carry risks and rewards, Rowan told Yahoo Finance later that same month, with more companies opting to go private than public. "The biggest trend in our industry is investors, individual investors, and institutional investors looking at their fixed income bucket and saying to themselves, why is this 100% public?" Others in his industry have made similar points. "I totally agree with our brethren at Apollo," BlackRock (BLK) CFO Martin Small said in December at a Goldman Sachs conference, when discussing the topic of putting private loans into retirement portfolios. Getting private equity into 401(k)s "is a big opportunity" and "just makes sense," KKR co-CEO Scott Nuttall said at the same Goldman conference in New York. The argument against opening retirement savings to private equity is that the funds can be riskier than plain-vanilla index funds and are less liquid, making it difficult to get money out if things go sideways. Private equity also isn’t cheap, as fees can eat into investment gains. Many private equity firms charge investors fees that amount to 2% of assets and 20% of any profits. There is no law stating that private equity can’t be a part of 401(k) offerings that millions of Americans rely on for their retirement savings, but what the industry will likely want is specific guidance from the Labor Department stating that such investments can be acceptable alternatives for these accounts. The first Trump administration said as much in 2020. But the Biden administration’s Labor Department reversed that guidance by saying it didn’t recommend it. Any new guidance on this front from Washington may also need to come with legal liability protection for retirement plan sponsors and administrators, Nuttall said in December. They are "clearly going to need some comfort for themselves from a litigation risk," he added.

Title: Garry Ringrose confident Leinster can balance the yin and yang of attack and defence

Garry Ringrose is hoping that any rugby chat in 2025 relates to on-pitch exploits. A couple of shoulder injuries, in a Champions Cup game against the Leicester Tigers in January last year and then on his return in a cameo appearance as a replacement on the wing for Ireland in their final Six Nations game against Scotland, scuppered the season from a playing perspective. He did come back in time to start Leinster’s URC semi-final defeat to the Bulls in June. Since then he has appeared in all five Test matches for Ireland, starting three of the five games from the second Test victory over the Springboks in Durban and the Autumn Nations Series internationals at the Aviva Stadium against New Zealand and Argentina. Seven appearances for Leinster this season, including two in Europe, underline his rude health. If there was any lingering doubt his thumping tackle on another Blackrock alumnus AJ MacGinty, the Bristol outhalf, expunged that notion. On Sunday he returns to Stade Marcel Deflandre where he helped the Irish province to the first of two wins last season over a club, La Rochelle, that had previously proved a nemesis. Leinster’s defence coach Jacques Nienaber had started work a couple of weeks before that pool fixture in December 2023, but his influence was already palpable in a rain-drenched arm wrestle. While there was no silverware Leinster continued to evolve, searching for a sweet spot where defence and attack are equally formidable. The trick was in trying not to rob Peter to pay Paul when it came to focusing on one aspect of the game more so than the other. Ringrose was asked about maintaining that equilibrium this week. “It’s always a little bit elusive, any given week, any given day you’re trying to get the balance right, when you have the ball, when you don’t, what will help you to win the game.” There are weeks when one side of the ball gets a little more play in training. He offered an example. “It can happen. The Bristol week, we would have shone the light defensively a lot on how many tries they score, their attack, how dangerous they are; that would have maybe been a week you shine the light defensively more. “Any given week you’re only ever doing the best you can to win so it’s always an interesting challenge. It makes it exciting though when you’re testing yourself against the best, (the likes of) La Rochelle, you have to get them both (attack and defence) spot on if you want a chance of winning, you can’t go all-in on one or the other.” Drilling down a little further into the constituent parts, Ringrose explained that the evolution process never stands still. “Essentially, defensively working with Jacques (Nienaber) we’re still learning and there is still things we’re maybe not getting right, trying to be quicker and become more instinctive. We are repping that in training as much as possible. And then in games you get exposed to it with a bit more consequence obviously. We like to think we’ve improved and got better defensively. In attack guess the score line probably flattered us (in the win over Munster). Whether we can get things to click a little bit better is the challenge for us. “The last time I played (against La Rochelle) was a wet day over there, there wasn’t much attacking, there was a lot of kicking, a lot of set piece and scrums and mauls and picking and going close to the line. We’ll have to be ready from that perspective, but if it is a bit drier (we must) get our set piece starters right and then because kicking is a big part of the game for us and them, be ready to go off the back of that.” It was put to him that maybe the attack might have suffered with more emphasis on the defence. Ringrose said: “I wouldn’t...I don’t think I’d use the word suffered. It’s like a tug-of-war between the two (attack and defence) in any given week. “Tyler (Bleyendaal) wants his minutes for us and same with Jacques; they are working unbelievably closely and they’re almost running meetings symbiotically. So I guess it’s always something they’re trying to get better at.” Sunday’s match between two unbeaten teams in Europe offers another benchmarking opportunity to see how that evolution in style is progressing. Despite La Rochelle’s patchy form in the Top 14 Ringrose doesn’t see much slippage from their time as back-to-back European champions. “They are so well drilled and well-oiled at set piece. How they defend, they’re very in sync and put you under massive pressure. Nothing’s changed from that perspective. They’re regarded across every team in Europe as one of the best. You’ve got to be at the races as they say to have any chance to beat them.” John O'Sullivan is an Irish Times sports writer Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Credit Firm SC Lowy Boots Private Debt Focus With New Fund

(Bloomberg) -- Credit investor SC Lowy Financial HK Ltd. will pivot more toward private credit and close a fund focused on public securities, in a bid to seize more opportunities in the burgeoning asset class. Hong Kong-based SC Lowy said in a statement Thursday that it will begin a gradual wind down of the Primary Investment Fund, which focuses on market-making activities in public securities across Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Europe. In its place, the firm will in mid-2025 launch a new interval fund, which focuses on direct lending among other securities. The timing of SC Lowy’s shift into private credit, notably in Asia and the Middle East, comes as secondary loan market and high-yield bond opportunities dwindle, the firm said in the statement. SC Lowy’s bet on private markets follows the footsteps of other global players, including BlackRock Inc., Tikehau Capital and Navis Capital Partners. These institutions have set up private funds in hopes of capturing higher returns in Asia Pacific, a region that represents just a fraction of the $1.6 trillion global private credit market. SC Lowy, which currently has $1.6 billion assets under management, has invested in private credit since 2011, according to their website. The firm’s Strategic Investments II and Strategic Investments IV funds, which focus on the asset class, had delivered net internal rates of return of 12.45% as of June 30, 2024 and 15.7%, as of Sept. 30, 2024, respectively, since the funds’ inceptions in 2021 and late 2023, according to a December document seen by Bloomberg.

Title: Wall Street Banks Cleared by Texas AG After Leaving NZBA

(Bloomberg) -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dropped his threat to cut off big US banks from municipal-bond deals after a slew of Wall Street firms exited a controversial climate-finance alliance. In 2023, his office announced that it was reviewing the policies of finance companies that were members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which he has repeatedly criticized. That stemmed from Texas legislation that sought to punish financial firms for engaging in what it viewed as a “boycott” of the oil and gas industries. In recent weeks, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. have said they’re quitting the alliance. Paxton’s office said late Tuesday that its reviews of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan will be closed. Those firms are major underwriters of state and local debt in Texas, one of the biggest markets for muni deals. The Texas attorney general’s office approves most public bond offerings before they’re able to close, giving Paxton influence over which banks can participate in such transactions. Still, the attorney general’s office said in a different notice that Bank of America and JPMorgan are still under review over their firearm policies. A separate GOP law restricts government work with companies that “discriminate” against firearm entities. Lauren Bianchi, a spokesperson for JPMorgan, said in a statement that the firm is proud of its role supporting the state’s energy sector and economy. “We look forward to continuing to help drive growth and prosperity in the state,” the statement said. Representatives for Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. In a statement, Paxton’s office said the alliance pushes members to advance “destructive climate goals regardless of their obligations to consumers and investors.” “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities,” Paxton said. Separately, a group of state attorneys general, led by Paxton, sued BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. in November for allegedly breaking antitrust laws by boosting electricity prices through their investment policies. After the suit was filed, BlackRock said the notion that it would invest “money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense.” (Updates with details on firearm review in the fourth paragraph and comment from JPMorgan in the fifth paragraph) More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira announced the initiative at a Marketing Association of Thailand seminar, emphasizing the program would operate within existing legal frameworks and wouldn't require new legislation. "We won't do anything that is illegal," Chunhavajira was quoted as saying, according to a report from The Nation Thailand. The development signals how the country's approach to digital assets is changing as it seeks to maintain its competitive edge in global finance and tourism. Chunhavajira reportedly highlighted how recent geopolitical conflicts have disrupted global economies, noting that for individuals fleeing political tensions and seeking to purchase property in Thailand, "paying with Bitcoin could be a much simpler process." In any case, the pilot program will allow foreign tourists to register their crypto through Thai exchanges and use it for purchases after identity verification. A clearing house would handle the conversion of digital assets to Thai baht. A separate report from Bangkok Post says that Chunhavajira understands how Bitcoin's limited supply has driven "strong demand" globally. "This indicates more than half of the codes have likely been forgotten, leaving about $1 trillion in liquidity available for exchange," the report quotes Chunhavajira as saying. Decrypt reached out to the report's authors for further information. The move comes as Thailand aims to capitalize on its tourism recovery, with visitor numbers expected to reach 39.8 million in 2025, up from 35-36 million in 2024, Chunhavajira said. Meanwhile, major economies have already accumulated significant Bitcoin reserves, and public companies such as BlackRock, MicroStrategy, and Metaplanet have been piling up. Industry experts, however, warn that Thailand risks falling behind in the broader crypto "arms race." Bitkub Capital founder and CEO Jirayut Srupsrisopa said in an interview with Thai PBS World that the country needs to take action on a strategic Bitcoin reserve. "The cost of inaction is going to be expensive," Srupsrisopa said. "The longer it takes us to decide, the more expensive it will cost the country." Srupsrisopa also claimed that Thailand has “one of the highest crypto adoption per capita” levels globally, with at least one of every seven people having downloaded their app. Meanwhile, grassroots crypto adoption is already taking place in some parts of Thailand. In the Huay Phueng district of Kalasin province, a local community has embraced Bitcoin payments, with over 80 businesses accepting it for everyday transactions.

Title: Garry Ringrose looking for elusive balance between attack and defence for Leinster

Garry Ringrose has added defensive steel to his silky skills. Photo; Sportsfile Perhaps no player embodies Leinster’s journey from fluid attacking force to gnarled defensive machine like Garry Ringrose. When he emerged from Blackrock College and the Leinster Academy, Ringrose was the kind of kid you wouldn’t mind your daughter bringing home. Now, he’s the type of fella you wouldn’t like to meet in a dark alley. Physically, he still looks the same but at 28 he appears to relish the contact more than the gliding runs outside defences. The 2025 edition of Leinster is a meaner, leaner version of its former self and the players seem to be relishing the defensive side of the game. Nobody sets the tone like the outside centre, whose wince-inducing tackling in the Bristol Bears and Munster games left a mark. The fear is that the team has lost something in attack, but Ringrose believes they’re getting the balance right. “It’s like a tug of war between the two, and any given week Tyler [Bleyendaal] wants his minutes for us and same with Jacques [Nienaber]. They’re actually working unbelievably close and they’re almost meeting symbiotically but it’s always something we’re trying to get better at,” he said. “Defensively, working with Jacques, we’re still learning and there’s still stuff we’re maybe not getting right and working at and trying to be quicker and and be more instinctive so we’re just repping that in training as much as possible. “In games, you get exposed to that with a bit more consequence, obviously. So we like to think we’ve improved and got better defensively and then attack, I guess, the scoreline probably flatters. “Whether we can get things to click a little bit better is the challenge for us. “It was obviously a wet day the last time we played over there [in La Rochelle] and that’s the last time I was playing [against them]. There wasn’t a lot of attacking; there was a lot of kicking, a lot of set-pieces and scrums and mauls and going close to the line, so we’ll have to be ready from that perspective. “If it is a bit dryer, get our starters, our set-piece starters right and then because kicking is a big part of the game for us to be ready to go off the back of that.” Ringrose is relishing his defensive role. “It’s interesting from the perspective of preparing to play against South Africa in the past and trying to understand what Jesse Kriel or [Lukhanyo] Am were doing and why and obviously talking to him and learning off him it makes sense,” he explained. “A lot of it, I know No 13 position is said to be difficult to defend but a lot of it depends on what the guys around me are doing. “It allows me to make reads or even the ones that maybe I’ve missed, or any of us have missed, the wingers and the full-back kind of cover for that. “Maybe it’s not as glaring... when they cover it you kind of just gloss over it. It’s a constant work-on, but the system would facilitate me being able to make reads if other stuff goes well. “I wouldn’t say mindset-wise but system-wise it’s different, so maybe the opportunities are presented. But I think the mindset is when you don’t have the ball you’ve got to be all-in. “It’s reflective of everything when we’re defending with Leinster and Ireland – and not overthink it. It’s just a place you’ve to get yourself to and stay there.”

New York â BlackRock told employees it is cutting roughly 1 per cent of its workforce after it committed more than US$25 billion (S$34 billion) for acquisitions in 2024 to expand its reach in private market assets and data. The cuts are part of BlackRockâs efforts to realign its resources with the firmâs strategy, the companyâs president Rob Kapito and chief operating officer Rob Goldstein told staff in a memo on Jan 8.Â The worldâs largest asset manager has more than 21,000 employees, meaning the cuts apply to about 200 staff. âAs part of these firmwide efforts, we will be making changes today that will see approximately 1 per cent of our colleagues leave the firm,â they said in the memo. âThis is never easy.â The firm added 3,750 employees in 2024 and expects to have 2,000 more in 2025 following the deals for Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), private credit shop HPS Investment Partners and data firm Preqin, according to the memo.Â The US$12.5 billion acquisition of GIP was completed on Oct 1, while the roughly US$12 billion deal for HPS is expected to close mid-year. The US$3.2 billion Preqin transaction was expected to close before end-2024, but it is still pending. âWe believe these investments make us a stronger and more dynamic organisation that is even better positioned to serve clients over the long term,â the BlackRock executives wrote. âThese investments will enable us to accelerate our momentum in 2025.â BLOOMBERG JoinÂ ST's Telegram channelÂ and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Explore Coercion and Countermoves: The US-China Economic Rivalry Elizabeth Economy sits down with Melanie Hart to talk about Chinese economic coercion and US responses. In a wide-ranging conversation, Dr. Elizabeth Economy and Dr. Melanie Hart discuss China’s economic coercion, its impact globally, and how the United States can most effectively respond. Hart draws on cases from her time at the State Department to illustrate how her team successfully combatted Chinese efforts to use the power of their market to force political alignment by other countries. She also stresses, however, that this is an ongoing battle. Hart also describes the Biden administration's framework for reducing dependence on Chinese critical minerals and semiconductors. She underscores the importance of investing in domestic manufacturing, partnering with other countries to build alternatives to Chinese suppliers, and working with allies to coordinate effective policy and early warning systems to address supply chain issues before they occur. WATCH THE VIDEO >> Elizabeth Economy: Welcome to China Considered, a podcast that brings fresh insights and informed discussion to one of the most consequential issues of our time, how China is changing and changing the world. I'm Liz Economy, Hargrove Senior Fellow and Co-director of the U.S China and the World Program at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Today I have with me, Dr. Melanie Hart, who who just stepped down from her position as the Senior Advisor for China and the Indo Pacific in the Office of the Undersecretary for Economic Growth, Energy and the environment at the U.S. department of State. And she's now the Senior Director for the Global China Hub at the Atlantic Council, Melanie, thank you so much for joining me today. >> Melanie Hart: Thanks for having me, Liz. >> Elizabeth Economy: So you were instrumental at the State Department in designing and driving forward a number of the agency's most consequential China initiatives, particularly around combating Chinese economic coercion. Can you start by just telling us a little bit about what is economic coercion? Why did you decide to focus on this particular issue at this particular time? As you know, it's been around for a long time, but I've never seen a U.S strategy to combat economic coercion, what made you take on this issue? >> Melanie Hart: Sure, so I joined the State Department in January 2021, when the Biden administration was coming in. It was the thick of when China was targeting Australia, Australia called for an independent investigation into the origins of the COVID crisis, and Beijing hit them with a wide array of ridiculous trade measures, economic coercion. And as I was going around the department talking to the really great career diplomats saying, what should the Biden team focus on? Because the Biden team came in with our own priorities but a really important part of the process is going to the people who've been in the trenches and hearing from them where they think we should focus. Economic coercion just kept coming up again and again, there was a real desire across the department and across the interagency to find a way to do more than just be there diplomatically, to be there economically. And by happenstance, my boss, Under Secretary Jose Fernandez, was confirmed finally by the Senate in August of 2021 and that was the exact time that Beijing decided to go after Lithuania. And what Jose told us was, look, here we go let's use Lithuania as our test case. Their GDP is only 2% dependent on China, if we can't win this one, we all know we have a problem. Let's throw the toolkit, let's figure out what our toolkit is by digging around the interagency and finding every possible mechanism that we can use to directly support Lithuania. And I think that case was really the game changer on the one hand for other nations who had been targeted by China or were targeted by China afterwards. When they looked at Lithuania, they saw a model for how you can stand up for yourself. Not back down in the face of bullying and not just stand up, but actually turn it into a win for your own economy. Lithuania replaced all of the China trade that they lost with new partnerships in Asia. They started new embassies in Australia, South Korea and Singapore. They're laser exports to South Korea doubled so a lot of countries looked at that and said, hey, that's not a bad deal actually. And we were really shocked actually after the Lithuania case that other countries started knocking on the door and saying we want the Lithuania package, is that an option if Beijing gets mad at us too? So that was just really the game changer and that was I credit Lithuania for inspiring a lot of us for how we can really step in and succeed. >> Elizabeth Economy: So let me take you one step back and just ask. I mean when you look across the universe of Chinese economic coercion, is there a certain issue or set of issues that China tends to get particularly upset about and then tries to use the leverage of its market to change countries policies. What prompted for example, the Lithuania case? >> Melanie Hart: In Lithuania's case they were allowing Taiwan to open a local representative office and to use the name Taiwan in the title, that doesn't violate Europe's one China policy. But Beijing didn't like it but some people assume that this is a Taiwan thing, it's not. You see cases on commercial issues look at Australia that was because Australia called for an independent investigation of the COVID crisis with Canada. It was over Meng Wanzhou and that that detention issue, it really varies by case. We've seen them target Philippine bananas in the past over South China Sea. When you look at the empirical record, there is almost no issue that Beijing won't use as a trigger for economic coercion, so unfortunately there's really no safe space. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yeah, I remember back when Daryl Morey, who was the general manager of the Houston Rockets for the NBA when he tweeted fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong. And then the Chinese began to target the NBA and have the all their gear removed from the shelves and particularly went off after the Houston Rockets, but also stopped televising the games in China. And I remember seeing on CCTV that it wasn't just you're exactly right it wasn't just about Taiwan or the South China Sea or what China called its core interests. What they said was any issue related right to sovereignty or social stability does not fall within the purview of free speech. And I think at that moment, just as you said, it's kind of like there's, there's no issue really around which China doesn't feel that it has the, the right to try to pressure other countries using their market to get them to align with Chinese interests. All right, so Lithuania became the case and what did you do in particular, what did the US do to support Lithuania? But beyond that, then how did you develop a kind of bigger strategy around countries that were being targeted for economic coercion? >> Melanie Hart: Sure, so the US rolled out a really innovative package to support Lithuania, which was all in direct response to what the Lithuanians were telling us China was targeting and where they need assistance. So for example, lasers are really critical for the Lithuanian economy their laser industry is a big source of pride and China had been buying them. As I just mentioned, their laser exports to South Korea have now doubled. But also the U.S. defense Department signed a bilateral procurement agreement with Lithuania that would allow them to sell lasers and other products to the US Military on equal footing with US companies. The US Military sees some value in a PRC free supply chain, also Lithuania had been in the pipeline to export eggs and other agricultural products to the United States. And the State Department helped them move through that process to get some those regulatory process moving and their ag exports to the US went up 19%, which is pretty significant. The US ex IM bank gave them a $600 million MOU to buy products from the United States they had previously been buying from China but China was blocking both exports and imports with Lithuania. And the great thing about that is Lithuania was telling us Beijing has canceled around 300 million in export credits that our companies were depending on. And US ex IM bank said we'll not just match that, but we'll double it and the important thing about that is the. Those are numbers. Those are real, concrete economic numbers. And the US can't replace China and anybody's supply chain, nor should that be our objective. That's not how markets work. But the US and other countries can help bridge the gap as companies are looking for and finding new opportunities. And to Lithuania's credit, their foreign minister and other members of their cabinet were all over the Asia Pacific making new friends, opening new embassies. And where they went diplomatically, commerce followed. And I think there was a great capstone on this Lithuania crisis turned into opportunity. In May of this year, the Lithuanian government held an economic coercion forum in Vilnius. Representatives from 30 different governments were there. The US was there at the vice ministerial level. Japan was there at the vice ministerial level. Costa Rica was there, the Koreans were there. 30 different countries sent representatives to Vilnius, which is a bit of a trek from the ROK or Costa Rica, to hear from Lithuania what their lessons learned were. And I think they are now seen as kind of a shining example that other countries are interested to follow and learn from. >> Elizabeth Economy: So do you think now that there's a kind of playbook that the United States, and its allies and partners have developed that can be deployed? Is this something that the EU and the US have come to some kind of here are the rules of the road. Is there a formalized mechanism in any way to address these kinds of cases? >> Melanie Hart: So in terms of formalized mechanism, I'll leave that to the current State Department colleagues to comment on what they have going on. But I will say, when you look at economic coercion cases, they are always different because every country's relationship with China is different. So for Australia, it was wine and barley and lobsters. For Lithuania, it was lasers and these other agricultural products and components. So every economic coercion case will involve different goods, with Canada, it was canola oil. So what we will really need to respond effectively is a broad coalition. And if shrimp is being targeted, the most important partners will be countries who have space to buy and eat more shrimp. >> Elizabeth Economy: I think this isn't necessarily something that you worked on when you were at the State Department, but I'm curious, was there discussion, consideration given to the targeting of just US companies? Because, again, there's been a long tradition in terms of China targeting our industries, whether it's the travel industry, the airline industry. I mentioned the case of the NBA. China frequently says, if you don't align with our government policy for example on Taiwan or the South China Sea, we are going to punish you, right? So are there lessons learned that you think are applicable for the United States in terms of supporting our companies that end up being targeted by the Chinese government, or they're sort of two separate things. >> Melanie Hart: This is a really tough one and timely given that Invidia was targeted this week, right? And I believe possibly intel as well. I mean, I'm of two minds about it. On the one hand, we always have to be honest with US Companies that China's a tough market, it's not a normal market economy. The risks are astronomical. And we don't want to see US Companies be dependent on the China market in such a way that when they are targeted. Because it's not, if it's a win when they are targeted, that that would have an outsized impact on their bottom line. But of course, at the same time, when China goes after US Companies, there should be a response. And I think the response to that should be based on what the companies are asking for, because it's the US Government's job to be a representative on behalf of the citizens that elect it. And that includes the companies that the US Government represents as well. Some companies might say, you know what, just let us work this one. Don't bring more heat to it, all you will do would bring heat. And I think that the US Government should listen to that. Other companies are going to say, that's it. We want the full package and they should get the full package. We should really defer to the companies who are deferring to their own workers, their employees, their shareholders. We should represent their interests, and that might vary case by case. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yeah, fair point. And so the issue that you just raised, which is an issue of over dependence on China, particularly by companies. I think is another one that you worked on very directly at the State Department in terms of trying to educate. I think, US Companies and provide a framework for them globally to think about how to diversify their supply chains, how to develop more resilient supply chains. And for the US government, right for our basic needs, around things like critical minerals like semiconductors. Talk about that work, and was that something that was of special interest to you, or is that something that was kind of mandated from on high? What sort of effort did you personally undertake around this supply chain diversification issue, which has been, I think, a very central issue for the Biden administration. >> Melanie Hart: Yeah, so I'll focus on critical minerals and chips because they're different in terms of the mandate for critical minerals. I really credit my boss from the State Department, Undersecretary Jose Fernandez. When he came in, he looked at the critical mineral issue and recognized that our best advantage in competing with China when we go out and bid for mines and processing facilities to bring new supply to market is not cash. The US government doesn't have boatloads of cash to bankroll mines, unfortunately. But we do have allies and partners who all share the same interest in having access to supply that's not controlled by Beijing. Since Beijing has demonstrated they will all cut all of us off from that supply whenever they choose to make a point about something. So to his credit, Under Secretary Fernandez pulled a lot of experts together, and came up with a very innovative idea that he then got allied buy in for, which was the Mineral Security Partnership. The Mineral Security partnership brings together 14 US-allies, including the European Union, to jointly identify projects of interest and pull together companies from allied governments. Might be US, might not be US financing from allied governments and just get projects moving. Because from a US perspective, we don't necessarily have companies that are working in all of these mining sectors or in all of the processing sectors or that want to. But if Australia does and they bring new capacity online that supports US national security, and if the US brings something online, that's good for Australia as well, and that's been wildly successful. They announced two deals so far this year, one on germanium. A Belgian-based company teamed up with the DRC-based company to develop germanium in the DRC. And the other one's graphite, a graphite mine in Tanzania that's a joint project between a South Korean company or South Korea's Posco and Australia's blackrock Mining. Those are real deals that are coming to market with allies coming together. I think it's a tremendous success and something I I really hope to see the Trump administration continue because it's a winner, and I hope to see Congress put some money behind it. >> Elizabeth Economy: So you mentioned gallium or germanium and- Germanium and graphite. Germanium and graphite, which just happened to be two metals that the Chinese have put export controls on. Is that why in fact we pursued those projects? Or does this happen to be luck of the draw? >> Melanie Hart: So the US and China both look at the same trade data. So before China even started with the export controls, we were looking at the same trade data and seeing these are our vulnerabilities. So let's get moving now. China was looking at the same vulnerabilities and that's where they decided to hit us. But before they even went down that road, the US Was already working on alternative supply. >> Elizabeth Economy: So is the process then basically to look at those minerals and metals where we have the greatest dependence on China, or is it a function of our national security that we're most concerned about? How do we make the determination about where to go? >> Melanie Hart: It's both, so when the MSP started up, it focused specifically on the critical minerals for the energy transition. And it's expanded over time. On the other side, you mentioned semiconductors. In the chip sector, there are specific critical minerals that we need to make a semiconductor chip. So when Congress passed the CHIPS Act, which gave the State Department a $500 million fund to do both 5G security and semiconductor supply chain and semiconductor security, which is a lot for that amount of money. State immediately looked at that and said one of our priorities has to be going out and finding the critical minerals that are needed to make a chip and invest in capacity that's free from PRC control. Because we cannot allow there to be a situation where your colleagues at Commerce, Liz, are doing such a great job bringing new fabs online here in the United States. We cannot have a situation where those fabs have to go get on their knees and beg Beijing for the gallium and their germanium that they need to make a semiconductor chip. So recognizing that there is a need for specific chip for specific minerals where China had a stranglehold on global supply, State had a specific effort under the CHIPS Act focused on semiconductors. >> Elizabeth Economy: And the semiconductor effort was broader, too, right? There was more, there was educational component. I mean, I think State Department really created, along with European and Asian allies, a pretty full bore program for investment and training in some emerging and middle income economies. Can you talk a little bit about that work? >> Melanie Hart: Yeah, absolutely, so the semiconductor side of the State Department CHIPS Act program focuses on three big priorities. The first is the one that I mentioned. Well, and all of these priorities nest under one big objective, which is provide the domestic US fabs with the international environment they need to succeed. So the international effort is in service of the domestic effort and domestic US jobs. It has three parts, one, get the critical minerals needed to make a chip, make sure we have access to supply that the PRC can't cut off. Two, work with allies and partners to get to a degree of coordination on policy, particularly subsidy policy. You don't wanna see a situation where Commerce Department here in the US, the Europeans, the Japanese, the Koreans are all trying to subsidize the same companies to come and build fabs. And we're pricing each other out of the market by having to bid and compete with one another. So we wanted to do what we could to align subsidy policy among nations. And that required having some kind of early warning system so that Europe could be dependent on chips from the United States and have early warning if a shortage is is likely or a supply gut and the same supply glut. And the same thing from the United States with Europe and Japan, and Korea. We can be more confident with some friends shoring if we have good transparency and information on those supply chains. So that was the policy pillar with allies. And then the third and final piece was when chips come off the factory line in Arizona and Texas, the fabs being built in the United States. The model is you do a lot of the processing, the downstream processing, the test testing, packaging, assembly, getting it ready to plug into your iPhone or to your laptop. A lot of that happens in middle income countries. That keeps cost lower for the fabs here and keeps the higher income jobs in the United States. And that capacity was concentrated in a few places, Malaysia, particularly during COVID when Malaysia had COVID, outbreaks, you couldn't make a car in the United States because the chip supply line ground to a halt. So that third piece of the chip strategy was identifying some clusters of nations that were ripe to either expand their downstream processing capacity or become a downstream processor. And state selected a group in the Americas and a group in Asia. And the group in the Americas was Costa Rica, Mexico, and Panama. And in Asia it was the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, India. And it was shocking to see how powerful it was to give those nations a ticket to enter into a US-centric supply chain as sparkly and exciting as one rooted in the CHIPS Act as an alternative to the lower value-added China supply chain. And the way the program works is it's not suitcases full of cash. It's not the Beijing model. State deployed the OECD to go into these countries and do a deep assessment of why isn't TSMC building a plant right now. Why isn't Intel building a plant right now and get a punch list of the things that needed to be done to move them up and make that market more attractive? As you said, a big need was workforce development. So State funded Arizona State University to go in and train workers to work in some of these facilities. And the reception has been tremendous. The most exciting thing at State was about a year after rolling out this program, we started being deluged by other countries that would say, I want to be the next Costa Rica, or I want what the Philippines has. And so we created something that had been missing, which is this pull factor, kind of a the pull of an opportunity that countries wanted to opt into. So we weren't just going around saying, China, bad move away from China. We had something to offer. >> Elizabeth Economy: No, that's exciting. Of course, at a certain point, I guess that $400 million that State Department got to do this kind of work also runs out. Is there still money left to be deployed or are we kind of at the end of the sort of the gravy train, or is it being picked up in different ways by private institutions, universities and companies that can keep moving it forward? What's the sort of sustainability of this program? >> Melanie Hart: So State and Commerce had different rules from Congress. You guys had it easy, I think Commerce, they just gave you 52 billion and you could run from there. >> Elizabeth Economy: 39 billion, because the science part never got funded, but yes, okay. >> Melanie Hart: 39 billion is a lot at state was 100 million year for five years. And every year, Congress would approve the next year's budget, and they would one by one approve each of the countries and activities that we would want to partner with. The great thing about that is that Congress was deeply supportive and wonderful to work with. The Republicans were as supportive as the Dems on SFRC when we would do our briefings. So they got it because they had written the CHIPS Act. So they got what we were trying to do, they were deeply supportive. They have been with the State Department every step of the way, so I have pretty high confidence that that would not change going into the new administration. I think what Congress should do is give State more money, because if you actually care about 5G security and rewiring the entire global semiconductor supply chain, $100 million a year to do both is a bit sad. I think we can do better, I think given that this is something the US has never done before, it makes sense to start out where they started out and not overload the finances in the beginning. But at this point, the success speaks for itself and there is clearly room and need to ramp up. And I think in particular, that critical mineral piece would be a great way, a great place to build in more funding, because now that the program has moved from identifying where the minerals are and where we should invest. To doing some, being ready to do some of those investments, there's a lot of space and they can, for example, maybe a lot of that money can flow through DFC, who can go in and finance some deals in some of these places. But, you know, I mean, the question I always ask Congress is, do you want the US Fabs to have to get on their knees and beg Beijing for some for critical minerals or not, it's really their decision? >> Elizabeth Economy: Right, I mean, and I think because it so directly serves our national interest and because the Chinese have developed a retaliatory toolkit now that directly targets these kinds of critical minerals and metals. I think maybe Congress will be more receptive to more funding for the DFC and for these kinds of investments moving forward. So, I think the major theme and not surprisingly, since you were at the State Department of your work and of your comments today, has been on the partnership with our allies. You've talked a lot about what I think have been amazing successes that you've had in the work that you've done. Have there been any, if not failures, let's say, any efforts that maybe didn't come fully to fruition things that the U.S tried to pursue with our allies and partners, but just somehow didn't get the kind of pickup that you would have liked to have seen? >> Melanie Hart: Well, let me say this, it is no accident that I have come to the Atlantic Council to do China work here. I think we have a lot of work to do in the transatlantic partnership and approaching the China challenge together. It was pretty frustrating to watch the dynamic play out when Europe was assessing making the decisions about tariffs on PRC EVs. The US tariffed PRC EVs at 100%, Canada did the same thing, Brazil has tariffs on PRC EVs, Turkey has tariffs on PRC EVs and the German Chancellor, German autos, more than any other stand to lose by China's predatory market tactics in the EV sector. And Germany voted against any kind of tariffs on Chinese EVs that really, to me tells us that we have more work to do there. And we have great as you know, there are really amazing China experts across Europe and America and elsewhere. So what I'm most excited about leaving the US Government is coming to the Atlantic Council, which has a transatlantic focus and doing China work here. We're looking at standing up some really interesting things on the de-risking front, at digging in on what US de-risking should look like going forward and trying to find the Venn diagram of where that overlaps with Europe, where that overlaps with Latin America and other partners. And I understand that Europe has a different system it's not one country, it's a group of countries that have to work together and the Commission has trade policy and the capitals have foreign policy and that's complicated, but we have to get it right. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yeah, no, I think that's a really good point and I know we both met with the same European delegation recently. And I think one of the things that I spoke with them about is, is how, you know, the U.S government, and certainly at the Commerce Department, but I think also at the State Department, how we worked to educate US business about the risks inherent in being too dependent on a China market. And that this really did have, I think, a pretty profound impact, I think business really did move up pretty aggressively. A lot of business on a learning curve when it comes to this, the idea of de-risking and so I think your work to educate more, I think will be very welcomed and as you say, I think probably pretty necessary. So let me ask you one last touch to touch on one last area, which is Taiwan, because you also worked on the sort of US Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership dialogue. Everything you did had a big, like, mouthful of words, I have to say but Taiwan obviously is a really was a very important part of US Strategy over the past four years and talk a little bit about what this was and what came out of it. >> Melanie Hart: So a lot of the State Department programs do have really long names and so they all have acronyms. So we call the Taiwan dialogue the EPPD, look Taiwan is our seventh largest trading partner, our tenth largest export market and our, the sixth largest market for U.S. food and agricultural products, that's huge. So it's natural that the US should have economic mechanisms for talking to Taiwan, commerce has a semiconductor supply chain dialogue with them. USTR has a trade more than dialogue now, 21st century trade process with them and State I think about the State Department's EPPD as the US Taiwan Dialogue, where economics meets foreign policy. It's kind of the economic security, economic statecraft dialogue with Taiwan and State. Under Secretary Fernandez and the team just had the fifth EPPD with Taiwan in October and they shared the list of things that they covered. It's economic coercion, working together to do infrastructure investments jointly in third countries it is addressing bilateral taxation. I know Secretary Raimondo was really focused on that, we were encouraging TSMC to come here into the United States and invest and that the taxation burden is real there. So supply chains, all kinds of things, I mean it's a, it's a great, it's a great dialogue for figuring out how to align on the economic security side of the coin. >> Elizabeth Economy: Okay, great, if only we could have productive dialogues these days with the PRC as well but I guess that's gonna have to wait for some point in, in the future. Okay, so lightning round, let me just ask you a couple of quick final questions. What's your must read booker article on China? >> Melanie Hart: So this is a little bit out of the box, but the book that I've read over the past year that has stuck with me the most and really helped me put some of what I see with China in a broader context. Is a book by a historian, Calder Walton's book called Spies, Epic Intelligence War between East and West. And it is a fabulous detailed history of how Russia approached the West before, during, and after the Cold War. And it has great source material, but really shows how the Soviets and then the Russians always perceive themselves as being weaker than the West economically weaker, weaker military. They didn't have the tech edge, and so they felt that espionage, coercion, subversion, everything was on the table to catch up and to even the playing field. And in their eyes, that was just the legitimate way to do business. I see some really big parallels with China, both in the way so many Chinese counterparts over the years, when you are talking to friends and counterparts in Beijing, you can kinda tell what's total talking points and what. When they keep saying it for ten years, even after drinks and late at night, you figure this one might be real. And one thing that always stuck out to me is a lot of people I deeply respect and admire and like talking to in China, they just can't conceive of what our problem is. Given that we're always stronger than them, of course they're going to use these other tactics. And I felt that this put that in context in a way that nothing else has. And in terms of articles, there was one article that I kept on my desk at the State Department and my colleague Jonathan Fritz did as well, and that's Xi Jinping's November 2020 article in Qiushi where he just says blatantly, our aim is to make international supply chains dependent on China. We kept that there as a reminder of what our job was. >> Elizabeth Economy: That is a particularly, I think, telling quotation. It's good that he's always basically signaling exactly what he plans to do and what he sees his mission as being. I think it helps us a lot. Okay, what do you miss most and least about your time in government? >> Melanie Hart: I had a unique opportunity because the things I was working on, there was no playbook. After 911, the US built up a whole counterterror apparatus and reoriented the government for counterterror operations. I see the Biden administration as a time when we were reorienting the government for economic statecraft and figuring out how to operate in this post COVID economic security space. And working for Under Secretary Fernandez, he would just say, achieve the objective don't let bureaucracy stop you. And Secretary Blinken would just say, lean in. And so our message was lean in. Don't ask permission, just get things done. And working with the amazing career diplomats at state in those trenches, and my diplomatic partners from allies and partner countries as well, where nobody has a rule book, we all have kind of a green light from our leadership to work together and figure things out. That was a, I think, tremendous opportunity and space for innovation. And I'm just deeply humbled by the brilliance that I saw in my career colleagues and what they can do when you give them the space to do that. And in terms of what I miss least, man, it's great being back on the think tank side and just saying, just speaking for myself and being really direct. When you're speaking for a government, it's different, as you know. So being China experts who say what we think without the weight or the carefulness of a broader entity behind us is a lot of fun. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yeah, I'm not sure I ever mastered the ability to just say what the government was telling me to say, but I tried. Okay, quickly, what one thing do you wish that the administration had done differently with regard to China? >> Melanie Hart: This won't be a shock to you, but trade deals with other countries. That's the missing piece of our toolkit. We've done a lot, but that's the missing piece. >> Elizabeth Economy: Yes, US no trade representative. Yep, anyway. Okay, quickly, what China issue do we not know enough about? >> Melanie Hart: That's a great question. I don't know if you had the same experience, but for me, this was my first government job. And being on the inside and getting that deep understanding of how the US policy process works really drove home to me how much I don't know about the inner workings of China's policy process. Is there an interagency policy committee? If there is one, to what degree is it real? Does Xi Jinping see different ideas or are they filtered before he gets to them? To what degree is there still bottom up versus top down? I think a great thing about the US system is there is a lot of space for bottom up innovation. I mean, how great was it to have Secretary Blinken say, lean in? And the Under Secretary say, just don't let bureaucracy stop you. I don't think that's what they're getting in Beijing for sure. But we don't know enough about what's really going on inside that policy process. And I really wish we did. >> Elizabeth Economy: Okay, last one. On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely, and I think I already know the answer to this one. How likely do you think we are to see a breakthrough in US China relations over the next decade? >> Melanie Hart: Unfortunately, I'd say around zero. There could be something short term. President Trump has mentioned that he's had communication with Xi Jinping. A lot of the folks going into the Trump administration are talking about trying to do a deal that Trump's tariff threats are to gain leverage so that they can do some kind of deal with China. Unfortunately, there's nothing that Xi Jinping is willing to give the United States in any deal that's in US national interests. That's unfortunate. So there could be short term blips, but I think it'll be a while before there's anything real. >> Elizabeth Economy: Okay, well, on that note, let me thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. As always, Melanie, you are both incredibly articulate and thoughtful and very much to the point. So thanks again. >> Melanie Hart: Great, thanks for having me, Liz. >> Elizabeth Economy: If you enjoyed this podcast and want to hear more reasoned discourse and debate on China, I encourage you to subscribe to China Considered via the Hoover Institution YouTube channel or podcast platform of your choice.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discussed These 10 NASDAQ 100 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other NASDAQ 100 stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his perspective on the stock market, especially reflecting on the events of 2024. He emphasized that years like 2024 don’t come around often, where everything feels so clear and the winners are so apparent. According to Cramer, if investors tried to get too creative or overcomplicate their strategies, they likely missed out on the obvious winners. “If you tried to get creative, you tried to get clever, you missed out on some truly idiot-proof winners. The losers on the other hand, well, they were not as easy to spot because in many cases they were the market’s former winners, even if they long ago lost their way.” READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 10 Healthcare Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 10 SaaS Stocks As part of his annual analysis on Mad Money, Cramer examined the top and bottom performers of the Nasdaq 100 in 2024, offering insights into what worked and what didn’t. He reviewed how, in many instances, investors tend to become frustrated with stocks that are overhyped, knowing deep down that eventually, something better will come along. He likened these overly loved stocks to a “mouse trap,” where the price could only go down from such lofty heights, warning that many investors would regret not jumping off the metaphorical spaceship before the crash. Cramer shared his thoughts on the five best performers in the NASDAQ 100 for 2024, calling it a “real good collection of winners” and expressing a genuine fondness for these stocks. He also noted that, while the Nasdaq 100 losers may have appeared to have suffered dramatic declines, the reality was more nuanced. “The Nasdaq 100 losers, though they aren’t so horrible as the declines would make you think, but they got clobbered because they were emblematic of golden calves, worshipped for a long time before being revealed as not so special after all.” For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 2. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 While Cramer has previously called Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) a “cult stock”, more recently, he has been highlighting the rapid growth of the company and its numerous government projects. In the recent episode of Mad Money, calling the stock a winner in 2024, he commented: “Most obvious winner for 2024, Palantir, the defense software company trying to revolutionize the way the Pentagon works. Its CEO Alex Karp is a brilliant bad boy Smash Mouth Philly guy who’s like a meaner version of Elon Musk and probably threw snowballs if not batteries at Santa Claus from the lower level of the link. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a software company that focuses on developing advanced data platforms, primarily serving government agencies with tools designed for data analysis and decision-making. The company has become well known for its ability to assist in large-scale data operations, often providing solutions to complex government challenges. In a recent interview, Palantir CEO, Alex Karp stressed the need for tech-government collaboration, especially regarding the AI arms race, and expressed optimism about the incoming administration’s potential to tackle government challenges. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives has highlighted an opportunity for Palantir to address inefficiencies within the U.S. government, particularly within the Washington, D.C. area. Ives believes that the company could capitalize on these inefficiencies to make significant progress in its operations. In addition, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been involved in the formation of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which aims to streamline government operations. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) co-founder Joe Lonsdale was reportedly also involved in DOGE’s early planning stages. CEO Alex Karp has expressed his full support for DOGE and its co-leads, including Musk. In a December interview with Fox News, Karp aligned himself with DOGE’s efforts for government reform and commended Musk’s leadership in this initiative. Overall, PLTR ranks 8th on our list of NASDAQ 100 stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: The full list of major US companies slashing staff in the new year, including Microsoft, Blackrock, and Ally

Layoffs and other workforce reductions are continuing in 2025, following two years of significant job cuts across tech, media, finance, manufacturing, and retail. While companies' reasons for slimming their staff vary, the cost-cutting measures are coming amid a backdrop of technological change. In a recent World Economic Forum survey, some 41% of companies worldwide said they were expecting to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence. Companies such as Dropbox, Google, and IBM have previously announced job cuts related to AI. Tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are meanwhile expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF. Here are the companies with job cuts planned or already underway in 2025 so far. BlackRock told employees it was planning to cut about 200 people of its 21,000-strong workforce, according to Bloomberg. The reductions are more than offset by some 3,750 workers who were added last year and another 2,000 expected to be added in 2025. BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, said the cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg reported. Bridgewater Associates cut 7% of its staff on Monday in an effort to stay lean, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider. The layoffs at the world's largest hedge fund bring its head count back to where it was in 2023, the person said. The company's founder, Ray Dalio, said in a 2019 interview that about 30% of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months. The Washington Post is eliminating less than 100 employees in an effort to cut costs, Reuters reported Tuesday. A spokesperson told the wire service that the changes would occur across multiple areas of the business and indicated that the cuts wouldn't affect the newsroom. "The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are," the spokesperson said, according to Reuters. Microsoft is planning job cuts soon, and the company is taking a harder look at underperforming employees as part of the reductions, according to two people familiar with the plans. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed cuts but declined to share details on the number of employees being let go. "At Microsoft we focus on high performance talent," the spokesperson said. "We are always working on helping people learn and grow. When people are not performing, we take the appropriate action." The digital-financial-services company Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI. The impacted employees were notified on Tuesday. "As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas, while continuing to hire in our other areas of our business," the spokesperson said. The spokesperson also said the company was offering severance, out-placement support, and the opportunity to apply for openings at Ally. Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, the Charlotte Observer reported.

An aerial view of a bustling financial district, with skyscrapers and a large financial institution in the city center. Shares in MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) dropped by 7.20 percent or $1.48 on Tuesday to close at $19.07 apiece as investors resorted to profit-taking following Monday’s gains and news that it loaned 7,377 of its Bitcoin holdings. Investors took the news as a potential risk to the company’s portfolio, especially as it represents as much as 16.4 percent of its reserves. According to the company, the move to loan to third parties was to help generate additional income. “There has been significant interest in MARA’s bitcoin lending program,” said MARA Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) vice president for investor relations Robert Samuels on X. “It focuses on short-term arrangements with well-established third parties. It generates a modest single-digit yield. It has been active throughout 2024. The long-term objective is to generate sufficient yield to offset operating expenses.” Overall, MARA ranks 10th on our list of firms mirroring Wall Street decline.
