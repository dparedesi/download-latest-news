Starting next year, investment strategies at Bank of America’s Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank, and Merrill Edge platforms will support clients who want to allocate up to 4% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, the outlet reported. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” Chris Hyzy, Bank of America Private Bank’s chief investment officer, reportedly said in a statement. Hyzy reportedly described “the lower end of this range” as suitable for investors with a conservative risk profile, with 4% being appropriate for those with high risk tolerances. On Jan. 5, Bank of America’s wealth management clients will also initiate coverage of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds from Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, and BlackRock, according to Yahoo Finance. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a Decrypt request for comment. Yahoo Finance reported that, historically, Bank of America’s wealth management clients were only able to access crypto-related products upon request. Previously, that left over 15,000 wealth advisors at the firm unable to make crypto-related recommendations. The shift comes as Bitcoin’s price jumped to near $91,600 at one point Tuesday. BTC was currently up 7.6% over the past 24 hours, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value is off about 30% since hitting a record high above $126,000 in early October, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. Vanguard, one of the world’s largest investment companies, will soon begin letting people on its platform access crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds, Bloomberg reported on Monday. A Bitcoin-friendly CEO was appointed to the world’s second-largest asset manager in May. Last year, Fidelity suggested that people allocate between 2% and 5% to Bitcoin, with up to 7.5% being worth for young investors. Describing the asset as “unique,” the institution has explored allocations in hypothetical scenarios as early as 2020.

A FORMER SCHOOL teacher will be sentenced next week for the indecent assault of eight boys over 30 years ago at a private Dublin school. Peter Kelly (73) of Booterstown Park, Booterstown was convicted by a Dublin Circuit Criminal Court jury following a two week trial in November. He pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting the boys at Willow Park School, Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin on dates in the 70s and 80s. The school is run by the Spiritan order of priests Kelly was convicted on all charges. The eight victims are now all aged in their early 50s. Judge Elma Sheahan heard the victim impact statements of each of the men that had been abused by Kelly. Some of the men took the stand to read their own statements while Inspector Rachael Kilpatrick read others into the record. The men spoke of the various ways Kelly’s actions impacted their life, speaking of addictions, inabilities to deal with relationships, inabilities to express their emotions and inabilities to reach their full potential in adult life. Some of the men have spent time in psychiatric hospitals, others have been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), many of them are on medication for anxiety and depression. The men spoke of the loss of their education and suffering from insomnia, night terrors and panic attacks. One victim spoke of an occasion as a child when he deliberately crashed his bike on the way to school. He was later treated in hospital because he had pretended he had injured his leg. He said in his victim impact statement that he did this so he could get out of school for some time and be away from Kelly. Many of the victims spoke of how their life could have been so different had they not been abused by Kelly and how as young children they never stood a chance against him. One of the victims spoke about how Kelly was “one cog in a machine of systematic abuse”. He said the school “tolerated widespread sexual abuse” and how “37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools” between both Willow Park and its feeder school Blackrock College. He said as children they had “no chance”. One of the victims told Kelly that he hopes he is made “confront the harm you have done”. This man also stated in his victim impact statement that he hopes “the court understands how you have not only violated the law but the life of a child and everything that he might have become”. Advertisement Another victim said he was “already vulnerable, already broken” when Kelly abused him as he had been the victim of “multiple sexual crimes committed by Kelly’s colleagues”. He said he was not abused “because I was chosen or groomed but because I was there in his classroom completely unable to protect myself”. “He used his position, he took advantage of my vulnerability and added to my pain,” the man continued. Kilpatrick outlined the incidences of abuse committed on each of the boys, who were mostly aged between 11 and 13 years old at the time. She said most of the abuse occurred in the classroom when Kelly would hold the child on his lap and molest them under the guise of tickling them. The victims said he would restrain them on his lap and bounce them up and down. He also played a game called ‘The Muppet Show’ during which he would take the child under the cloak he wore as a school teacher and again tickle them and then molest them. One of the victims was abused in the school’s rugby changing room. He described being laid across Kelly’s lap before he was abused. Others were abused in the school gym. Andrew Sexton SC, defending, told the judge that “there is not an acceptance of the verdict” before he added that Kelly never owned a passport. He said Kelly’s “entire life centred around the school and his home”, with his home being right beside the school. Counsel said the school implemented its own disciplinary regime following an initial complaint in the early 2000s, which was followed by a series of suspensions and which ultimately led to the end of Kelly’s career at the school with Kelly resigning his post in 2004. The Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to prosecute the allegations that had been made in the early 2000s. “He suffered the cessation of his life as a teacher and it was not replaced by anything else,” Sexton told the court. The judge said it was “very important to acknowledge that it had been a very difficult morning” for the six victims who were present in court. She pointed out that due to the law that existed at the time of Kelly’s offending the maximum penalty available to the court in most of the charges was ten years, while two of the offences allowed a penalty of up to two years in prison. The judge revoked Kelly’s bail and remanded him in custody pending sentence next Monday 8 December. She said he was to be given the medical attention he required having been informed that he has a number of medical conditions. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

Title: Who will be the next Fed chair?

SUBSCRIBE & SAVE Less than $3 per week Kevin Hassett appears to be Trump’s pick President Donald Trump says he has chosen the next chair of the Federal Reserve, but he is not yet naming names publicly. Current National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett is widely expected to be the nominee, said Axios. Trump is not saying. “I’m not telling you, we’ll be announcing it,” he said to reporters. The next chair will replace Jerome Powell, who has “faced months of complaints and demands” from Trump to bring interest rates down more quickly, said Axios. Powell’s term does not end until May, so he may have to spend the final months of his term with a “shadow chair” peering over his shoulder, said Fortune. Trump officials have signaled their desire to undercut Powell even if he remains in his position. With a shadow chair in place, “no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore,” said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to Barron’s last year. The question for Wall Street, then, is “will Powell or his successor hold more sway with the markets?” said Fortune. Escape your echo chamber.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. The likely choice of Hassett “appears to be about loyalty” to Trump, said John Authers at Bloomberg. Other possible nominees — including Bessent, as well as current Fed governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder — might feel compelled to “establish themselves as independent from the administration.” But being seen as a Trump loyalist could also force Hassett to prove his independence to “win the confidence of markets.” For now, though, “markets aren’t freaking out at the prospect of a Hassett chairmanship.” “Thank heavens” for Powell, said Brett Arends at MarketWatch. The latest numbers suggest the U.S. economy is “much stronger than people realized” even with the Fed chairman resisting Trump’s demanded rate cuts. If the president had gotten his way, the “likeliest scenario would be that inflation would be rocketing higher again.” Instead, the Federal Reserve has cut rates just twice this year and indicated another rate cut is unlikely in December. Americans should be grateful the current Fed chair has proven his independence and “refused to be intimidated” by Trump. Hassett would have “closer ties to the sitting president” than any modern Fed chair, said Axios. That might mean a quick drop in short-term rates, but long-term rates may stay high if Wall Street comes to believe he is “simply doing Trump’s bidding, with little regard for inflation.” That notion “might be difficult for a pick like Hassett to shake.” The next chair will face an unusually divided Fed board, said The Wall Street Journal. Fed chairs have ordinarily sought the “broadest possible consensus around rate decisions” and split votes have been rare. No longer. There is a “real prospect of three or more dissenting votes” at December’s meeting, whether Powell decides to pause rate cuts or continue them. “It’s not a slam dunk” that Trump’s choice will dictate policy as much as his predecessors, said Krishna Guha, a former New York Fed executive.

Title: Bank of America says clients can allocate up to 4% to crypto
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=550834
Time Published: 2025-12-02T17:03:22Z
Full Content:
Bank of America’s new guidance lets advisers actively recommend Bitcoin ETFs, signaling rising institutional confidence despite the market pullback. Bank of America has officially opened the door for its wealth management clients to include crypto in their portfolios. They are recommending a 1%–4% allocation through regulated Bitcoin ETFs beginning 5 January 5. However, beyond the headline, what stands out is the timing of this shift — it arrives during a broad market pullback, not at a cycle peak. The global crypto market cap currently sits at $3.09 trillion, according to new data (from CoinMarketCap. That’s down sharply from $3.71T last month, yet still well above the $2.42T yearly low. Source: CoinMarketCap This paints a very different backdrop from the euphoric rallies that typically precede new institutional endorsements. Instead, BofA’s guidance lands during a corrective phase, suggesting the bank views crypto as a long-term asset class rather than short-term speculation. According to reports, beginning 5 January, Bank of America’s CIO office will formally cover and recommend four spot Bitcoin ETFs: This is the first time advisors on Merrill, Private Bank, and Merrill Edge can proactively recommend crypto exposure — a major shift from the previous “request-only” framework that kept many clients from accessing the asset class. CIO Chris Hyzy framed the allocation as appropriate for investors “with interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility,” emphasizing regulated products and risk-aligned sizing [1–4%]. Crypto’s market cap has cooled from its late-summer highs, mirroring Bitcoin’s fall from above $126,000 to the mid-$80,000 range. Yet institutions are increasing, not decreasing, their engagement: The trend shows that Wall Street wants regulated crypto exposure integrated into traditional portfolios, even during downturns. This suggests a growing institutional consensus that crypto markets have matured sufficiently to withstand — and potentially benefit from — cyclical volatility. By allowing crypto allocations at a moment when the total market cap has dipped nearly $600 billion in a month, Bank of America is signaling: It’s a different kind of institutional endorsement — one that doesn’t chase hype but leans into market structure, regulation, and portfolio construction.

Title: Former teacher Kelly was 'one cog in machine of abuse'

Órla O\u0027Donnell Legal Affairs Correspondent A former maths teacher at a private primary school run by the Spiritan order of priests in South Dublin will be sentenced next week for indecently assaulting eight young boys in the 1970s and 1980s. Peter Kelly who is 73 and was a maths teacher at Willow Park school in Blackrock for almost thirty years, was found guilty by a jury earlier this year of 28 counts of indecent assault. One victim told the court, Kelly was "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse" at Willow Park, and secondary school, Blackrock College. Peter Kelly began teaching at Willow Park Primary school in 1977. He resigned in 2004 after an investigation following a complaint made in 2001. The DPP decided not to prosecute him at that stage. Earlier this year however, he went on trial at the Circuit Criminal Court, charged with 28 counts of indecent assault against eight boys. All the boys were aged between around 10 and 13 years old when the assaults took place. Some of the offences took place in the classroom, some in changing rooms. Kelly denied the charges but was found guilty by a jury last month. The court heard he doesn't accept the jury's verdicts. Many of the boys gave evidence that Kelly wore a black gown and would put boys under his gown and cuddle and fondle them - something he referred to as "the Muppet show". He would also tickle boys, calling it "death by tickles", slap them, bounce them on his crotch and touch their genital areas or make them touch his. The boys also gave evidence of physical punishment, although this did not form part of the charges against Kelly. However the prosecution case was that he used physical and sexual violence to demean the boys in his class. The boys are now men in their fifties and the court heard emotional and moving victim impact statements from all eight of them. Some of the men read their own statements, some were read by investigating garda inspector Rachel Kilpatrick. Most of the men described suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. Some had struggled with addiction and lived with self doubt, fear, depression and anxiety. The first man to give his victim impact statement told the court he had been a normal child who enjoyed life to the full and had lots of friends. He said he had loved sports and loved playing marbles and he remembered laughing with friends and laughing with his mother. But he said all that disappeared the moment Kelly touched him for the first time. The man said Kelly eroded his normal life into doubt and fear. He said his whole life became insufferable. He said he knew it was wrong and knew he didn't want Kelly near him, but he couldn't get away from him. The man described turning in on himself, he said he was terrified and Kelly made it impossible to be normal. He learned how to exist rather than how to live. From the moment he opened his eyes in the morning until he went to sleep at night, he said he was constantly wondering what he could do make sure Kelly wouldn't notice him so he wouldn't touch him. Although he tried to be good, silent and quiet and do his homework, he said Kelly always got him in the end. On one occasion, he described faking a serious accident so he wouldn't have to go to school and his relief when he was taken to hospital. The man described the damage done to him as irreparable and said his life would have been completely different if the abuse hadn't happened. He gave up sports and dropped out of school early. He said he was floored when he found out others had been abused but he always felt it couldn't just have been him. The man told the court he had always hated himself for letting Kelly beat him mentally but only now could he see that he never stood a chance at 11 years old. Another man described the severe impact the abuse had had on his physical and mental health. He said his health had deteriorated and his ability to work had been affected. He too had been diagnosed with PTSD and he said his symptoms had placed a tremendous strain on his family and on his marriage. This man told the prosecuting counsel, John Griffin, that Kelly had worked in an institution which "tolerated widespread physical and mental abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College". He said 37 sexual abusers had been identified in both schools and Kelly was just "one cog in a machine of systematic abuse". "We as children, had no chance," he said. A third victim of Kelly's abuse told the court he had already been broken by abuse carried out against him by another teacher, Edward Baylor, who has since died. He said Kelly, instead of supporting him as a vulnerable person, took advantage of his vulnerability and added to his pain. He said Kelly's abuse reinforced his shame and intensified his sense that there was no escape. This man told the court he had lived with pain and damage ever since, and the loss of what his life should have been. He said he was desperate to be invisible at school, his grades plummeted and his future changed course. He left Ireland as a young man, he told the court, and now feels he needs to leave again as it is too painful to stay here. This man broke down as he told the court he felt useless and that he was "never getting out of this". He said it had taken him years to be able to speak about it and that he was "so very, very tired". He told Kelly he hoped he was being made to confront what he had done. Other victims also wrote of feeling terrified of Kelly and of suffering from depression and anxiety later in life. Defence counsel, Andrew Sexton told the court Kelly's entire life had centred around Willow Park and Blackrock College until he resigned in 2004. He said he had medical and physical issues of significance and his health was deteriorating. He has no other convictions. Judge Elma Sheahan said it had been a very difficult morning for victims and she needed time to consider all she had heard. She said she would sentence Kelly next week and remanded him in custody in the meantime. Legal Affairs Correspondent Follow@Orlaodo © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Former Willow Park primary school teacher to be sentenced over abuse of eight boys

A former teacher at Willow Park primary school in south Dublin will be sentenced next week for the indecent assault of eight boys more than 30 years ago. The school, located on the grounds of Blackrock College, was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, now the Spiritans. One survivor of the abuse inflicted by Peter Kelly told Dublin Circuit Criminal Court that his former teacher had worked for an institution “that tolerated widespread sexual abuse in Willow Park and Blackrock College”. “Thirty-seven abusers were identified in this, he was a mere cog in a machine of systematic abuse. We as children had no chance.” Kelly (73), who grew up in Booterstown and taught maths at the school from 1977 until 2004, had pleaded not guilty to 28 counts of indecently assaulting eight boys in the 1970s and the 1980s at Willow Park primary school. He was convicted last month of all 28 counts after a trial before Dublin Circuit Criminal Court. The jury returned majority verdicts, following more than seven hours of deliberation. The matter was adjourned for a sentencing hearing before Judge Elma Sheahan, who on Tuesday heard victim impact statements from all eight complainants who were aged between 10 and 13 at the time of the offences. Having also heard submissions on behalf of barrister John Griffin, for the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), and Andrew Sexton SC, Kelly’s barrister, the judge said she had a lot to consider and would pass sentence on December 8th. Because of different legislation applying in different years to the offences, the maximum penalties are two years in some cases and 10 years in others. In mitigation submissions, Mr Sexton said his client has spent his entire life around his home in Booterstown and the school, and prison would be difficult for a man of his age. There was no acceptance by Kelly of the jury’s verdict, counsel also said. A complaint against Kelly was made in 2001 and a decision was made by the DPP not to prosecute, counsel also said. Six complainants were in court to read their statements while statements from the remaining two were read by Insp Rachel Kilpatrick, who was involved from 2021 in a large scale Garda investigation into allegations of sexual abuse at Blackrock College and Willow Park primary school. Insp Kilpatrick said Kelly had made no admissions during two interviews with gardaí before his being charged with the offences. A number of complainants referred to Kelly engaging in what was known as the “Muppet Show” in the classroom, in which he would take a boy under his black cloak and, under the guise of tickling them, would run his hands up and down their torsos and buttocks. Kelly had also pulled some complainants on to his lap and bounced them aggressively up and down in front of the class while pushing his body against their backs. The judge was also told Kelly had brought some boys to stand in front of the class, stood behind them and took hold of their hands and moved their hands up and down all over their bodies while standing close behind them and pushing his body into theirs. One complainant described this as akin to “a humiliation ritual”. Many of the offences took place in the classroom but one complainant was assaulted on four occasions by Kelly in a rugby changing room, including being held face down across Kelly’s knee while the teacher slapped his bottom and pushed him up towards his penis. Another complainant was assaulted where gym equipment was stored, involving being made bend over a gym horse and having his buttocks rubbed and slapped. One complainant had alleged, during an occasion when he was held back at school by Kelly, the teacher had put his hands inside his underpants and digitally penetrated his anus. All eight statements outlined serious adverse impacts of the abuse by Kelly. Some suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and some spoke of experiencing suicidal ideation. One complainant said he always had a sense of “danger and dread” around Kelly. Not only had the teacher abused him, he “controlled me mentally”, the man said. As a result of Kelly’s abuse, he hated everything to do with school, stopped all sports and gave up his goals, he said. In adult life, he could never face situations without severe anger, trauma and anxiety, he said. It was only after he underwent counselling that he saw he never had a chance. Another complainant said that, as a result of Kelly’s abuse, he did not like it when his father hugged him after he did well at school or sports. He had never had any counselling but intended to when the criminal process was over, the man said. A third complainant said he spent long periods in psychiatric hospitals due to the abuse and was diagnosed with PTSD. His personal and professional life were very seriously affected, he said. Another man said he suffered depression, social anxiety and PTSD, as well as trust issues. Only when he began therapy in his 40s had his situation started to improve, he said. Another said he became a “hollow shell of a human” and was unable to cry as a child and into later life, either for himself or others. He had used alcohol and drugs for a long time in an effort to stop negative thoughts. Insomnia and addiction issues were cited by another survivor who said he contacted gardaí after seeing RTÉ’s Late Late Show address issues about abuse in schools run by the Spiritans. Another survivor said, when Kelly abused him, he was already vulnerable and broken as a result of “multiple sexual crimes” by another person. He continues to experience serious difficulties daily as a result of the abuse, he said. Another survivor said he became withdrawn and “dark and brooding” following the abuse and did not speak out because he felt there was an air of “don’t speak, don’t tell”. The “sense of being alone” might sum it up best, he said.

Title: Meesho Faces Investor Protest Over Anchor Allotment To SBI Funds

Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book faced a setback after several major investors pulled out when the Indian e-commerce firm was said to have allocated about a quarter of the shares in this tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., the country’s largest asset manager, according to people familiar with the matter. That decision triggered a pushback from other large funds, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Meesho is set to open its anchor book — a portion of shares reserved for institutional investors — on Tuesday ahead of its initial public offering that launches on Wednesday. Among those who withdrew were Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., Nippon India Life Asset Management Ltd. and Nomura Asset Management, the people said. Many had sought allocations on par with those of SBI Funds and opted out in what was viewed as a protest, they added. Even so, Meesho’s anchor lineup features several global investors, including sovereign wealth funds such as GIC Pte and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, alongside major long-only investors like Fidelity International, BlackRock Inc., Baillie Gifford, as well as global firms like WCM Investment Management and Dragoneer Investment Group LLC, the people said. To be sure, the anchor allotment process is still ongoing, and the final investor lineup may change. The episode underscores the intense demand for India’s tech startups as they move toward public listings. Recent IPOs from digital platforms including Urban Co. and Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd. — the parent of discount broker Groww — have drawn heavy demand, reflecting consumers’ rapid shift toward online services and commerce. Representatives for Capital Group and Aberdeen declined to comment. Spokespersons at Meesho, SBI Funds and the other investors didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Bengaluru-based marketplace, which links small manufacturers with price-sensitive consumers in smaller Indian cities, aims to raise as much as 54.2 billion rupees ($603 million). The shares are priced in a range of 105 rupees to 111 rupees apiece, according to a newspaper advertisement published Friday. Existing shareholders, including Elevation Capital V Ltd., Peak XV Partners Investments V and Meesho’s founders will sell shares in the offering.

Title: Bank of America Greenlights Wealth Advisers to Recommend Up to 4% Bitcoin Allocation

Bank of America, one of the U.S.’s largest financial institutions, has become the latest Wall Street giant to warm up to bitcoin BTC$92,710.65. Beginning in January, the bank's wealth management advisers will be allowed to recommend a 1%-4% allocation to crypto assets, according to Yahoo Finance. Initially, the BofA/Merrill Lynch thundering herd will focus on four spot bitcoin ETFs — BlackRock's IBIT, Fidelity's FBTC, Bitwise's BITB and Grayscale's BTC. It's a major change for the bank, which previously allowed its clientele to invest as they wish, but did not allow its advisors to recommend crypto exposure. The news comes just hours after asset management titan Vanguard reversed its long-standing policy and will now allow its clients access to crypto ETFs. The move also brings BofA in line with the wealth management platforms of other major institutions like BlackRock and Morgan Stanley. The action also likely ups the pressure on the dwindling number of holdouts, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and UBS among them. "For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate," Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, said in a statement. "The lower end of this range may be more appropriate for those with a conservative risk profile, while the higher end may suit investors with greater tolerance for overall portfolio risk," Hyzy added.

Business CEO of Dell Technologies Michael Dell participates an Invest America Roundtable in the State Dining room, at the White House, in Washington, U.S., June 9, 2025. REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein WASHINGTON, Dec 2 : Entrepreneur Michael Dell and his wife, Susan, will deposit $250 in the individual investment accounts of 25 million American children in a $6.25 billion philanthropic pledge as part of the Trump administration's Invest America initiative. The initiative, known as "Trump accounts", was created this year under President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act and has sparked a scramble by financial firms looking to participate. The U.S. Treasury will deposit $1,000 into investment accounts for all children born between 2025 and 2028. The Invest America accounts are expected to open on July 4 next year, but details about how they will work are still unknown. The funds - required to be invested in an index fund that mirrors the performance of the broader stock market - become available at the age of 18 for education, job training, a first home or starting a business. "We believe the smartest investment that we can make is an investment in children," Michael Dell said at a White House event announcing the donation.

Title: Cardano’s Hoskinson Reveals the Way Forward for Crypto Market, Shares Optimistic Expectations

Time Published: 2025-12-02T13:34:24Z

Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson believes the current crypto market downturn is unlikely to persist, arguing that the market has shifted far beyond the retail-driven cycles of previous years. Speaking in a recent interview, Hoskinson noted that the arrival of major financial institutions and the U.S. government has fundamentally changed the market’s structure and its long-term trajectory. Responding to a question about whether a more crypto-friendly U.S. administration could soften the impact of the current drawdown, Hoskinson said this cycle stands apart from earlier ones. “The last three times it was retail-led,” he explained. “But this time around, you have BlackRock and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and the U.S. government, all others coming in.” The Cardano co-founder added that a growing portion of crypto now represents real-world assets, pointing to the rapid expansion of stablecoins, which have surpassed $250 billion in issuance and could exceed $1 trillion by 2030. Hoskinson also highlighted projections that between $10 trillion worth of equities and other traditional assets could move on-chain by the mid-2030s. Combined with a potential rise in global crypto users from 550 million today to nearly one billion, the sector’s foundation is stronger than short-term sentiment suggests. “There’s no way for these markets to stay depressed forever,” Hoskinson said, framing current prices as a reflection of macro uncertainty rather than deteriorating fundamentals. That uncertainty is visible on market dashboards. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index recently plunged to 6, one of its lowest readings ever. Meanwhile, analysts noted that short-term profit-and-loss metrics have fallen even more sharply than during the COVID-19 and FTX crashes. Nevertheless, some analysts are calling the downturn an opportunity, urging traders to “buy the dip.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are flashing mixed signals. Bitcoin wavers between institutional outflows, renewed whale accumulation, and questions surrounding its upcoming quantum-resistant upgrade. Ethereum faces regulatory delays, proposed staking reward cuts, and persistent whale buying even as retail holders exit. At the time of writing, the crypto market stands at a total valuation of $2.96 trillion.

Title: Bank of America backs 1–4% crypto allocation, opens gates to Bitcoin ETFs

Bank of America’s wealthiest clients will gain access to Bitcoin ETFs, while its network of over 15,000 wealth advisers can recommend crypto exposure for the first time, Yahoo reported. More big-name financial institutions are opening the door to Bitcoin exposure, signaling a growing institutional appetite for regulated digital asset products. Bank of America, the second-largest US bank, reportedly recommended a 1%–4% cryptocurrency allocation to its wealth management clients through the Merrill, Bank of America Private Bank and Merrill Edge platforms, according to a statement shared with Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. “For investors with a strong interest in thematic innovation and comfort with elevated volatility, a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets could be appropriate,” said Chris Hyzy, chief investment officer at Bank of America Private Bank, in the statement shared with Yahoo. Starting Jan. 5, the bank will enable its clients to gain access to four new Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The development will enable the bank’s wealthiest clients to gain exposure to Bitcoin ETFs, which were previously only available upon request. The bank’s over 15,000 wealth advisers were unable to recommend any cryptocurrency investment products. “Our guidance emphasizes regulated vehicles, thoughtful allocation, and a clear understanding of both the opportunities and risks,” added the bank’s chief investment officer. The bank’s Bitcoin allocation recommendation is signaling a wider institutional appetite for regulated cryptocurrency investment products. It comes a day after Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, enabled crypto ETF trading for its clients, reversing its previous stance on digital asset ETFs. Cointelegraph has contacted Bank of America for more details on its crypto allocation recommendations. Bank of America is the second-largest bank in the US with about $2.67 trillion in consolidated assets and over 3,600 branches, according to Forbes. Related: Bitcoin to end four-year cycle, break out to new highs in 2026: Grayscale BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, was the first big institution to recommend an up to 2% Bitcoin allocation to its clients, Cointelegraph reported in December 2024. Around 1%–2% is a “reasonable range for Bitcoin exposure,” which poses the “same share of overall portfolio risk” as a typical allocation to “the ‘magnificent 7’ group of mostly mega-cap tech stocks,” wrote BlackRock in a report at the time. The “magnificent 7” refers to Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta and Nvidia.

Earlier in October, Morgan Stanley also suggested a 2% to 4% allocation to crypto portfolios for investors and financial advisers, further signaling that large financial institutions are moving toward a shared playbook of modest, risk-managed exposure to digital assets.

Title: Vanguard caves on crypto to retain clients as rivals win flows — opens $9.3T platform to crypto ETFs

With $9.3 trillion under management, Vanguard’s entry into crypto ETFs could usher tens of billions in new demand despite modest initial allocations. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. On Dec. 2, Vanguard will reportedly open its massive brokerage platform to spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This strategic volte-face ends the asset manager’s steadfast isolation from the $3 trillion digital asset market. For years, Vanguard stood as the most prominent holdout of the crypto space, driven by a philosophy that viewed the high volatility of digital assets as fundamentally incompatible with the principles of long-term, diversified portfolio construction. This reversal, therefore, represents one of the most significant capitulations in the traditional finance sector’s gradual embrace of the crypto economy. Crucially, Vanguard said it is not deviating from its core manufacturing philosophy. So, it would not be launching its own proprietary crypto funds. Instead, it will serve as a critical gateway, allowing its conservative client base to access regulated products managed by rival issuers such as BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments, and Bitwise Asset Management. Speaking on the broader significance of the move, Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, noted the stark contrast between the magnitude of the policy shift and the market’s muted reaction, a sign of the asset class’s maturity. He noted: “The 2nd largest brokerage in America flips its policy from sell-only to allowing crypto ETF purchases. And no one is fired up. Whether people are stoked right now or not — crypto is rapidly entering the mainstream.” The firm’s restrictions on crypto ETFs had remained firmly in place even after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot Bitcoin funds in early 2024 and the first Ethereum products later that year. Notably, Vanguard’s internal client guidelines and platform eligibility rules kept those ETFs from its self-directed brokerage system, citing regulatory ambiguity and investor protection concerns. However, the calculus changed following a sweeping shift in the regulatory environment under the current US administration. The SEC’s pivot toward a pro-innovation stance, combined with years of court decisions, effectively evaporated the regulatory uncertainty that Vanguard had long cited as a barrier. Indeed, the approvals of spot crypto ETFs were underpinned by robust frameworks that establish how surveillance-sharing agreements, custody arrangements, and disclosure standards apply to digital assets. These frameworks, first battle-tested with Bitcoin ETFs, became the template for subsequent products, significantly reducing the operational risk for brokers offering access through retail platforms. Furthermore, the move is an acknowledgment of irrefutable market realities. A recent study found that 35% of younger, wealthy Americans have left their financial advisors because they do not allow access to crypto. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the fastest-growing ETFs in US history, demonstrating that demand for crypto exposure had decisively shifted from niche trading platforms to mainstream asset managers. Today, spot Bitcoin funds manage approximately $120 billion in assets across issuers, while Ethereum ETFs collectively hold nearly $20 billion. At the same time, newer products tracking Solana and XRP are succeeding, thanks to strong market demand. Beyond regulation, the absence of crypto access had become a burgeoning competitive liability for Vanguard. Notably, many clients already held crypto ETFs in accounts outside Vanguard while maintaining traditional holdings on the platform. This bifurcation forced advisors to route trades through separate institutions, complicating processes such as tax-loss harvesting and model portfolio management. So, this decision acknowledges that clients seeking exposure through regulated ETFs should be able to execute those trades within their primary Vanguard accounts rather than migrating capital to outside brokers. Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, reportedly said: “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity. The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured, and investor preferences continue to evolve.” The direct impact on ETF flows will depend on how Vanguard’s unique client base responds. Vanguard manages more than $9.3 trillion in assets, but the addressable market for these products is narrower because only self-directed brokerage and IRA accounts are authorized to trade them. Institutional mandates, defined benefit plans, and other pooled vehicles generally remain restricted from such allocations. Moreover, Vanguard clients exhibit behavior distinct from the active traders who drove early crypto ETF inflows. This demographic favors passive, long-dated index products over thematic or tactical funds. As a result, initial allocations are expected to be modest. Still, a penetration rate of roughly 0.1% to 0.2% of eligible brokerage assets would imply early flows in the low-single-digit billions, spread across Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP funds. Meanwhile, the significance of Vanguard’s entry lies not in the velocity of the flows, but in the stickiness of the capital. Unlike the “mercenary capital” of hedge funds or the reactive flows of retail day traders, Vanguard inflows tend to be price-agnostic and permanent. So, in a standard “60/40/1” portfolio—allocated to equities, bonds, and crypto respectively—automated systems maintain target weightings by selling outperforming assets and buying underperforming ones. If the price of Bitcoin or Solana drops, the portfolio algorithmically buys more to restore the 1% weighting. This creates a structural “buy the dip” mechanism that could dampen volatility and raise floor prices over a full market cycle. Moreover, broader distribution typically improves liquidity. The influx of Vanguard’s diversified volume is expected to narrow bid-ask spreads and reduce execution costs for all investors, further tightening the efficiency of ETF arbitrage mechanisms and the responsiveness of pricing to underlying market movements. As a result, even a conservative adoption curve could have outsized impacts. So, if only a fraction of Vanguard’s client base allocates a standard 1% to 2% “satellite” position to crypto ETFs, it represents tens of billions of dollars in net new demand.

Title: 11 Trillion Asset Management Giant Vanguard To Allow Bitcoin, Ether, And XRP ETF Trading In Stunning About-Turn

Vanguard, the world’s second-largest asset manager, is set to allow its clients to start trading crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds on its platform, abandoning its previous anti-crypto stance that had kept digital-asset offerings off its shelves for years. Starting Tuesday, Vanguard will allow trading in funds that hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, and Solana (SOL), similar to how the firm treats gold, according to a Monday report from Bloomberg. “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity,” Andrew Kadjeski, Vanguard’s head of brokerage and investments, told Bloomberg. “The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve.” Notably, funds linked to memecoins or those not supported by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will remain barred. Moreover, Vanguard has no immediate plans to create its own crypto products. The pivot provides more than 50 million Vanguard brokerage customers with access to regulated crypto funds, including those from rival asset manager BlackRock. Nearly a dozen spot Bitcoin ETFs that launched early last year attracted impressive inflows, pushing their combined assets to nearly $120 billion, while ETH products grew to around $20 billion, per SoSoValue data. Still, Vanguard astutely indicated that it would steer clear of such crypto-related investment products, citing volatility and the speculative nature of assets. As recently as August 2024, iShares veteran and current CEO Salim Ramji had ruled out any plans to offer crypto ETFs. According to Bloomberg, the Wall Street behemoth’s decision to embrace crypto assets is a response to strong demand from retail and institutional clients despite a sharp market pullback. Some crypto commentators believe Vanguard’s change of heart could lead to a deluge of crypto ETF customers and act as a catalyst for crypto prices. Vanguard is second only to BlackRock as an asset manager, with roughly $11 trillion in global assets under management. Crypto strategist Nilesh Rohilla noted on X that he would be shocked if the BTC price doesn’t “jump 5% in this news in the next 24 hrs.” Vivek Sen, the founder of Bitcoin public relations company Bitgrow Lab, also forecasted that there are “trillions incoming.” Meanwhile, X user BankXRP observed: “This is another massive signal that traditional finance is fully stepping into digital assets. The wall of money is lining up.”

Share this article Bank of America, one of the nation’s largest financial institutions, has advised its wealth management clients to consider allocating 1% to 4% of their portfolios to digital assets through regulated investment vehicles, Yahoo Finance reported on Tuesday. The bank’s investment strategists will begin providing research coverage on four Bitcoin ETFs in January, allowing its 15,000 advisers to formally recommend them. The covered funds include products from Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, and BlackRock. The recommendation is consistent with the ongoing adoption of digital assets within traditional finance. Major financial institutions have increasingly embraced crypto assets as portfolio components. Banks are adjusting their wealth management strategies to include digital assets as potential thematic investments, moving beyond previous skepticism. Bitcoin has gained acceptance among institutional players as a hedge against economic uncertainties. The digital asset is viewed as both a store of value and a medium of exchange within decentralized financial systems. Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee is recommending 2%–4% crypto allocations for suitable clients, calling Bitcoin “digital gold” and viewing crypto as a speculative but maturing asset class. The guidance favors ETF-based exposure with regular rebalancing. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account? Sign In Forgot your password?

Title: Meesho faces investor protest over anchor allotment to SBI Funds

(Bloomberg) -- Meesho Ltd.’s anchor book faced a setback after several major investors pulled out when the Indian e-commerce firm was said to have allocated about a quarter of the shares in this tranche to SBI Funds Management Pvt., the country’s largest asset manager, according to people familiar with the matter. That decision triggered a pushback from other large funds, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Meesho is set to open its anchor book — a portion of shares reserved for institutional investors — on Tuesday ahead of its initial public offering that launches on Wednesday. Among those who withdrew were Capital Group, Aberdeen Group Plc, Norges Bank Investment Management, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., Nippon India Life Asset Management Ltd. and Nomura Asset Management, the people said. Many had sought allocations on par with those of SBI Funds and opted out in what was viewed as a protest, they added. Even so, Meesho’s anchor lineup features several global investors, including sovereign wealth funds such as GIC Pte and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, alongside major long-only investors like Fidelity International, BlackRock Inc., Baillie Gifford, as well as global firms like WCM Investment Management and Dragoneer Investment Group LLC, the people said. To be sure, the anchor allotment process is still ongoing, and the final investor lineup may change. The episode underscores the intense demand for India’s tech startups as they move toward public listings. Recent IPOs from digital platforms including Urban Co. and Billionbrains Garage Ventures Ltd. — the parent of discount broker Groww — have drawn heavy demand, reflecting consumers’ rapid shift toward online services and commerce. Representatives for Capital Group and Aberdeen declined to comment. Spokespersons at Meesho, SBI Funds and the other investors didn’t respond to requests for comment. The Bengaluru-based marketplace, which links small manufacturers with price-sensitive consumers in smaller Indian cities, aims to raise as much as 54.2 billion rupees ($603 million). The shares are priced in a range of 105 rupees to 111 rupees apiece, according to a newspaper advertisement published Friday. Existing shareholders, including Elevation Capital V Ltd., Peak XV Partners Investments V and Meesho’s founders will sell shares in the offering.

Title: Goldman's $2B ETF Issuer Takeover Is Both a Blessing and a Curse for Crypto
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/12/02/goldman-s-usd2b-etf-issuer-takeover-is-both-a-blessing-and-a-curse-for-crypto

Goldman Sachs (GS) buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer for about $2 billion doesn't seem like it has much to do with crypto at first. However, the Wall Street banking giant's purchase of Innovator Capital has implications that can shake up the entire crypto industry, primarily the ETF sector. That market today is worth $190 billion, but the spot bitcoin BTC$92,710.65 ETF market alone is projected to grow to $3 trillion by 2033. When the deal was announced, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in a statement that “Active ETFs are dynamic, transformative, and one of the fastest-growing segments in today’s public investment landscape,” and “by acquiring Innovator, Goldman Sachs will expand access to modern, world-class investment products.” Bruce Bond, CEO of Innovator, said: “Goldman Sachs has a long history of discerning emerging trends and important directional shifts within the asset management industry." The statements speak volumes about how Goldman sees the ETF industry evolving: building a truly "modern" platform that will invest in emerging trends, based on investor demand. This could eventually include digital assets. Why? Just ask BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, which has more than $13.4 trillion in assets under management. The firm manages over 1,400 different ETFs globally, and out of all these funds, according to one of its executives, bitcoin ETFs have become the firm’s most profitable product line. As a reminder, Goldman Sachs already serves as an Authorized Participant for major spot bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Grayscale, facilitating their daily trading. And while Innovator primarily focuses on defined outcome ETFs, it has responded to the increasing demand for crypto exposure with structured ETFs such as the Innovator Uncapped Bitcoin 20 Floor ETF (QBF), which provides investors with exposure to bitcoin through a risk-managed strategy. “Not only does this give them an ETF manufacturing scale in one shot, but it also opens up a pre-engineered, compliant channel for pushing buffered bitcoin exposure through private banks, RIAs and wealth platforms that crypto-native issuers struggle to access,” Anna Tutova, AI Crypto Minds founder and family offices’ advisor told CoinDesk. Simply put, crypto is becoming another Wall Street product that traditional financial institutions want to get exposure to as investors demand new, innovative products and asset classes. ETFs are becoming the distribution channel for that demand. This raises a long-standing debate about why cryptocurrency was created: to provide an alternative financial system that addresses the problems of legacy financial systems. However, crypto needs mass adoption if it is to stand toe-to-toe with traditional finance and government oversight. And to do that, it needs the very institutions, such as BlackRock, Goldman and even the governments it meant to rival. “This deal pretty much sums up 2025 as the year when the legitimacy of crypto has been validated by governments and big players," said Anastasiia Bobeshko, an independent strategic Web3 adviser. And this is where many industry participants sound the alarm. “Crypto is becoming just another Wall Street investment tool, not the alternative system it set out to be," said AI Crypto Minds' Tutova. Trevor Koverko, a co-founder of Sapien and Polymath, echoed the sentiment, saying that Goldman Sachs’ potential crypto ETF move is “good for adoption, dangerous for the ethos." Wall Street ETFs bring scale plus liquidity, but if we stop at ‘number go up in brokerage accounts,’ we’ve just rebuilt the old system on new assets. ETFs should be the on-ramp, not the destination,” he told CoinDesk. So while Wall Street giants like Goldman Sachs are pushing further into crypto, legitimizing the industry and preparing it for further adoption, it might fail to uphold the original vision of the cypherpunks and even Bitcoin's mysterious founder (or founders), Satoshi Nakamoto. “Satoshi positioned Bitcoin against corrupt systems like the banking system,” said Kadan Stadelmann, Komodo Platform CTO. “Now massive corporations like BlackRock and Fidelity have become dominant crypto players, changing Bitcoin inherently. It is no longer a political tool based on self-custody, but, rather, a financial tool for wealth preservation and diversification.” More For You Protocol Research: GoPlus Security What to know: More For You ETHZilla Buys 20% of AI Lending Platform Karus in $10M Deal to Tokenize Auto Loans The companies plan to tokenize auto loans, with the first portfolios expected to be available by early 2026.

Title: Vanguard reverses course, opens door to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana ETFs

In a dramatic shift that signals growing acceptance of digital assets by mainstream finance, Vanguard has opened its brokerage platform to regulated crypto ETFs. Starting this week, US investors can access exchange-traded funds tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, marking a major reversal from the firm’s long-held resistance to cryptocurrency. 🚨 Just found this on Vanguard’s official website 👀 Multiple XRP ETFs (Franklin, Canary, REX-Osprey, ProShares…) are now showing under « Non-Vanguard Funds » in the Digital Assets category. Looks like access is finally opening up for crypto ETFs pic.twitter.com/Y08IgtAybg — Arthur (@XrpArthur) December 2, 2025 Notably, the move comes amid surging client demand and increasing institutional interest in digital assets, reshaping Vanguard’s traditional investment philosophy. For years, Vanguard maintained a cautious stance toward cryptocurrencies, with former CEO Tim Buckley publicly dismissing BTC and other digital assets as too speculative and unsuitable for long-term portfolios. The firm consistently refused to offer crypto ETFs, emphasising stability and low-risk investments for retirement-focused clients. However, leadership changes paved the way for a rethink. Salim Ramji, formerly the global head of ETFs at BlackRock, assumed the CEO role and gradually steered Vanguard toward regulated crypto offerings. While the firm still will not create its own crypto ETFs or mutual funds, it now supports third-party products that meet regulatory standards, providing clients with access to digital assets while maintaining compliance. The platform expansion enables more than 50 million US brokerage clients to trade crypto ETFs alongside other non-core assets like gold. This could significantly increase market participation, with some predicting near-term price boosts in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Among the new offerings, XRP-based ETFs have generated particular excitement. In just 11 trading days, spot XRP ETFs have recorded net inflows exceeding $756 million, with total assets under management reaching $723 million. Remarkably, there have been no outflows, and major inflow events include $243 million during Canary Capital’s launch, $164 million tied to Grayscale and Franklin Templeton ETFs, and $89.65 million in the most recent session. This rapid accumulation is reducing the liquid XRP supply on exchanges, potentially creating a supply shock that could influence pricing. Vanguard’s pivot reflects a broader trend among traditional financial institutions embracing crypto. Goldman Sachs, for example, is deepening its exposure through a $2 billion acquisition of Innovator Capital Management, which issues defined-outcome ETFs, including Bitcoin-linked structured funds. The bank has rapidly increased its holdings in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, totalling billions in assets, while also developing infrastructure for tokenised financial products. Industry observers view these moves as part of a gradual yet significant integration of digital assets into mainstream portfolios, indicating that regulated, institutionally backed crypto investment is shifting from a niche to a standard. The implications of Vanguard’s decision extend beyond immediate market activity. By allowing access to regulated crypto ETFs, the firm is providing a channel for both retail and institutional investors to participate in digital asset markets within a familiar, compliant framework. This could draw additional inflows, potentially reshaping liquidity dynamics and market sentiment across Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana. For Vanguard, the shift represents not only a strategic response to client demand but also an acknowledgement that digital assets have become a permanent fixture in the global financial landscape.

Title: Vanguard Expands to Bitcoin ETFs, Turns Bitcoin Hyper Bullish

Quick Facts: Vanguard’s decision to let clients trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana ETFs marks a sharp break from its long-held crypto skepticism. The move will expose more investors to the crypto space, which will likely fuel the ecosystem as a whole moving into 2026. At the same time, easier ETF access mostly drives exposure to ‘Bitcoin beta’ – price action tied to $BTC itself. If you already hold spot Bitcoin or plan to stack via ETFs, that’s helpful, but it doesn’t fully capture the upside in the infrastructure being built around Bitcoin’s base layer. In that context, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is drawing attention as an attempt to bolt a Solana‑style execution engine directly onto Bitcoin’s settlement layer. By positioning itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) support, it targets the oldest critique of $BTC: slow, costly, non‑programmable base‑layer transactions. Learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper is right here. Vanguard’s ETF pivot adds to a roster of giants like BlackRock and Fidelity already funnelling retirement and brokerage capital into Bitcoin exposure. As institutional ETF flows normalize $BTC in traditional portfolios, attention often rotates to ‘picks and shovels’ plays. Within that mix, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) sits in the more aggressive bucket: a modular architecture that uses Bitcoin Layer 1 for settlement while executing smart contracts on an SVM‑powered Layer 2. For investors who see $BTC ETFs as the safe core position, projects like this become a way to express a higher‑risk view on Bitcoin’s eventual app layer. Buy your $HYPER today on the official presale page. Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) central claim is ambitious: a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin ecosystem with near-instant finality and ultra-fast smart contract execution. Instead of pushing complex logic onto Bitcoin’s base layer, Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2 routes execution through a real-time SVM environment while periodically anchoring the state back to Bitcoin for security and final settlement. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper uses a single trusted sequencer, which batches and orders transactions before anchoring them to Bitcoin. The Canonical Bridge is the bone beneath the meat, producing the wrapped $BTC that the clients can use within the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 ecosystem. On the capital side, the $HYPER presale has raised over $28.8M, with a current price of $0.013365, signaling substantial early interest in a Bitcoin‑centric smart contract thesis. In terms of profit, you’re looking at ROIs of 1,396% and 11,125% respectively, which is incentive enough for early coin hunters. An additional incentive comes from the presale’s projected end date, which should come between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026. Not much time left on the clock, so read our guide on how to buy $HYPER before it’s too late. Visit the presale page and buy your $HYPER before the presale ends. This isn’t financial advice.

Title: Vanguard just ‘caved’ – 50M investors can now trade crypto ETFs

Will Vanguard’s move boost recovery of crypto ETFs inflows? Vanguard Group, the world’s second-largest asset manager, will allow access to crypto ETFs and related mutual funds on its platform from the 2nd of December. This would give over 50 million brokerage customers, who see over $11 trillion in capital, access to the fast-growing digital assets market, noted Bloomberg. Surprisingly, the approval came only after the market rout erased more than $1 trillion following the October pullback. In 2024, the asset manager took to the sidelines as BlackRock and others entered the sector. At that time, it viewed crypto as mere speculation and too volatile for traditional investments. But in September 2025, Vanguard adopted a softer stance and signaled a likely access, citing clients’ demand for crypto ETFs. Explaining the firm’s U-turn, Andrew Kadjeski, head of brokerage and investments at Vanguard, said, “Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity.” He added, “The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve.” Only Bitcoin, Ethereum [ETH], Ripple [XRP], and Solana [SOL] ETFs will be allowed on the Vanguard platform. But the asset manager reiterated that it won’t launch its own crypto products. Reacting to the update, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, said the move meant the ‘crypto is rapidly entering the mainstream.’ Source: X For his part, Nate Geraci, founder of ETF Prime, said Vanguard finally ‘caved’ for digital assets. However, some didn’t view the news as short-term bullish for crypto and BTC, which hovered around $86K as of press time. That said, spot crypto ETFs experienced record growth in 2025, except in Q4. For the U.S. spot BTC ETFs, for example, total assets under management (AUM) reached a record $170 billion in October. BlackRock led the way with over $100 billion in AUM, and its BTC ETF became its top revenue line. However, the Q4 crypto rout has led to a sharp drop in BlackRock’s AUM to $66 billion and the overall net assets value to $112 billion. Nevertheless, the broader crypto ETFs experienced a rebound of $1.07 billion in inflows last week. For CoinShares, the recovery was attributed to hopes of a Fed rate cut.

In a new column for The Economist, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein say that finance is “entering the next major evolution in market infrastructure,” one that could move assets “faster and more securely than systems that have served investors for decades.” Tokenization records ownership of assets on digital ledgers, enabling stocks, bonds, real estate, and other holdings to exist as verifiable digital records that can be traded and settled without traditional intermediaries. The executives’ view fits squarely within BlackRock’s tokenization agenda, harking back to Fink’s 2022 statement that "the next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities." “At first it was hard for the financial world—including us—to see the big idea,” the duo wrote, noting that tokenization “was tangled up in the crypto boom, which often looked like speculation.” But beneath that noise, “tokenization can greatly expand the world of investable assets” and “offers the potential to settle transactions instantaneously,” while replacing “manual processes, bespoke settlements and records that haven’t kept up with the rest of finance.” The world’s largest asset manager’s executives did caution that the technology won't replace existing systems immediately, describing it instead as "a bridge being built from both sides of a river" connecting traditional institutions with digital-first innovators. Joshua Chu, a lawyer and co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association, told Decrypt that BlackRock is "probably directionally right that tokenization will be part of the 'next generation for markets,' but the implied timing is, in my view, potentially over-compressed." "This is a multi-cycle transition in which narrow, well-regulated use-cases will accrete over time, not a one-cycle revolution where everything is tokenized by next year," Chu said. "That is simply not how innovation works." ‘Tokenization absolutely has a place in modern finance,” he said, but stressed it “only earns its keep when it solves a real problem that a plain-vanilla structure cannot,” whether by reducing settlement risk, improving collateral mobility, or opening access to previously unreachable assets. Tokenized financial assets remain a sliver of global equity and bond markets. Still, they’re expanding quickly, up roughly 300% in the past 20 months, Fink and Goldstein noted, comparing today’s stage to “the internet in 1996,” when Amazon had sold just $16 million worth of books. The world’s largest asset manager is already building towards that future with BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), which debuted last year and has grown to $2.3 billion, making it among the largest tokenized assets globally, according to RWA.xyz data. "We need to be tokenizing all assets, especially assets that have multiple levels of intermediaries," Fink told investors during BlackRock's third-quarter earnings call, citing real estate as a sector where the technology could lower costs and improve affordability by eliminating layers of middlemen.

Title: Auto-enrolment pensions are almost here but are some employers trying to game the system?

It may have taken more than two decades to come to fruition but efforts to finally introduce compulsory pensions, via auto enrolment, for all workers looks to have run into some rocky waters, amid reports that some companies have been deliberately trying to avoid the scheme. Now the Government is set to clamp down on such behaviour, by the introduction of minimum contributions from January 1st, 2026, across the broader pension sector. But what are the differences between occupational schemes and the auto-enrolment My Future Fund, which will finally come into play on January 1st? And will workers ultimately be the winners of the Government’s actions? My Future Fund is aimed at some 800,000 employees who have no private pension provision. Under current legislation, companies have to give an employee the option of establishing a pension – but crucially they don’t have to contribute to it. In practice, Stephen Gillick, head of pensions with Mason Hayes & Curran, says this typically means setting up a meeting for an employee with a pension provider. My Future Fund will change this. According to a report from pension platform Kota, “it’s the first time employers will be legally obliged to contribute to a pension on behalf of their employees, placing it among the most significant changes to the Irish pension landscape in the history of the State”. Employees are automatically opted in to the new scheme, but can later opt out. To join you must be aged 23-60 and earn more than €20,000 annually. The big advantage of the new scheme is that both the Government, and your employer, will also contribute to your pension. The starting rate is 1.5 per cent per employee/1.5 per cent per employer, and 0.5 per cent from the Government, although this is due to increase to 6 per cent per employee and employer and to 2 per cent from the State after 10 years. “My Future Fund will certainly benefit a large cohort of employees,” says Gillick, although he adds that it will take a few years for contribution rates to build to anything substantial. “The sooner we hit the decent contribution rates, the sooner people will really start to notice,” he says. [ Auto-enrolment Ireland: What long-delayed pension reform means for workers and future fundsOpens in new window ] With an occupational scheme, there may be some advantages over auto-enrolment, such as employees may be able to access the funds in occupational schemes from as young as 50, while they will have to wait until 66 through My Future Fund. Occupational schemes also frequently offer more flexibility when it comes to investment choices; investments are limited to three State-run funds with auto enrolment, with three managers, Irish Life Investment Managers, Amundi, and BlackRock. Employees can also make additional voluntary pension contributions, known as AVCs, to the scheme. At present, it’s not clear how additional contributions can be made in My Future Fund. When it comes to tax relief, employees benefit from their marginal rate on contributions – so then, a standard rate payer will get 20 per cent relief, and a higher rate taxpayer 40 per cent. This means a €100 contribution will cost the former €80 and the latter €60. Employees in auto-enrolment won’t get tax relief as such. Rather, the 1:3 State/employee contribution ratio is equivalent to a 25 per cent tax relief. Depending on your earnings, an occupational scheme might be more attractive. As our table shows, occupational schemes can be more beneficial for this reason for those paying the higher rate of tax. With an occupational scheme, employees do not need to contribute, but employers do. Crucially, however, there is no minimum contribution required from an employer. This is what has given rise to the current issues. For example, under auto-enrolment, an employee earning €45,000 would be entitled to a contribution from their employer of 1.5 per cent, or €675 in this case, on an annual basis into their pension. Within 10 years, this employer contribution should grow to €2,700, based on employer contributions increasing to 6 per cent, and on the salary staying the same. But contributions under an occupational scheme could have stayed at the €675 level – a significantly lower level of contribution. [ Employer still in the dark on how to sign staff up for auto-enrolmentOpens in new window ] Have companies been setting up occupational schemes as a way of avoiding being tied to contribution increases under the State fund? Earlier this month, Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary said he was concerned about employers trying to subvert auto-enrolment by getting their employees to sign up for inferior schemes. Employers were warned it was an offence to “hinder or attempt to hinder an employee from participating in the My Future Fund scheme”. As it stands, there have been reports of employer contributions of as little as 0.5 per cent – with no obligation to increase these. Whether this is the case or not, employers have certainly been encouraged to consider their options. Earlier this month, ISME, the small business association, sent around an email to members entitled “Auto Enrolment Alternative!” This noted that ISME had partnered with Kota to offer an “easier” alternative to members, setting out some of the advantages of an occupational scheme versus My Future Fund. In one of its publications, Kota noted that “contributions are mandatory at 1.5 per cent of salary, gradually rising to 6 per cent by 2035, regardless of business circumstances. This one-size-fits-all model leaves little scope to control costs, enhance the employee experience or align processes with company needs.” Pension experts argue that if avoidance tactics were in place, it was in the minority. “No scheme I’ve ever seen has a contribution rate of 1.5 or 2 per cent going into it,” says Gillick. “All the schemes that I’m involved in, the rates are far in excess of any minimum for auto-enrolment.” Following the Minister’s announcement, ISME has stated that it sees that “the overwhelming majority of SMEs are acting in good faith and complying fully with the rules as auto-enrolment is introduced”. Keith Dundon, head of financial services at SYS Financial, says businesses are doing what they can do to remain sustainable, but that he hasn’t seen “widespread token gestures” by employers to make them exempt from auto-enrolment. ISME said “employees retain the freedom to choose whether they prefer to contribute to a PRSA or to the My Future Fund”. However, this hasn’t always been the case. It’s understood that companies have been automatically enrolling employees into occupational pension schemes in the run-up to January – this can be done when employees sign up without making a contribution – which has led to Government concerns. While there might be data protection concerns with such an approach, the view is that it has been used as a vehicle to get employees into occupational schemes on lower contribution rates ahead of January. Once the schemes are established, minimum employer contribution rates – which have been cited as being as low as 0.5 per cent in some reports – will be brought up to typical levels. “In no way can I see companies getting employees to join a scheme with a low contribution rate to get around the auto-enrolment obligations,” says Gillick. [ Auto-enrolment looms for workforce that has little understanding of pensionsOpens in new window ] Now the State is set to clamp down on companies trying to limit employee contributions by opting for occupational schemes. According to Gillick, the Department of Social Protection intends to introduce minimum pension contribution regulations within weeks, taking effect from January 1st. From this date a new minimum total contribution rate of 3.5 per cent will apply. At least 1.5 per cent of this must come from the employer, with the remaining 2 per cent from the employer or employee. Another change is that employee consent will be required for enrolment into a pension scheme, given previous concerns. “The changes will have significant implications for certain arrangements, particularly noncontributory schemes and structures where employees receive reduced pension contributions,” says Gillick, adding that employers need to take “urgent action” now to ensure compliance ahead of the new year. Indeed, employers were previously told there would be no minimum level of contribution required for occupational schemes at least until 2031. And this “last-minute change” is coming at a time when companies are still trying to find out more about the auto-enrolment scheme. “There is a lot to be found out underneath the bonnet as to how it will fully work,” says Dundon, adding that the minimum contribution regime will complicate this. “On top of auto-enrolment being a challenge in terms of the information we’ve got, this will only cause another layer to it.” © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Twelve Irish restaurants where you’ll find particularly good value

This cosy city-centre spot has evolved beautifully over five years from brunch cafe to impressive modern Irish bistro. Seasonal, local produce from top Cork suppliers shines in confidently French-inspired cooking. Everything seems to come with an irresistible sauce, dip or side, such as cheesy cheese croquettes with date ketchup, or Anne’s brown bread with burnt onion butter. Bonus points for the natural-wine-focused wine list always having a big by-the-glass selection. AD The sizzle of dosa and steam of chai set the tone – southern Indian cooking that starts at breakfast and doesn’t stop. Mornings bring dosa, idli, vada and uttappam; by lunch it’s biryanis, thali platters, Gutti Vankaya curry, mutton fry and chicken Chettinadu. The Marlborough Street original now has siblings on Abbey Street and in Belfast, all serving the same deep menu built for repeat visits. Thalis stand out, with Gobi 65, gongura prawns and lamb Chettinadu showing their range. Read our review here. CH On the main street of this planned estate town, Bramley is an elegant and spacious venue serving casual lunch and upscale dinners. Chef Sam Moody brings extensive fine-dining experience to dishes such as a crispy chicken schnitzel Caesar salad, honey-glazed quail and wild Irish venison with spiced date puree. The supper menu available from Wednesday to Friday offers exceptional value, especially when matched with a glass from the well chosen wine list. JC Philip Yueng’s refined neighbourhood restaurant Craft is approaching its 10th birthday and the consensus is that it has never been better. His style of modern Irish food with subtle Asian influences has proven consistently popular with locals. The three-course lunch menu for €25 or evening time chef’s menu for €39 is certainly excellent value, but the a la carte is equally worth a browse. With the winter months drawing in, the return of the Sunday roast is very welcome. JC Few restaurants cook at this level for the money. Kevin and Shirley Stirzake’s €44 and €63 menus get you three courses and a sorbet, with dishes such as Falls goat’s cheese, Keem Bay smoked salmon, West Coast crab, scallops with pork belly, Hereford sirloin and rack of lamb. CH Raffaele Rasso now heads the kitchen at this Michelin Bib Gourmand neighbourhood restaurant, where the early evening menu (€35/€40, Wed-Fri, 5pm-6.30pm) is a bargain. Expect Silverhill duck leg croquettes with fried artichoke, broad bean hummus, chicken thigh with smoked cannellini beans, seabass with kombu gnocchi, and tonka bean panna cotta to finish. CH Usually, we’d slag someone off for having notions in Ireland, but not here. Instead, we’re delighted to see Two Pups cafe on Francis Street transformed after hours into a bistro-style evening restaurant. The casual sharing menu features star suppliers and current Irish menu favourites such as hispi cabbage, oysters, padron peppers and cod roe. Breads come from their own Bold Boy Bakery, and there’s a playful natural wine list. Read our review here. AD Nabbing a window seat here is always a treat, with harbour views over Dún Laoghaire. It’s a hotel restaurant, but it feels more like a buzzy local bistro, with an Italian-leaning menu of Lambay crab arancini, scallops in chicken butter sauce, wood-fired meats, seafood, and rich pastas (the pizzas quietly bowed out this summer). The wine list leans Italian too, with plenty offered by the glass or carafe. AD Rúibín is that rare kind of place where you feel at home from the minute you walk in the door. Maybe it’s the beautiful stone building with even more exposed stone inside. Or maybe it’s the excellent cocktails. Open for lunch, dinner and bar food, Rúibín’s style is contemporary and delicious. Try trout crudo with buttermilk, dill and apple, muscovado-brined pork chop or monkfish fillet with sobrassada butter. JC It’s all go at Conor Halpenny’s Square restaurant, which recently nearly doubled in capacity, while its partnership with local An Táin Arts Centre offers good value pre-theatre dining menus. A former Euro-Toque young chef of the year and current Georgina Campbell chef of the year, Halpenny blends classic techniques with modern trends to create dishes such as Square KFC or monkfish with pickled mussels. JC The combination of outstanding modern Irish dishes from chef Stephen McArdle and exceptional wines from his partner and sommelier Morgan VanderKamer is what makes Union wine bar and restaurant so special. Occupying a former pub, the front is cozy and perfect for a glass of wine while the dining room opens up to the rear. With more than 35 wines available by the glass and a tasty bar bites menu, the Déise is calling. JC Blackrock residents are spoilt to have this as their local spot. Chef Barry Sun’s modern European cooking with Asian influences (there is usually a delicious dumpling on offer) shows up as colourful plates of food full of texture. There’s great value in their €38 neighbourhood four-course menu on Wednesdays and Thursdays and three-course lunch menu on Fridays and Saturdays. Seasonal aperitifs and an interesting wine list make it all the more special. AD © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ethereum ICO wallet moves $120M after a decade, throws it into staking

Fears tend to mount whenever an OG crypto whale starts shifting funds, but this one used it to double down on the blockchain network. Another Ethereum whale has just woken from dormancy after a decade of silence — but rather than sell, the whale has deployed its entire stash into staking. The Ether (ETH) wallet holds 40,000 tokens, which the holder paid around $12,000 for during Ethereum’s genesis block launch in July 2015, according to blockchain data platform Lookonchain. It is now worth $120 million. However, rather than move the funds to a cryptocurrency exchange deposit address, the ICO-era whale has instead staked their entire ETH holding, suggesting the whale is doubling down on their conviction in Ethereum. There has been considerable chatter over the last month about large crypto whales selling, with some analysts attributing recent crypto price fluctuations to their actions. Another OG wallet, which stacked 254,908 tokens during the Ether ICO, started selling their holdings on Nov. 26. In an initial sale, the whale sold 20,000 Ether, then steadily chipped away until they had just $9.3 million in Ether left as of Saturday. At the same time, another OG who had accumulated 154,076 Ether, starting in 2017, sent 18,000 tokens to the web-based crypto exchange Bitstamp. Previously, the whale had sold off 87,824 Ether at an average price of $1,694. Related: CME rekindles ETH ‘super-cycle’ debate as Ether futures volume tops Bitcoin A larger Ether ICO wallet that woke up after eight years in September also opted to stake some of their stash. The whale snapped up 1 million tokens during Ethereum’s genesis and moved 150,000 Ether to a new wallet for staking. While some OG Ether whales might be selling, the top addresses are still accumulating. Last Wednesday, the supply of Ether held by the top 1% addresses rose to 97.6%, up from a year ago, when they only had 96.1%, according to blockchain data platform Glassnode. The Eth2 Beacon Deposit Contract holds the most Ether at 72.4 million, which is worth around $203 billion and represents around 60% of the total supply, according to blockchain intelligence platform Arkham. Crypto exchange Binance holds the second-largest amount, with 4 million, and asset manager BlackRock makes up the rest of the top three, with 3.9 million Ether in its stash.

Title: Vanguard’s 50M+ clients will soon have access to crypto ETFs

Vanguard CEO Salim Ramji ruled out crypto ETFs on its platform in August, but consistent demand for crypto has seemingly changed his firm’s tune. Vanguard, the second-largest asset manager in the world, is set to allow its clients to start trading crypto exchange-traded funds and mutual funds on its platform starting Tuesday, reversing its previous stance on digital asset ETFs. Spurred by persistent retail and institutional demand, Vanguard will permit third-party access to crypto ETFs and mutual funds similar to how the firm treats gold, a Vanguard spokesperson confirmed to Cointelegraph in a statement. Bloomberg reported that only ETFs that meet regulatory standards will be included, such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and Solana (SOL)-related ETFs. The investment manager told Cointelegraph it has ruled out memecoins as well as creating its own crypto ETFs and mutual funds. “We serve millions of investors who have diverse needs and risk profiles, and we aim to provide a brokerage trading platform that gives our brokerage clients the ability to invest in products they choose,” the Vanguard spokesperson said. Vanguard is second only to BlackRock as an asset manager, with over $11 trillion in global assets under management as of January, according to the company’s latest report. Vanguard was previously against offering crypto ETFs on its platform, citing volatility and the speculative nature of the assets. Its former CEO, Tim Buckley, was also strongly opposed, saying in a May 2024 video that the company doesn’t “believe it belongs, like a Bitcoin ETF belongs in a long-term portfolio of someone saving for their retirement. It’s a speculative asset.” Buckley announced he was stepping down as CEO in February 2024 and retired at the end of that year. Salim Ramji, the former head of BlackRock’s global ETF business, who succeeded Buckley as CEO of Vanguard, had also ruled out offering crypto-related investment products as recently as August. Related: Vanguard users threaten to close accounts after firm blocks spot Bitcoin ETFs Some X users speculate that Vanguard’s policy shift could open the floodgates to new investors and spike crypto prices. Crypto analyst and investor Nilesh Rohilla said he would be surprised if Bitcoin doesn’t jump “5% in this news in the next 24 hrs.” X user BankXRP said it “is another massive signal that traditional finance is fully stepping into digital assets. The wall of money is lining up.” Meanwhile, Vivek Sen, the founder of Bitcoin public relations firm Bitgrow Lab, also predicted there are “trillions incoming.” Magazine: Animoca’s bet on altcoin upside, analyst eyes $100K Bitcoin: Hodler’s Digest, Nov. 23 – 29 Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Written & Edited byMohammad Shahid Vanguard, the $8 trillion US asset manager, will allow crypto-focused ETFs and mutual funds to trade on its platform from December 2, ending its long-standing refusal to support digital asset products. The decision marks a major shift for the world’s second-largest asset manager and opens regulated crypto access to more than 50 million brokerage customers. The firm confirmed it will support products that hold Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, Solana, and other regulated cryptocurrencies. However, it will continue to block funds tied to meme coins and will not launch its own digital asset products. Starting tmrw vanguard will allow ETFs and MFs tracking bitcoin and select other cryptos to begin trading on their platform. They cite how the ETfs have been tested performed as designed through multiple periods of volatility. Story via @emily_graffeo pic.twitter.com/AKhMdR7pab Vanguard spent years resisting crypto exposure and repeatedly framed Bitcoin and other digital assets as speculative. The company rejected spot Bitcoin ETFs after their January 2024 debut and even restricted customer purchases of competing funds. For years, Vanguard executives argued that crypto lacked intrinsic value, produced no cash flows, and did not fit long-term retirement strategies. However, persistent demand pressured the firm to rethink its stance. Bitcoin ETFs became one of the fastest-growing product categories in US fund history, with BlackRock’s IBIT alone gathering tens of billions in assets. This scale, combined with a steady shift in investor preferences, weakened the rationale for exclusion. Vanguard 2024: “#Bitcoin isn’t a store of value. We’ll never offer ETFs.”Vanguard 2025: “Bitcoin trading starts tomorrow.” pic.twitter.com/dBysvngja7 The policy shift follows more than a year of internal debate. Vanguard’s former CEO, Tim Buckley, was widely seen as the main opponent of crypto adoption. His departure and the appointment of Salim Ramji — a former BlackRock executive with experience in blockchain initiatives — signaled a potential pivot. Ramji did not push the firm toward issuing its own crypto funds but supported granting customers access to regulated products. That move aligns crypto with Vanguard’s treatment of other non-core assets, such as gold ETFs. The reversal comes during a deep crypto drawdown and heavy ETF outflows since early October. Bitcoin’s market value has fallen sharply, and leveraged positions have suffered heavy losses. Yet Vanguard said digital asset ETFs have continued to operate smoothly and maintain liquidity through volatile periods. The firm noted that operational processes for servicing crypto products have matured since 2024. It added that its clients increasingly expect access to a wide range of asset classes through a single brokerage platform.

The company will still screen products for compliance and will exclude any vehicle tied to SEC-defined memecoins. Vanguard stressed that it has no plans to build proprietary crypto offerings. Instead, it aims to accommodate diverse risk profiles while maintaining its conservative product philosophy. The move is likely to strengthen digital asset legitimacy across traditional finance. It also marks a symbolic turning point for a firm long considered crypto’s most persistent holdout.

Beginning Tuesday, the firm will permit trading in funds that hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, putting crypto exposure on the same footing as other non-core assets it already accommodates, such as gold, Bloomberg reported. The change gives more than 50 million brokerage customers access to regulated crypto wrappers across the U.S. fund industry. The pivot follows months of internal review and comes as client interest in digital assets has persisted through a sharp market pullback. Eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs that debuted in early 2024 pulled in heavy inflows, lifting their combined assets to about $25 billion within the first month. Vanguard’s refusal to offer access left the firm on the sidelines as those assets swelled to roughly $125 billion in under two years. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, the largest of the group, now holds about $70 billion, down from a peak near $99.5 billion, SoSovalue data shows. While crypto represents one of the smallest fractions of BlackRock’s $13.5 trillion in assets under management globally, Vanguard—the world’s second-largest asset manager—manages roughly $11 trillion. In July 2024, iShares veteran Salim Ramji took over as Vanguard CEO. Unlike both his predecessor, Tim Buckley, and the company at large, Ramij is a public supporter of both Bitcoin and blockchain. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, it was the “first time ever” that Vanguard has hired externally for its top job, with the analyst tweeting earlier this year that he was “semi-shocked” by the move. Ramij had worked for Vanguard’s biggest competitor, serving as head of iShares and index investments at BlackRock. Notably, Ramij oversaw the filing and logistics for IBIT.

Title: World’s Second Largest Asset Manager Vanguard Opens Its Platform to Bitcoin and Crypto ETFs: Bloomberg

Skip to comments. Posted on 12/01/2025 2:15:56 PM PST by NoLibZone Vanguard is going to allow bitcoin and crypto-linked exchange-traded funds and mutual funds to trade on its platform. Vanguard Group will allow bitcoin and crypto-linked exchange-traded funds and mutual funds to trade on its platform, reversing a policy that for years barred retail clients from accessing digital-asset products through the firm. Starting Tuesday, Vanguard brokerage customers will be able to trade ETFs and mutual funds that primarily hold select cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and other crypto, according to Bloomberg reporting. The move marks a shift for the world’s second-largest asset manager, which has long argued that digital assets were too volatile and speculative for long-term portfolios. The decision follows growing demand from both retail and institutional investors and comes after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 ushered billions of dollars into regulated crypto products. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, the largest of those funds, peaked near $100 billion in assets earlier this fall and still manages about $70 billion despite recent price declines. A Bitcoin ETF lets investors gain exposure to Bitcoin without actually buying or storing the cryptocurrency themselves. Instead, the fund holds Bitcoin (or Bitcoin-related contracts) while investors simply buy shares on a stock exchange, with the share price moving alongside Bitcoin’s market value. It’s a convenient and easy way to get invested in Bitcoin.

Title: Vanguard Opens Platform to Crypto ETFs in Major Shift: Bloomberg
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/12/01/vanguard-opens-platform-to-crypto-etfs-in-major-shift-bloomberg
Time Published: 2025-12-01T22:08:44Z

Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers with roughly $11 trillion in assets under management, will begin allowing customers to trade cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds on its brokerage platform starting Tuesday, according to Bloomberg. "Cryptocurrency ETFs and mutual funds have been tested through periods of market volatility, performing as designed while maintaining liquidity," Andrew Kadjeski, Vanguard's head of brokerage and investments, told Bloomberg. "The administrative processes to service these types of funds have matured; and investor preferences continue to evolve." Vanguard said it will support most crypto ETFs and mutual funds that meet regulatory standards, similar to how it treats gold and other niche asset classes, the story said. Funds tied to memecoins or unsupported by the SEC will remain barred. The firm added that it has no current plans to launch its own crypto products, according to the report. The move gives Vanguard's 50 million clients access to regulated crypto funds like those from rival asset manager BlackRock. Crypto ETFs have become a key gateway for U.S. investors to gain exposure to digital assets. Spot bitcoin BTC$92,710.65 ETFs mushroomed to almost $120 billion in assets under management since the January 2024 debut, while ether ETH$3,117.69 vehicles swelled to nearly $20 billion, SoSoValue data shows.

Title: Goldman Sachs buys Innovator for $2B, adding a Bitcoin-linked ETF to lineup
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldman-sachs-buys-innovator-2b-bitcoin-etf
Time Published: 2025-12-01T18:57:06Z
Full Content:
The acquisition expands Goldman’s defined-outcome ETF business and moves the bank deeper into crypto-linked investment products. Goldman Sachs agreed to acquire Innovator Capital Management for about $2 billion, bringing the issuer of defined-outcome exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including a Bitcoin structured fund, under its asset management umbrella. The transaction, slated to close in the second quarter of 2026, will bring about $28 billion in additional assets under supervision to Goldman Sachs’ Asset Management, which reported $3.45 trillion in assets under supervision (AUS) at the end of the third quarter. Goldman said the purchase will broaden its plans for active and defined-outcome ETFs, a fund that uses options to limit losses and set how much of an asset’s gains investors can capture over a fixed period. Launched in February, Innovator’s QBF ETF uses FLEX options referencing Bitcoin ETFs or the Cboe Bitcoin US ETF Index to mirror part of Bitcoin’s gains while capping quarterly losses at 20%. Its current 71% participation rate means the fund is designed to capture 71% of any positive Bitcoin (BTC) price move over that period. As of Friday, Innovator reported that QBF held about $19.3 million in market value. Related: BlackRock exec says ‘perfectly normal’ as IBIT sees $2.3B outflows in Nov After dismissing cryptocurrencies as unsuitable for client portfolios in 2020, Goldman Sachs has become increasingly bullish on crypto and blockchain technology. From 2020 to 2024, the US investment bank took part in 18 investments in blockchain companies, placing it among the most active global backers of early-stage companies in the sector. In the second quarter of 2024, it bought about $419 million worth of Bitcoin ETF shares, according to CoinShares’ analysis of quarterly 13F filings. In the last quarter of 2024, SEC filings showed Goldman bought almost $1.28 billion of iShares Bitcoin Trust and $288 million of Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund. The bank also boosted its Ethereum ETF exposure that quarter to $476 million through BlackRock and Fidelity’s Ether (ETH) products. The bank has reportedly been working on creating a new entity designed to issue and trade tokenized financial instruments. In July, Cointelegraph reported that Goldman Sachs was preparing to let institutional clients access tokenized money market funds with 24/7 settlement and blockchain-based ownership tracking.

Title: Tokenization may be quietly entering its pre-boom internet phase: BlackRock CEO

Share this article Could tokenization spark a boom like the internet did in the 1990s? BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Rob Goldstein seem to think so. “If history is any guide, tokenization today is roughly where the internet was in 1996—when Amazon had sold just $16m-worth of books, and three of the rest of today’s “Magnificent Seven” tech giants hadn’t even been founded,” the BlackRock duo noted in a guest column for The Economist. “Tokenization could advance at the pace of the internet—faster than most expect, with enormous growth over the coming decades.” Tokenization, which allows ownership of assets to be tracked on digital ledgers, has emerged from the shadow of crypto speculation and is increasingly seen for its practical potential, according to Fink and Goldstein. They expect it to dramatically speed up and secure asset transactions, broaden market access, and encourage collaboration between traditional finance and digital-first innovators. The investment leaders stress that careful regulation, clear safeguards, and interoperability with existing systems will be essential to ensure tokenization grows safely and builds trust among investors. BlackRock has strategically focused on asset tokenization, which its CEO, Fink, has called the “next generation of markets” and a central pillar of the firm’s long-term growth. In March 2024, the leading asset management firm debuted its tokenized money market fund, commonly known as the BUIDL fund, which aims to provide institutional investors access to US dollar yields on-chain through blockchain technology. The fund, available on multiple blockchain platforms, has surpassed $2.3 billion in assets under management, according to data from RWA.xyz. Despite an 18% drop in asset value in the last 30 days, it still dominates US tokenized financial products. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?
