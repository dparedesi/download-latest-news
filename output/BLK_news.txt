Title: AIL Division 1A round-up: Clontarf hold off Terenure revival to secure nervy win

Clontarf moved above Terenure into second place in Division 1A with an entertaining, hard-earned and ultimately nervy 29-24 win in the ‘Jordan Coghlan Derby’ at Castle Avenue on Saturday. Due to the recent rain, this repeat of the 2022 and 2023 finals was moved to the all-weather pitch and was a better spectacle as a result. Dylan Donnelan opened the scoring from a trademark ‘Tarf power play and after an impudent grubber and finish by Chris Cosgrave, James Ryan’s brother, Mark, restored the lead on his debut. After a well-taken try by Terenure’s Connacht centre John Devine, Tarf halfbacks Sam Owens and Conor Kelly put Alex O’Grady over in the corner, Kelly adding a penalty for a 22-12 interval lead. Two big scrums led to Donnellan finished superbly for his seventh try this season and 83rd in less than four and a half campaigns. But Terenure, helped by the interval arrival of outhalf Caspar Gabriel – one of four Leinster travelling reserves released to their clubs – responded with tries by Harrison Brewer and winger Pa Ryan. And after Kelly’s penalty hit the upright, ‘Tarf had to snuff out one final sustained attack by ‘Nure. “It was a good contest, two good sides going at it,” said Clontarf’s coach Andy Wood. “I’m happy out to be honest. Any time you play Terenure and come away with a win it’s a good result. They play with a lot of ambition and it’s great to watch.” Terenure earned two bonus points and coach Carlos Spencer said: “We let in a couple of soft tries in the first half but we were still in the fight. Our set-piece was poor and our discipline probably cost us in the second half. We still gave ourselves an opportunity at the end but we couldn’t execute.” Lansdowne are a point further back in fourth after opening up a five-point gap on Ballynahinch with an 18-10 win at home. First-half tries by number eight Hardus van Eeden and scrumhalf Jack Matthews, to one by Aaron Sexton, had them 12-7 ahead at the break and two penalties by James Tarrant in a tryless second half sealed the win. Young Munster roared into a 26-17 lead 55 minutes into a fluctuating Munster derby at home to Cork Con after tries by Bailey Faloon and a third of the game by winger Hubert Gilvarry. But Con capitalised upon the binning of David Begley with tries by Aidan Moynihan and in-form centre Eoghan Smyth, before two late turnovers by Jack Kelleher completed an entertaining 29-26 win which arrested a run of three defeats. St Mary’s remained top with a 49-15 win at home to Nenagh, winger Aaron O’Sullivan and Myles Carey each scoring twice and Mick O’Gara converting all seven tries, while Old Belvedere climbed two places to seventh with a 36-12 win at home to UCD. Old Wesley stayed top in Division 1B with a 21-17 win at Highfield, while MU Barnhall and Galwegians maintained their unbeaten records atop 2A and 2B with 41-20 and 41-24 home wins over Ballymena and Enniscorthy respectively. Connacht winger Finn Treacy, playing at outside centre, scored three of ‘Wegians six tries, and inside centre Rob Deacy scored two.

Title: Hutchinson on fire as Ballygunner regain Munster throne

RTÉ Sport contributor Ballygunner (Waterford) 0-21 Éire Óg Inis (Clare) 1-09 Ballygunner went clear atop the Munster hurling roll of honour after a damp-squib nine-point victory over Éire Óg Inis in front of 3,065 fans at Semple Stadium. The Waterford kingpins' sixth title pushes them one clear of Blackrock, while providing a fifth medal in seven seasons for many of their players. Dessie Hutchinson put in a man-of-the-match performance with 0-07 from play as the Gunners cruised to an All-Ireland semi-final against either Ballyhale Shamrocks or St Martin’s. Éire Óg got off to a decent start to lead 0-03 to 0-02 after eight minutes. Danny Russell picked off a couple of frees either side of Darren Moroney’s drop-shot point. That would prove their only score from play of the half. Darragh Stack saved from Kevin Mahony to maintain that lead a few moments longer. But it would be overwhelmed as the Gunners reeled off 10 of the final 11 points in the run-in to half-time. Philip Mahony mopped up everything Éire Óg hit long, and when the Clare champions tried to run the ball out, they got turned over. Hutchinson quickly emerged as the dominant figure as he floated in and out of the right corner-forward berth. His first point arrived in the fifth minute. His next pair, created by Michael Mahony, sparked a six-point surge, which included another from the stutter-stepping Déise captain. Patrick Fitzgerald scored a brilliant pair to complete the set. His dummy shot left Aaron Fitzgerald for dust for the first before nailing an outrageous second from the New Stand sideline. After a Russell free, the Gunners tagged on four more through Pauric Mahony (free), Peter Hogan, Conor Sheahan, and Hutchinson. They led 0-12 to 0-04 at half-time. That gap grew to 10 with points from Patrick Fitzgerald and a Pauric Mahony free. Éire Óg offered one last kick with three points in a row. Oran Cahill landed the first before Shane O’Donnell won back-to-back frees for Russell. They wouldn’t add another point beyond the 43rd minute as the Gunners reeled off four in a row, including a pair from the pacy Hutchinson. Éire Óg went goal hunting and they eventually found one on the hour. O’Donnell was pulled back by Ian Kenny for a penalty, which Russell dispatched. The 2024 Hurler of the Year O'Donnell led their resistance, being fouled for 1-04 plus two more frees which were dropped in. Russell ended with 1-06 all from placed balls.

Title: Bitcoin’s bull market: A slowdown, not a breakdown

ETF flows, stablecoins, and leverage have all cooled at once, forcing Bitcoin to run without its usual turbo boost. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s big buyers seem to have stepped off the gas. For the better part of the last year or so, it felt like there was a constant tailwind behind Bitcoin’s price. ETFs vacuumed up coins, stablecoin balances kept climbing, and traders were willing to go to insane levels of leverage to bet on more upside. NYDIG called these the “demand engines” of the cycle in its latest report. The company argued that several of those engines have reversed course: ETFs are seeing net outflows, the stablecoin base has stalled, and futures markets look cautious. That sounds rather ominous if you only read the headline. Unfortunately, as always, the truth is always somewhere in the middle. We will walk through each of those engines, keep the focus on dollars in and out, and end with the practical question everyone cares about: if the big machines are really slowing, does it break the bull market or slow it down? The simplest engine to understand is the ETF pipe. Since their launch in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US have brought in tens of billions of dollars in net inflows. That money came from advisers, hedge funds, family offices, and retail investors who chose a brokerage ticker as their preferred method of Bitcoin exposure. The crucial detail is that they were net buyers almost every week for most of the year. But that pattern broke over the past month. On several days in November, the ETF complex logged heavy redemptions, including some of the largest outflows since launch. A few of the funds that had been reliable buyers (think BlackRock) flipped to net sellers. For anyone looking at a single day of data, it sure could have felt like the entire ETF market blew up. The longer view is, of course, less dramatic but important nevertheless. Cumulative flows are still deeply positive, and all funds still hold a huge pool of Bitcoin. What changed is the direction of marginal money: instead of new cash flowing steadily in, some investors are taking profits, cutting exposure or moving into other trades. That means spot price no longer has a constant mechanical buyer sitting underneath it. A lot of that behavior is tied to how investors now hedge and manage risk. Once regulators allowed much higher position limits on ETF options (from 25,000 to 250,000 contracts), institutions could run covered-call strategies and other overlays on top of their ETF holdings. That gave them more ways to adjust risk without dumping shares, but also drained some of the pure “buy and hold at any price” energy. When price surged toward the top, some investors capped their upside for income. When price rolled over, others used the same options market to hedge instead of adding more spot. The second engine sits in stablecoins. If ETFs are the Wall Street-friendly funnel into Bitcoin, stablecoins are the crypto-native cash pile that lives inside the system. When USDT, USDC, and peers grow, it usually means more fresh dollars are arriving or at least being parked on exchanges ready to deploy. For much of the last year, Bitcoin’s big legs higher lined up with a growing stablecoin base. That pattern is wobbling, as the total stablecoin supply has stopped growing and even shrunk a little in the past month. Different trackers disagree on the exact amount, but the drop is clear enough. Some of that can be put down to simple risk reduction: traders pulling money out of exchanges, funds rotating into Treasuries, and smaller tokens losing market share. But some of it is real withdrawal of capital from the market. The takeaway here is straightforward: the pool of digital dollars that can chase Bitcoin higher is no longer expanding. That doesn’t automatically push price down, but it does mean every rally has to be funded out of a more or less fixed pot. There’s less “new money” sloshing around on exchanges that can instantly flood into BTC when sentiment turns. The third engine lives in derivatives. Funding rates on perpetual futures are a fee that traders pay to keep those contracts in line with spot price. When funding is strongly positive, it usually means many traders are long with leverage and are paying to stay that way. When funding goes negative, shorts are paying longs and the market is skewed toward bets on downside. The “basis” on regulated futures like CME is simply the gap between futures and spot. A big positive basis usually shows strong demand to be long with leverage. NYDIG points out that both of these gauges have cooled. Funding on offshore perpetuals has flipped negative at times. CME futures premia have compressed. Open interest is lower than it was at the peak. This tells us a lot of leveraged longs were washed out in the recent drawdown and haven’t rushed back. Traders are more cautious, and in some pockets they’re now willing to pay for downside protection instead of upside exposure. This matters for two reasons. First, leveraged buyers are often the marginal force that takes a move from a healthy uptrend to a vertical blow-off. If they’re nursing losses or sitting on the sidelines, moves tend to be slower, choppier and significantly less fun for anyone hoping for instant all-time highs. Second, when leverage builds in one direction, it can amplify both gains and crashes. A market with less leverage can still move a lot, but it’s less prone to sudden air pockets triggered by liquidations. So if ETFs are leaking, stablecoins are flat, and derivatives traders are cautious, who’s on the other side of this selloff? Here is where the picture becomes more subtle. On-chain data and exchange metrics suggest that some long-term holders have used the recent volatility to take profits. Coins that sat dormant for long periods have started to move again. At the same time, there are signs that newer wallets and smaller buyers are quietly accumulating. Some address clusters that rarely spend have also added to their balances. And some retail flows on large exchanges still lean toward net buying on the worst days. That is the core of NYDIG’s “reversal, not doom” framing. The most visible, headline-friendly demand engines have shifted into reverse just as price cooled. Underneath that, there’s still a slow transfer from older, richer cohorts to newer ones. The flow of this money is choppier and less mechanical than the ETF boom period, which makes the market feel harsher for anyone who arrived late. But it isn’t the same thing as capital vanishing altogether. First, the easy mode is more or less gone for now. For much of the year, ETF inflows and growing stablecoin balances acted like a one-way escalator. You didn’t need to know much about futures funding or options limits to understand why price kept grinding higher, because new money kept arriving. That background bid has faded and, in some weeks, flipped into net selling, making drawdowns feel heavier and rallies harder to sustain. Second, a slowdown in demand engines does’t automatically kill a cycle. Bitcoin’s long-run case still revolves around fixed supply, growing institutional rails and a steady expansion of places where it can sit on balance sheets, and those structures are still in place. What changes is the path between here and the next high. Instead of a straight line driven by one giant narrative, the market will start trading more on positioning and pockets of liquidity. ETF flows may swing between red and green, stablecoins may bounce around a plateau instead of sprinting higher, and derivatives markets may spend more time in neutral. That kind of environment rewards patience more than bravado. Finally, if you zoom out, reversals in the demand engines are part of how every cycle breathes. Heavy inflows set the stage for overextension, but then outflows and cooling leverage force a reset. New buyers arrive at lower prices, usually quieter and with less fanfare. NYDIG’s argument is that Bitcoin is somewhere in that reset phase, and the data supports that view. The engines that drove the first leg of the bull run are running slower, some in reverse, but it doesn’t mean the machine is broken. It means the next leg will depend less on automatic pipes and more on whether investors still want to own this thing once the easy part has passed.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Are Now BlackRock’s Biggest Revenue Drivers, Surpassing Older ETFs

BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become the asset manager’s top revenue source, according to Cristiano Castro, the director of business development at BlackRock Brazil, surpassing products that have been generating revenue for over two decades. This is a huge feat for BTC, given the company manages more than 1,400 exchange-traded funds globally and is the world’s largest asset manager with over $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Speaking at the Blockchain Conference 2025 in São Paulo, Castro called their growth “a big surprise” and said that allocations in BlackRock’s Bitcoin funds, including the U.S.-based iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Brazil’s IBIT39, had surged to $100 billion this year. IBIT, which began trading in January of last year alongside roughly a dozen Bitcoin ETFs, currently has around $70.73 billion in assets under management, according to data source SoSoValue, making it by far the most popular exchange-traded fund to track the BTC price. “When we launched, we were optimistic,” Castro said, “but we didn’t expect this scale.” IBIT’s net inflows surpassed $52 billion in its first year, far outshining all other ETFs that debuted over the past decade. The Bitcoin fund is also estimated to have generated approximately $245 million in annual fees by October 2025. A wave of institutional demand following the U.S. regulatory approval of spot BTC funds has largely driven IBIT’s strong growth. BlackRock now owns around 3.9% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply. Castro’s remarks come on the heels of a rollercoaster month for BlackRock’s US-listed IBIT, which witnessed a staggering $2.34 billion in withdrawals this November. The biggest capital exits occurred mid-month, with the fund shedding approximately $463 million on Nov. 14 and around $523 million exiting on Nov. 18 — extending their outflow streak. According to Castro, such brutal outflows are expected given how retail investors react to price drawdowns. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments,” Castro reportedly told local media at the Blockchain Conference. “They exist to let people allocate capital and manage cash flow. What we’ve been seeing is perfectly normal; any asset that starts to experience compression usually has this effect, especially in an instrument that is heavily controlled by retail investors.” Bitcoin has retreated sharply from its October $126,080 all-time high, trading around $91,331 at press time and testing the conviction of newer ETF entrants who purchased near the highs.

Title: Ethereum Leverage Reset Complete – Time For Market Re-Accumulation?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum presently trades around $3,000 following a broader crypto market rebound in the last week. During this time, the market’s largest altcoin gained by 7.22%, providing a much-needed relief after an extended correction that dominated the majority of the last two months. As price stabilizes, crypto analytics platform XWIN Research Japan shares a forward-looking assessment of Ethereum’s outlook, especially considering developments in the futures market. Amid the widespread correction of the crypto market in Q4 2025, Ethereum’s prices crashed from $4,700 to as low as $2,900, representing a 38% price decline. XWIN Research Japan reports this price fall coincided with certain relevant developments in the futures market. In particular, Ethereum’s open interest across all exchanges dropped from $21 billion to around $17 billion in late November, as overleveraged long positions were closed down, forcing traders to open new positions with moderate leverage size. Meanwhile, funding rates stayed positive but declined to around 0.002, meaning that the dominant bullish sentiment from mid-2025 greatly reduced. Looking at on-chain data, the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) is at 1.27, while Binance data shows it to be around 1.0, both values indicating Ethereum is in a neutral to fair value zone, suggesting a period of stability before the next major trend emerges. Meanwhile, the recent market recovery kick-started after ETH retested the realized price of whale addresses, indicating that large market players are bolstering their holdings. XWIN Research Japan supports this theory, noting that Ethereum Treasury BitMine has boosted its market holdings to 3.63 million ETH. Additionally, a BlackRock client recently acquired tens of millions of dollars’ worth of ETH, further reinforcing the strength of current market demand. However, despite this robust market demand, ETH Spot ETF net outflows for November hit $1.42 billion, indicating there is significant selling pressure in the market. At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,003, reflecting a 0.22% loss in the past day. Despite its gains in the last week, the altcoin is still down by 22.34% over the last month, suggesting the majority of short-term holders are in losses. XWIN Research Japan explains that although the overleveraged position has been cleared out with market whales now ramping up their holding, Ethereum remains in a “bottom-building phase”. Therefore, investors should still anticipate a “choppy, sell-on-rally” price action in the short term. The analysts predict a major trend reversal with time as the current price area becomes increasingly attractive to investors for massive accumulation opportunities.

BlackRock says $2.34 billion in November outflows from IBIT are normal as demand once pushed the ETF near $100 billion. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) closed November under pressure after experiencing heavy withdrawals, but the asset manager remains confident in its long-term outlook for the product. Speaking in São Paulo, BlackRock business development director Cristiano Castro said the company’s Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs had become one of its biggest revenue drivers, calling their growth “a big surprise” given how fast allocations surged this year. Castro’s comments followed a rough month for BlackRock’s US-listed IBIT, which logged an estimated $2.34 billion in net outflows across November. The two largest withdrawals came mid-month, with about $523 million leaving on Nov. 18 and roughly $463 million on Nov. 14. “ETFs are very liquid and powerful instruments,” Castro reportedly said after his panel at the Blockchain Conference 2025. “They exist to let people allocate capital and manage cash flow. What we’ve been seeing is perfectly normal; any asset that starts to experience compression usually has this effect, especially in an instrument that is heavily controlled by retail investors.” Related: Different types of ETFs, explained - Cointelegraph Castro added that demand earlier in the cycle speaks for itself. Combined US and Brazil listings under the IBIT nameplate came “very close to $100 billion” in assets at their peak, he said. As Cointelegraph reported, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF holders returned to profit after Bitcoin climbed back above $90,000 on Thursday. Investors in BlackRock’s IBIT now sit on a cumulative gain of about $3.2 billion, reversing the losses seen during Bitcoin’s recent pullback. IBIT and BlackRock’s Ether ETF holders were up nearly $40 billion at their peak in early October before profits collapsed to just $630 million last week, meaning most positions were close to break-even until the latest rebound. Related: Why XRP ETF proposals are increasing and what is keeping other issuers on the sidelines Spot Bitcoin ETFs ended four weeks of heavy withdrawals with a $70 million weekly inflow, reversing part of the $4.35 billion that left the sector during November. Spot Ether (ETH) ETFs also rebounded, logging $312.6 million in weekly inflows after losing $1.74 billion over the previous three weeks.

Title: Overheard: ‘Gary took no prisoners’: man who egged bankers during depths of crash dies

Some people just capture the spirit of the age. Gary Keogh, the AIB shareholder who pelted the bank’s higher-ups with eggs in 2009 as all about him lost their heads, was one of them. He died last week. “I feel happier about the whole thing than I have done for months,” Keogh told The Irish Times in May 2009, in the immediate aftermath of the incident. He had lost €18,000 on his investment in AIB during the course of the crash and, at the age of 65, decided to make his displeasure known. He showed up to the emergency general meeting of the stressed bank and, amid very heated exchanges, targeted the then chief executive Eugene Sheehy and chairman Dermot Gleeson. Sheehy emerged clean, but Gleeson’s suit “sustained a direct eggy hit”, according to contemporary reporting. The bank was outlining a €3.5 billion government bailout at a time when shares had dropped from highs of €23.95 a share to 87 cent on the day – and had further to go before hitting rock bottom. A lot of people, including many at or near retirement age, lost a lot of money. Keogh, a former retail worker, had been buoyed by a kidney transplant, which freed him from dialysis and left him ready for action. “I think I got Che Guevara’s kidney,” he said. [ From the archive: Shareholder who threw eggs 'feels happier'Opens in new window ] It was a splatter heard around the world. International outlets such as the BBC and The Guardian included the colour amid global tales of financial woe, as an example of the reality beneath the eye-watering debt numbers. “Gary took no prisoners,” his wife Thelma told Overheard this week. Equipped with a dry sense of humour and a strong sense of fairness, the egg incident was absolutely within character. “That’s why he did it – because of the unfairness of it. He was a principled person. He didn’t want to see people being deceived.” Memories of the crash have slowly faded, but Gary’s legend lived on in Blackrock, south Dublin, where he was from, and where the egging was “one of the first things mentioned” at his funeral. The bankers and the national media found out about the plan before Thelma. “He didn’t even tell me. I knew nothing about these eggs, they were sitting in the garage for about a month. He had them in his pocket,” she said. “Afterwards he told me: ‘Turn on the radio.’ That’s how I found out.” After the incident, he told The Irish Times it was “the first” but wouldn’t be the last. True to his word, he took his protest to Bank of Ireland in 2011, firing at Pat Molloy and Richie Boucher – though on that occasion, he missed. Not every prominent Irish person abroad is necessarily as famous in their host country as they are at home – Ryan Tubridy and Evan Ferguson are good examples – but designer Paul Costelloe certainly made his mark. The Dubliner was a household name in certain British households because of his association with Princess Diana, whom he dressed on several occasions. The Times of London dutifully provided an obituary for him with in the right royal register reserved on Fleet Street for matters Windsor. [ Easygoing but disciplined - descriptions of Paul Costelloe’s clothes also applied to the manOpens in new window ] “The tenor sang, the heavens opened and Princess Diana was soaked, her blonde hair streaming down both sides of her face,” the piece began, going on to note some of the most chic Costelloe clobber in her archive. Some other details were fuzzier, however. At one point, Costelloe was described as “6ft, only a couple of inches taller than his royal client”, while later he was referred to as spending much of his time in “Monkstown, in southeast Dublin, where he could often be found sketching and doodling at Kehoe’s pub”. The Times, mostly hidden behind the paywall, still allows readers to comment online, and they rushed to make corrections. Gavin Costelloe, Paul’s son, commented: “Paul was 6’ 4”. Not 6’.” That would make him half a foot taller than the former Lady Spencer. Another commenter also weighed in: “ ... and Kehoe’s is not in Monkstown!” The pub, one of Dublin’s most storied, is of course on South Anne Street, metres from Grafton Street. Best wishes to the Parma farmers as Parmigiano Reggiano, the grateable hard cheese, signs up to a Hollywood agent with hopes of becoming a superstar. Europe’s favourite umami dust will go to work for the United Talent Agency, which reps the likes of Angelina Jolie, Channing Tatum and Mariah Carey. The plan is product placement, in order to “introduce Parmigiano Reggiano to a wide pool of partners, to further its message of gastronomical excellence”. Overheard, still chewing a lump of Durrus as we found this out, wondered why Irish cheeses aren’t out there furthering their own message of gastronomical excellence in superhero movies and so on. We asked Cáis, the Association of Irish Farmhouse Cheesemakers. “Most makers are small, family-run businesses focused on local markets,” said Eimear Cuddy, secretary of Cáis. “Many don’t export at all, so the logistics, cost and time involved in pursuing international product placement would outweigh any potential return.” But Ireland’s hardworking culture industry sometimes name-drops a cheese without some slick-haired Hollywood dealmaker taking their percentage. “There are occasional organic moments of exposure,” says Cuddy. “For example, Cashel Blue has been named in a Cecelia Ahern novel, in poetry and also on a quizshow without them ever seeking it – but nothing that would resemble a Hollywood placement strategy.” Busáras, the nation’s foremost coach station, divides opinion between those (Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin) who consider it “Dublin’s most iconic mid-century modernist masterpiece” and those (authentic mid-century modernist Myles na gCopaleen) who consider it a “bust station”. Hoping to heal this rift, Bus Éireann is in the process of trying to renovate it sympathetically, modernising access and facilities while polishing up the original features. [ Why The Irish Times had to apologise to the architect of the ‘fabulous’ BusárasOpens in new window ] First, they have to find out what it looks like. The OPW has issued a tender seeking a “geomatic survey of the building, both internal and external” to provide a basis for drawings. That means making a digital plan using lasers, in essence. Early stages, you’d have to conclude. What might they find? It’s well known that there’s a 225-seat theatre in the basement, with the Eblana having played host to the likes of John B Keane and Brian Friel over the years before shutting down in 1995. It won’t be back – the space will become a training centre for elite bus operatives – but who knows, there could be a museum or a funfair down there too. These modernists were utopian. Still, if they get started now, it could be done before the Charlemont MetroLink stop. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Letters: Democracy is in danger when Trump can shrug off a murder

Donald Trump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, prime minister of Saudi Arabia, during a meeting in the White House on November 18. Photo: Getty Madam — Peter Vandermeersch is right to refuse to accept moral shrugging as a form of leadership (‘Journalists must always challenge Trump’s cynical shrug in the face of evil’, November 23). When Donald Trump dismissed the murder of Jamal Khashoggi with the phrase “things happen”, he did more than trivialise a brutal assassination. He signalled that truth and human dignity are negotiable when wealth and influence are in play. That is a message the world cannot afford to normalise. Truth is not a luxury of stable societies; it is the foundation that allows them to exist. When leaders treat facts as inconveniences and atrocities as diplomatic embarrassments, they erode the very principles that underpin international order. If a journalist can be murdered and dismembered and the response from a global superpower is a shrug foll­owed by arms deals and photo opportunities, then the world’s moral compass has been deliberately set off course. Power does not absolve responsibility — it multiplies it. World leaders, particularly those who claim to stand for freedom and democratic values, have an obligation to call out wrongdoing, even when it threatens trade, oil or investment. Economic partnerships built on silence are not partnerships at all; they are transactions bought with integrity. When nations choose profit over principle, they teach every autocrat watching that violence carries no cost and that censorship can triumph over accountability. Khashoggi’s death was not a “thing” that “happened”. It was a crime — one aimed at silencing truth itself. To ignore that is to betray not only his memory, but the essential belief that facts matter and human life matters. If democracies will not speak when the powerful commit wrongs, who will? The price of truth may sometimes be economic, but the price of abandoning it is far greater: a world where nothing is sacred, and everything — even life — can be shrugged away. Paul Byrne, Dublin 7 Madam — Eilis O’Hanlon is right to highlight the absurd loop in which the State finds itself with Enoch Burke (‘How do you solve a problem like Enoch? Well, first you need to find him’, November 23). Yet the real scandal is not the institutional paralysis; it is that the education of children has been forced to orbit around one man’s unyielding dogma. Whatever convictions Mr Burke holds, they do not entitle him to turn a school into a theatre for his own absolutes. His insistence on presenting himself at the gates each morning is not an act of witness. It is a refusal to accept that pupils deserve a learning environment free from spectacle. The true innocents in this saga are not the courts or the Government, but the teenagers who now pass security guards and cameras on their way to class, all because he cannot conceive that his conscience might co-exist with their right to be left alone. Faith without humility has a habit of mistaking disruption for duty. O’Hanlon describes a stubborn dance in which the State repeats its mistakes. Burke’s greater failure is that he mistakes his certainties for a licence to disturb the everyday life of children who never sought to be part of his crusade. Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh Madam — In her column on Enoch Burke, Eilis O’Hanlon omits to point out the fact that a boy cannot become a girl or vice versa. This lie is being perpetuated in schools. Enoch Burke needs to be backed by the whole country for his brave stance in protecting children. There are too many families who fell for this and are now faced with the consequences in their child’s life where there has been medical intervention: infertility, inability to have a sex life, early onset of menopause, arthritis and so on. If adults wish to change to appear like the opposite sex, fine; but this should not be off­ered to children who may have underlying issues that are not being properly explored. Hopefully, the country will soon come to its senses and reinstate Mr Burke in his job and restore his money taken from his bank account. Anne Grace, Blackrock, Co Dublin Madam — John Greene’s art­icle (‘When the system fails to deliver’, Sport, November 23) shows all too clearly the damage that can be done to children when grown-ups don’t, or won’t, behave properly. In this case, a young girl was upset to the point where she felt unable to continue playing her sport. Had the gossips been correct in their supposition of the child’s gender, a young trans girl might have suffered the same fate. Either way, a child would have suffered due to the actions of people who are allegedly old enough to know better. Can the so-called adults please behave as such and let children play together in peace? Bernie Linnane, Dromahair, Co Leitrim Madam — Following a recent cancer diagnosis, I spent time in two Dublin hospitals. In one, I experienced outstanding nursing care. In the other, that care and compassion was heartbreakingly absent. In the interest of fairness, I must say that some nursing staff were kind and professional, in particular a specialist nursing team who supported my family and me with great humanity during my time of need. They were a lifeline. But overall, my experience left me shaken. As a retired nurse, I know the pressure hospital staff work under, yet no workload or staff shortage can ever justify neg­lecting a patient’s dignity. Compassion is not a luxury — it is at the core of care. One moment I will never forget: after a sleepless night, I was taken to the bathroom for personal care. The care assistant, clearly overstretched, left the door open to monitor another patient, exposing me to a male ward. My dignity and privacy were dismissed in that instant. I felt demeaned, broken and utterly vulnerable. Later, when I met my consul­tant to discuss my treatment, I felt so humiliated that I forgot all the important questions I intended to raise. That is the unseen damage that such care inflicts. Hospital management must ensure all staff — permanent or agency — be properly trained, supervised and held to the same standard. Basic training in infection control and cross infection prevention is critical.Respect, privacy and humanity are not optional. They are the difference between care and cruelty. I write not from anger, but from a hope that no patient will ever feel as I did — stripped of dignity when they most need compassion. We owe every patient better.I know we can and must do better. Hannah McCarthy, Dundrum, Dublin Madam — Fair play to Seán Ó Fearghaíl for not holding back in his attack on the leadership of Fianna Fáil (‘Fianna Fáil’s problems run much deeper than botched Áras campaign’, November 23). He hopes a new and ­exciting chapter for Fianna Fáil will begin, following his Oireachtas colleagues’ report into the presidential campaign. Really? The only outcome from that report will be to kick-start the exit of Micheál Martin as leader. Renewal or rejuvenation is another matter. Good luck with trying to latch on to young voters — they want solutions to our housing problem and less of the old-guard politics. The three main parties will continue to share the spoils of our PR system for some time. That’s as exciting as it will get for Fianna Fáil. Aidan Roddy, Cabinteely, Dublin 18 Madam — What gives Deputy Malcolm Byrne and Fianna Fáil the right to think they can rename Dublin Airport after one of their own, Seán Lemass? Dublin Airport does not belong to any one political party. Leave it alone. Walter Lacey, Bullock Park, Co Carlow Madam — Reading Sarah Breen’s article about her time as a shop assistant (‘True heroes of the spending season are shopping assistants’, November 23) reminded me of my first real job, when I started as an app­rentice in the men’s outfitting business at 15 years of age. How times have changed in the 60-plus years since. Not a hint of self-service back then. Even a tie required “selling”, laying them out in assorted boxes and making the Windsor knot on your hand for the prospective buyer. My most unusual transaction was when a woman bought a suit from me for her just-deceased husband. Apparently, the poor divil had been saving for a new suit when God issued the call. I had to be careful not to say: “If he doesn’t like it, you can exchange it.” I spent some 30 years in the trade, so in some sense it must have suited me. Tom Gilsenan, Beaumont, Dublin 9 Madam — Twink tells us she “kept The Late Late Show alive” and that the programme has only “boring, stuffed-shirts” as guests (Life, November 23). What an egotistical woman. She should be grateful for her lot — she hit the big time early in life, but things move on and she must accept that her style of entertaining is well past its sell-by date. Tom Kelly, Newbridge, Co Kildare Madam — Justifying a former taoiseach’s expensive tastes, the entertainer Twink commented in her interview with Barry Egan last week: “We had those big fat boozy, pint-drinking thugs of taoiseachs with tomato stains down their front and looking like balubas representing us....” (‘Curtains up!’, Life, November 23). While none of the holders of that office were ever my first choice, I am astounded that such a view was not challenged in the article. The description fits none in my experience. Leaving the comment there unchallenged is unfair to the people themselves and to our country. While politics is a rough and tough business and you take the robust comments on the chin, it does not have to be insulting and offensive. Democratic politics is under enough attack across the world without such puerile commentary. Cllr Dermot Lacey (Labour), Donnybrook, Dublin 4 Madam — Shane Ross last week quoted an unnamed former Fine Gael minister to soften the insult featured in his headline (‘Paschal trots off to pastures new while Fine Gael is led by donkeys’, November 23). This is crass. Here it is important to note that, in this era of declarations of interest, Shane was once a member of Fine Gael. He is used to hyperbole too. He once described Enda Kenny as a corpse, and then went on to serve under him in the Cabinet. Now that Paschal Donohoe is gone and getting praise, I don’t recall Mr Ross garlanding him with many honours while he was finance minister. A very Irish thing. You must be gone or dead to earn the plaudits. Brendan Cafferty, Ballina, Co Mayo Madam — Brendan Sweeney makes many valid points on the recent municipal and regional elections in Denmark (‘What Ireland can learn from Danish election shock’, November 23). Denmark is following in the footsteps of the Netherlands and the parliamentary elections there last month; the 38-year-old centrist liberal leader Rob Jetten is destined to be the youngest prime minister in Dutch history. His D66 party has risen spectacularly, outflanking the far-right leader Geert Wilders. Indeed, there are more similarities with the election of Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York. All of these elections were won by campaigning on what matters most to their constituents — housing, afford­ability and costs of living, instead of immigration. All of which makes it clear that Simon Harris’s foray into the debate on immigration after Fine Gael’s disastrous presidential election was nothing other than an attempt to gaslight the opposition and shift the focus from the Coalition’s very obvious policy failures. Tom McElligott, Tournageehy, Co Kerry Madam — Saoirse Hanley enthuses over President Connolly’s decision “to make Irish the working language of the Áras” and expresses her incredulity that anyone could question that decision (Life, November 23). President Connolly promised to represent each citizen equally. I presume this includes the Gaeilgeoir and the non-Irish-speaker alike. Yet a substantial section of her inaugural address was delivered “as Gaeilge”, rendering it unintelligible to the majority of her audience. There appears to be an almost evangelical push to persuade people to feel guilty for being unable to converse in their native tongue. A headline on a recent column by Naoise Dolan struck me as dogmatic and didactic: ‘We need to create an Ireland where everyone can become fluent in Irish’ (November 9). We also need to create an Ireland that is inclusive, not divisive. I refer to the President’s questionable remarks during the campaign: “Irish does not contain a false distinction between the person and nature, which exists in English. English is the language of colonisation, of extraction, of destruction.” We can surely appreciate Irish culture and language without denigrating others. The President should be more circumspect in her pronouncements or she risks alienating many of us. Personally, just because I cannot speak Irish, I am no less Irish than a fluent Gaeilgeoir. I love Irish culture in all its richness and variety. However, President Connolly, if you wish to communicate with me and with millions like me, please speak mainly in English. Brid Ewing, Newtowncunningham, Co Donegal Madam — Don Byrne (Lett­ers, November 23) tells us that systemic corporal punishment in schools left many students in the 1950s associating the Irish language with pain and humiliation. Why only Irish? Was corporal punishment not part of the reality endured in other subjects as well? The language, and people’s interest and enjoyment of it, should not be held hostage by the experiences of some schoolchildren more than seven decades ago. Daragh Breathnach, Glasnevin, Dublin 11

Title: Brad Lander’s departure as NYC comptroller is good news for Gotham’s $300B pension fund

Brad Lander won’t be New York City comptroller much longer — and that’s good news for Gotham’s rank and file. It’s not just because Lander is a knee-jerk leftist who rivals Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani when it comes to his out-of-touch patter on economic policy. He’s also a dullard seemingly unaware of the core function of the job he’s held for the last four years. Lander, as the city’s chief fiscal officer, is the fiduciary, investment adviser and custodian of the city’s $300 billion pension fund system. He’s supposed to make sure the funds are invested in securities that grow in value so they can “fully fund” the retirement accounts of all the city’s police, firefighters and teachers. Those accounts are not fully funded, and the shortfalls are poised to grow once Mamdani gets into office. Recall the mayor-elect’s pledges to raise taxes and turn the city into Moscow-on-the-Hudson, which will certainly cause more businesses and high earners to leave. Now Lander wants to oust BlackRock from managing city retirement money because it refuses to embrace his weird green energy agenda, which envisions a future of windmills and bicycles along the streets of New York instead of cars — and energy bills that no one can afford. Consider: BlackRock doesn’t suck at money management, it’s actually quite good at it. Its CEO, Larry Fink, is considered among the best risk managers in the business. BlackRock’s big crime is that it doesn’t want to be an accomplice to Lander’s wacky, unrealizable and maybe illegal campaign on the climate — i.e. reducing carbon emissions with brute force. In Lander’s mind, the stocks of companies that drill for oil, frack natural gas, keep our lights on or make sure the AC works in the summer are pure evil. The comptroller, of course, prefers those that embrace green energy — like those useless windmills off the coast of New Jersey that give the state some of the highest electricity bills on the planet. What’s more, Lander literally wants the city to demand that all of BlackRock’s clients’ portfolios — not just the NYC retirement system’s — comply with his whims under threat of NYC yanking its funds. It’s among the most narcissistically dumb ideas to ever come out of a public official. Let’s get real: little Brad Lander ain’t doing nothing to stop global warming; China keeps polluting and adding to carbon emissions every day. So does India and the rest of the ­developing world. Plus, those green stocks often really do really suck (Google “Solyndra”) while companies that invest in good old-fashioned crude like ExxonMobil — with a five-year spike in its shares of nearly 200% far outstripping the S&P — really don’t. BlackRock’s CEO, it should also be noted, is an odd target for Lander. Fink was one of the key proponents of so-called Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, which took into account carbon emissions of companies in which it invested. Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday. Please provide a valid email. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Never miss a story. He got a bad rap from the political right for it, and BlackRock lost business — that is until Fink clarified the company’s position: As Fink told Lander years ago, the NYC comptroller can’t dictate what BlackRock does for the Texas state pension. Plus, if BlackRock sold all of its $225 billion in energy-related stocks — the largest energy slug owned by any money manager — it would probably crash all major stock market indices. How is that good for NYC retirees? It isn’t, of course. It shows how little thought Lander probably put into this attention-grabbing charade as he reportedly gears up to run for a seat representing lower Manhattan and progressive parts of Brooklyn in Congress in the 2026 midterms. It also shows why lefty Manhattan Borough President and former City Councilman Mark Levine, who will replace Lander as comptroller, should just ignore his predecessor’s recommendation. Levine probably won’t, of course, given how progressively cringey NYC politics has become. I should point out that neither Lander nor Levine has the complete final say over where managers of the city’s retirement system invest all that money. That say belongs to the trustees of the funds, of which the comptroller has one vote, while the mayor appoints members as well. That doesn’t mean Lander should be given a pass in the court of public opinion for making this an issue. Nor should he be given a pass when it comes to his legal obligations as city comptroller, i.e. maximizing returns in the retirement system, as opposed to tilting at windmills. A fully functioning government should take action before Lander or whoever replaces him does even more damage to a city that has been losing population and business for years. But our local prosecutors (Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, et al) are too busy jailing citizens defending themselves from criminals to make sure a raging leftist doesn’t defund pension funds that are already underfunded — and bound to get worse as the city goes full-on socialist under our new mayor.

Title: Paschi, Investors Coordinated to Buy Mediobanca, Prosecutors Say
URL: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/paschi-investors-coordinated-to-buy-mediobanca-prosecutors-say-11764453409111.html

Full Content:
(Bloomberg) -- Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA Chief Executive Officer Luigi Lovaglio and two prominent Italian investors allegedly coordinated actions to seize control of Mediobanca SpA and tighten their grip on Assicurazioni Generali SpA, according to documents compiled in a probe by Milan prosecutors. Prosecutors describe an alleged multiyear strategy by billionaire Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Chairman Francesco Milleri of Delfin Sarl, two of the largest investors in Mediobanca and Generali, to take control of the Milan-based investment bank — with the ultimate goal of controlling Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer. A key step in the plan was last year’s purchase of a Monte Paschi stake by Italy’s government, part of a process prosecutors described as orchestrated and lacking transparency. After the purchase, Caltagirone and Milleri built up a deal in coordination with Lovaglio that allowed Monte Paschi to take over Mediobanca, without properly disclosing their alignment to the market to the potential detriment of other investors, according to the 35-page document seen by Bloomberg. Prosecutors allege the project was executed in breach of Italian market rules and through coordinated behavior that was capable of influencing Mediobanca’s share price. Monte Paschi completed the €17 billion ($19.7 billion) acquisition of Mediobanca in September, creating Italy’s third-largest lender by assets in a government-backed deal. Milan prosecutors are investigating alleged market manipulation by Lovaglio, Milleri and Caltagirone and obstruction of regulators tied to Monte Paschi’s takeover of its smaller rival. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government and the Finance Ministry in Rome aren’t under investigation and none of the individuals or companies have been charged with wrongdoing. Prosecutors allege that concealed coordination meant the participants didn’t have to pool their stakes and allowed them to avoid the obligation to launch a costly mandatory cash takeover bid once their combined stake surpassed the 25% threshold in Mediobanca. Monte Paschi said Thursday the bank “is confident it can provide all the necessary information to clarify the correctness of its actions.” Delfin said its board “always acted in full compliance with market rules and laws.” Caltagirone Group said its representatives “consistently acted in accordance with the rules governing the market.” All declined to comment further when reached by Bloomberg outside business hours on Saturday. The documents trace the origins of the project back almost a decade. Delfin and the Caltagirone group have been significant shareholders since at least 2016. Starting in 2019, they allegedly pursued control through parallel and coordinated investments in both Generali and its main shareholder, Mediobanca. Mediobanca is the largest shareholder in Generali with a 13.2% stake. Delfin — the Del Vecchio family’s holding company — owns 10.1% of the insurer and Caltagirone controls 6.3%, according to Generali’s website. Delfin also holds 17.5% in Monte Paschi and Caltagirone has a 10.3% stake, making them among that bank’s largest shareholders — and both built sizeable positions in Mediobanca before committing their shares to the offer. The overlapping stakes created a dense web of influence linking Italy’s largest insurer, its main shareholder Mediobanca and Monte Paschi — the vehicle used in the takeover. Investigators allege the two camps gradually converged, with stakes in Generali and Mediobanca rising in lockstep and their voting behavior becoming increasingly aligned. Treasury Role The strategy entered its final phase in November 2024, when Italy’s Treasury sold a 15% stake in Monte Paschi through an accelerated bookbuilding, according to the documents, elements of which were reported earlier by Corriere della Sera. Prosecutors say the sale was structured in a way that favored buyers aligned with the Mediobanca takeover plan — namely Caltagirone and Delfin, which offered the same price for the same number of shares within minutes of each other. A rapid closing of the order book shut out other interested investors such as UniCredit SpA and BlackRock Inc. While the Finance Ministry and its representatives aren’t under investigation, the document cites the government’s role, arguing the sale was characterized by “opacity and anomalies.” The sale appeared steered toward predetermined buyers, raising questions over potential conflicts of interest given the Treasury’s dual role as both seller of the stake and late backer of Monte Paschi’s offer, according to the court documents. Italy’s Finance Ministry acted in compliance with rules and procedures, an official told Bloomberg on Saturday when asked to comment on the investigation.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Are Now BlackRock’s Top Revenue Source, Exec Says

BlackRock’s bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become the firm’s most profitable product line, according to Cristiano Castro, director of business development at BlackRock Brazil. The figure is notable given that the firm manages over 1,400 ETFs globally and is the world’s largest asset manager with more than $13.4 trillion in assets under management. Speaking at the Blockchain Conference in São Paulo to local media, Castro called the development “a big surprise” and said that allocations in the firm’s bitcoin ETFs, including the U.S.-based IBIT and Brazil’s IBIT39, had come close to $100 billion. “When we launched, we were optimistic,” Castro said, “but we didn’t expect this scale.” The firm’s U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETF IBIT, launched in January 2024, became the fastest in history to reach $70 billion in assets, doing so in 341 days. That momentum has continued despite recent volatility in bitcoin’s price, with the ETF currently sitting at $70.7 billion in net assets according to SoSoValue data. Net inflows exceeded $52 billion in its first year, far outpacing all other ETFs launched in the last decade. IBIT also generated an estimated $245 million in annual fees by October 2025. IBIT’s rapid growth has been fueled by BlackRock’s global distribution network and a wave of institutional interest following U.S. regulatory approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. It now holds over 3% of bitcoin’s total supply, and it was followed by various BTC-linked products from BlackRock, including ETPs overseas. Castro addressed recent outflows from bitcoin funds, saying that such movement is expected given how retail investors tend to react to price drops. “ETFs are a very liquid and powerful tool. They’re meant for people to manage flows,” he said. BlackRock itself has been betting on its bitcoin ETF. Its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio has recently raised its stake in IBIT by 14%. CoinDesk has reached out to BlackRock but didn't hear back at the time of writing.

Title: Elegant cocktail watches, a Kashmir sapphire ring and a tiara that turns into a necklace

As purchases of jewellery and watches peak at this time of the year, auctioneers have been busy selecting antique pieces for their pre-Christmas auctions. But, before we go there, it’s interesting to note how Courtville Antiques is drawing in potential customers by offering classes in the history of jewellery design. “There are classes on how to make jewellery, or how to grade gemstones, but we are keen to run courses looking at how jewellery styles evolved through historic fashion icons and how jewellery featured in portrait paintings,” explains Matthew Weldon, owner of Courtville Gallery in Dublin’s Powerscourt Townhouse Centre. This columnist was one of the 42 attendees last week at the pilot courses, which Weldon hopes to develop through Courtville Academy in 2026. Each two-hour class offered a whistle-stop tour through the jewellery styles from Victorian to Art Deco and Art Nouveau to Edwardian eras. For instance, did you know that Victorian jewellery often had a secret language coded into the design of the piece? A brooch with consecutive ruby, emerald, garnet, amethyst, ruby and diamond stones spells regard, indicating the esteem the giver held for the recipient. During the suffragette movement, a brooch with stones in green and violet had the hidden meaning “give votes to women”. And did you know that the introduction of platinum in Edwardian times enabled jewellery designers to create more delicate, yet still strong necklaces, brooches and rings? In the classes, Paris-based jewellery historian Véronique Goguen, and Courtville’s jewellery historian, Efthymia Sigkoudi, explained the historical context of jewellery designs, while participants tested their new knowledge to identify brooches, necklaces, rings and bracelets from the different periods. But back to the auctions: Adam’s Fine Jewellery and Ladies’ Watches auction on Tuesday December 2nd has an intriguing collection of watches from the late 1800s through to the 1970s. This single-owner collection offers us another short history lesson in the origins of wristwatches, worn more by women initially than men. From the late 1800s onwards, robust wrist watches became more practical than pocket watches for men at war planning synchronised battle attacks. And it was a Brazilian pilot, Alberto Santos-Dumont, who first commissioned his friend, French watchmaker Louis Cartier, to design a wristwatch for him for use during flying. In contrast, ladies’ watches were first designed as bracelets – often with the watch itself concealed in the design. The 1940s Vacheron & Constantin retro secret bracelet watch (€8,000-€12,000) is one example of this style, as is the Kutchinsky Jaeger-LeCoultre cocktail bracelet with its tiny watch hidden inside a shell-like shield (€6,000-€8,000). The Cartier Art Deco-style pearl, diamond and onyx cocktail watch (€12,000-€18,000) is a more subtly stylish watch, also for sale as part of this single-owner collection. Adam’s director of jewellery, Claire Mestrallet, is also very excited by the inclusion of another Kashmir sapphire in a sapphire and diamond ring (€100,000-€150,000). It is for sale on behalf of a member of the Guerlain family, owners of the famous French perfume house. This will be the fourth Kashmir sapphire for sale at Adam’s in 2025; the first sold for a record €660,000 in May, and another two Kashmir sapphire brooches sold in September for €1.36 million. Kashmir sapphires are particularly valuable, because they were excavated from a small mine in the Indian province for only about five years in the 1880s. Mestrallet says that each Kashmir sapphire has been a “discovery”. When she suspected she had another Kashmir sapphire set in to a ring by French jeweller Boucheron, her fellow directors and even the laboratory technicians doubted her instincts. “When the lady brought me in her jewellery for sale, I thought it was a Kashmir sapphire, but I didn’t say anything. I told the directors we should have it tested and they laughed at me,” explains Mestrallet. However, her instincts were correct and she now expects potential international buyers to arrive in Dublin to view the ring. “I had people flying in from India, Hong Kong and Australia for the earlier auctions with Kashmir sapphires,” she says. A late 19th-century diamond tiara, which converts to a necklace (€5,000-€7,000), is another exquisitely made piece. Adam’s is also holding an auction of men’s watches on December 3rd, with highlights including an extremely rare Longines Sommatore chronograph wristwatch (€40,000-€80,000) and a Rolex Submariner Date (€10,000-€15,000). Meanwhile, Adams of Blackrock is hosting an online jewellery and watches auction, which ends on December 3rd. With a wide variety of rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets, with estimates starting from around €150-€450, this auction has many pieces that would make for more affordable Christmas presents. There is also a good range of antique watches, including a Cartier Panthère de Cartier (€1,200-€1,400), and an 18-carat gold nurse’s brooch/watch (€350-€450). More unusually, the auction also has a kimono-style dress worn by the late Irish singer Sínead O’Connor, designed by Joanne Hayes (€600-€800). Designer handbags also feature, including a black Chanel quilted flap bag (€1,800 – €2,000) and a Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 bag in damier azur canvas (€500-€600). Estimate: €6,000-€9,000 Hammer price: €6,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €200,000-€300,000 Hammer price: €340,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €14,000-€18,000 Hammer price: €26,000 Auction house: deVeres Estimate: €3,000-€5,000 Hammer price: €4,000 Auction house: deVeres Keep up to date with fashion news and trends for you and your home.

Title: Will LIC Stand Firm Or Will It Bend Against External Influence?
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/will-lic-stand-firm-or-will-it-bend-against-external-influence
Time Published: 2025-11-29T12:14:40Z

There is growing noise around LIC’s investments, with some groups targeting it along with groups like Adani and Reliance, calling them “risky.” This is an attempt to influence LIC’s decisions through media and social media pressure. Between 2010 and 2013, similar campaigns targeting India’s coal, energy and power and defence sectors led to a policy paralysis resulting in economic failures and large NPAs in public sector banks. Stocks like Coal India, NTPC, ONGC, BHEL, and Hindustan Aeronautics faced stalled decisions due to external pressure. If LIC hesitates due to public pressure or selective criticism, it could delay vital long-term investments in India’s infrastructure and capital markets, harming the country’s financial stability. Its important that LIC remains firm on its stands so it protects policyholders’ money and supports India’s long-term growth. Facts: LIC is not just another company. It is India’s largest financial institution, managing Rs 55 lakh crore of the nation’s savings. Almost every Indian family has some connection with LIC. That is why any attack on LIC’s credibility does not just affect LIC — it affects India’s trust in its own institutions. Some organised groups are spreading selective information, but they do not tell you that private institutions like SBI Life, HDFC Life, HDFC, ICICI, Kotak, and many mutual funds hold similar or sometimes larger exposures in the same companies. Singling out only LIC creates confusion and unnecessary fear. LIC follows strict rules — no special treatment for anyone LIC cannot invest more than 1% of its total fund in any corporate group. Every investment has to go through: Detailed checks, IRDAI regulations, Board approvals. Reliance on Proxy Advisors No single officer or politician can decide where LIC invests. LIC’s money is spread across the entire economy LIC has investments in 300+ top Indian companies — Adani, Reliance, Tata, Aditya Birla and many more. It does not depend on any one group or one sector. In fact, LIC’s investments have multiplied because of this disciplined approach. Its equity portfolio grew from Rs 1.5 lakh crore in 2014 to Rs 15.5 lakh crore today — a 10x increase. Most of the remaining fund — about Rs 40 lakh crore — is in AAA-rated government debt and in ‘AAA’ rated assets from other companies such as Adanis, Tatas and Reliance--the safest category of investment. But why is LIC being targeted now? A lot of the criticism focuses on LIC’s investment in one or two particular groups such as Adani and Reliance. But look at the facts: Since 2017, LIC invested about Rs 31,000 crore in Adani group. Today, the value is around Rs 65,000 crore. That is not a loss — that is a gain because of proper due diligence. In debt, LIC invested Rs 5,000 crore ‘AAA’ rated bonds from Adani which drew so much attention. Meanwhile, similar or larger investments in the same group have been made since LIC’s investment by US insurers like Athene Life, MetLife ($750 million/Rs 6,700 crore) and by Indian institutions like HDFC Bank (Rs 10,000 crore+), Japan’s largest banks such as MUFG and Mizuho, and some of Europe’s largest Banks such as DZ World (Germany’s largest bank, BNP Paribas, Barclays and Standard Chartered. Blackrock, world’s largest fund has also invested in Adani Group in May 2025. But no one questions them. This selective criticism creates doubt, not clarity. It can lead to decision paralysis, similar to what India faced between 2010 and 2013, when confusion around coal, power and defence halted projects and slowed the economy. Why LIC invests in companies like Adani and Reliance that own infrastructure? To understand this, think simply: If you want stability, you invest in something that gives steady income every year. Infrastructure — power lines, airports, ports, energy distribution, and logistics — gives exactly that. It is predictable and steady, like rent from a house or income from a shop. This is not an Indian idea — this is a global insurance model. Look at Warren Buffett’s company, Berkshire Hathaway Many people admire Warren Buffett. His company controls major infrastructure assets in the North America (US and Canada): Electric generation power plants (Coal, natural gas and hydro) Transmission and distribution assets in North America (US and Canada) and Uk Solar and wind plants Natural Gas storage facilities and pipelines Largest railroads and rail maintenance companies in North America Some of the companies it owns includes Mid American Energy Cmopany, PacifiCorp, NV Energy, Northern Powergrid, BHE Pipeline Group, BHE Renewables, BNSF Railway, Altalinks etc. Berkshire generates near 20% of profits only from infrastructure sector. Interestingly, these are the very infrastructure areas where India’s largest infra player Adani operates with assets that are rated ‘AAA’ or safest by any standards by all rating agencies. Despite that anti-India forces want LIC to not invest in companies like Adani and Reliance. A Rs 5,000 crore (0.1% of LIC’s total AUM) recent investment(May 2025) by LIC in Adani created so much noise, while US insurance companies such as Meta Life, Athene Life invested Rs 6,700 crore (USD 750 Mn) invested more than that (In June 2025). India has only a few groups that operate such large, national-scale infrastructure. Groups like Adani, Reliance, and Tata run: Transmission lines, Renewable Energy, Energy networks, Ports, Logistics Chains, Roads, Airports These assets usually have AAA or high safety ratings from rating agencies. For an insurer like LIC — which needs to think 20, 30, even 40 years ahead — such companies offer stability, security, and steady income. This is exactly why global insurers invest heavily in infrastructure. LIC is doing the same — following the same global best practices. A growing attempt to destabilise the Indian economy by creating systemic risk in the insurance sector. In contrast to large global insurers, many Indian insurers, not just LIC, but SBI Life, and ICICI Prudential, have significant exposure to the IT and banking sectors—industries highly vulnerable to technological disruption and geopolitical shocks. Recent events, such as the US USD 100,000 visa rule, sent immediate tremors through India’s IT sector. Looking ahead, innovations like AI could replace large portions of IT services, affecting companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro. The critical question is: if a major natural disaster, pandemic, or economic shock occurs in 2040, will insurers heavily exposed to volatile sectors be able to meet their obligations and pay claims? This underscores the strategic importance of long-term, stable infrastructure investments, which safeguard both policyholders and the broader economy. So the question is not “Why LIC invested here?” The real question is “Why should LIC not invest here, when every global insurer does?” LIC has always protected policyholders — since 1956 Even during earlier periods when LIC had exposure to troubled companies, LIC never defaulted or failed its customers. LIC under the UPA government took a big hit on investments as it made big investments in Mallya companies, DLF, GVK, Gitanjali Gems, Vakrangee etc—but no such cases in the past ten years. Since 2014, there has not been a single major investment failure of the kind seen earlier. As mentioned previously LIC’s equity portfolio has 10-folded from Rs 1.5 lakh crore to Rs 15.5 lakh crore. Investments in companies such as Adani, Tatas and Reliance is a major reason. Disclaimer: NDTV Profit is a subsidiary of AMG Media Networks Limited, an Adani Group Company.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF records $114 million in net outflows amid market volatility

Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw approximately $114 million in net inflows on November 28 amid ongoing crypto market volatility. The substantial outflow comes as many investors continue reducing their digital asset exposure. The selloff reflects investor sentiment across US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have experienced notable outflows in recent weeks. BlackRock has observed clients pulling back from Bitcoin positions during the current crypto market downturn. In recent weeks, major funds have reported significant Bitcoin sell-offs as the crypto market faces heightened volatility. The trend aligns with institutional investors’ broader strategy of reducing exposure to digital assets during periods of market uncertainty. Despite outflows from IBIT, US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs still finished Friday in the green, buoyed by fresh inflows into funds run by Fidelity, ARK Invest, and Grayscale. The group collectively pulled in around $71 million. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account? Create one Create your account Already have an account? Sign In Forgot your password? Sign In

Title: BlackRock shifts 4,044 BTC and 80,121 ETH – But it’s NOT fresh buying!

ETF redemptions moved $354M BTC and $235M ETH, signaling capital exiting rather than fresh buying. The crypto market remains in a tense holding pattern, with Bitcoin struggling to stay above the key $91,000 level. This persistent volatility often signals weakness, suggesting bulls are finding it difficult to gain control. However, the moves by Wall Street’s largest players stand in sharp contrast to these concerns. Reports show BlackRock moved a massive $589 million in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with Arkham data confirming it received $354 million in BTC and $235 million in ETH from Coinbase. At first, this seems like a major accumulation, but it actually reflects a deeper structural shift. Despite Bitcoin [BTC] trading near $90,898 and Ethereum [ETH] remaining above $3,000, at press time, these inflows into BlackRock’s wallets are not new purchases. Many assume this activity is triggering a market “flush,” but that misses the real story. The current volatility isn’t a sign of weakness; it’s part of crypto’s transition into a more mature, institutional system. The transfers reveal how ETF redemptions work and highlight the widening gap between what on-chain data shows and what’s actually happening in the market. Under the cash creation process, market makers manage ETF withdrawals by repurchasing ETF shares and selling an equivalent amount of Bitcoin or Ethereum to remain hedged. Once this sale is complete, they redeem the ETF shares with BlackRock and receive the actual BTC or ETH. This step triggers large on-chain transfers from Coinbase Prime to their wallets. In the past three days alone, these redemptions have moved 4,044 BTC worth $354 million and 80,121 ETH worth $235 million on-chain. Importantly, these transfers do not represent new buying activity. Instead, they mark the final handoff of crypto following earlier sell pressure from investor exits. In short, this reflects capital leaving the ETF system rather than entering it. Overall, BlackRock’s strategy highlights a sharp divide between speculative enthusiasm and institutional discipline. By dismissing most altcoins as “worthless” and concentrating solely on Bitcoin and Ethereum, the firm is anchoring itself to assets it views as durable, liquid, and more likely to meet regulatory standards Combined, all these factors point to the fact that the future of institutional crypto will be built on select assets and scalable financial infrastructure and not on chasing the ever-expanding altcoin universe.

About us Copy link Investors have deployed nearly $25 billion into crypto companies in 2025, dwarfing last year’s by over 150% and blowing past market watchers’ expectations. Top guns involved in dealmaking this year include tech-focused firms Paradigm and Sequoia Capital, as well as Wall Street juggernauts BlackRock, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. The most popular sectors? Centralised exchanges with $4.4 billion, prediction markets with $3.2 billion, and DeFi platforms with $2.9 billion, according to data from DefiLlama. “The projects attracting capital today are those aligned with regulatory clarity, operational resilience, and the ability to integrate with TradFi institutions and their standards,” Jordan Knecht, head of institutional strategies at GlobalStake, the blockchain services firm, told DL News. “In the middle of a choppy market, investors are signalling that they prefer durable, compliance-first businesses that aim to establish a long-term foundation for this asset class,” Knecht said. Knecht isn’t alone to note that the crypto market has evolved this year. Charles Chong, VP of strategy at crypto-native advisory firm BlockSpaceForce, told DL News that “the environment for crypto startups is shifting.” Chong said that capital is rotating toward mature players whose revenue and unit economics justify valuation. “None of this signals weakness; it simply reflects a market that is normalising and maturing,” he said, adding that raises are “becoming more rational, more aligned with fundamentals, and less driven by reflexive speculation.” Georgii Verbitskii, angel investor and founder of the crypto investment firm TYMIO, told DL News that crypto is closely following the same pattern as other market cycles. “In every major technology cycle, capital first flows into the base layer — the rails, liquidity, and settlement systems — before it moves into consumer-facing applications,” he said. Here are some of the most notable raises this year. Binance, said to be the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, secured a massive raise of $2 billion in March. This significant capital injection was led by Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and advanced technology investor MGX. Binance CEO Richard Teng said that “this investment by MGX is a significant milestone for the crypto industry and for Binance. Betting platform Polymarket closed a major funding round worth $2 billion in October, led by Intercontinental Exchange, valuing it around $8 billion. Once a fringe crypto‑betting site, the capital infusion reflects high institutional confidence. Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the $76 billion stablecoin USDC, raised $1.1 billion in its June initial public offering. The blockbuster IPO was led by JP Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs serving as joint lead bookrunners, joined by Barclays, Deutsche Bank, and Société Générale as bookrunners. Founded in 2013, Circle has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the United States’ warming to the crypto industry.

Heading out of office on a characteristically pathetic note, city Comptroller Brad Lander mounted his high horse to demand city pension funds burn money on a symbolic stand against clmate change. Fund officials must cut ties with BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and PanAgora Asset Management, he preached — because those firms have stopped bowing to the anti-carbon hysteria. “Climate risk is financial risk,” Lander emoted. “You can see it all around you in an increased number of flash floods and wildfires.” Never mind that actual science doesn’t show such impacts from global warming, nor do major companies fail to account for all manner of genuine downside risks in their earnings forecasts: Loons like Lander want the financial world to pretend that every firm that isn’t (wrongly) assuming a climate catastrophe is coming isn’t worth investing in. BlackRock rightly slammed Lander’s hissy fit as “another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” Lander’s insistence on performative virtue-signaling, instead of acting in the best interest of 800,000 current and former city workers (and the taxpayers who ultimately guarantee public pensions) is another reason to cheer his departure from the city payroll.

The simply truth is that “decarbonizing” pension funds won’t do a darned thing to save the planet, but only reduce the returns on the funds’ investments. An honest comptroller wouldn’t strive to waste public monies on ideological hobby horses. Cross your fingers that Lander’s Dec 31 exit from the comptroller’s office will mark the end of his disgraceful political career. And pray that Democratic voters don’t entertain this preposterous fraud’s expected challenge to Rep. Dan Goldman in next June’s primary: Make Brad finally have to earn a living in the private sector.

Title: Bitcoin Maxi Says ATH Back On The Table After 40x Derivatives Surge

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Bitcoin may be closing in on a new all-time high after moves in the derivatives market and fresh buying from large holders, according to market watchers and on-chain data. Max Keiser, a long-time Bitcoin advocate, pointed to a filing by Nasdaq to increase options limits for BlackRock’s IBIT to 1 million contracts — a jump that represents roughly a 40x expansion from prior levels — as a key development that could remove barriers to bigger institutional flows. According to Nasdaq paperwork and public commentary, the previous 25,000 contract cap had been seen by some as too small for rising volume. Market experts argued that earlier limits were “discriminatorily small” and suggested that 400,000 contracts would be a more reasonable baseline given current demand. Some described the change as a move that could place IBIT into a mega-cap derivatives category, unlocking follow-on effects for how banks and funds structure exposure to bitcoin. I first explained this in 2017: Now that BTC derivatives market was just expanded by 40x New ATH’s are in play. **November 2, 2017** Max Keiser first discussed Bitcoin market makers needing to expand their inventory to support higher prices in this X post: “Wall St traders… https://t.co/aBQ5DdSDay — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) November 27, 2025 Market makers will be able to hedge larger positions without hitting the old size wall, which can lower spreads and deepen available liquidity. Based on reports, that also means banks can build structured notes that use IBIT as a reference without tripping existing risk caps — and JPMorgan is reportedly preparing Bitcoin-backed structured notes that would track BlackRock IBIT. Those products could channel steady, institutional flows into the market rather than one-off spikes. According to Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score by cohort, holders of 10,000 BTC or more have flipped to net accumulation and now show a score of 0.8, signaling strong buying. The 1,000 to 10,000 BTC group has also turned positive for the first time since September, while the 100 to 1,000 BTC cohort has been in active accumulation since October and continued buying through recent declines. Even retail holders with less than 1 BTC are showing their strongest accumulation since July. Bitcoin’s price behavior supports the buying narrative. The token fell into the low $80,000 area that served as support in May and then climbed back above $90,000 quickly, which many traders took as a sign that the market sees value in the $80,000 zone. Based on reports, the average cost basis for US spot bitcoin ETFs was near $82,000, and that figure has been cited as a reason institutions found the dip attractive. Keiser had warned previously that when size limits blocked hedging, the market would be prone to pullbacks — and some analysts say that is part of the reason for recent volatility. Expanding the options cap allows volume sellers to enter more smoothly, which could reduce erratic swings but will not erase market risk. Price spikes are still possible and downside moves remain a real threat if flows slow or macro conditions shift.

A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

What was labelled the “new classico” at the height of their rivalry, this latest meeting could be called the “Jordan Coghlan derby” as the former Leinster, Munster, Leicester and Nottingham number eight faces Terenure, the club where he shone for the last four seasons before his summer wedding and relocation to his home club, Clontarf. Terenure recorded a 28-10 victory in the bullring last season before Clontarf completed a trademark comeback when Conor Kelly landed a last-ditch conversion in Lakelands Park in a pivotal win en route to regaining the title.

Also named on the bench for Tarf, who hosted Leinster last week for an open session, is another UCD summer signing, Dave Ryan, brother of James. Carlos Spencer makes three changes for Nure, including Connacht centre John Devine. Max Russell reverts from flanker to hooker, with John McKee on Leinster duty, and Harrison Brewer reverts to the backrow. Lansdowne, in fourth on 20 points, host fifth-placed Ballynahinch, a point behind. Declan Fassbender makes five changes, among them Harry O’Riordan and Harry van Eeden replacing Leinster duo Charlie Tector and Max Deegan. Ulster outhalf James Humphreys and Marcus Rea are among Ballynahinch’s four changes. Leaders St Mary’s host bottom-placed Nenagh Ormond, with the Division 1A leading points scorer Mick O’Gara replacing Conor Dean at outhalf. Ninth-placed Old Belvedere host UCD in eighth at Ollie Campbell Park. Young Munster in seventh host Con, two points above them in sixth, at Tom Clifford Park in a match that is live on irishrugby+.

Title: EU Set to Launch Full Antitrust Probe Into BlackRock–MSC Bid for Barcelona Port Terminal

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Join the leading maritime news network Shipping containers are seen at the port of Barcelona, Spain, October 3, 2024. REUTERS/Nacho Doce By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (Reuters) – BlackRock and MSC’s bid for CK Hutchison’s terminal at Barcelona port faces a hurdle with EU antitrust regulators set to investigate the Spanish deal, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday. The deal is separate from and predates BlackRock and MSC’s bid for most of CK Hutchison’s global port operations, Swiss-based MSC said. Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing’s CK Hutchison separately wants to sell its 80% holding in the $22.8 billion ports business, which encompasses 43 ports in 23 countries, a politically sensitive deal that has been caught up in China-U.S. tensions. The likely full-scale investigation by the European Commission, previously unreported, could see regulators demand concessions from BlackRock and MSC in return for clearing the Spanish deal. The Commission declined to comment. BlackRock did not respond to several emailed requests for comment. CK Hutchison has interests in ports across Europe, including in Belgium, Poland and the Netherlands. It was not immediately clear if those other European parts of the global acquisition could also eventually come under scrutiny. The non-EU portions of the wider deal fall outside the EU’s review jurisdiction. BARCELONA TERMINAL ACQUISITION UNDER EU SCRUTINY The overall wider package, which includes two ports along the strategically important Panama Canal, has become highly politicized between Washington and Beijing. The Spanish deal would see Terminal Investment Limited Holding (TiL), a unit of Switzerland-based MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, and BlackRock acquire joint control of Hutchison’s terminal at Barcelona port. The terminal can serve multiple mega-ships simultaneously and has an eight-track rail facility – making it the EU’s largest rail terminal on the Mediterranean Sea – that connects the port with traffic to and from Southern Europe. TiL already operates a terminal at the Spanish port of Valencia. The European Commission, which acts as the EU competition enforcer, is set to open a full-scale investigation after its preliminary review of the deal ends on December 10, the person said. Full-scale EU investigations typically last around four months or longer and can lead to firms offering concessions including divestments to address competition concerns and secure regulatory approval.

Title: XRP Spot ETFs Behind The Scenes – Here’s What Institutions Aren’t Saying Publicly
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-spot-etfs-behind-the-scenes/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T17:00:56Z
Full Content:
Following the launch of the historic XRP Spot ETFs, the community has been buzzing with excitement, triggering notable success for the funds over the next few days. As the exchange funds continue to attract significant inflows, a crypto expert has outlined the development that is unfolding behind the initiative. The Spot XRP ETFs are seeing robust growth, but what is happening behind the scenes is quite interesting and demands attention. Pumpius, a crypto expert and investor, has uncovered a subtle play among institutions that is not being shared with the general crowd. According to the expert, ETF fund managers are legally forbidden from purchasing XRP directly from payment firm Ripple or escrow. This is due to the court’s injunction that every single ETF must acquire the altcoin on the open market only, breaking the concept of shortcuts, backdoor deals, and wholesale buying. Pumpius has declared this underlying trend at the institutional level to be the most bullish step for the altcoin. His reason hinges on the fact that Ripple will only release what is absolutely necessary from the monthly escrow holdings. Furthermore, the payment firm will avoid causing taxable events this way by keeping the escrow untouched. Such a move would imply that Ripple is drip-feeding just enough liquidity to avoid dislocation while ETFs are actively absorbing circulating supply. The expert considers this pattern the calm before a structural supply shock, and not a sign of stagnation. When the shift happens, it will be seen as a balancing act, a pressure build-up, and a loading phase. In the meantime, fund managers are already in discussion with Ripple, which means timing coordination is currently ongoing. At the same time, the expert has highlighted that supply dynamics are now being designed in real time. Once the early balance period concludes and ETF demand continues to rise while escrow is strictly regulated, XRP will not move at a slow pace. Instead, the expert predicts that the altcoin will experience substantial movement, breaking upside resistance levels with violence. Spot XRP ETFs have become a serious mode of investment in the landscape since their launch. Franklin Templeton recently stunned the market by introducing the Franklin XRP ETF on NYSE Arca and referring to the token as “fundamental to the global settlement system.” Other major firms such as Bitwise, Grayscale, and Canary Capital have all rolled out their own ETFs, which attracted millions in inflows from their first day. With the robust adoption and interest in the funds, the message is clear that the demand for regulated XRP exposure is bigger than anticipated. Despite the significant demand, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has yet to jump into the funds, stating that customer demand is still primarily centered on Bitcoin and Ethereum for now. Furthermore, they believe that regulatory clarity is still not entirely certain despite repeated victories over the US SEC. However, if the company eventually launches its own fund, it would spur billions of capital and new institutional money. Considering its status in the finance sector, “a BlackRock ETF would be the ultimate stamp of approval.” For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Amundi, Europe’s biggest asset manager, tokenises money market fund on Ethereum
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/amundi-europes-biggest-asset-manager-tokenises-money-market-fund-on-ethereum/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T15:01:44Z

European asset management giant Amundi has taken a major step into the digital finance era by launching the first tokenised share of its AMUNDI FUNDS CASH EUR money market fund on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokenised fund marks a significant innovation in fund distribution and allows investors to hold fund units digitally while maintaining the traditional channels for accessing the fund. According to Amundi, the tokenised fund is built in collaboration with CACEIS, one of Europe’s leading asset-servicing providers. CACEIS supplies the technology infrastructure required for tokenisation, including digital wallets for investors and a blockchain-based order platform that supports subscriptions and redemptions. Jean-Pierre Michalowski, CEO of CACEIS, highlighted that the hybrid transfer agent service opens a new distribution channel, allowing clients to quickly and efficiently execute fund transactions via blockchain while paving the way for potential future operations in stablecoins or central bank digital currencies. The first transaction of the tokenised share took place on November 4, 2025, and the fund is now distributed through a hybrid model. This means that investors can continue to use conventional methods, but the new digital option enables fund units to be recorded as tokens on Ethereum, providing secure, transparent, and traceable transaction records. Blockchain technology provides multiple advantages for both investors and fund managers. Orders can be executed instantly, operations can continue around the clock, and transactions are recorded with full transparency. The tokenised model also opens the fund to younger and more digitally oriented investors, reflecting a shift in investor behaviour toward faster, more accessible financial products. Amundi emphasised that the launch does not replace traditional fund access but instead provides an additional route for investors. The hybrid approach ensures that the fund remains inclusive, combining the reliability of conventional distribution with the efficiency and innovation offered by blockchain technology. Jean-Jacques Barbéris, Head of Institutional and Corporate Clients and ESG at Amundi, described asset tokenisation as a global transformation set to accelerate in the coming years, with this initiative serving as a practical demonstration of the firm’s expertise in implementing secure and robust blockchain applications in finance. The launch comes amid a broader expansion of tokenised real-world assets. Market data shows that the value of tokenised assets on blockchains rose sharply in 2025, from $15.2 billion at the beginning of the year to $37.1 billion by late November. Ethereum, where Amundi’s fund is hosted, ranks second globally in the tokenised real-world asset space with a market cap of $12.4 billion. The trend reflects increasing institutional interest in blockchain-based investment solutions and the mainstreaming of digital finance innovations. Tokenised money market funds, in particular, have seen rapid adoption in recent years. Industry data indicates that products from leading firms like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton now manage billions in digital assets, while total value locked in tokenised funds surged from around $770 million at the end of 2023 to nearly $9 billion by October 2025. Amundi’s launch positions it as a front-runner in Europe, showcasing its commitment to leveraging digital innovation while maintaining robust regulatory and operational standards.

The crypto industry rushed to the aid of Hong Kong residents who suffered the city’s most devastating fire in 80 years, claiming the lives of at least 128 people. Some of the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges and Web3 companies have pledged millions of dollars to support victims of the deadly fire at the Wang Fuk Court apartment complex in Hong Kong’s Tai Po District, highlighting the sector’s growing role in real-world relief efforts. Three centralized crypto exchanges (CEXs) have publicly pledged to donate $24.78 million Hong Kong dollars ($3.19 million) to aid the victims of the devastating fire, which claimed the lives of at least 128 residents. The donations included $1.5 million from Bitget exchange, $1.28 million from Binance, and about $256,000 from KuCoin exchange. Bitget contributed the largest share, aiming to support reconstruction and recovery in the affected community, Bitget CEO Gracy Chen said Friday on X, adding that the exchange “stands with Hong Kong, wishing affected residents a swift recovery and rebuilding of their homes.” The two-day fire began on Wednesday at the Wang Fuk Court complex and spread to seven high-rise buildings before being extinguished on Friday, in what the media have described as Hong Kong’s deadliest fire in 80 years. Related: BlackRock ETF investors bounce back to profit as price reclaims $90K Hong Kong-based Web3 intellectual property company Animoca Brands has also started a token-based fundraiser, aiming to collect funds from the crypto community via an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a Solana (SOL) wallet address. The fundraiser is collecting donations until Dec. 2. The company pledged to convert 100% of the proceeds to Hong Kong dollars by Dec. 3, to support the relief efforts of the Hong Kong Red Cross. For transparency, Animoca will post a donation receipt showing the final amount collected and donated, the company said in a Thursday announcement. Animoca’s EVM-compatible wallet had collected $171,000 while its Solana wallet collected $1,500 in cryptocurrency donations at the time of writing, according to cryptocurrency intelligence platform Nansen. Tron Network founder Justin Sun also pledged an undisclosed amount to the fire victims. Related: Over 8% of Bitcoin changed hands in week, markets on ‘knife’s edge,’ Analysts say Cryptocurrency-based donations have emerged as a significant lifeline for disaster-stricken regions and underdeveloped economies lacking banking infrastructure. In 2024, crypto donations surpassed $1 billion, driven by large-scale transfers to the victims of the earthquake in Thailand and Myanmar. Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao alone donated nearly $600,000 to the disaster relief fund in April 2024, following a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Thailand and Myanmar on March 28. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also been known for his crypto donations. In October 2024, Buterin donated over $180,000 in Ether (ETH) to the biotech charity Kanro.

Avalanche (AVAX) is back in the spotlight after reclaiming its position among the top 20 cryptos to surpass Hedera (HBAR), just as Securitize secures EU approval to launch the region’s first fully regulated blockchain-based securities market on the Avalanche network. This convergence of regulatory momentum, institutional adoption, and renewed technical strength has positioned AVAX for a potential market revival heading into 2026. Securitize received regulatory authorization from Spain’s National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) to operate a tokenized trading and settlement system under the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime. The approval enables Securitize to passport the license across the European Single Market, including France, Germany, and Italy, creating an unprecedented bridge between its U.S. broker-dealer operations and Europe’s capital markets. The firm confirmed that the entire infrastructure will run on the Avalanche blockchain, citing sub-second finality, regulatory-grade network performance, and scalable architecture. This move positions Avalanche at the center of institutional tokenization just as Securitize prepares for a $1.25 billion SPAC merger and expands its portfolio, including managing the now-over $1 billion BlackRock BUIDL on-chain treasury fund. The first EU-compliant issuance is slated for early 2026, opening the door for a wave of regulated tokenized assets, an estimated $18 trillion market by 2033. While fundamentals surge, AVAX’s price remains compressed near the long-term support zone around $12–$15. The token recently bounced to $14.94, posting a 6.5% daily gain and breaking above its 7-day moving average at $13.96. It now faces a technical showdown with resistance at the 20-day SMA at $15.21. Momentum indicators are turning constructive. RSI sits at a healthy 42, MACD shows bullish divergence, and Stochastic momentum favors buyers. A breakout above $15.21 could open the path toward $18.61, with a larger target near $33 if long-term trendlines snap. However, failure to hold above $13.91 risks retesting deeper support near $12.57. Fueling optimism, AVAX One Treasury recently accumulated over 9.37 million AVAX, spending $110 million between November 5 and 23. Total reserves now exceed 13.8 million AVAX, signaling robust long-term institutional confidence. On-chain metrics support the bullish case. Deployed contracts are rising, developer activity is expanding, and futures taker data shows increasing buyer dominance. These combined forces suggest that AVAX may be carving out a medium-term bottom. As institutional momentum builds and Europe’s first regulated blockchain securities market goes live on Avalanche, AVAX’s comeback narrative is gaining traction—and a trend reversal may be closer than the charts imply.

The asset manager’s hybrid rollout enables investors to choose between the traditional fund and a new blockchain-based version recorded on Ethereum. Amundi, Europe’s largest asset manager, has introduced its first tokenized share class for a euro money market fund. The fund is now offered in a hybrid structure, allowing investors to choose between the traditional version and the new blockchain-based one. The first transaction was recorded on the Ethereum network on Nov. 4. The rollout was developed in collaboration with CACEIS, a European asset-servicing group that provided the tokenization infrastructure, investor wallets, and the digital order system used to process subscriptions and redemptions. According to the companies, tokenizing the fund streamlines order processing, widens access to new investor channels, and enables 24/7 trading. Amundi said the fund holds short-term, high-quality euro-denominated debt, primarily comprising money-market instruments and overnight repurchase agreements with European sovereigns. According to the company’s website, it manages about 2.3 trillion euros ($2.6 trillion) in assets and serves more than 100 million retail clients. Amundi is based in Paris, France.

RWA.xyz data shows BlackRock’s onchain money market product currently holds $2.3 billion in tokenized assets, while Franklin Templeton’s money market fund has more than $826 million in assets. Both funds have been expanding across multiple blockchains. On Nov. 12, Franklin Templeton announced that its tokenization platform joined the Canton Network, enabling its money market fund to operate within a permissioned ecosystem built for financial institutions. BlackRock has also expanded its tokenized fund beyond Ethereum, adding support for Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon. A Bank for International Settlements bulletin released on Wednesday noted that tokenized money market funds had climbed to $9 billion in value by the end of October, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. However, the report warned that the growing adoption of tokenized Treasury portfolios as collateral could expose the financial system to new operational and liquidity vulnerabilities.

Title: Recovery In Sight? Charles Hoskinson Sees Bitcoin Reaching $250,000 By 2026
URL: https://zycrypto.com/recovery-in-sight-charles-hoskinson-sees-bitcoin-reaching-250000-by-2026/

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has offered a ray of hope to Bitcoin (BTC) holders, tipping the cryptocurrency to recover its yearly losses and set a new all-time high. Hoskinson noted that an imminent Bitcoin rally will send prices all the way to $250,000 before the end of next year. According to a recent interview, Hoskinson revealed that Bitcoin is primed for a recovery run that will see the asset recoup its recent losses in the coming months. The Cardano co-founder disclosed that the largest cryptocurrency is only facing short-term downsides due to macroeconomic pressures. Hoskinson argued that the Bitcoin price has been adversely impacted by Trump tariffs and other macroeconomic uncertainties, noting that “crypto is not immune to the macro.” Since October, Bitcoin price has tumbled from its peak of over $126,000 to trade below the $90,000 mark, erasing all its yearly gains. Despite the jarring price drops, Hoskinson is eyeing a meteoric rally for Bitcoin “over the next two quarters.” Furthermore, the outspoken Cardano founder tipped Bitcoin to reach $250,000 by the end of the year, defying claims of an extended rally. Hoskinson clarified that institutions will lead the incoming bull run, unlike previous retail-led bull markets. He pointed to Wall Street’s growing participation in the ecosystem, with BlackRock, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and the US government scrambling to accumulate Bitcoin. Apart from Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and frenetic adoption by treasury companies, Hoskinson hinged his bullish estimates on the steady rise of stablecoins and tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Hoskinson revealed that retail will still play a key role in the anticipated bull run, with the number of cryptocurrency holders predicted to climb to 1 billion. “The fundamentals are just sound. There is no way for this market to stay depressed forever,” said Hoskinson. They are just reflecting their current macro environment.” Previously, Charles Hoskinson tipped Bitcoin to climb to $1 million but did not disclose a timeline for the milestone. Meanwhile, several experts have made bold calls for Bitcoin’s end-of-year price, with the average at $150,000. However, recent price performance has put a dent in end-of-year predictions, with BTC threatening to fall below $85K. While Bitcoin continues its decline, other cryptocurrencies are also facing a torrid patch with Ethereum and XRP wallowing below $3,000 and $2, respectively. BNB, SOL, and DOGE have recorded losses of over 5% over the last day, while Cardano’s ADA tumbled by nearly 8% in the same timeframe. Meanwhile, CoinMarketCap data indicates that the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has surged by 2.44% to settle at $3.12 trillion.

Title: Bitwise CEO Praises XRP ETF Performance Amid Record-Setting Inflows, Here Are The Numbers
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-performance-record/
Time Published: 2025-11-27T16:30:28Z
Full Content:
The launch of XRP exchange-traded funds has quickly turned into one of the strongest openings the crypto ETF market has seen this year. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley publicly celebrated the early success of his firm’s product, pointing to a surge in investor interest that has driven inflows to nine figures in a couple of days. His comments come at a time when total XRP ETF inflows across the industry are climbing, whereas Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are finding it difficult to maintain the same level of demand they had in the past. The Bitwise Spot XRP ETF started trading on November 20 after going live based on the new fast-track SEC guidelines for launching ETFs. Since then, the ETF has witnessed consistent days of inflows. Horsley revealed that the Bitwise XRP ETF recently recorded roughly $18 million of inflows in one trading session. This huge amount is one of the fund’s strongest days yet and demonstrates that institutional investors are taking active positions rather than waiting on the sidelines. The CEO emphasized gratitude to those allocating capital to Bitwise’s product, describing the inflow strength as a sign of confidence in both XRP as an asset and Bitwise as a manager. “Grateful to investors entrusting Bitwise to steward their asset,” he said. The timing of these inflows also shows the bullish momentum across XRP ETFs, with multiple issuers reporting consistent interest since regulatory approval. This is interesting, considering the spot price of the altcoin has been going through a not-so-favorable period in November. According to Horsley, the Bitwise XRP ETF has now attracted approximately $135 million in inflows over its first three days of trading. This pace places it among the fastest-growing altcoin ETFs launched in the United States, although still behind early-stage numbers associated with Bitcoin or Ethereum products. These inflow numbers show the pent-up demand for institutional-grade exposure to the cryptocurrency. In addition to Bitwise, industry-wide XRP ETF data shows that the new products collectively brought in about $164 million on Monday, October 24. In total, the four US-based ETFs have witnessed $643.92 million in inflows since launch, with no day of outflow yet to be recorded. The strong early adoption contrasts sharply with the hesitation seen among some heavyweight ETF issuers. Firms like BlackRock and FIdelity are yet to launch their own version of a Spot XRP ETF, leaving the current wave of inflows to be dominated by Bitwise, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. Their absence has not stopped the momentum flowing into XRP, though it has kept the scale of inflows below what it could become once the larger issuers eventually join the field.

Title: Ten decor drops from legacy raids and dungeons to pick up on Player Housing day one

NEXT | How to win the World Championship Hearthstone Tavern Brawl Cruising through old World of Warcraft content is something that I’ve loved doing for many years for the transmog, pets, and mounts, and now we can add Player Housing decor to the list of things you can pick up in legacy dungeons and raids. While there’s a surprisingly short list of adornments from the first eleven chapters of our journeys across Azeroth that are known to drop from bosses so far, it’s a safe bet that more will be added in the coming months and years. These decor items are guaranteed drops, so no tedious grinding is necessary for your first copy. Dungeons will have their last boss drop the decor item, but any boss from a raid could drop a furnishing. If you’re looking for multiple copies of any of these items, it’s a simple as running the instance again for a second or third (or 20th) copy of the item. Here is the list of decor I have on my launch day wish list. Valdrakken Hanging Lamp — After a quick run through the Ruby Life Pools, you’ll be able to hang an indoor-only glass sphere of enchanted fire from your rafters. The long rope gives this versatility, but the five colored gems really set it apart from the multitude of other lighting options. Magistrix’s Garden Fountain — Just a few bosses into The Nighthold is where you’ll encounter Spellblade Aluriel, who will now drop a stylish stone water feature each time you defeat her. You can place a large one front-and-center in your yard, but I’m excited to see what creative hijinks the community gets up to by taking advantage of this item’s ability to also be placed inside. Eye of Acherus — If you’re planning on using your home as a base for raising an army of undead and training them in the ways of the Death Knight, you’ll want one of these smoking blue orbs with its stylish skull-and-chain holder from the Pit of Saron. It’s a must-have for rooms with an Icecrown theme or as a Hallow’s End yard decoration. Tome of Pandaren Wisdom — I have already seen some amazing player-built features such as gaming tables and cozy reading nooks. This book bound in wood and red yarn found in the Temple of the Jade Serpent should give a little flair to any personal library or nightstand, and can even be placed outside for a bit of light Lorewalking in the shade. Gnomish Tesla Tower — Clearing Operation: Mechagon on any difficulty will net you this amazing electrical contraption that could be perfect for an interior workshop space or atop the pinnacle of your house as a lightning rod or weather station. This is an absolute necessity for any Gnome-themed area on your property. Crucible Votive — Here’s something perfect for setting just the right mood in your drawing room. If you’ll be running a murder mystery party, crafting an enormous pipe organ, or simply looking to furnish your dedicated brooding space, this rack of 46 candles drops from the Restless Cabal in the Crucible of Storms. Tidesage’s Fireplace — While you’re vanquishing the tentacled horrors of Stormsong Valley, you can pop over to the Shrine of the Storm and pick up this stunning full-wall masterpiece. Don’t even think about putting the finishing touches on any nautical-themed sitting parlor without this enormous green cephalopod adorning your mantle. Horde Warlord’s Throne — We’ll wrap up with a trio of Horde-themed decor for anyone looking to put an extra zug zug into their floorplan. You’ll have to get all the way through Siege of Orgrimmar to earn Garrosh Hellscream’s personal seat, but it will certainly be worth the effort to use it as a centerpiece in your great hall or to lord over your weekly lawn darts tournament. Orgrimmar Sconce — Skulloc in the Iron Docks is the source for this wall-mounted horn that holds up a flaming spiked cage on a thick metal chain. Lining a hallway or dining room with these is sure to get your name on the shortlist to be the next Chief Interior Decorator of the Horde Forces. Horde Battle Emblem — Here’s the perfect item to mount above your horned Warlord Throne. Clearing Upper Blackrock Spire will reward you with this axe/shield combo that can also be placed outside to the annoyance of your Alliance-biased HOA. Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers.

Title: Why Real-World Utility, Not Meme Coin Mania, Will Drive Crypto’s Next Wave

Time Published: 2025-11-27T15:00:18Z

For years, crypto has resembled a casino, with flashy trends, wild price spikes and meme coins stealing the spotlight. But beneath the noise, something very different is taking shape in the middle of this so-called bear market. The next major leap in digital assets is unlikely to be fueled by the latest meme coin or a fleeting trading frenzy. Instead, it will be powered by real-world applications and the development of durable, institutional-grade infrastructure. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. As the industry evolves, a substantial shift in investment and engineering resources is underway. The focus is moving away from speculative”casino” behavior and toward more functional, enduring applications: everyday global payments, banking services built on stablecoins and the seamless integration of tokenization into traditional financial systems. This transition will mark the true maturation of the parallel financial system. A recent TRM Labs adoption report revealed that India, the United States, Pakistan, the Philippines and Brazil are now leading global digital asset usage. South Asia is also the fastest-growing crypto market in 2025. The next significant advancement in digital assets probably won’t be driven by a new meme coin or a temporary surge in trading activity. Crucially, the research shows that stablecoins accounted for approximately 30 percent of all on-chain activity, with total transaction volume rising above $4 trillion between January and July 2025, marking an 83 percent year-over-year increase. That isn’t the profile of a market anticipating the next viral trend. It’s the profile of a parallel payments and settlement layer taking shape. The last big boom was fueled by meme coins and quick-hit trading crazes. That era brought millions of newcomers into crypto, but it also cemented the perception of the industry as a digital gambling hall. Today’s landscape looks markedly different. Significant liquidity is now flowing through crypto spot ETFs. Stablecoin activity is at an all-time high. Tokenization markets are expanding. Serious capital is staying in the system, not just passing through for a quick bet. At the same time, hype-driven projects with no real utility beyond speculation are being flushed out. What’s emerging instead is infrastructure and applications designed for populations regularly excluded from traditional banking systems. One of the strongest indicators of this adoption-driven future lies in the emergence of a new class of financial institutions. For over a decade, neobanks were heralded as the future of finance, despite most remaining deeply tied to legacy rails, from know-your-customer (KYC) procedures and custody models to payment networks and physical card issuance. They did little for the 1.4 billion people who remain unbanked, and they still left users exposed to arbitrary account freezes and the same opaque systems that defined traditional banking. A new category, known as decentralized on-chain baking platforms, or deobanks, is taking the opposite approach. Instead of layering a sleek interface over incumbents, these platforms are building upward from blockchain infrastructure itself. Here, self-custodial accounts are connected through smart contracts, giving users real control over their assets, unlike the temporary permissions granted on a centralized bank ledger. These accounts also operate on stablecoin-native infrastructure, enabling cross-border transfers to settle in minutes and eliminating SWIFT fees and correspondent banking delays. Moreover, loyalty and governance are directly linked to network participation, rather than being obscured by unclear “points” programs. Critics point to new risks from key management challenges to smart contract exploits to uneven regulatory oversight. And while those concerns are valid, they also overlook that these systems offer meaningful benefits to millions who lack reliable access to savings, credit or affordable international payments. And this is where stablecoins change the story. This new infrastructure is paving the way for mainstream crypto adoption, where digital assets are used for everyday payments, not just speculative bets. As noted, stablecoin use has shot up considerably, with TRM Labs reporting that they now account for nearly one-third of all on-chain activity. Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape around them is shifting in ways that legitimize these assets. The U.S. recently enacted its first comprehensive legislation for fiat-backed tokens known as the GENIUS Act. The E.U.’s MiCA regulations are now in effect, and Hong Kong, along with other major financial hubs, has introduced dedicated frameworks for these assets. These developments are now making it possible for banks, payment processors and fintech companies to integrate with crypto infrastructure without the regulatory paralysis of prior years. They are also reshaping real-world incentives, making remittances from workers in the Gulf, Europe or North America to relatives in South Asia, Africa and Latin America, not only cheaper, but almost instant. With trillions of dollars flowing through stablecoins each year—and clear legal recognition emerging in major markets—they are becoming far more than payment novelties. Given that 90 percent of them are pegged to the U.S. dollar, these assets are now functioning as an alternative settlement layer for the dollar itself. As money increasingly flows through this system, a tipping point will arrive: an infrastructure strong enough to shape the next chapter of global finance. It’s become very difficult to believe that the next bull run will still be driven by the old question: Which coin will be 100x? Instead, it is far more likely to be driven by the networks processing the next trillion dollars in real-world payments. And because crypto is shedding its identity as a discrete asset class and becoming part of the invisible infrastructure behind everyday payment transactions, that shift may arrive sooner than expected. Two trends are powering this transition: the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and the emergence of decentralized banks. Today, roughly $35.6 billion in RWAs is tokenized, with market-maker Keyrock projecting the figure will reach $50 billion by the end of 2025. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has also outlined a plan to unlock up to $4 trillion in digital wallet-held assets around the world through the digitization of traditional financial products—a signal of how large this market may grow. Deobanks, meanwhile, bring stablecoin payments and self-custody to the mainstream while layering in credit, savings and rewards. They allow users to bypass legacy intermediaries and plug directly into blockchain settlement rails. In such an ecosystem, liquidity can no longer depend on speculative waves. It will come from continuous flows: remittances, payroll, supplier payments, trade finance and tokenized fixed-income products. At that point, market cycles will sit on top of a growing base of structural demand, not narrative-driven inflows. Ultimately, it is this structural foundation that will determine how far any future bull market can run. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: BlackRock ETF investors bounce back to profit as price reclaims $90K

BlackRock Bitcoin ETF investors are back in profit, in a promising sign of a December market recovery from the cohort that drove much of Bitcoin’s rise to all-time highs in 2025. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) holders are back in profit after Bitcoin’s recovery above $90,000, an early sign that sentiment may be turning among one of the key investor groups driving the market this year. The holders of the largest spot Bitcoin (BTC) fund, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), bounced back to a cumulative profit of $3.2 billion on Wednesday, according to blockchain data platform Arkham. “BlackRock IBIT and ETHA holders went from being up almost a combined $40 billion at their PnL peak on 7th October, down to $630 million 4 days ago,” wrote Arkham in a Wednesday X post. “This means the average of all BlackRock ETF buys is at just about break-even.” With ETF holders no longer under pressure, Bitcoin ETFs may continue to slow their selling rate, which has seen a significant improvement since the $903 million in outflows recorded on Nov. 20. Bitcoin ETFs recorded two consecutive days of inflows for the first time in two weeks, with a modest $21 million in cumulative inflows on Wednesday, according to Farside Investors.The development is a welcome sign for Bitcoin, as BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF was the only fund to realize net positive inflows for 2025, according to K33 Research. The inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs were the primary driver of Bitcoin’s momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset management firm, with $13.5 trillion in assets under management as of the third quarter of 2025.Related: Over 8% of Bitcoin changed hands in week, markets on ‘knife’s edge,’ Analysts say The broader spot Bitcoin ETF investor cohort is also back in profit after Bitcoin climbed above the key $89,600 flow-weighted cost basis, a level that was lost two weeks ago.Bitcoin’s recovery follows a sharp increase in interest rate cut expectations for the US Federal Reserve’s Dec. 10 meeting, with odds increasing by 46% in a week. Markets are pricing in an 85% chance of a 25 basis point interest rate cut, up from 39% a week ago, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Related: Bitcoin rout continues as crypto treasuries face reckoning: Finance Redefined Two weeks ago, Bitcoin’s price correction pushed Bitcoin ETF holders below their flow-weighted cost basis near $89,600, according to Glassnode analyst Sean Rose, with the average holder facing paper losses on their investment.

Institutional wealth managers might lose young crypto investors due to the absence of digital asset offerings, a new survey shows. Recently, decentralized finance (DeFi) became more intertwined with mainstream firms as users backed on-chain use-cases. A new survey conducted by crypto payment firm ZeroHash highlights the growing adoption of digital asset offerings, especially among young investors. Participants indicated that they are willing to change wealth managers because exposure to crypto assets is not on the table. About a third of investors are in search of crypto offerings supporting the position. More practically, over 50% of participants said they moved between $250,000 and $1 million in search of crypto products. This shows the skyrocketing demand for digital assets and recent institutional investments in the market. Meanwhile, 18% of young investors pulled out less than $100k from funds with virtual assets, and 5.3% transferred over $1 million. The majority claim their stance was influenced by heavy institutional accumulation in recent months. According to the survey, if large institutional firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, etc are increasing exposure to crypto, smaller investors should follow a similar path. Meanwhile, 84% of investors said they plan to increase their crypto holdings in the next 12 months. This adoption spike is expected after crypto assets like Bitcoin tapped all-time highs this year, with analysts tipping a bull case of $1 million by 2030. Short-term projections suggest a run above $150k despite recent setbacks triggered by mass liquidations. Crypto users became more bullish after the United States’ positive stance, prompting a surge in institutional demand. Most young investors now feel confident about the market’s future. Previously, several institutional giants refused to include virtual assets in their portfolios, citing concerns about manipulation. “Crypto assets have become essential to modern portfolio strategy with users not waiting for their private wealth managers to catch up… Advisers who adapt early can strengthen client loyalty and capture new growth, while those who delay risk falling behind,” the report added. Furthermore, 92% of participants say a broader range of crypto-based investment products is required, a move away from the dominant Bitcoin and Ethereum offerings. This year, altcoins like Solana and XRP recorded consecutive inflows into institutional products as the market awaits spot ETFs and more decentralized finance use cases.

Saudi Aramco has selected Citigroup to advise on the planned sale of a stake in its oil export and storage terminals business, reported Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter. The appointment follows a competitive process involving several major investment banks, with Citigroup emerging as the preferred adviser in recent days. The gold standard of business intelligence. Find out more Combine business intelligence and editorial excellence to reach engaged professionals across 36 leading media platforms. Find out more Previously, the company mandated JPMorgan Chase as a sell-side adviser for separate sales of stakes in its oil and gas pipeline infrastructure. The proposed transaction could raise several billion dollars for Aramco, although discussions remain at an early stage. No final decisions have been made regarding the structure or timing of the sale, according to the report. The Saudi energy company is expected to begin a formal sale process next year, which may attract interest from large infrastructure funds. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. This move aligns with its broader strategy to divest assets, including parts of its real estate portfolio, as it seeks to generate capital for future investments. Aramco’s oil storage and export network includes major facilities at Ras Tanura on the Persian Gulf and terminals on the Red Sea. The company owns interests in product terminals in the Netherlands and holds leases for crude and product storage in Egypt and Okinawa, Japan. Bloomberg said that Aramco’s decision to explore the sale of a stake in the oil terminals business comes as the company responds to changing market conditions. Oil prices have declined by around 16% this year, prompting the company to delay some projects and consider asset sales to maintain investment capacity. While the impact on earnings has been offset by increased production, asset sales are considered a means to strengthen Aramco’s financial position. Citigroup declined Bloomberg’s request to comment on the appointment, and Aramco did not immediately respond to requests for comment, without disclosing further details of the stake sale. In September this year, a consortium led by Global Infrastructure Partners, part of BlackRock, was reportedly in negotiations with several banks to secure up to $10.3bn (SR38.62bn) in financing for Aramco’s Jafurah gas development deal. JPMorgan and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking are said to be among the financial institutions in discussions to support the transaction.

Title: Nasdaq seeks SEC nod to lift IBIT options cap to one million contracts

BTC’s V-shaped recovery meets Nasdaq’s IBIT options expansion. IBIT options expansion provides 40× more room for Bitcoin derivatives exposure, boosting liquidity, but persistent market fear raises questions. BTC is showing a V-shaped recovery, reclaiming $92k, but full reversal is still uncertain as options leverage peaks and resistance levels loom. The Q4 market cycle is prompting investors to reconsider the “store of value” narrative. From DATs losing purchasing power to ETFs bleeding cash, and big institutions selling to protect their balance sheets, Bitcoin [BTC] conviction is being tested. BlackRock’s BTC holdings are a clear example. According to BitBo, the firm has offloaded roughly 30,000 BTC since the October crash. And it’s not just their direct holdings. BlackRock’s BTC ETF (IBIT) logged more than $3 billion in outflows in November alone. Source: BitBo In short, institutional conviction in BlackRock took a hit this cycle. Yet, the latest Nasdaq–SEC filing looks like an attempt to reboot momentum around IBIT. According to the filing, Nasdaq wants to raise IBIT’s options contract limit from 25k to 1 million, marking a 400% jump. Simply put, that’s 40× more room for derivatives exposure in Bitcoin, putting IBIT in the same conversation as the “Magnificent Seven” in terms of options depth. But the question is: Is the timing right? BTC has bounced back to $90k, yet “fear” still dominates the market. ETFs haven’t fully rebounded either. In this context, does Nasdaq’s move give IBIT room for serious derivatives flows, or is it just another high-risk trade? The market reaction to the news is clear on the charts. According to CoinGlass, Bitcoin’s Options Open Interest (OI) jumped about $4 billion in a single day, hitting $62 billion. That’s a clear sign derivatives activity is picking up, likely boosted by the expanded IBIT options limits. The impact on Bitcoin? Pretty clear. BTC is riding the bullish momentum from yesterday’s 3.51% rally, trying to reclaim the $92k level. In fact, this marks BTC’s first V-shaped recovery in nearly a month. Source : TradingView (BTC/USDT) However, a full reversal isn’t on the cards yet. In early November, BTC failed to break the $110k ceiling, forming two lower lows, the latest around $80k. In this context, breaking $94k would be the first step toward a vertical expansion. Meanwhile, options leverage is heating up, while the SEC has yet to rule on the IBIT filing. Still, the market’s reaction is already evident. As BTC nears resistance, how this leverage plays out will serve as a crucial gauge for traders. If BTC holds above current levels, the 1 million contract expansion could pave the way for deeper liquidity. Otherwise, excessive leverage could make BTC prone to volatility, turning the expansion into a high-risk trade.

Title: Kevin Hassett tipped as next Fed Chair, markets eye dollar impact

U.S. bond markets remain steady despite speculation that White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett could replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair in May. Hassett’s reputation for favoring rate cuts has sparked concerns that the dollar could weaken. Betting markets show rising odds for Hassett, while short-term yields dipped briefly before rebounding. (Source: Reuters) The dollar and Fed funds futures have seen minimal impact, even as investors price in an 83% chance of a quarter-point rate cut in December. Hassett, a former Fed senior economist, is considered aligned with President Trump, who favors faster reductions in interest rates. The market reaction may be muted because Hassett was already seen as the frontrunner. The field of candidates for the Fed chair has narrowed to a handful of finalists. These include former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. On betting site Polymarket, Hassett’s odds have risen to 53%, Waller holds 22%, and Warsh is at 16%. Investors largely discount any risk to Fed independence, regardless of who takes the helm. Experts emphasize that the chair guides the committee, but the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee ultimately decides on rates. The path of interest rates will continue to depend heavily on fresh U.S. economic data, including labor reports and the administration’s trade and tariff policies. Kevin Hassett may be seen as less independent compared to other candidates, which creates some risk to the dollar and the Treasury yield curve. However, his traditional economics background could limit aggressive dovish moves. Experts caution that Hassett would likely not fully align with political pressures, even if he favors rate cuts more than Powell. The Fed eased rates by a quarter percentage point in both September and October, leaving the Fed funds rate at 3.75–4%. Hassett previously supported a “slow and steady” approach to rate cuts and emphasized that Fed policy must remain independent of political influence. Analysts believe fears of a politicized Fed are overdone, noting Hassett would struggle to push the committee toward aggressive dovishness.

Title: Americans in Ireland think of home at Thanksgiving: ‘There are troubled times over there’

One American couple’s “most memorable” Thanksgiving was when they got caught up in the Dublin riots this time two years ago while out for dinner. Tania Etter from Pennsylvania and her husband Marcus from San Francisco moved to Dublin seven years ago as part of his job. Thanksgiving, which Americans – including those living in Ireland – celebrate today, is his favourite holiday. “American holidays are very commercialised whereas there’s nothing about Thanksgiving other than eat, drink, family and sport,” he says. Thanksgiving has nothing of the “pretentiousness” of other holidays, he adds. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday in November and dates back to 1621 when European settlers, or Pilgrims as they were known, were having trouble growing enough food. Native Americans taught them how to grow crops and the Pilgrims invited them to a feast as a thank-you. The couple were attending a Thanksgiving event with other Americans when the riots broke out in November 2023 and they couldn’t get home. “We walked south of Ranelagh before we finally found a taxi man who we could convince to take us home,” he recalled. “It was an adventure,” added Ms Etter. [ Meet the Americans moving to Ireland for a better lifeOpens in new window ] They have a tradition of putting messages in a stuffed animal known as Terry the Thanksgiving turkey that sits as a table centrepiece. Family and friends write messages of what they are thankful for. The messages become the tail feathers and after dinner, the turkey is plucked and messages read aloud. Marcus is thankful for his Irish citizenship which he received this year and their recent move to their home in Blackrock, south Dublin. “I just went back to America for the first time in four years for our business trip. I can absolutely and unequivocally say I do not miss it,” he said. He misses his family at home but Teams and Zoom calls make it “easier”. This year they will celebrate with a pre-prepared meal at home with their dogs. The Late Late Toy Show has become one of their holiday season traditions. “Our view is you can’t just be American and hold on to all your Americanisms. You’re living in a new culture, a new world, a new society, you need to adopt that.” Molly Coyle Shibley moved to Ireland in 2019. She is grateful to live here but feels “guilty” for family still in the US. Originally from Massachusetts, Coyle Shibley settled in Rathfarnham, south Dublin with her husband Tom while pregnant with their first child Nora after he was offered a job in Dublin. “I’m very grateful to be in Ireland for different reasons every year,” she said. “Last year, we bought a house. This year my husband and daughter’s citizenship applications were approved and I’m applying for mine.” Ms Shibley celebrates with the same group of friends every year. “They have seen my daughter grow up, they’re my family away from home.” Margie O’Rourke has been living in Ireland since 1987 and settled in St Margaret’s in north Dublin, where her husband, who she met in her hometown of Philadelphia, is from. “The major thing with Thanksgiving is family so it’s a weird experience being away from family,” she said. “Most people here are completely unaware it’s Thanksgiving.” She is thankful for her good health and that of her husband and family, and grateful for friends and little things like “the green grass and a cup of tea”. “It took me 10 years to settle here but life is good. There are troubled times over there [in the US],” she said. “Thanksgiving – it’s tradition and it’s part of me.” [ US students drawn to Ireland struck by hard realities of rental marketOpens in new window ] © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The filing, dated November 21, 2025, seeks to raise the limit from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. It would place IBIT options in the same tier as major equities and ETFs such as Apple, NVIDIA, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. “The proposed rule change seeks to dramatically increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 to 1,000,000 contracts,” the filing reads, adding the current cap is “restrictive and hampers legitimate trading and hedging strategies.” A higher limit would allow institutional traders and market makers to establish larger positions, thereby increasing market depth and liquidity for the product. "This will allow institutions to build more interesting structured products for IBIT, increasing the total possible amount of capital that can be allocated to the Bitcoin ETFs," Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fisher8 Capital, told Decrypt. "This should be good for long-term IBIT flows." “This is already the second time Nasdaq has requested an increase in IBIT’s options position limits,” Tim Sun, Senior Researcher at HashKey Group, told Decrypt. The move showcases that institutional demand for Bitcoin derivatives continues to expand as larger players seek to increase their Bitcoin allocations, Sun added. The filing requests an exemption to eliminate limits entirely for customized 'FLEX' options that are physically delivered. This move would “align IBIT with other major commodity-based ETFs and help pull trading activity away from opaque over-the-counter markets,” per the filing. It also cites IBIT's market capitalization of $86.2 billion and an average daily volume of 44.6 million shares as of September 22, 2025, as key factors supporting the proposed change. The ISE proposal is subject to SEC approval, with a public comment period open until December 17, 2025. “IBIT is now the biggest bitcoin options market in the world by open interest,” Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, wrote in a Wednesday tweet. “At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves. Institutional vol is finally here,” Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest Advisors tweeted on Wednesday. The scale of this change is “more modest than most headlines suggest,” Derek Lim, head of research at crypto market-making firm Caladan, told Decrypt. With BlackRock holding over $71 billion in Bitcoin, the increased options limit would allow roughly $5.3 billion, representing about 8% of that total value, which is a standard, conservative practice for large ETFs," Lim added. While the changes have yet to take effect, the adjustment signals that Bitcoin trading is shifting from purely speculative to allocation-driven behavior, the HashKey analyst noted. Despite no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s short-term price, Sun explained it would allow institutions to build Bitcoin positions in a “lower-risk and more controlled manner.” From a volatility standpoint, Lim noted that realized volatility is likely to compress 50 to 100 basis points over the next six to 18 months, which “can translate to marginally higher prices through lower risk premia.” Bitcoin’s rally from $70,000 to $110,000 earlier this year occurred amid declining volatility. That negative correlation marks a fundamental shift, Lim noted, suggesting that if the Nasdaq’s proposed changes come into effect, Bitcoin will increasingly trade like a macro asset and would accelerate this transition. In a related development, BlackRock continues to accumulate Bitcoin exposure in its in-house funds. A separate Wednesday filing revealed its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio increased its IBIT holdings by 14% in Q3 to $155.8 million. Bitcoin hit $91,500 on Wednesday and is up 5% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Title: Nasdaq seeks to ‘super-size’ option limits for BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF

Time Published: 2025-11-27T03:20:26Z

The push from the Nasdaq to increase option limits for the BlackRock Bitcoin fund shows Bitcoin markets are “breaking out of their training wheels.” The Nasdaq International Securities Exchange has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to increase the position limits for options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund to 1 million. Position limits exist to prevent any one investor from controlling too many option contracts on the same stock, thereby reducing the risk of manipulative schemes that could affect prices, according to the notice and copy of the filing from the SEC on Wednesday. The Nasdaq has requested in its Nov. 13 filing to increase the BlackRock ETF limit from 250,000 contracts to 1 million, as the exchange has seen an ongoing increase in demand for IBIT. A lower limit would impede trading activity and the strategies of investors, such as the use of effective hedging vehicles or an income-generating strategy. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, said the SEC is likely to approve the proposal because “these adjustments are routine once an asset proves it can handle real volume. If approved, expect thicker order books, tighter spreads, and a more efficient options market.” Nasdaq previously filed to raise the limit from 25,000 to 250,000 in January because IBIT was well above the trading volume minimum of 100 million shares. Liu said this current push from the Nasdaq to “super-size IBIT option limits shows Bitcoin markets breaking out of their training wheels.” Related: S&P downgrades USDT’s dollar peg rating to lowest score “Bigger bands mean bigger players can finally hedge, size up, and sharpen price discovery. A clear sign that crypto derivatives are shifting from niche to necessary,” he said. Meanwhile, Adam Livingston, a Bitcoin (BTC) analyst and author, said in a series of X posts on Wednesday that the move by Nasdaq places BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF into the same category as the “largest, most liquid equities on Earth,” such as tech giants Apple and Microsoft. “They did it because the market has already decided Bitcoin is a mega-cap asset, whether Washington likes it or not. This is the moment every banker secretly feared,” he said.
