US stocks have led the equity market in recent years and strategists at BlackRock's Investment Institute don't see that narrative changing in 2025. "Currently, across all the scenarios in the outlook, the platform is gravitating towards the US corporate strength scenario, which is another way of calling for US exceptionalism," BlackRock Investment Institute chief investment strategist Wei Li said during a media roundtable on Wednesday. Li cited stronger earnings growth seen in the US this year and the expectation that earnings growth will continue to broaden outside of the "Magnificent Seven" names that have powered the stock market higher over the last two years. This view has been a common refrain from Wall Street firms offering bullish outlooks for 2025 over the last month. "Earnings is almost everything when it comes to longer-term equity returns," Li said, adding the strongest revisions for next year have come from the US and Japan, where BlackRock is also overweight equities. BlackRock's call for continued US exceptionalism has been echoed at other firms on Wall Street during 2025 outlook roundtables. On Monday, Bank of America senior US economist Aditya Bhave told Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal the US economy will likely outperform in 2025. In October, the team at JPMorgan Asset Management said it believes the US's role in the rise of artificial intelligence will help its economy outpace others around the world. The firm said this will result in US equities continuing to dominate globally over the next decade. "We expect extraordinary earnings growth will settle at still-elevated levels for mega-cap tech while reaccelerating in other areas of the market," JPMorgan Asset Management's chief global strategist David Kelly wrote in his team's 2025 outlook. "This broadening, coupled with resilient economic fundamentals, policy tailwinds, and secular trends, should support a more inclusive rally in the year ahead." On a sector level, BlackRock noted Wednesday that Utilities (XLU) should be set to benefit from the broadening of the AI trade due to the increased power demands to operate AI servers. All of this puts BlackRock further overweight US equities headed into 2025 and betting on a "pro-risk" environment in 2025. "In an environment where there's spirit animals that are poignant, it's not clear exactly who's going to take away the punch bowl in this environment," said Jean Boivin, the head of BlackRock's Investment Institute. "We're constructive, we're pro-risk ... But I think we need to be mindful of excessive risk-taking at some point as well down the road." And while BlackRock doesn't issue an S&P 500 target for the year ahead, its bullish stance on US stocks has been reflected across Wall Street's 2025 outlooks. Strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance have issued 2025 year-end S&P 500 targets as low as 6,400 and as high as 7,007. The index closed at 6,086 on Wednesday, meaning the low-end 6,400 target represents about a 5% upside in the benchmark index over the next year. Meanwhile, the high end of forecasts is calling for another 15% gain in the S&P 500 over the next 12 months. Strategists believe another strong year of growth in both the US economy and corporate earnings, combined with a pro-business administration in the White House and Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, will propel stocks higher. In a Tuesday research note detailing his Street-high 7,007 S&P 500 target, Wells Fargo equity strategist Christopher Harvey wrote the data "did not support" a weak or negative year for the S&P 500. "2025 is likely to be a solid-to-strong year," Harvey wrote. Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

Title: W.Va. Rep.-Elect Riley Moore: How GOP Can Deliver for Working-Class Families

Send an email to Bradley. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 election marked the first time in 20 years that a Republican presidential candidate won the popular vote in addition to the electoral vote. The commanding fashion of Trump’s historic comeback was further proof that the political realignment Trump started nearly a decade ago—transforming the Republican Party into the party of the working class—is being further cemented. And it’s no surprise, then, that victors of down-ballot elections are increasingly representing the coalition that now makes up the Republican base. Rep.-elect Riley Moore, R-W.Va., is a perfect example, and he joined me on this week’s episode of “The Signal Sitdown.” Now that the GOP has rebranded itself as a multiracial, working-class party, our conversation particularly focuses on how Republican lawmakers in Washington, D.C., can deliver for their supporters. “People don’t want to monkey around,” Moore said of the incoming Congress. “They don’t want to horse around on any of this stuff. They just want to go. President Trump has got the mandate, and President Trump has got the vision, and that’s what we’re going to work on.” This vision is not only important to the president, but to the American people who, for the first time since President Grover Cleveland in the late 1800s, have sent a former president back to the White House. Though Moore will be a freshman member of Congress, he has experience delivering policy victories for a constituency made of working-class voters as the state treasurer of West Virginia. The Mountain State, which voted 70% for Trump in the 2024 election, is a good encapsulation of the ethos that propelled Trump to the forefront of American politics. His Make America Great Again movement has always felt more like West Virginia than Texas, and for good reason, as West Virginians have shouldered much of the burden for Washington’s globalist immigration, trade, and foreign policies. “We’re tired of being lied to, and we’re tired of being taken advantage of,” Moore said of West Virginians. “I mean, we mine the coal that forged the steel that built the buildings, that built the airplanes and the warships and the rails and everything else that built the United States.” “And what do we get?” Moore added. “An opioid crisis and destroying our coal industry.” For too long, Washington, D.C., has had a “total disregard for the feelings of the people of West Virginia,” Moore told me. “It dates back to [the North American Free Trade Agreement], particularly in my district—northern panhandle specifically would be a great example—where we do a lot of steel manufacturing,” Moore explained. “We had tens of thousands of people working in that industry, obviously. That’s not the case now due to globalization and offshoring and dumping of cheap steel, which, for some reason, people of this town have allowed to happen for successive decades. Letting China into the World Trade Organization, most favored nation status, and all these other things piled on top of it that has really crushed a state like West Virginia.” Fast-forward to President Barack Obama’s tenure, and the destruction accelerated. Due to what Moore calls “environmental extremism,” West Virginia “lost 30,000 coal mining jobs in just a few years due to the Obama administration.” The continued leftward lurch of economic policies from both public and private institutions has only compounded some of West Virginia’s woes. “We had coal operators coming to me saying, ‘I’m losing access to capital. We can’t finance our stuff. No one will bank with us. We’re getting debanked all over the place,’” said Moore, adding: “This [environmental, social, and governance] movement that was destroying West Virginia.” West Virginia responded by chasing out as many ESG-promoting financial institutions from the state as possible, particularly by divesting West Virginia taxpayer dollars from companies like BlackRock. “The working class in West Virginia was like, ‘Yes! Thank you for doing this: fighting for our jobs, fighting for our economy, fighting for our way of life,’” Moore said. Moore said he’s bringing the same mindset with him to Washington. “They did not elect me to get on television and tell them that they’re getting screwed. They already know that. They know that. They elected me to do something about it.” Trust in the legacy media is at an all-time low. That’s because they are out of touch, deliberately lie to the American public, and ignore conservative audiences. By supporting The Daily Signal Institute today, you will help cut through the liberal media spin and provide honest, thorough, and responsible reporting to millions of Americans and decisionmakers in Washington.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM) stands against other AI stocks that will skyrocket. Some investors are heavily scrutinizing Big Tech’s AI spending. Despite these hefty expenditures, Big Tech has been enjoying solid revenues and earnings growth. Yung-Yu Ma, CIO at BMO Wealth Management, recently joined Yahoo Finance to shed light on the overall AI sector outlook heading into 2024. Ma believes that companies are increasing their investments in AI in anticipation of higher returns. He said that it makes sense that the market is less likely to be enthusiastic about this situation. Ma argued that while spending on AI is likely to increase, there is a certainty that the results will soon show, maybe by the end of 2025. He added that the market will probably see healthy earnings growth in 2025. Spending is broadly going to drive these earnings, particularly AI and its different use cases such as data centers, electricity grids, and other infrastructure. He expects an overall growth in valuation and shared that Big Tech is extremely confident and committed to pouring investment into the sector. 2024 has been quite a year for artificial intelligence. Existing startups like Anthropic and Databricks have been performing exceptionally well and transforming the industry. Anthropic is an AI safety and research company behind the OpenAI rival, Claude. On November 24, Anthropic extended its partnership with AWS, involving another $4 billion investment, bringing the total to $8 billion. The partnership also positions AWS as Anthropic’s primary cloud and training partner. Keeping up with the partnership, on December 4, Anthropic began optimizing Claude models to be able to run on AWS Trainium 2. Databricks, the data and AI company, is another AI startup crucial to the AI revolution. Some of the products by Databricks include data management solutions, data warehousing, real-time analytics, data sharing, and data governance. The company is expanding to new heights. On November 6, the company partnered with KT Corporation to boost data and AI innovation in Korea. Following the trend, on November 20, Databricks announced it saw 70% annualized growth in its French business and has launched a new office in central Paris. To come up with AI stocks that will skyrocket, we consulted media reports to shortlist stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well according to analysts and strategists. After consulting 10 similar rankings on the internet we examined the Street-High upside for each stock and picked the ones with the highest upside, as of December 3, 2024. Our list is in ascending order of the street high upside as of December 3, 2024. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment for each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Title: Beef, milk supply TAINTED with new BlackRock-backed animal drug called Bovaer that claims to stop animal farts

Time Published: 2024-12-05T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Beef and dairy cattle are eating the drug, made by DSM-firmenich â BlackRock is a major shareholder in DSM-firmenich, by the way â as part of an effort by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) to decrease animal methane releases and thus cool planetary temperatures. The idea was hatched back in 2006. The FAO started fearmongering about cattle casting a "long shadow" with their flatulence, which comes out slightly warm and stinky much to the chagrin of the globalists who fear that the weather might get too hot if something is not done to cap those smelly fumes. A report issued at that time by the UN claimed that livestock is responsible for 18 percent of the world's greenhouse gases. It turns out this figure was pulled out of a bull's behind, so to speak. (Related: Did you hear that the FDA just approved a new drug called 3-NOP for dairy cattle that supposedly stops them from farting â but at what cost?) Animal farts are normal Dr. Frank Mitloehner, an air quality specialist in the Department of Animal Sciences at UC Davis, says the report and its claims are wildly flawed. And the FAO was later forced to admit that Mitloehner is right. "I must say honestly that he has a point," commented one of the study's authors about Mitloehner's discovery that the paper only looked at "the tailpipe emissions of cars" rather than conduct "a comprehensive life-cycle assessment." "We factored in everything for meat emissions, and we didn't do the same thing with transport â we just used the figure from the IPCC ..." The researchers now admit that while they did conduct a full life-cycle analysis on meat, taking into account both direct and indirect emissions, the only thing factored in as far as the transportation of meat is concerned was direct emissions, "leaving out activities like extracting fuel or the disposal of old cars." "While FAO researchers initially stuck with their 18 percent figure based on their confidence in what makes up total emissions worldwide, a subsequent FAO study calculated global livestock emissions slightly lower, at 14.5 percent." Mitloehner says that the way to create "less heat," if that is what the climate cultists are worried about, is to do "smarter animal farming, not less farming." "Producing less meat and milk will only mean more hunger in poor countries," he warns. It turns out that the original FAO report from 2006 that started all this does not even contain evidence to back the claim that the "livestock sector" is responsible for producing too many greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Much of the public confusion over the supposed role that meat and milk play in climate change is attributable to just two sentences in the report that are printed only in the executive summary and nowhere else in the body of the text: "The livestock sector is a major player, responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents). This is a higher share than transport." Both of these sentences are factually wrong, and yet these false claims serve as the foundation of a decades-long quest by climate lunatics to stamp out animal flatulence and other natural processes that they strangely fear are going to destroy the planet. "Methane emitted by livestock is part of the biogenic carbon cycle, a natural process," Mitloehner says.

It turns out this figure was pulled out of a bull's behind, so to speak. (Related: Did you hear that the FDA just approved a new drug called 3-NOP for dairy cattle that supposedly stops them from farting â but at what cost?) Animal farts are normal Dr. Frank Mitloehner, an air quality specialist in the Department of Animal Sciences at UC Davis, says the report and its claims are wildly flawed. And the FAO was later forced to admit that Mitloehner is right. "I must say honestly that he has a point," commented one of the study's authors about Mitloehner's discovery that the paper only looked at "the tailpipe emissions of cars" rather than conduct "a comprehensive life-cycle assessment." "We factored in everything for meat emissions, and we didn't do the same thing with transport â we just used the figure from the IPCC ..." The researchers now admit that while they did conduct a full life-cycle analysis on meat, taking into account both direct and indirect emissions, the only thing factored in as far as the transportation of meat is concerned was direct emissions, "leaving out activities like extracting fuel or the disposal of old cars." "While FAO researchers initially stuck with their 18 percent figure based on their confidence in what makes up total emissions worldwide, a subsequent FAO study calculated global livestock emissions slightly lower, at 14.5 percent." Mitloehner says that the way to create "less heat," if that is what the climate cultists are worried about, is to do "smarter animal farming, not less farming." "Producing less meat and milk will only mean more hunger in poor countries," he warns. It turns out that the original FAO report from 2006 that started all this does not even contain evidence to back the claim that the "livestock sector" is responsible for producing too many greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. Much of the public confusion over the supposed role that meat and milk play in climate change is attributable to just two sentences in the report that are printed only in the executive summary and nowhere else in the body of the text: "The livestock sector is a major player, responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions measured in CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents). This is a higher share than transport." Both of these sentences are factually wrong, and yet these false claims serve as the foundation of a decades-long quest by climate lunatics to stamp out animal flatulence and other natural processes that they strangely fear are going to destroy the planet. "Methane emitted by livestock is part of the biogenic carbon cycle, a natural process," Mitloehner says.

Title: The most expensive Irish homes sold in 2024: From a Cork estate to a mansion once owned by Jennifer Guinness
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/property/residential/2024/12/05/irelands-most-expensive-homes-of-2024-the-super-prime-residential-market/

Full Content:
Against the backdrop of people raising concerns about high rents and a shortage of affordable housing to canvassing politicians in advance of last Friday’s general election, on the opposite end of the spectrum, Ireland’s super-prime residential market has been motoring on quietly and is showing no sign of slowing down. As the end of 2024 approaches, an examination of the Property Price Register (PPR) shows that approximately 1,235 sales have been completed nationally for sums of €1 million and above. The figure is roughly the same as that transacted until the end of November 2023 and over the same period in 2022. A further inspection of the register shows that approximately 202 sales with a value of €2 million and above were completed in Ireland in the 11-month period to the end of November, while 62 homes changed hands for at least €3 million, with the most valuable sale approaching €30 million. What follows are the top 10 residential sales by value this year. Where they appear on the register, the recorded figure reflects the amount paid for the principal residence and up to an acre of land. When a residential property sale includes more than an acre of land, the value of that extra land is not included on the register; we have marked the sale prices of these homes with an asterisk. A few miles upstream from Youghal in east Cork is Ballynatray House, a late Georgian estate set on 850 acres, located on a bend in the river Blackwater, which achieved €29.25 million, according to the PPR. It is understood to have been sold off-market last February, making it the most valuable transaction to have taken place in the Irish residential market so far this year. The PPR does not take into account the 850 acres of land included in the property, with some reports estimating the full sale price to be in the region of €32 million to €35 million. Situated where the river is at its most expansive, the 11-bay, two-storey-over-basement classical-style house is understood to have been bought by British vacuum-cleaner magnate, James Dyson. Ballynatray House was built between 1795 and 1797 on a symmetrical plan incorporating the fabric of an earlier house (built circa 1700), and includes ruins of an ancient abbey as well as estate houses. The property last came to market in March 2003, when it was purchased for over €11 million by property investor Henry Gwyn-Jones, along with 400 acres of land. Gwyn-Jones bought it from French aristocrats Serge and Henriette Boissevain, who had bought Ballynatray in 1995 when the then-1,000-acre estate sold for about £1.5 million. It is said the Boissevains entertained many of Europe’s best and brightest at the residence, including Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, known as Princess TNT, whom one local recalls being photographed on the lawns for a glossy fashion magazine. The grounds of Ballynatray House also featured in the 1975 Stanley Kubrick movie Barry Lyndon, which starred Ryan O’Neal. Censure House was launched to the market seeking €15 million in May, 2022. When it didn’t sell at that price, it is understood to have gone through a number of agents before being sold by Lisney for €10 million (17 per cent below its €12.5 million guide price) in March of this year, according to the PPR. It is a six-bedroom property extending to 1,365sq m (14,700sq ft), with a lift for simple transportation to all floors, and a self-contained one-bedroom apartment. The apartment was built on the site of an existing Regency villa, named Ceanchor House, which once belonged to the late socialite Jennifer Guinness. Nestled into the rock face, the property is sheltered from the elements by mature trees, while it maintains sea views to its south, east and west. It also abuts the cliff walk, so, despite the elevation, you can exit a gate and nip down the cliffs to take a dip in the sea at Jameson Beach, one of Howth’s few south-facing swimming spots, within a matter of minutes. Read our full review here A decade ago, when it last went on the market, Victoria House also made the list of the 10 most expensive house sales of the year. It was purchased for €4.41 million, according to the PPR, and has since been extensively remodelled and extended by its most recent owners. It was brought to market last April by Sherry FitzGerald, seeking €10 million – a sum which it achieved in September, according to the PPR. The vendors of the classic Victorian restored its coving, cornicing and ceiling roses and had engineers reinforce the feature staircase. They also engaged Bloom-gold-medal-winning landscape architect Jane McCorkell to reimagine the beautiful south-facing back garden. Set on the sunny side of this embassy belt road and extending to 550sq m (5,901sq ft), the six-bedroom residence backs on to the German ambassador’s residence, Danesfield, set on four acres. Read our full review here Melbeach was sold off-market deal by Inhous. Set over three floors, the six-bedroom house extends to about 743sq m (8,000 sq ft) with sea views from its kitchen, livingroom and diningroom. Daniel Lanois, who produced U2′s 1987 album, The Joshua Tree, alongside Brian Eno, told Hot Press in 2007 that Melbeach was where songs such as Mothers of the Disappeared and Bullet the Blue Sky were born, when it was owned by The Edge. Rarc An Ilan came to market in October 2023 seeking €8 million, and sold for €7.5 million (6 per cent below the guide price) last June, through Knight Frank, according to the PPR. Despite it looking like it has been in situ since Georgian times, the house dates from 1993 when it was purchased by accountant and businessman Howard Kilroy, whom Michael Smurfit described in his autobiography, A Life Worth Living, as “his long-time colleague”. It is understood Kilroy knocked an existing house and built this period-looking home of 318sq m (3,423sq ft) on the 0.6-acre site. Roscommon-based architectural firm Udo Humborg Associates was engaged to ensure original features, such as the old granite steps, lion’s heads and chimney pots, were reinstated. Along with maritime views, Rarc An Ilan offers direct access to the sea, where the water pools in the granite rocks. The new owner is understood to be a tech professional, and will find themself in good company in Dalkey, which Daft research found to be the area with the highest concentration of property millionaires as of 2018. Read our full review here One of the largest properties on Dublin 6′s Dartry Road, and once the childhood home of the late former taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, it is understood Lonsdale has been acquired in an off-market sale conducted by Inhous. Dating from 1884, the detached six-bedroom home, extending to 791sq m (8,514sq ft), is also one of the oldest holdings on the road. The granite-porticoed house comes with half an acre of gardens plus significant frontage to the road and includes an old coach and mews house. A fine example of the classical Victorian revival, it is fitting that the residence has been bought by the Italian embassy as the ambassador’s residence. “There was some domestic interest in the property but they weren’t coming up to the asking price,” says selling agent Barbara Carty. She says it is likely that events will be hosted there, pointing out that there is “half an acre to put up marquees”. Read more here Waverley is a seven-bedroom detached house on an acre of impressive gardens, which came to market seeking €8.45 million in April 2023 through Sherry FitzGerald. It then sold for €7.255 million last July, according to the PPR, 14 per cent below the asking price. Designed for entertaining, and previously rented as an embassy residence, one can picture pyramids of Ferrero Rocher being served while those gathered sip cocktails and explore the vast house and stylish grounds. The vendors bought the premises in the middle of the property boom in 2005 for €7.2 million, then set about completely revamping it: “We kept one or two things,” they told The Irish Times – the double-height nine-panelled front window with a sandstone surround and the portico leading to the front door, for example. But they changed much of the rest of the house, working with architectural firm Frank Ennis & Associates and designer Suzanne Roche. Built in 1999 to look like a stately period home, the completely modern house extends to 698sq m (7513sq ft), has B1 Ber, triple-glazed windows, geothermal central heating and underfloor heating on the ground and first floors. A balcony off the principal bedroom overlooks the back garden and beyond it, Foxrock golf club, on to which the property backs. It has a 46sq m (500sq ft) well-equipped home gym in the building at the bottom of the garden as well as a detached executive office. The garden of Waverley was designed first by Diarmuid Gavin and later by Paul Doyle. It is tended to twice a week by a gardener. Read our full review here Lansdowne Place in Dublin 4 continues to attract buyers with deep pockets. The highest-value sale at the scheme was recorded at €7 million in 2023, with the second most expensive unit, 21 The Templeton – a seventh-floor, three-bedroom penthouse – selling for €6.6 million through joint agents Sherry FitzGerald New Homes and Savills in May this year. The penthouse’s new owner will enjoy floor-to-ceiling vistas of the city in a vast space that extends to 320sq m (3,454sq ft) and includes a terrace of 17sq m (189sq ft), big enough to fit a table for 12. However, it is the further 174sq m (1,879sq ft) of roof terrace above that deliver wow-factor views to the mountains and sea. The owner may even bump into high-profile fellow residents of the scheme, such as pop star Rod Stewart or former Republic of Ireland and Manchester United captain Roy Keane. Read more here Number 3 Churchfields at the K Club is a five-bedroom detached Regency-style residence, extending to 582sq m (6,246sq ft), that was constructed in the late 1990s. The property also contains a detached garage and an annexe which is currently used as a gym studio. It was sold in September for €6 million, according to the PPR, in an off-market deal. It is understood John Bosco French of French Estates advised on the deal. Originally owned by the late racehorse trainer Vincent O’Brien and his wife, Jacqueline, the house may be familiar to hawk-eyed analysts of the PPR as it is listed as having sold for €2.3 million in May 2017 and again for €2.825m in December 2020, and has since been extensively refurbished. Rathbeale Hall in Swords sold for €5.875m in April, according to the PPR. The property is listed on the National Built Heritage Service website as one of architectural, archaeological and artistic note. Dating from about 1680, the detached five-bay, three-storey-over-basement pile was remodelled in 1750 to incorporate a Palladian facade along with flanking wings of two storeys each. It was further extended in 1850 to include a two-storey kitchen block. Kilree Estate, Kilree, Co Kilkenny. (On 535 acres.) Sale price: €1.2m*. Agent: Savills. Property including land understood to have sold for €7.75m. Killough Castle and Farm, Thurles, Co Tipperary. (On 527 acres.) Sale price: €505,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for in excess of €6.39m asking price. Tullyard House and Farm, Trim, Co. Meath. (On 189 acres.) Sale price: €900,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for slightly under €3.85m asking price. Rathduff Stud, Golden, Cashel, Co Tipperary. (On 95 acres.) Sale price: €850,000*. Agent: Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes. Property including land understood to have sold for €2.675m at auction. Sherry FitzGerald Country Homes reports the sale of Dowth Hall on 11 acres in Co Meath, which it says closed in January 2024, at a price of €11m. The sale has yet to appear on the PPR. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Bitcoin rose above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Donald Trump as US president has spurred expectations that his administration will create a friendly environment for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up about 45% in the four weeks since Trump’s sweeping election victory on Nov 5, when a number of pro-crypto lawmakers were also elected to Congress. Bitcoin was trading around $102,600 (3.51 million baht) late Thursday morning Thailand time. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of the US crypto firm Galaxy Digital. “This momentum is fueled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path.” More than 16 years after its creation, bitcoin appears on the cusp of mainstream acceptance, despite naysayers and a history of controversies. “Bitcoin crossing $100,000 is more than just a milestone; it’s a testament to shifting tides in finance, technology, and geopolitics,” said Justin D’Anethan, a Hong Kong-based crypto analyst. “The figure not that long ago dismissed as fantasy, stands as a reality.” For years a sceptic about crypto, Trump embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the “crypto capital of the planet” and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. Crypto investors see an end to increased scrutiny under US Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler, who said last week he would step down in January when Trump takes office. On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Paul Atkins to run the SEC. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner, has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to “develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms”, and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. A number of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are jostling for a seat on Trump’s promised crypto advisory council, seeking a say in his planned overhaul of policy, according to digital asset industry executives. Trump’s businesses may also have a stake in the sector. He unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September. Although details about the business have been scarce, investors have taken his personal interest in the sector as a bullish signal. Trump’s social media company is in advanced talks to buy the crypto trading firm Bakkt, the Financial Times reported last week, citing two people with knowledge of the talks. Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates Truth Social, is close to an all-stock acquisition of Bakkt, according to the FT report. Billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s rebound from a slide below $16,000 in late 2022 has been rapid, boosted by the approval of US-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January this year. The SEC had long attempted to block ETFs from investing in bitcoin, citing investor protection concerns, but the products have allowed more investors, including institutional investors, to gain exposure to bitcoin. More than $4 billion has streamed into US-listed bitcoin ETFs since the election. “We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov 5, US investors resumed buying hand-over-fist,” said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. There was a strong debut for options on a BlackRock ETF in November with call options — bets on the price going up — substantially more popular than puts. McCann calculated the put to call ratio at about 22 to one. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in the bitcoin miner Mara Holdings up around 65% in November. Yet the rise is not without critics. Two years ago, the industry was wracked by scandal with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange and the jailing of its founder Sam Bankman-Fried. The cryptocurrency industry also has been criticised for its staggering energy usage, while crypto crime remains a concern, too. Market participants are keeping a close eye on what happens now that bitcoin has broken above $100,000, with investors and speculators possibly looking to pocket some of their recent gains. “But once we flush out those sell orders, this could go higher still, and very rapidly,” said Steven McClurg, the founder of Canary Capital, a digital assets investment firm. He said he expects bitcoin to hit $120,000 by Christmas.

Title: SolarZero collapse: Willis demands more answers from NZGIF, Crown agency says BlackRock caught it on the hop

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Finance Minister Nicola Willis says she still has multiple questions about Crown-backed NZ Green Investment Finance's $145 million credit line for SolarZero installs. Photo / Mark Mitchell A fact-finding day on SolarZero’s collapse has only led to more questions. The Kiwi-founded firm, bought by US private equity giant BlackRock for $110 million in mid-2022, went into liquidation on Tuesday last week, owing more than $40m, including $4.1m to tradies and a similar amount to staff in holiday and notice pay. In August, the NZ Green Investment Fund (NZGIF) set up by the previous Government said it had extended the debt facility it provided to SolarZero to $145m as part of wider credit arrangements involving international lenders that totalled $365m. NZGIF said SolarZero had drawn down $110m by the time of its liquidation. On Thursday morning, NZGIF chairwoman Cecilia Tarrant met with Finance Minister Nicola Willis and Climate Change Minister Simon Watts. Shortly after the meeting, Willis’ office sent a statement saying, “Nicola Willis conveyed her expectation that NZGIF will be publicly accountable for the investment it has made.” She still has questions about: “The failure of SolarZero raised questions about taxpayers’ money being used in this way and those are questions ministers will be giving consideration to,” the statement said. Willis sought assurances about NZGIF’s other investments. These include solar farm start-up Lodestone Energy, to which it provided a $15m working capital facility in FY24. “This facility remains current,” a spokesman told the Herald this afternoon. A full list of its investments has been posted online here. While its various SolarZero debt facilities have been easily the largest bits of business for the self-styled “green bank” (it is not a registered bank), NZGIF has also extended chunky credit lines to EV fleet leasing firm Carbn ($42.4m), UK firm Zenobe ($20m), which is doing work on electrification of businesses in NZ, solar farm firms Far North Solar Farm ($78m) and Lodestone Energy ($15m). And although a lot of NZGIF’s dealings have been with startups, it has also done business with established players including a $1.2m debit facility for Genesis Energy (”to help industry switch from fossil fuels”), a $10m mezzanine debt facility to NZ Post to co-finance $10m spent on electric vans and a $15m “green credit facility” to CentrePort for “accelerating projects to decarbonise Wellington’s port”. As she emerged from her meeting with Willis and Watts, Tarrant initially refused to comment, then said to Newstalk ZB’s Jason Walls: “We do feel very bad, as we all do, about the people who have lost their jobs, but we did not lend to SolarZero the company and we are not responsible for what the company has done.” Tarrant said: “Let’s step back a minute and understand that we did not lend to SolarZero itself. We lent on the receivables; the panels and batteries that were installed on people’s houses and those contracts. Those customers are fine. They are now being serviced by Verofi as the standby servicer who has stepped in to take over from SolarZero.” The NZGIF debt was securitised and held by two special-purpose vehicles, both of which were taken over by the Public Trust shortly before the liquidation. The special purpose vehicles are not in liquidation. The first liquidators report says: “The Liquidators understand that SZL [SolarZero Limited] had underwritten certain aspects of the securitisation, resulting in unsustainable regular payments to the SPVs.” Later on Thursday, Tarrant added in a statement: “Our Shareholding Ministers rightly have questions about how this all happened, and so do we. The change in stance from SolarZero’s owner BlackRock came as a surprise to NZGIF and other lenders, and indeed appears to have caught SolarZero’s CEO off guard given recent public comments. “We are extremely frustrated by this outcome. NZGIF and other international lenders worked to support the growth of this business. BlackRock has not explained its sudden change in stance toward this company, which has severely impacted its staff, suppliers, contractors and partners. “Prior to early November we had no indication from the SolarZero board or BlackRock that the company did not have the support of its owner, which had been funding the ongoing operation of the group. NZGIF takes an active role in monitoring and engaging with investee and client companies and it is fair to say we, along with staff, suppliers and customers, have been shocked by BlackRock’s decision to place the company in liquidation,” Tarrant said. An NZGIF spokesman said earlier that it had less than a day’s notice of BlackRock’s intent to liquidate. The Herald has asked BlackRock for comment. The first liquidators’ report revealed that beyond the $110m it paid for SolarZero, the private equity firm had “injected significant additional capital to the group since its 2022 acquisition, totalling $147.8m”. Liquidators Russell Moore and Stephen Keen, both of Grant Thornton, said the firm had never been profitable. The pair said the total amount owing was still being established. It was not clear at this point if there would be funds to pay secured creditors. Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team.

Title: To $100,000 and beyond: Bitcoin's wild ride
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/to-100000-and-beyond-bitcoins-wild-ride-3755665

(Reuters) -Bitcoin broke above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday as the election of Republican Donald Trump as president fuelled bets that his administration will create a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The world's biggest and best-known cryptocurrency has more than doubled from this year's low of $38,505 and is up over 50% since Trump's sweeping election win in early November. Here are key events in bitcoin's journey towards $100,000 and beyond: 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the cryptocurrency's presumed developer, introduces the concept of bitcoin 2010: The first retail transaction takes place when a user pays 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John's (NASDAQ:PZZA) pizzas 2013: As bitcoin's popularity grows, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of crypto exchange Gemini, file their first application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to create a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale Investments launches the Bitcoin Investment Trust, an open-ended private bitcoin trust. 2016: The Winklevoss brothers adjust their application numerous times, such as the exchange on which the product would be traded. They also file amendments naming State Street (NYSE:STT) as administrator. Grayscale files with the SEC to convert its bitcoin trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2017: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss application on the grounds bitcoin markets were not mature enough. Grayscale withdraws its first attempt to convert its trust into an ETF, saying the regulatory environment was not developed enough. 2018: The SEC rejects the Winklevoss twins' second application to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, saying cryptocurrency exchanges do not have the necessary controls to prevent manipulation. 2020: Grayscale transforms its trust into an SEC-reporting entity, and its shares begin trading on the pink sheets, for stocks that trade over the counter. Although not an ETF, it is the first publicly traded bitcoin fund in the U.S. 2021: The first spot bitcoin ETF launches in Canada. Gary Gensler replaces Jay Clayton as SEC chair in April. In October, the SEC approves the ProShares Bitcoin Trust listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, noting the CME has a satisfactory mechanism for surveilling abuse in the futures market. It is the first U.S.-listed futures-based bitcoin ETF, accumulating $1 billion in assets within its first days of trading - faster than any other ETF. Also in October, Grayscale again submits an application to the SEC to convert its trust into a spot bitcoin ETF. 2022: The SEC rejects several applications from would-be spot bitcoin ETF issuers, including SkyBridge, Fidelity and Bitwise. The SEC also rejects Grayscale's application, prompting the company to sue the agency. Amid crashing crypto prices, multiple crypto companies file for bankruptcy, including Three Arrows Capital, Celsius Network and FTX, whose founder Sam Bankman-Fried is also charged with fraud. 2023: May: Cathie Woods' ARK Investments and CBOE Global Markets file for a spot bitcoin ETF, giving the SEC a maximum of 240 days to approve or reject the application. June: BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) files a spot bitcoin ETF application with the SEC, raising industry hopes the agency may approve the product and sending the price of bitcoin to a one-year high. A flurry of other issuers and exchanges, including Fidelity and Invesco, file bitcoin ETF applications in the subsequent weeks and months. August: A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. rules in favour of Grayscale, saying the SEC did not justify why it had rejected its proposal. Europe's first spot bitcoin ETF begins trading on the Euronext (EPA:ENX) Amsterdam stock exchange. October: The SEC opts not to appeal the court's ruling in the Grayscale case and is required to reexamine the application. 2024: Jan. 10: The SEC approves 11 proposals from issuers including BlackRock, Fidelity and VanEck, among others, to launch spot bitcoin ETFs. February: Net inflows into the 10 largest ETFs hit $4 billion in the first month, according to LSEG data. March: Bitcoin tops $70,000 for the first time to hit a record high, having doubled in value in the five months. June: Trump pitches himself as a champion for cryptocurrency and slammed Democrats' attempts to regulate the sector during a San Francisco fundraiser. July: Trump tells a bitcoin conference that, if elected, he will create a strategic national bitcoin stockpile and will ensure the United States is the "crypto capital of the planet." October: The SEC grants "accelerated approval" to U.S. exchanges to list and trade options tied to 11 spot bitcoin ETFs. Nov 6: Trump is declared winner of the presidential election, sparking a huge rally in a range of assets, with bitcoin being the standout gainer. Nov 12: Total (EPA:TTEF) crypto market cap tops $3 trillion. Year-to-date ETF net inflows hit $25.8 billion, according to LSEG data. Nov 21: Bitcoin nears $100,000 for the first time in history, driven by a swell of buying from investors in anticipation of Trump dismantling a lot of the regulation around crypto investment. Dec. 5: Bitcoin soars past $100,000 for the first time, taking its gains for the year to over 140%.

Latest Topics The Nightly Topics The price of bitcoin soared past the long-awaited $US100,000 benchmark for the first time ever late Wednesday evening. The flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by more than 5 per cent at $101,072.00, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it rose as high as $101,555.40. The move came hours after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a move viewed by the crypto community as being in keeping with his promise not just to replace Gary Gensler — who has become something of a villain in crypto for the agency’s regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry under his leadership — but to set up a more supportive regulatory environment for the crypto industry more broadly.

In the same day, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said bitcoin is “just like gold only it’s virtual, it’s digital,” speaking at the DealBook conference. He further clarified that “people are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value” and that “it’s not a competitor for the dollar, it’s really a competitor for gold.” It’s a day of celebration for longtime bitcoin investors, who have held on for dear life, or “HODL’d” through several of the cryptocurrency’s boom and bust cycles, during which government and financial institutions remained dismissive — and even hostile — toward the asset class. That’s largely because of the cryptocurrency’s anti-establishment roots. The original idea for Bitcoin was proposed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis: a “peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution,” its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote in the Bitcoin Whitepaper. In recent years, however, the industry has demonstrated the value of bitcoin to much of the institutional investing world. BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and others launched the first spot bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of this year — bitcoin’s “IPO” moment — and the growing demand for them by institutions has helped drive the price higher. In November, Rick Wurster, the incoming CEO of Charles Schwab, said the firm is preparing to enter spot crypto trading, pending regulatory changes expected in the next Trump administration. “We’re witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream,” Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC. Bitcoin has been widely expected to reach the landmark $100,000 level since the U.S. presidential election. However, excited investors sent bitcoin closer to this mark much sooner than initially anticipated; it rose as high as $99,849.99 on Nov. 22. There is much hope that President-elect Donald Trump will deliver on several pro-crypto initiatives in the year ahead – including the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve or stockpile, no taxes on crypto transactions and opening up the crypto public equity markets with more IPOs. “Over the long term, I’m bullish,” Novogratz added. “It won’t be a straight line up, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it’ll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice.” Copy Link Copied Government accused of inflaming anti-Semitism as Australian Jews become targets of ‘domestic terrorism’.

The price of Bitcoin has for the first time broken past the $100,000 mark, hitting a new record high. The value of the world's biggest cryptocurrency has been boosted by hopes US President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies. The milestone was reached hours after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator. Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler. The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world. Bitcoin's wildly fluctuating value has always attracted interest, with its backers reacting with delight when it has passed previous price thresholds - and defiance during its slumps. But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world. Millions of viewers even tuned in to online watch parties as the price hovered close to $100k. The value of a single bitcoin is one of the barometers of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry which is now estimated to be worth $3.3tn, according to analysis firm Coin Market Cap. Trump's election victory last month was the catalyst for the latest surge. The president-elect has vowed to make the US "the crypto capital of the planet" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a "scam." Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at. But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value. From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes. So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history. Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email. Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers. But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out. In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information. Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi. Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him. Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza. On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas. A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day. A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online. Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin. The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars! In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender. Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country. While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped. He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country. As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years. The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country. It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value. A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value. In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions. These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part. Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves. At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment. But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts. Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth. Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact. Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (£78m) - and then accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details. That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline. Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him. He told the BBC: "It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling." No-one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community. FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days. Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research. Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: "I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was." After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years. Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies. In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any. Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs. It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined. Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold. Ann Jensen, from Salisbury, was tricked into investing by a deepfake of Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Justin Sun described Maurizio Cattelan's infamous 2019 work as "much better than other bananas". New evidence suggests the YouTuber promoted investments without revealing his financial interest in them. James Howells accidentally threw out his hard drive in 2013 and has been searching for it ever since. Ilya Lichtenstein laundered the stolen cryptocurrency with his wife Heather Morgan aka Razzlekhan. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

By Thursday afternoon, the flagship cryptocurrency pulled back from the milestone. It was recently higher by 0.28% at $99,140.00, according to Coin Metrics, trading at the lows of Thursday's trading following some profit taking by investors. On Wednesday night, it rose as high as $103,844.05. The move came after President-elect Donald Trump announced plans to nominate Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The appointment could fulfill Trump's most important campaign promise to the crypto industry: to replace Gary Gensler, who has become something of a villain in crypto for the agency's regulation-by-enforcement approach to the industry under his leadership. Trump congratulated bitcoiners in a Truth Social post Thursday morning, saying "you're welcome" for his part in helping send bitcoin to $100,000 and that "together, we will make America great again." It's a day of celebration for longtime bitcoin investors, who have held on for dear life, or "HODL'd" through several of the cryptocurrency's boom-and-bust cycles, during which government and financial institutions remained dismissive — and even hostile — toward the asset class. That's largely because of the cryptocurrency's anti-establishment roots. The original idea for bitcoin was proposed at the height of the 2008 financial crisis: a "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution," its founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote in the Bitcoin Whitepaper. In recent years, however, the industry has demonstrated the value of bitcoin to much of the institutional investing world. BlackRock, Fidelity, Invesco and others launched the first spot bitcoin ETFs at the beginning of this year — bitcoin's "IPO" moment — and the growing demand for them by institutions has helped drive the price higher. In November, Rick Wurster, the incoming CEO of Charles Schwab, said the firm is preparing to enter spot crypto trading, pending regulatory changes expected in the next Trump administration. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said bitcoin is "just like gold, only it's virtual, it's digital," speaking at the DealBook conference. He further clarified that "people are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value" and that "it's not a competitor for the dollar, it's really a competitor for gold." "We're witnessing a paradigm shift. After four years of political purgatory, bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream," Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, told CNBC. Bitcoin had been widely expected to reach the landmark $100,000 level since the U.S. presidential election. However, excited investors sent bitcoin closer to this mark much sooner than initially anticipated; it rose as high as $99,849.99 on Nov. 22. There is much hope that Trump will deliver on several pro-crypto initiatives in the year ahead — including the establishment of a national strategic bitcoin reserve or stockpile, no taxes on crypto transactions and opening up the crypto public equity markets with more IPOs. "Over the long term, I'm bullish," Novogratz added. "It won't be a straight line up, and investors should always consider taking gains off the table. But, with a pro-crypto administration about to take charge in the U.S., it'll be hard for the rest of the world not to take notice." Bitcoin is now up more than 133% in 2024 and 42% since the election. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Bitcoin Hits Major Milestone of $100K, Nears $2 Trillion Market Value

Bitcoin's price has surged past the $100,000 mark for the first time in its history, fueled by institutional demand, corporate accumulation and heightened expectations of crypto-friendly policies under Donald Trump's presidency. Now ahead about 130% year-to-date, bitcoin's market capitalization has risen to just shy of $2 trillion only 15 years after coming into existence. For reference, Nvidia and Apple sport market caps of about $3.5 trillion, Microsoft $3 trillion, and Google and Amazon $2.2 trillion. The market capitalization of all the gold in the world is roughly $17.7 trillion. At the forefront of this rally was the early-2024 launch of spot-based bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) by asset management giants including BlackRock and Fidelity. These products have been a resounding success, securing assets under management of around $30 billion in less than one year's time. Despite the success of the ETFs, the move higher in bitcoin seemingly stalled throughout a large chunk of this year, at least in part thanks to regulatory uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election. The early November victory of crypto-friendly Donald Trump, though, spurred new legs for the rally, with bitcoin quickly taking out its March high above $73,500, then in fast time moving past $80,000, then $90,000, and finally $100,000 just minutes ago. Read more: Crypto Foe and SEC Chair Gary Gensler Will Quit When Trump Takes Office Another large part of the bull story is growing corporate adoption, led by MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. The company — which began its bitcoin purchases in August 2020 — has continued to raise billions of dollars to deploy into bitcoin, taking its holdings to 386,700 tokens which are now worth more than $38 billion. Saylor and team have inspired other publicly traded companies, U.S.-listed Semler Scientific and Japan-listed Metaplanet among them, to pursue similar strategies. Even tech giant Microsoft has a proposal before its board as to whether it should pursue a bitcoin treasury strategy.

Title: Bitcoin tops $100,000 on optimism over Trump crypto plans

(Reuters) -Bitcoin catapulted above $100,000 for the first time on Thursday, a milestone hailed even by sceptics as a coming-of-age for digital assets as investors bet on a friendly U.S. administration to cement the place of cryptocurrencies in financial markets. Once it broke $100,000 in Thursday's Asian morning, boosted by U.S. President-elect Trump's nomination of pro-crypto Paul Atkins to run the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was soon at an all-time high of $103,649. It last fetched $98,803, up 0.95% on the day. The total value of the cryptocurrency market has almost doubled over the year so far to hit a record over $3.8 trillion, according to data provider CoinGecko. By comparison, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) alone is worth about $3.7 trillion. Bitcoin's march from the libertarian fringe to Wall Street has minted millionaires, a new asset class and popularised the concept of "decentralised finance" in a volatile and often controversial period since its creation 16 years ago. Bitcoin has more than doubled in value this year and is up more than 50% in the four weeks since Donald Trump's sweeping election victory, which also saw a slew of pro-crypto lawmakers being elected to Congress. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU’RE WELCOME!!! Together, we will Make America Great Again!" Trump said on Truth Social, his social media network, on Thursday. "We're witnessing a paradigm shift," said Mike Novogratz, founder and CEO of U.S. crypto firm Galaxy Digital (TSX:GLXY). "Bitcoin and the entire digital asset ecosystem are on the brink of entering the financial mainstream - this momentum is fuelled by institutional adoption, advancements in tokenisation and payments, and a clearer regulatory path." Trump - who once labelled crypto a scam - embraced digital assets during his campaign, promising to make the United States the "crypto capital of the planet" and to accumulate a national stockpile of bitcoin. "We were trading basically sideways for about seven months, then immediately after Nov. 5, U.S. investors resumed buying hand-over-fist," said Joe McCann, CEO and founder of Asymmetric, a Miami digital assets hedge fund. Bitcoin's proponents cheered Trump's nomination of Atkins to the SEC. A former SEC commissioner, Atkins has been involved in crypto policy as co-chair of the Token Alliance, which works to "develop best practices for digital asset issuances and trading platforms," and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. "Atkins will offer a new perspective, anchored by a deep understanding of the digital asset ecosystem," said Blockchain Association CEO Kristin Smith. "We look forward to working with him ... and ushering in – together – a new wave of American crypto innovation." A slew of crypto companies including Ripple, Kraken and Circle are also jostling for a seat on Trump's promised crypto advisory council. PART OF THE LANDSCAPE Bitcoin has proven a survivor through precipitous downturns. Its move into six-figure territory is a remarkable comeback from a dip below $16,000 in 2022 when the industry was reeling from the collapse of the FTX exchange. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried was subsequently jailed. Analysts say the growing embrace of bitcoin by big investors this year has been a driving force behind the record-breaking rally. U.S.-listed bitcoin exchange-traded funds were approved in January and have been a conduit for large-scale buying, with more than $4 billion streaming into these funds since the election. "Roughly 3% of the total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist have been purchased in 2024 by institutional money," said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF). "Digital assets, as an asset class, is becoming normalised," he said. It is already becoming increasingly financialised, with the launch of bitcoin futures in 2017 and a strong debut for options on BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s ETF in November. Crypto-related stocks have soared along with the bitcoin price, with shares in bitcoin miner MARA Holdings and exchange operator Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) each up around 65% in November. Software (ETR:SOWGn) firm Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), which has repeatedly raised funds to buy bitcoin and held an aggregate of about 402,100 bitcoins as of Dec. 1, has gained around 540% this year. Trump himself unveiled a new crypto business, World Liberty Financial, in September, although details have been scarce and billionaire Elon Musk, a major Trump ally, is also a proponent of cryptocurrencies. Some say the asset remains a speculative or investment vehicle and not an instrument for payments. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell likened bitcoin to gold, “only it's virtual, it's digital." "People are not using it as a form of payment, or as a store of value. It's highly volatile, it’s not a competitor for the dollar." While earlier big bitcoin rallies have been followed by significant pullbacks, its wider adoption now may help tamp down volatility, analysts said. "That is not to say that there will not be 30-50% drawdowns over time, but my base case is that the nature of the drawdowns will be less severe than what we saw in the last bear market," Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said. "Passive flows into ETFs, a liquid options market, corporate treasury adoption, and nation state adoption will likely play a large role in dampening volatility," Farrell said. 'WHO CAN PROHIBIT IT' Cryptocurrencies have been criticised for their massive energy consumption and use in crime around the world, and the underlying technology is far from delivering a revolution in the way money moves around the globe. The U.S. and Britain announced on Wednesday they had disrupted what they described as a global money laundering ring which used cryptocurrency to help rich Russians to evade sanctions and launder cash for drug traffickers. Although calculations vary, the Cambridge University Centre for Alternative Finance estimates bitcoin uses around the same amount of electricity each year as Poland or South Africa. Still, as Russian President Vladimir Putin pointed out at an investment conference on Wednesday: "Who can prohibit it? No one." And its longevity is perhaps testament to a degree of resilience. "As time goes by it's proving itself as part of the financial landscape," said Shane Oliver, chief economist and head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) in Sydney. "I find it very hard to value it ... it's anyone's guess. But it does have a momentum aspect to it and at the moment the momentum is up."

Title: Bitcoin Whale Resurfaces After 11 Years After Its BTC’s Value Rose Over 15,000%
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/bitcoin-whale-resurfaces-after-11-years-after-its-btcs-value-rose-over-15000/

A Bitcoin whale that had been inactive for 11 years has resurfaced with a transaction of around $257 million in BTC after seeing the price of their holdings surge by over 15,300% since their last action. According to data shared by on-chain analysis service Lookonchain, the long-dormant Bitcoin whale received 2,700 BTC back in December 2013 when the price of the cryptocurrency was at $625.84. Since then, BTC’s price rose more than 15,300% to now stand at $96,320. Bitcoin whale movements are notable as they can influence the price of the flagship cryptocurrency, with whales from around the era of BTC creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who disappeared back in 2010, being especially influential and closely watched. The whale resurfaced at a time in which the total amount of Bitcoin exchange reserves has dropped to its lowest level in years after massive outflows have been seen since the US presidential election in early November led to a massive cryptocurrency market rally. According to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 171,000 BTC have moved off of cryptocurrency trading platforms since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the election, leading to a market rally given his pro-crypto stance during the campaign. As CryptoGlobe reported, Bitcoin whales have been steadily accumulating over the last few weeks as BTC trades below the psychological resistance level around $100,000. CryptoQuant data shows that 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day late last month. A lower amount of Bitcoin on exchanges suggests that there is less supply available on the market, which if coupled with steady or rising demand could lead to a cryptocurrency price rise. The price of Bitcoin has been strolling to surpass the $100,000 psychological barrier after surging exponentially after Trump secured the US elections. The cryptocurrency is, at the time of writing, trading at $96.700 after moving up more than 40% in the last month. While whales are accumulating, the total holdings of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have grown to surpass the 500,000 BTC mark. Another entity heavily accumulating the flagship cryptocurrency is Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which accumulated an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion earlier this month to bring its total BTC holdings above the 400,000 threshold.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In this article, we’ll be summarizing a bullish thesis posted on VIC covering Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (NYSE:ASPN) in October, when the stock was trading at $21.86. Currently, ASPN stock is trading at $14.83, which shows that the stock has dipped since the publication of this thesis. Nonetheless, ASPN stock is now trading at a forward PE ratio (non-GAAP) of 38.44, and the stock is trading at 2.70 times, forward sales estimates. A technician meticulously inspecting a corrosion-resistant insulation panel for a fire-protection system. As a leading proponent of aerogel technology, Aspen Aerogels, Inc. (ASPN) offers cutting-edge thermal management solutions for sectors including sustainable building insulation, energy infrastructure, electric vehicles (EVs), and industry. Its PyroThin® insulation tackles critical EV problems including thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries, placing Aspen as a major player in an industry expected to reach over 100 million vehicles by 2030. In order to improve energy efficiency and sustainability, the company's aerogels are also extensively applied in projects related to energy infrastructure like petrochemical plants and LNG facilities. Growing environmental and legislative concerns have helped Aspen since its products fulfill strict energy efficiency criteria and ESG targets. The company obtained a $150 million DOE loan in 2023 to grow its Georgia plant, raising PyroThin® manufacturing capacity. This development helps it to satisfy growing demand both domestically and abroad, especially as EV safety rules tighten worldwide. Aspen's long-term income from that relationship may be lowered by GM's move toward prismatic battery cells, but diversification among other OEMs and industrial uses as well as Aspen's larger prospects in cylindrical and pouch cell markets should help to offset this impact. Driven by increasing demand in the EV industry and industrial uses, Aspen's growth path has been distinguished by constant upward changes in revenue projection. Its capacity to boost guidance several times in 2024 highlights the confidence of management and the resilience of its plan. Aspen's strategic efforts in growing production and enhancing operational efficiency, together with its central role in energy-efficient markets, help it to be positioned for continuous growth despite hazards like pricing constraints and EV market dependency. The company's competitive edge in highly sought-after markets is cemented by its alignment with federal sustainability projects and developing industry trends. Aspen Aerogels, Inc.

Title: Stocks Buoyed by Tech Rally With Powell in Focus: Markets Wrap

(Bloomberg) -- A rally in the world’s largest technology companies drove stocks higher, with traders wading through the latest economic data and awaiting Jerome Powell’s remarks for clues on the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Treasuries rose and the dollar fluctuated. Equities headed toward all-time highs, with the S&P 500 set for its 56th closing record in 2024. The Nasdaq 100 climbed about 1%. Nvidia Corp. led a gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps higher as the group extended this year’s surge to 62%. Salesforce Inc. jumped 9% and Marvell Technology Inc. soared 24% as their results boosted hopes both companies will keep benefiting from an industrywide boom in artificial intelligence. Just days ahead of the key jobs report, data showed employment at US companies remained firm in November while services activity expanded at the slowest pace in three months. Powell participates in a moderated discussion later Wednesday, and one of his favorite barometers of the economy — the Beige Book — will likely reflect the post-election surge in sentiment. “Right now, the odds favor another cut this month followed by a pause in January, but a significant change in the jobs landscape could rearrange those puzzle pieces,” said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.4%. European stocks advanced for a fifth consecutive session as German shares hit a fresh record. Investors were watching the no-confidence vote taking place in France. Treasury 10-year yields declined four basis points to 4.18%. The market-implied odds of a quarter-point Fed cut this month have improved to around 70%. Additionally, a cumulative 80 basis points of easing is priced in by the end of next year. To George Smith at LPL Financial, momentum could continue for stocks as December has been a good month for market seasonals. It’s overall the second-best performing month since 1950 — with a 1.6% average gain — and the third-strongest over the past five years, according to Smith. When studying the proportion of positive monthly returns since 1950, December often delivers the highest proportion of positive monthly returns — around 74%. Despite the seasonality, Smith doesn’t out the possibility of short-term weakness, especially as geopolitical threats have the potential to escalate. Equities may also need to readjust to what may be a slower and shallower Fed rate-cutting cycle than markets are currently pricing in, he noted. “We remain tactically bullish into year-end given the positive macro environment, earnings growth, and a Fed that remains supportive of markets,” wrote JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Market Intelligence Team led by Andrew Tyler. “It is sensible to play the market’s momentum and see low pullback potential until mid-January,” they say. To some technical analysts who watch and analyze price moves, and strategists that keep an eye on investor sentiment, the initial rumblings are starting to sound a lot like a stock market that has overheated. A Bank of America Corp. indicator that tracks sell-side strategists’ average recommendations remains at its highest level since early 2022, in neutral territory, but much closer to a contrarian “sell” signal than a “buy.” “Statistically (and paradoxically), the impact of 2024’s big gains has made the market look riskier for long-term investors, but potentially safer for near-term speculators,” the Leuthold Group’s Doug Ramsey wrote this week. Leuthold’s major trend index (MTI) — which takes into account many different kinds of indicators — remains at a “high neutral,” but all of the indexes in the MTI closed last week with maximum-bullish readings. All the short-term positioning, rally chasing and mechanical buying flow speaks to an attitude of just running with the market tide. That doesn’t stop the potential for things to change when the calendar flips into 2025. “To put it simply, and probably no one wants to hear it, but this is not a good set up — investors and speculators alike have been lulled into permabull paradise,” writes Callum Thomas at Topdown Charts. Investors have their hopes up for a Santa Claus rally, but a healthy dose of skepticism might be warranted after November’s stellar run-up, according to Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management. “The bar for success is now a lot higher for an economy that may still be in flux,” Cox said. “Yields show that expectations have moved a lot over the past two months, yet we haven’t seen any sustained, clear momentum in economic data. Expectations matter, and the job market is under a microscope.” To Mark Hackett at Nationwide, the sustainability of the market rally will be dependent on the continued resilience of the consumer. One of the best forecasters of consumer spending is the health of the job market. “Markets continue to be driven by a combination of technical and fundamental factors,” Hackett noted. “The consistency of the rally is demoralizing to bears, creating a ‘virtuous circle’ where buying drives further buying. There are questions of sustainability into 2025 given elevated expectations and valuations, but that is unlikely to derail the near-term momentum.” Appetite for equities has shown no sign of abating this year. The S&P 500 made multiple record highs, surging over 25%, powered by technology shares and a broad preference for US assets. The rally extended after the election of Donald Trump raised hopes of tax cuts and deregulation. While American equities have persistently outpaced their global peers, BlackRock Investment Institute says that could continue. The US benefits more from “mega forces,” driving corporate earnings, the firm notes. That is supported by a favorable growth outlook plus potential tax cuts and regulatory easing. “Some valuation measures – whether price-to-earnings ratios or equity risk premiums – look rich relative to history. But they may not tell the full story,” according to BII. “Comparing today’s index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges. Plus, valuations tend to matter more for returns over a long-term horizon than in the near term.” BII says the AI mega force will likely benefit US stocks more and that’s why the firm stays overweight, particularly relative to global peers such as European stocks. “The upshot: We are risk-on for now, but stay nimble. Key signposts for changing our view include any surge in long-term bond yields or an escalation in trade protectionism,” BII concluded.

US stocks ended higher on Wednesday, jumping to fresh highs as traders took in Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's optimistic comments on the US economy. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed at records, with the Dow topping 45,000 for the first time ever. All eyes were on Powell in the afternoon, when the central bank chief spoke on the strength of the economy at The New York Times' DealBook Summit. "Growth is definitely stronger than we thought, and inflation is coming a little higher," Powell said at the event. "The good news is that we can afford to be a little more cautious as we try to find neutral," he added, referring to the neutral interest rate, a hypothetical level where rates neither expand nor contract the economy. Traders also took in weaker-than-expected private jobs data. Private payrolls rose just 146,000 in the last month, lower than the expected 163,000, according to ADP. Bets that the Fed will cut rates another 25 basis points at their December policy meeting also surged, with investors now pricing in a 78% chance the central bank will issue another quarter-point cut. Odds for a further 25 basis point cut in January held steady at 18%.

Title: Why Walmart Inc. (WMT) Is the Best Retail Stock to Invest in

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Retail Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) stands against the other best retail stocks to invest in. On December 2, Lindsey Bell, Chief Strategist at 248 Ventures, appeared on CNBC to discuss the consumer and economy in the holiday shopping season and the impact of proposed tariffs and the strong dollar on earnings. She said that the economy will see a resilient consumer, economy, and marketplace this week and at the end of the year. Bell expressed optimism going into the end of the year and was of the view that there is opportunity in retail at the present after staying in the shadows as a forgotten area. As consumers have shifted in how they spend money and what they spend it on over the last several years, the retail sector is starting to see a comeback to discretionary items. Although an opportunity exists, retailers can only avail of it if they have the right merchandise at the right price or offer the right experience for the consumer. This is because the consumer is still value-oriented and price-sensitive simultaneously. Concerns are circulating in the retail industry about the potential effects of "tariff threats" on the economy. Bell was of the view that it is undoubtedly necessary to stay on top of the potential threats that the president-elect's proposed tariffs might cause to the markets. However, she took us back to Trump's first term as a president and the tariff increases he made, that Joe Biden continued in his term, highlighting that there wasn't a significant lasting inflationary impact to them. She explained how tariffs work, saying that they go up when put on and have an impact in the near term, but eventually subside over time. The markets saw that in 2018 and 2019, while real inflation came in 2021 and 2022 with the pandemic. She reiterated that although the tariffs are something we need to keep an eye on, the scenario is not something we need to worry about from a consumer perspective this holiday shopping season. Although the tariffs may not pose threats to consumers, what do they mean for investors? With the dollar up by half a percent at the time of the interview, concerns are rising about the dollar's possible strength going into the next earnings season and the possible impact on rates that these "tariff threats" might bring about. Bell agreed that the dollar's strength impacts the earnings season, as about 50% of the S&P 500 gets its revenues from overseas multinational companies. She said that the dollar's strength can continue into the year ahead, but this is a relative game. It is important to consider the currency and the strength of the economy around the world, as a strong dollar does depict a strong economy here in the US. A manager standing in a hypermarket, pointing out items available for wholesale. For this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify around 40 retail stocks and narrowed our list to 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund holders, as of fiscal Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund data from Insider Monkey's database. The stocks are arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88 Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an omnichannel retailer that operates retail and wholesale stores and clubs, e-commerce websites, and mobile applications. It offers an elaborate array of items, ranging from general merchandise and electronics to food, groceries, and more. The company's fiscal Q3 2025 earnings showed sales growing by 6.1% in constant currency and profit growing by 9.8%. E-commerce was one of the primary drivers of growth worldwide, up 27%. Other growth drivers included advertising and membership income, which grew by 28% and 22%, respectively. These trends allowed the company to grow profits faster than sales while simultaneously working to lower prices and invest in its associates. The rapid growth from these newer businesses is allowing Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to strengthen its business model. It is continuing to gain market share in the US in both general merchandise and grocery. Further trends in the US in fiscal Q3 2024 saw growing in-store volumes, faster curbside pickup, and an increase in delivery sales. There was no like-for-like inflation in the US in fiscal Q3 2025. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is becoming more convenient for its customers and members, and that is helping it drive growth. Overall, WMT ranks 1st on our list of best retail stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of retail stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than WMT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

These three dividend-paying companies have all raised their payouts every year for at least 40 consecutive years. The retailer also aims to grow sign-ups for Walmart+ after initially downplaying the membership program, Doug McMillon said at a Morgan Stanley event.

The former Red Bull executive is faced with turning around investor perceptions amid pressure on shares. Shares of connected TV platform company Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) jumped Wednesday morning after Needham analyst Laura Martin said she believes that Roku will be acquired at a hefty premium in 2025. As of 11:30 a.m. ET, Roku stock was up by 10.5%. Likely in response, Walmart decided to acquire Roku rival Vizio, a deal that closed Tuesday. The bull market looks to be in full force as valuations continue to rise higher for many stocks. Three of these hot stocks that investors should be extra careful about these days are MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR), and CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). Although they have generated some fantastic returns for investors, you may want to consider taking a second look at these stocks before deciding to invest in them, as their valuations are at absurdly high levels. US president Joe Biden made a mistake in not embracing Elon Musk, his predecessor Bill Clinton has said, after the Tesla boss donated millions to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. Elon Musk is on another level this year. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO added $119 billion to his fortune in 2024. This pushed his net worth to $348 billion. That's not just a number. It's more than the entire net worth of tech icon Michael Dell. Let that sink in. Musk isn't alone in raking it in, though. The 10 biggest wealth gainers globally have seen their fortunes grow by a combined $585 billion this year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Title: Why Vertiv Holdings (VRT) Will Be a Major Beneficiary of AI

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) stands against other stocks that will benefit from AI. Artificial intelligence has been the driving theme of the stock market over the past couple of years which have seen investors battle inflation and high interest rates. Ever since OpenAI publicly released ChatGPT in November 2022 and NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang predicted the next year that there was a trillion-dollar market in play when it came to upgrading traditional computing hardware to accelerated computing, the stock market has seen no respite. However, when it comes to AI stocks, not all of them have flourished. Apart from Huang's firm, the world's leading graphics processing unit (GPU) designer, shares of OpenAI's biggest backer, i.e., the firm known for the Windows operating system, were two of the biggest initial AI beneficiaries. Between December 2022 and H1 2024, their shares have gained 631% and 75%, respectively. Other technology stocks have also ridden the AI wave and have posted gains ranging between 42% to 308%. Within these, the stock that has gained 308% is Facebook's parent entity and its focus on GPU investments and success with the Llama open source model have caught investor attention. These firms have primarily posted gains because the AI wave, as analysts would like to remind you, is in its early stages. This stage is characterized by investor interest in firms that are AI enablers. However, the next stage of AI investment could see investors broaden their horizons. Some of this diversification away from technology stocks has already taken place in the form of impressive performance by utility stocks in 2024. Their performance is evident through the utility component of the flagship S&P index gaining 28% from the start of the year to the end of November as it led the benchmark index by a percentage point. We analyzed this stage in AI investment in great detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks. Stocks in this list range from utility firms to computer hardware providers, semiconductor firms, and glass companies. Within this list, data center hardware firms were quite common, and as you read below, you'll find out why they might be the biggest beneficiaries of the next wave in AI investment. Wells Fargo has extensively covered the topic of what other stocks apart from the most valuable in the world can benefit from artificial intelligence. Its research covers firms that benefit from AI spending and applications. Starting from stocks that might benefit from AI spending, the bank notes that these will primarily include areas where the money trickles from AI data spending. In 2025, it estimates that hyperscaler cloud providers' capital expenditures can sit around a cool $180 billion. This is more than twice the expected spending by oil majors, which is estimated to sit at close to $85 billion. So where will this money trickle down to? Well, WF believes that while the "largest portion of cost involved in constructing data centers is graphics processing units (GPUs) and the supercomputers that contain them," other sectors that should not be ignored include "cabling; steel racks; cooling (liquid and air); electrical equipment (both inside and outside the box); and backup generators" along with others that "are required to lay the foundation and power generation to support the facility." While it lists down the usual culprits of information technology, communications services, and software firms that are part of discretionary stocks as the beneficiaries of data center spending, WF also adds two other sectors. These are industrial and material stocks, as the bank believes that while a "data center may not be a factory, but if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it might be a duck." It quotes research to share that since as much as 45% of the cost of building a data center "is related to land, building shell, and basic building fit-out," firms that "supply steel, aggregates, cement, and water equipment and, by extension, construction and engineering firms as well as broad non-residential construction suppliers (such as industrial distributors)" can benefit from the $180 billion in estimated hyperscaler capital expenditure. WF adds that data center spending will also include electrical and HVAC systems, as it notes that this sector can benefit from the fact that "there are a relatively limited number of scaled suppliers of large electrical equipment, commercial HVAC systems, and diesel generators."

A close-up of a group of technicians working on complex data center systems. To make our list of stocks that will benefit from AI, we ranked the stocks part of our list of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. This upgrades the list since it was published when the latest hedge fund data was unavailable and it narrows down the list of stocks to the top fund favorites. Why are we interested in stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 91 Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is a computer hardware company that designs and sells power management, racks, cooling equipment, and other associated equipment. It is one of the top-performing stocks in 2024 as the shares are up 180% year-to-date. Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) has been an investor favorite particularly since it also sells liquid cooling products. These are indispensable for AI workloads due to the excessive heat generated by performance-intensive GPUs. The firm is particularly exposed to the data center industry as it generates 75% of its revenue from this industry. The positive catalysts from AI-generated demand were also evident in Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT)'s third quarter results. These saw the firm grow sales by 19% and orders by 37%. Therefore, the year-to-date share price gain is unsurprising. Baron Small Cap Fund mentioned Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) is a leader in data center equipment, with significant share in both power and cooling applications. The stock rebounded off recent weakness, as investors gained confidence that a massive build out of AI data centers globally was on the horizon. Vertiv’s strong relationship with chip manufacturers and involvement in the necessary technology roadmap for solutions as the energy density of server racks increases were catalysts. Vertiv’s orders were up 57% year-over-year in the second quarter, backlog was $7 billion, a record, and 2024 operating profit margin and EPS guidance was raised.” Overall, VRT ranks 9th on our list of stocks that will benefit from AI. While we acknowledge the potential of VRT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 97 Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is one of the top-performing stocks of 2024 as its shares are up by a whopping 305% year-to-date. It is a Texas-based utility, and as you might have guessed, the firm has wide exposure to the nuclear industry. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) also benefits from being an unregulated utility which enables it to self-set rate of returns on its power generation projects. The stock has risen in 2024 after the firm's decision to bring a nuclear business fully under its fold sent the shares soaring by 25%. Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) also scored another win this year when regulators approved its request to extend the operational life of a nuclear power plant. For full-year 2024, the firm aims to earn between $5 billion to $5.2 in operating income and $2.65 billion to $2.85 billion in free cash flow. Along with deals with data center firms for clean energy and the regulatory environment for future projects, these also play an important role in Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST)'s story. Meridian Funds mentioned Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) in its Q3 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: "Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated retail electricity and power generation company, primarily serving Texas and the Midwest. We own Vistra because we expect power markets to continue tightening as baseload supply declines, coupled with rising demand from data centers, electric vehicles, and manufacturing reshoring. These factors create a favorable pricing environment for Vistra’s generation fleet, especially its nuclear and gas assets. The stock performed well during the period for three key reasons: tightening energy markets and strengthened pricing in forward-year energy contracts, the continuation of Vistra’s aggressive share repurchase program, and the company’s announced plan to acquire the remaining interest in Vistra Vision at an attractive valuation. Additionally, the company reaffirmed its 2024 guidance, indicating that results are trending toward the upper end of the previously projected range. We took advantage of the stock’s strength this quarter to trim our position.” Overall, VST ranks 7th on our list of stocks that will benefit from AI. While we acknowledge the potential of VST as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The world's largest asset manager says it's not too late to turn bullish on US stocks heading into 2025. In its outlook for the new year, BlackRock upgraded its "Overweight" rating on US stocks, turning even more bullish than its prior recommendation even as the S&P 500 trades at all-time highs. The firm was previously "+1" overweight relative to "Neutral" and is now "+2" overweight, with its highest overweight rating being "+3." BlackRock's recommendation to stay "pro-risk" toward US stocks is the opposite of Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett, who recommended this week that investors should bet on international stocks in 2025 due to the fear that America's exceptionalism trade is about to end. But BlackRock isn't buying it. "U.S. equities have persistently outpaced their global peers," BlackRock's Investment Institute wrote in their 2025 outlook. "We think that could continue." The driving force behind BlackRock's doubling down on the US stock market rally to continue is the belief that "mega forces" like artificial intelligence are disproportionately set to benefit American companies. "We think the AI mega force will benefit U.S. stocks more and that's why we stay overweight, particularly relative to international peers such as European stocks," BlackRock said. The firm also believes potential tax cuts and an easing regulatory environment under the incoming Donald Trump administration should support continued economic growth. One top concern for US stock market investors has been valuations, which, based on metrics like price-to-earnings ratios, are hitting historical extremes. However, BlackRock dismissed the valuation concern by highlighting that the US economy looks a lot different than it did in the past, as technology and services take center stage at the expense of manufacturing. "The equity market's changing sectoral composition reflects the transformation taking hold. So, comparing today's index to that of the past is like comparing apples to oranges," BlackRock said. Valuation measures have also proven to be a poor timing tool for getting in or out of the stock market, the firm said. "We are risk-on for now but stay nimble." The firm said factors that could force it to change its bullish tune include a significant surge in long-term bond yields or an escalation in trade protectionism.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Farmland and Agriculture Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) stands against the other farmland and agriculture stocks. The farmland and agriculture sector is crucial for global food security and economic stability. As the world population continues to grow, the demand for food increases, necessitating innovative practices in agriculture and farming. Recent trends indicate a significant shift towards technology-driven agriculture, which aims to enhance productivity while promoting sustainability. In the first quarter of 2024, McKinsey surveyed around 4,400 farmers across Europe, India, Latin America, and North America to understand the factors influencing their profitability and technology adoption. The firm conducted a similar survey in 2022. The findings indicate that while farmers are increasingly adopting technology, the pace remains slow, with a three-percentage-point rise since 2022 in those using or willing to use at least one new digital tool to improve operations.

In the US, 61% of farmers are using or willing to adopt digital agronomy. Additionally, 51% are using or willing to adopt precision agriculture hardware, and 38% are adopting remote-sensing technologies. Latin America showed the most significant growth in technology adoption, with a remarkable ten-percentage-point increase from 2022 to 2024. Farmers around the world are more inclined to adopt new technologies that directly improve operations. According to the data, digital agronomy and precision agriculture hardware are the most popular technologies around the world. The survey highlights that in the US, larger farms are 45% more likely to adopt agricultural technology compared to smaller farms. This trend can be attributed to the greater scale needed for a favorable return on investment (ROI) in agtech. Despite the challenges posed by rising input costs and extreme weather conditions, farmers are looking towards sustainable practices and innovative technologies to enhance their productivity and profitability. Organizations that provide technology and services have a unique opportunity to cater to farmers’ diverse needs across different regions. To compile our list of the 13 best farmland and agriculture stocks to invest in according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest farmland and agriculture companies. We also reviewed our own rankings and consulted various online resources. From an initial pool of more than 30 farmland and agriculture stocks, we focused on the top 13 stocks most favored by institutional investors. Data for the hedge fund sentiment surrounding each stock was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of 900 elite hedge funds. The 13 best farmland and agriculture stocks to invest in are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NYSE:NTR) set ambitious performance targets for 2026, focusing on improving earnings and cash flow. The company has made good progress and now aims to achieve $200 million in operational efficiencies by 2025, one year ahead of schedule. These efficiencies will be realized through cost reductions across both retail and corporate operations. In the first nine months of 2024, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) reported an adjusted EBITDA of $4.3 billion, driven by higher retail earnings, increased fertilizer volumes, and lower operating costs. The company has already boosted sales volumes by 1.3 million tons this year through the first 3 quarters of 2024, with plans to increase potash and nitrogen production by an additional 2 to 3 million tons compared to 2023 levels. Nutrien Ltd.’s (NYSE:NTR) strong health is further demonstrated by its commitment to returning value to shareholders.

Title: Why Is Kura Oncology, Inc. (KURA) Among the Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks With Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Small-Cap Biotech Stocks with Massive Potential According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) stands against the other small-cap biotech stocks. The biotechnology sector is expanding quickly due to rising demand for novel therapies, technological advances, and government assistance. Advances in fields like gene editing, sequencing, personalized medicine, and artificial intelligence are making new techniques possible, while the aging population and growing healthcare demands are driving a robust market for new treatments. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, venture capital firms made approximately $52 billion in global investments in therapeutic-focused biotech companies between 2019 and 2021. Two-thirds of this sum was given to platform-tech start-up companies. Despite its growth, many biotech companies have faced challenges in turbulent markets, taking drastic measures such as cutting programs and implementing significant layoffs to conserve cash. While recent rate cuts could encourage the revival of scientific projects, analysts like Jared Holz note the difficulty of gauging their impact. Holz also highlighted a shift in market dynamics, observing that biotech's performance increasingly correlates with small-cap equities. If small-cap stocks trade well, biotech is likely to follow, though stagnation could occur if momentum fades. Notably, the idea of interest rates predicting biotech success is relatively new, emerging only after the pandemic, which reshaped the industry by driving substantial investment into therapeutic-focused companies. With innovative treatments, biotech businesses are revolutionizing healthcare by tackling important unmet medical needs. Establishing the National Bioeconomy Board as a component of Biden's Investing in America agenda is a significant breakthrough. It seeks to maximize biotechnology's economic potential in the United States. Furthermore, policy suggestions to expedite the approval process for biotechnology goods are being developed by the National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology. More academics will be able to use biotechnology for agricultural purposes if entry obstacles are reduced, which will benefit American farmers and increase food security. It is anticipated that these initiatives will open up new markets. This year (2024) started strongly for the biotechnology sector due to a rise in mergers and acquisitions as well as anticipations of falling interest rates. Therefore, estimates suggest that the worldwide biotechnology market might increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 14% from 2024 to 2033, reaching an astonishing $5.7 trillion. The market for agricultural biotechnology is also expected to develop at a 7.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach $232 billion by 2032. But even with the market's potential, investing in biotech companies still carries a number of serious dangers. Bankruptcy may result from failing to satisfy clinical trial endpoints or obtain adequate finance before a product launch. In the biotech industry, where drug development usually takes more than ten years and has an estimated failure rate of about 90%, the danger of failure is very substantial. Hence, biotech stocks are often considered “high-risk, high-reward” investments due to their upside potential coupled with significant risks In our methodology, we identified the top small-cap biotech stocks with significant growth potential, ranked according to their total hedge fund holdings as of Q2 2024. Our selection process began by filtering companies with a small market capitalization. Next, we reviewed analyst recommendations, focusing on stocks with strong bullish sentiment and high institutional ownership. Finally, we ranked these companies based on the number of hedge funds holding their shares as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A biopharmaceutical researcher intently studying results from a clinical trial. Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 36 Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. At its core, the company designs and develops targeted therapies that aim to improve outcomes for patients with various types of solid tumors and blood cancers. A major catalyst for Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) is the development of ziftomenib, its lead drug candidate. Ziftomenib, an oral medication targeting the menin-MLL1 protein-protein interaction, has received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation for patients with relapsed/refractory NPM1-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This designation could accelerate the drug's path to market, potentially leading to increased revenue and market share. Another catalyst is the company's expanding clinical trial program. The corporation has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of ziftomenib (KOMET-001) and is conducting multiple clinical trials to evaluate ziftomenib in combination with current standard-of-care regimens. Kura Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:KURA) reported significant financial developments in Q3 2024, with research and development expenses increasing to $41.7 million from $29.3 million in Q3 2023 which was driven by higher clinical trial costs for key programs such as ziftomenib and KO-2806. General and administrative expenses also rose to $18.2 million from $13.1 million, contributing to a net loss of $54.4 million, up from $38.6 million in the prior year. The company maintains a strong cash position of $455.3 million, ensuring operational funding into 2027. As of the third quarter of 2024, 36 hedge funds had investments in the company, with Suvretta Capital Management being the largest shareholder, holding stakes valued at $149.5 million, according to the Insider Monkey database. Analysts on Wall Street have a consensus Strong Buy rating for the stock. Over the past three months, analysts have set a 12-month price target of $30.89, with estimates ranging from a low of $22.00 to a high of $37.00. This represents a potential upside of 52.47% from the current price of $20.26. Overall KURA ranks 2nd on our list of the best small-cap biotech stocks with massive potential according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of KURA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A biopharma executive in a meeting room discussing the clinical-stage of a new therapy. Number of Hedge Fund Holdings: 34 Arvinas, Inc.

Clinical trials have yielded encouraging results, with a Phase 1b trial demonstrating a clinical benefit rate of 63% and an overall response rate of 41.9% among heavily pretreated patients. These outcomes have prompted the initiation of several Phase 3 trials, including VERITAC-2 and VERITAC-3, which could pave the way for regulatory approval if successful. The company has shown impressive growth since its market debut in 2016, when it raised about $120 million through the issuance of approximately 7.5 million shares at $16 per share.

The company reported impressive Q3 2024 financial results, with revenue surging to $102.4 million from $34.6 million in Q3 2023 which was driven primarily by $76.7 million from the Novartis license agreement, which offset declines in collaborations with Pfizer and Bayer.

R&D expenses rose slightly to $86.9 million from $85.9 million, while G&A expenses increased significantly to $75.8 million from $22.6 million, reflecting strategic investments.

Title: Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Lowest Level in Years Amid Whale Accumulation
URL: https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2024/12/bitcoin-exchange-reserves-hit-lowest-level-in-years-amid-whale-accumulation/

* Bitcoin exchange reserves have decreased to their lowest level in years due to significant outflows since the US presidential election. * The outflows are attributed to the cryptocurrency market rally following Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance during the campaign. * Bitcoin whales have been accumulating BTC, with 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entering whale reserves in a single day. The total amount of Bitcoin exchange reserves has dropped to its lowest level in years after massive outflows have been seen since the US presidential election in early November led to a massive cryptocurrency market rally. According to data from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, over 171,000 BTC have moved off of cryptocurrency trading platforms since Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump won the election, leading to a market rally given his pro-crypto stance during the campaign. The firm’s data notably shows there has been a steady decline in Bitcoin exchange reserves since the beginning of this year, as there were then around 3 million BTC on cryptocurrency exchanges. The figure has since plunged to around 2.64 million coins. As CryptoGlobe reported, Bitcoin whales have been steadily accumulating over the last few weeks as BTC trades below the psychological resistance level around $100,000. CryptoQuant data shows that 16,000 BTC worth nearly $1.5 billion entered whale reserves in a single day late last month. A lower amount of Bitcoin on exchanges suggests that there is less supply available on the market, which if coupled with steady or rising demand could lead to a cryptocurrency price rise. The price of Bitcoin has been strolling to surpass the $100,000 psychological barrier after surging exponentially after Trump secured the US elections. The cryptocurrency is at the time of writing trading at $96.700 after moving up more than 40% in the last month. While whales are accumulating, the total holdings of the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) offered by the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, have grown to surpass the 500,000 BTC mark. Another entity heavily accumulating the flagship cryptocurrency is Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which accumulated an additional 15,400 coins for $1.5 billion earlier this month to bring its total BTC holdings above the 400,000 threshold.

The startup said on Wednesday that it has broken ground on the installation of 24 EV fast chargers at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The installation doubles the airport’s existing EV charging capacity. This is the second time Revel has partnered with New York’s Port Authority, which acts as the landlord and regulator for the city’s ports, to install fast chargers. The two are also building out 48 fast charging ports near LaGuardia Airport. Both airport projects are expected to be completed in 2025. Revel and the NY Port Authority plan to place the chargers — which will support both the Combined Charging System and the North American Charging Standard — at JFK Airport’s west cell phone lot, which is where drivers, including Revel’s ride-hail drivers, often wait for passengers to arrive. The ports promise to charge an EV from 20% to 80% within 15 to 20 minutes. Revel, which began as an e-moped sharing service before launching an all-electric ride-hail platform and building NY’s first EV charging hub, currently runs four public 24/7 fast-charging stations. These feature a total of 64 ports in Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, and the company plans to add five more across the city, including the two at the JFK and LaGuardia airports. The startup’s playbook has been to roll out ride-hail services alongside charging stations so that the chargers see maximum utilization. Revel says its stations are used roughly 50/50 by its ride-hail drivers and by other EV owners. A Revel spokesperson told TechCrunch that the majority of those EV owners are ride-hail drivers for competing platforms — the company gives Uber drivers a 25% discount at its sites as part of a partnership with the ride-hail and delivery giant. In October, Toyota and Revel agreed to give Toyota and Lexus EV owners free access to Revel’s charging stations. “It’s impossible to electrify rideshare without an abundance of charging near airports,” Frank Reig, co-founder and CEO of Revel, said in a statement. “Revel’s JFK site will be one of the most used fast charging stations in the country, and with the Port Authority’s support, we’re on track to open it in a matter of months.” Revel launched its ride-hail platform in 2021, featuring an all-Tesla fleet driven by its own employees. But this September, the company laid off its employee drivers and implemented a gig-work system, where it rents out its cars to the workers. Today, its fleet of 550 cars includes other EVs, like the Kia Niro. Revel is funding the installation of the charging ports at JFK Airport. The startup has raised roughly $275 million to date, per PitchBook, from investors including BlackRock, Toyota Ventures, and Maniv, and is currently raising more capital to fund its expansion, according to the company. Outside of New York, Revel recently broke ground at a charging station in downtown San Francisco (it plans to open the station in the first quarter of 2025), and has plans to open a site in Los Angeles in 2026. A spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch Revel has eight active leases for sites across the Bay Area, is actively acquiring other sites, and plans to open more than 100 charge ports in the region in the coming years.

Title: Predicting proprioceptive cortical anatomy and neural coding with topographic autoencoders
URL: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614

Full Content:
Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1. The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. 2. The distribution of neuronal preferred directions (PDs) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes several testable predictions: 1. Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs. 2. Few neurons will encode just a single joint. Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. It is well established that proprioception is essential for effective for motor control, yet our understanding of proprioceptive coding in somatosensory cortex lags behind that of more studied sensory modalities such as vision and touch. Here, we use unsupervised learning of a deep neural network imposed with biological constraints to reproduce coding properties of proprioceptive neurons in area 2 of primary somatosensory cortex. With this model, we demonstrate that the tendency for area 2 neurons in close physical proximity to share similar directional tuning can be explained by local topographic organisation driven by Mexican hat lateral effects, a phenomenon that is otherwise unobservable with the spatial resolution of available electrode microarray recordings. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first evidence of local topographic organisation in area 2 proprioceptive neurons. We also predict that the structure of proprioceptive receptive fields is typically multi-joint rather than single-joint in nature and provides, to the best of our knowledge. We find that our model best reproduces the tuning properties of neural data when training on natural kinematic recordings, rather than those from a stereotyped task, underlining the importance of training on data that reflect the natural distribution of sensory stimuli.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Somatosensation includes the familiar sense of touch, provided by receptors in the skin, and proprioception, the much less consciously perceived sense that informs us about the pose, motion and associated forces acting on our limbs. Both are essential for our ability to plan, control and adapt movements. In engineering, the control of robotic movement would be impossible if the controller did not know the location of its actuators; correspondingly in human motor control, popular frameworks for explaining many types of movement, such as optimal feedback control theory [1,2], are dependent on feedback such as that provided by proprioception. Moreover, individuals with proprioceptive neurological deficits, such as patient IW, have profound motor deficits even in the presence of vision and an intact motor system [3,4]. Similarly, recent major developments in the control of limb movement through intracortical Brain Computer Interfaces are centred on restoring somatosensory sensory feedback as well as effecting motion [5–8]. Thus far, these efforts have been almost exclusively limited to the sense of touch, in part because of our better understanding of that modality. However, restored proprioceptive feedback is also likely to be needed to adequately restore functional capability [9–11]. Unlike hearing or vision, proprioceptive afferent pathways originate not from a single organ but from diverse families of mechanoreceptors within muscles, tendons, joints, and even the skin [12]. Proprioceptive information ascends within the dorsal column pathway through the dorsal root ganglia, the dorsal column nuclei, and thalamus before arriving in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Crucially, neurons are somatotopically organised throughout this pathway, meaning that neighbouring neurons encode stimuli from closely related parts of the body. This gives rise to the sensory homunculus, which results from the ordered mapping of tactile representations of the body’s surface across the cortical surface [13]. Although proprioception is generally acknowledged to be critical to motor behaviour, the corresponding proprioceptive maps ‐ particularly that of primate area 3a, but also the mixed modality area 2 ‐ are much less obviously structured than those of the touch (areas 1 and 3b). We know that the proprioceptive and tactile systems often encode overlapping information, e.g. mechanoreceptors in our skin and interosseous membranes respond to deformation and vibration, contributing to the sense of body position and movement [3]. Indeed, the firing rates of somatosensory neurons with cutaneous receptive fields in area 2 can be used to decode limb movement as accurately as those with muscle fields [14]. While proprioceptive cortical areas are critical for our ability to generate goal-directed complex behaviour it is unclear what properties of proprioceptive cortical coding facilitate this capability. Crucially, we lack an accepted hypothesis about the computational principles that drive the mapping of proprioceptive arm representations onto the cortex. The limited nature of our understanding of proprioceptive neural representations in the brain is in large part due to the difficulty of delivering independent proprioceptive stimuli in comparison to other senses, such as vision [15] and touch [16]. To overcome this limitation, we combined computational modelling and natural movement kinematic data to test hypotheses of organisational mechanisms that are currently beyond the capability of microarray recording techniques, where the distance between electrodes is too great to observe spatial organisation at the level of neighbouring neurons. This combination of experiment and theory has been useful for explaining population-level coding in other sensory modalities, such as vision [17] and touch [18,19], but has only recently begun to be applied to proprioception [20,21]. Much of the computational theoretical work on other senses has either focused on predicting specific neural coding features from natural sensory statistics [18,22], or has ignored the details of neural coding and focused on the spatial distribution of stimulus representation across the cortex [23]. Our chosen system was the proprioception of the right arm (Fig 1A) for which we had collected natural behavioural data from daily life in humans (food preparation, eating, etc; Figs 1B and S1) as well as constrained, planar centre-out reaching in both humans and monkeys (Fig 1C). This data describes the joint angle kinematics of the of the body over time and thus stands in for the proprioceptive sensory state. We aimed to relate kinematics to proprioceptive encoding with modelling and comparisons to existing single-unit recordings from monkeys. We formulated a novel computational model that predicts both neural coding of single neurons and the spatial organisation of these neurons across the cortex (Fig 1D–1G). We chose a small set of general computational elements that reflect principles and mechanisms found in sensory systems but have not been previously unified, which are as follows: Models should 1) use the information maximisation principle, which postulates that efficient sensory representations in the brain reflect natural sensory statistics, and implies that they are essential in shaping neural representations, 2) be stochastic, generative, and decodable, to reflect the natural variability in the data, produce neural activity to mimic that of the biological system, and offer the means to reconstruct the relevant original sensory input from its output, 3) implement, in Marr’s sense [24], neural computations that are performed by locally interacting neurons through synaptic interactions, rather than by an abstract computational machine.

(H) Flow of natural and planar movement data (joint angular velocities) in this work. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614.g001 In the context of proprioception, these principles require that our model should learn how to translate proprioceptive inputs from movements of the body into a latent representation of proprioception (which is read out as neural firing). In addition to performing efficient feature learning of a spike-based code, the model should have minimal inductive bias regarding a particular sensory modality, in that it can be generalised to modelling other regions of sensory cortex. By training the model on natural movement stimuli, it should learn representations that can maximise information about the environment with the limited bandwidth of neurons that is available at any given encoding step, thereby implementing efficient coding [25–27]. Given these requirements, we chose to use an unsupervised deep neural network model, a variational autoencoder (VAE) [28] (Fig 1D) to perform efficient feature learning of proprioceptive stimuli. The primary training objective of an autoencoder is to reconstruct the input stimuli, enabling the model to learn in an unsupervised manner. Furthermore, in our use case, the encoder component of the VAE model parameterises a latent Bernoulli distribution to imitate the activity of spiking neurons. In following our third outlined principle and the observation that spatial organization is relevant to cortical coding, we introduce a 2-dimensional structure to the latent (“bottleneck”) layer of the VAE (Fig 1E). A conventional “vanilla” VAE model will capture the properties of encoded sensory features but would be devoid of any of the spatial properties of cortical neurons that are critical for determining how sensory stimuli are represented across the cortical surface. Incorporating spatial relationships in neural coding models has proven an important consideration for understanding neural computation, where anatomical structure and function in neural computation are fundamentally linked by biophysical constraints [30–33]. We therefore also implemented a topographical mechanism, using a lateral interaction term between the units in the VAE’s latent layer (see Methods for detailed motivation and mathematical description; Fig 1F). This term corresponds biologically to a spatial distribution of short-range excitatory and longer-range inhibitory synaptic interactions between neurons (Fig 1G). We call our model the “topo-VAE” and compared it with existing recordings from area 2 of somatosensory cortex. It could equally well be applied to other proprioceptive areas such as 3a or even 5. With further adjustments, such as replacing the linear decoder (or even the MLP encoder) layer with more elaborate architectures, it should be possible to apply this model to the study of spatial organisation in other sensory modalities, including touch, vision, and hearing. Here, the approach has enabled us to uncover novel insights into proprioceptive coding by linking anatomical structure and function so that we can test our model’s predictions using the sparse set of obtainable data. We developed a novel model of cortical sensory representation (see Methods for details) that predicts both function and structure–the topo-VAE model. We trained, and validated, and tested our model as follows (Fig 1H): We trained our topo-VAE model on natural daily human arm movement kinematics and explored the emergent proprioceptive representations in its cortical layer (i.e. the latent layer of the topo-VAE). After training, we used the model to generate neural responses by providing it kinematic data from a centre-out reaching task performed by human subjects. We then compared the properties of these simulated neural activities (i.e. the generated spike trains) to those of S1 neurons which were previously recorded from monkeys performing a planar centre-out reaching task, for which macaque and human arm kinematics are known to be similar [34]. We characterised the proprioceptive neural representations at two levels of description: first, we considered the spatial tuning curves of individual neurons and second, we considered the organisation of tuning preference maps across our model’s cortical surface. We used three sets of measurements to summarise the neural coding properties of S1 neurons for this centre-out task: 1) the preferred direction (PD) of single-neuron firing rates, 2) features of the tuning surface defined by firing rate modulation as a function of both direction and speed of movement, and 3) the overall distribution of firing rates throughout the behaviour. First, we analysed PDs of neurons in the recordings and in our modelling (Fig 2). The PD refers to the movement direction of the hand (when performing the centre-out reaching task) in which a neuron was most active. The tuning surface refers to the inferred firing rate response of a neuron to a given range of endpoint directions and velocities, which is generated using a Poisson GLM trained to map from x and y endpoint velocities to the firing rate of a neuron. We found that generally, the parametrically fit PD tuning surfaces exhibited by modelled neurons were similar in appearance to those of recorded neurons (cf. Fig 2A and 2B, top panel for the 12 best matches between modelled and recorded neurons, bottom panel for 12 examples from the ∼50th percentile of match quality. Further examples of each can be found in S2 Fig). At the population level, while there was a statistically significant difference (p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) between the distribution of PDs of modelled and recorded neurons (Fig 2C), the distributions were similar in that they were both bimodal (S3 Fig), with a bias towards the 120°/300° reach axis (Mean: 97° vs 115°, natural-trained model vs recorded) (Fig 2D). Previous experimental studies have suggested such coding biases are a natural consequence of musculoskeletal constraints in the arm [35,36], which cause the natural distribution of right arm reach movements to favour the 120°/300° reach axis. Under the efficient coding hypothesis, this becomes reflected in the coding properties of the sensory neurons. To test this theory, we trained a second model on stereotyped movement stimuli from the centre-out reach task only. We compared the reconstruction quality (R2 scores) of natural-trained and planar-trained models by evaluating them on planar and natural movement data, respectively. We found that the natural-trained model generalised to planar movement data significantly better than the planar-trained model generalised to natural movement data (0.81 ±0.02 vs 0.73 ±0.04, natural-trained vs planar-trained; p<0.005; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The planar-trained model produced a PD distribution that was also significantly different from the PD distribution of recorded neurons (p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), but unlike the natural-trained model, the reach axis bias was perpendicular to that of recorded neurons (Mean: 49° vs 115°, planar-trained modelled vs recorded) (Fig 2D and 2E). This suggests that certain features of proprioceptive coding are only emergent when the coding is conditioned on the natural distribution of stimuli.

Two such features were compared (Fig 3A): Half-peak widths measure how sharp the tuning of a neuron is, where smaller half-peak widths indicate sharper tuning, and velocity gradients measure how sharply the firing rate of a neuron changes as a function of the endpoint velocity in the direction of tuning (note that the velocity gradient measurements were adjusted to control for differences in mean firing rate between modelled and recorded neurons). While there was a statistically significant difference between the feature distributions of modelled and recorded neurons (p<0.005 for both features and all model variations; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), Jensen-Shannon divergence between distributions was minimised (Fig 3B and 3C) when the model included lateral effects and was trained on natural movement data. This would suggest that both model constraints are important for reproducing the tuning properties of recorded neurons. One concern was that the distributions of tuning curve geometry between modelled and recorded neuron populations were similar only because of the Poisson GLM fitting process–perhaps fitting a Poisson GLM to any random data would produce distributions like these. To verify that this was not the case, we shuffled the firing rate data from modelled neurons to remove any correlation between endpoint velocities and firing rates and trained an additional Poisson GLM on this data. The shuffling produced a very different pair of distributions for the geometric features, with flat, poorly tuned curves–suggesting that any similarities we saw between the original unshuffled curves were in fact due to similarities in the underlying structure of the modelled and recorded neuron data. This provides an empirical lower bound of the similarity between feature distributions, and would suggest that similarity between the distributions of modelled and recorded neurons is not trivially the result of using a GLM (Fig 3B and 3C).

Histograms represent actual distributions, whereas lines represent fitted gamma distributions (R2>0.95 for all; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614.g003 Finally, we examined endpoint-velocity modulation of firing rate distributions, which were well fit by Gamma curves for both modelled (Fig 3D) and recorded neurons (Fig 3E; R2 > 0.95 for equal numbers of neurons). We compared the distributions at different endpoint velocities and found that they differed significantly in both modelled and recorded neurons (p<0.005; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test), indicating velocity dependence in both. In summary, modelled neurons in the topo-VAE exhibit various tuning properties such as preferred direction and endpoint-velocity modulation of firing rates which are structurally similar to those of recorded neurons. While the population statistics of these tuning properties differ significantly between modelled recorded neurons, the combined lateral effects that constrain our model and the training data that reflects the natural distribution of arm movement, increase the similarity, all without fitting our model to any neural data. Having demonstrated similarity in the tuning statistics between modelled and recorded neurons, we next compared the spatial relationship of PDs in our model neurons to those in the monkey brain within the constraints of the 400 μm spacing of the recording electrodes (Fig 4). While neurons recorded at two adjacent electrodes corresponded to a distance that was substantially beyond the effective range of the Mexican hat distance function, many electrodes recorded data from more than one distinguishable neuron. The distance between these neurons was within the local neighbourhood of neurons in our model. We could thus compare the similarity of neural coding properties (specifically, the PDs) between neurons recorded on the same electrode to the similarity between neurons on different electrodes (cf. Fig 4A). In modelled neurons, same-electrode PD differences followed an exponential distribution, such that the probability that two neurons had similar (within 30 degrees) PDs was much higher than chance (p = 0.81; Fig 4C., blue histogram). Conversely, the probability that two neurons on the same electrode had nearly opposite PDs (between 150° and 180°) was very low (p = 0.032; Fig 4C orange histogram). These distributions were significantly different for nearby vs distant neurons (p<0.05; two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test). We then ran the same analysis on recorded neurons (Fig 4C) and found that there was no significant difference between the nearby PD difference distributions (orange) in modelled vs recorded neurons when σ = 2 (p > 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Different choices of the neighbourhood hyperparameter, σ, led to differences in the exponential distributions of PD difference (S4B and S4C Fig). Small neighbourhood values (σ = 1, S4B and S4C Fig, left) led to more uniform distributions, whereas larger neighbourhood values (σ = 3, S4B and S4C Fig, right) led to a more exponential distribution, both of which were significantly different from the distributions observed in recorded neurons (p < 0.05; Wilcoxon rank-sum test). This would suggest that a lateral effect range of σ = 2 most accurately captures lateral interaction distances in proprioceptive cortex.

The model predicts that PDs are clustered in blob-like structures of similar PDs with boundary regions where the PDs rotate smoothly toward neighbouring directions (Fig 4D). This arrangement is interrupted by small, sparsely spaced “pinwheel” regions, representing all PDs in a small neighbourhood, which is consistent with same-electrode similarity of Fig 4B and 4C. Next, we examined which specific elements of the lateral interaction were important for reproducing the recorded data. We verified through model ablation the importance of the shape of the Mexican hat function (blue curve in Fig 5A), which determines the strength of excitatory and inhibitory connections as a function of distance between two neurons. We found no lateral effect function with a significant effect on input data reconstruction accuracy when compared to a model with no lateral effects (P<0.005; ANOVA). Flipping the function upside down (i.e., short range inhibition and intermediate range excitation, yellow curve in Fig 5A) eliminated the obvious topographic structure (Fig 5B, yellow box). Similarly, removing either the excitatory (purple curve in Fig 5A) or inhibitory component (red curve in Fig 5A) produced results unlike the localised topographic structure of our primary model against which the recorded data was validated (Fig 5B, purple and red boxes, respectively), suggesting that the specific Mexican hat shape was important for reproducing biological results.

(B) resulting PD maps for each function (colour matched to 5D). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012614.g005 We also investigate whether this topographic organisation emerges when the model is trained on shuffled kinematic data, to determine if the inherent structure of movement data (e.g. the covariance between joints and the constraints due to musculoskeletal geometry) contributes to the topographic organisation. We find that, while some level of organisation remains (S5A Fig), it is less pronounced (S5B Fig), suggesting that the structure of natural movement shapes topographic organisation in conjunction with lateral effects. In addition to predicting the spatial organisation of proprioceptive coding, our model enables testable predictions about the representation of movements involving multiple joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder) across the neural population. To obtain a measure of how the 3 joints (Fig 6A) are encoded across the cortical surface relative to each other, we found the average correlation with firing rate for all the degrees of freedom of each joint. All joints were evenly represented across the whole population (Fig 6B), but no neurons correlated with only one joint. Many modelled neurons were correlated even with non-adjacent joints, e.g. elbow-wrist or even all three joints, possibly a result of the natural covariance patterns that exist between joints. For pairwise joint sensitivity comparisons see scatter plots (S6 Fig). (A) Joint angle axes, 3 per joint. (B) 3D plot showing the relative sensitivity of each neuron to joint inputs.

The maps had a spatial pattern of ripple-like transitions between positive (white) and negative (black) correlations (Fig 6C), producing topographic clusters of neurons that are sensitive to particular joints (Fig 6D). The scale of these clusters approximately matched the that of the Mexican-hat lateral connection range. Regions of pure red, green, or blue in Fig 6D would correspond to neurons responsive to only shoulder, elbow, or wrist respectively. Instead, colours that are the result of blending two or more joints predominate. Here, we combine natural proprioceptive stimuli with a novel model of neural coding and topographical organization of neurons in somatosensory cortex to help develop our understanding of proprioceptive coding and allowing us to paint a picture beyond that we can see through the restricted lens of neural recordings. Core to our approach was allowing the model to learn to represent the statistics of natural human movements rather than stereotyped movements, which under the efficient coding hypothesis is key to understanding sensory representations in the nervous system [27,37–39]. Our topo-VAE is designed to reflect information processing in cortex: we hypothesise that the cortex learns, through experience, an efficient representation of the somatosensory world which we replicate here as a deep autoencoder network. The network learns a nonlinear mapping from kinematic inputs into a “cortical” latent space of spiking neurons, which embodies a stochastic, generative model of movement-related neural activity. While VAEs have been used before to learn both single neuron and population level features from spike train data [40,41] a vanilla VAE cannot induce a topographic mapping on the data. Consequently, they cause nearby input variables (stimuli) to be represented in arbitrary locations across the latent space. By contrast, the latent space of a topo-VAE is arranged as a two-dimensional cortical surface, thereby creating a population of neurons on a square grid. This enables a lateral interaction term between neighbouring neurons to be added, that shapes cortical activity into local neighbourhoods, allowing it to learn cortical-like spatial structure as well as temporal single-neuron activity patterns, both of which we compare to recorded neural data. Previous self-organising maps [23,42,43] operate on less biologically plausible grounds. For example, Kohonen-type maps operate on winner-takes-all, non-spiking activation (and consequently, their training updates synaptic connections in a winner-takes-all form as well) [43]. Therefore, only one neuron can ever be active for given a sensory stimulus in a Kohonen map, a property very unlike actual proprioceptive cortex. In contrast, any number of neurons in our topo-VAE can be active simultaneously (and consequently, all synaptic connections are updated as sensory information is processed). Likewise, Poisson GLMs consider only the input statistics when producing simulated neural responses. While it is possible to reproduce the coding properties of individual neurons from convergence of peripheral inputs to a GLM, those models can tell us little about the role of neighbouring cells in shaping receptive fields or neuroanatomy-neural function relationships in general. It is important to note that there would be alternative ways to introduce lateral effects in the latent space which might better reflect biological circuits than the loss term used here. For example, our current approach simply encourages nearby neurons to be active when driven by similar inputs, and distant neurons to be active for differing inputs. However, lateral effects in biological circuits involve causal excitatory and inhibitory interactions between neurons. Such interactions may be better modelled in a network with recurrent feedback, which would also enable the latent space to be conditioned on sequences of stimuli. Alternatively, conditional random fields [44,45] could capture this property without the need for recurrent feedback, by conditioning the probability of a neuron firing on both the input, and the state of neighbouring neurons (defined by an undirected graph similar to Ψ). Emergent from our model, were neurons with tuning surfaces comparable to those of recorded neurons as monkeys performed the same centre-out task (Fig 2A and 2B). Furthermore, higher-level features of the modelled neurons, such as PD distributions and the distributions of tuning curve features, were comparable to recorded neurons, particularly when the model was constrained by lateral effects and trained on stimuli that reflected the natural distributions of arm movement (Figs 2 and 3). However, they were not captured perfectly (e.g. the PD and tuning geometry distributions of modelled neurons were still significantly different from those of recorded neurons, p<0.005; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Despite this, the current model is able provide multiple predictions about the nature of proprioceptive coding, one of which we partially validate with our limited neural data. Future work includes identifying additional constraints that can allow the model to better reproduce neural data from proprioceptive cortex. The well-known somatosensory homunculus represents only the tactile component of somatosensation and its well-ordered map of the skin receptors. Since the human tactile homunculus has driven much of neuroscience’s intuition about somatosensory representations, it is tempting to hypothesise that proprioceptive representations might also be similarly structured. However, proprioception is driven not by receptors embedded in a “simple” two-dimensional sheet, but rather by different types of muscle receptors with varying dynamics, that span one, two, and even three joints. Thus, the expectation that proprioception and touch might share a similar homunculus may not be reasonable. Indeed, instead of a point-to-point mapping to the limb, in our model, we find structure akin to the pinwheels of the visual cortex, here representing hand movement direction instead of orientation selectivity. While the relatively large spacing of electrodes used to record neural data from area 2 does not allow us to confirm the pinwheel anatomical structure directly, there are signatures of it in the recordings, such as the fact that neurons recorded on a given electrode tend to have more similar PDs than those recorded on separate electrodes–a necessary, but not sufficient property for proprioceptive pinwheels. Our model predicts not only the spatial organisation of tuning, but also the receptive fields of single neurons–although this prediction remains difficult to test with our currently available data. We find that modelled neurons encode combinations of joints, both adjacent (shoulder-elbow) and distant (shoulder-wrist). Such convergence in monkey somatosensory cortex has been observed for the hand [46,47] and must be present to some extent in the proximal arm, given its multi-articular muscles. Our model used only joint-based inputs (i.e., the kinematic state or pose of the arm) but knows nothing about the musculoskeletal mechanics of the limb (e.g., the fact that bi-articulate muscles span multiple joints), beyond what can be inferred from correlations between joint angles. Nonetheless, multi-joint coding emerged for most neurons in our model. The correlations between motion of different joints that we observe in the natural data are substantial (4 principal components explain 80% of the variance of the seven degrees of freedom of the arm) and are the result of three main factors: 1) the biomechanics of the body, including the way many muscles span multiple joints, 2) the way the brain controls movements and 3) the tasks performed. Arguably, task requirements drive a substantial amount of the correlations. By training the topo-VAE on a highly varied dataset of natural movement, we enable it to generalise from these natural tasks to planar centre-out movements. Using this same dataset, Ejaz and colleagues showed that the pairwise similarity of finger-specific fMRI activity patterns in human sensorimotor cortex was better explained by the correlation structure of hand movements than muscle activity [37]. Therefore, the emergence of multi-joint proprioceptive receptive fields may be a further example of the shaping of neural activity by higher-order features of movements [48], analogous to higher-order features of visual receptive fields, such as edges in V1 [22]. It is important to acknowledge that while the comparisons between modelled and recorded neurons are promising, it is largely a qualitative similarity, particularly at the level of population statistics. Understanding what further constraints might enable our model to better reproduce these features will be an important step in further elucidating the principles that shape proprioceptive representations in the brain. We also make the key assumption that the proprioceptive organizational principles captured by our topo-VAE model based on the kinematics of human movement would extend to monkeys. While this assumption seems to have largely held, there may still exist differences that contribute to the inconsistencies between our model and recorded neurons. This may be addressed in future work using musculoskeletal models [49,50] to identify upper limb kinematics that are inconsistent between macaques and humans and filter them from the training data. Another key limitation of the current model is the use of only joint kinematics. Biological inputs to proprioceptive cortex are received from muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs, which convey muscle length, velocity, and force information. An important future direction will be to test the topo-VAE on such inputs, whether they be recorded experimentally or inferred from existing kinematic data using musculoskeletal simulations. Furthermore, because of its accessibility with Utah multielectrode arrays, we compared our modelled neurons to those recorded in area 2 of the somatosensory cortex, an area that combines cutaneous and muscle information in single neurons. Area 3a, on the other hand, has only muscle-receptor inputs, and shares many features with the adjacent motor cortex. One might expect an even closer correspondence between our model and area 3. Lastly, we would like to highlight the observation that, when trained on the stereotyped centre-out-data only, the topo-VAE predicted recorded neuron data more poorly than when it was trained on the richer natural movement data. We interpret this to reflect the efficient coding hypothesis [26], whereby a population of sensory neurons are optimised to code stimuli representative of those found in their natural environment. Such codes are well documented in the visual [22] and auditory systems [51]–here we provide evidence that this may also be the case for proprioceptive neurons. This points towards the importance of working with training data that matches the natural distribution of stimuli when modelling sensory neurons, as it suggests important features of the neural code (such as the complex receptive fields predicted by our model) will only be elucidated under these conditions. This observation may be of great importance for the many proprioceptive and motor neurophysiology experiments that have been conducted in highly constrained lab settings, settings that may not contain adequate ethologically relevant kinematic statistics to uncover the true coding of cortical neurons. Undertaking electrophysiological experiments with a broader repertoire of movements may affect proprioceptive neuroscience as much as the adoption of natural images did for understanding vision. All surgical and experimental procedures were fully consistent with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Northwestern University under protocol number IS00000367. All human participants provided written consent, and experiments were approved by Imperial College Research Ethics Committee under Reference No. 18IC3815. In the following we lay out the rationale for building our model and the model itself, the various forms of data we collected for model training and validation, and the validation methodology. The topo-VAE model (cf. Fig 1D–1G) uses the autoencoder framework to model sensory representations. Autoencoders are a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient encodings of unlabelled data [52]. We choose a variational autoencoder (VAE) [28] because we want the latent cortical layer to capture the stochasticity and variability inherent to neural representations [53]. Let be a set of N sensory stimuli consisting of D features, following the natural behaviour distribution p(X). A group of cortical neurons, arranged in a 2D grid, are activated by the sensory stimuli X and generate firing patterns . This relationship is captured by the conditional distribution p(Z│X), which is dependent on p(X), and therefore intractable. However, it is possible to approximate p(Z│X) through variational inference by optimising a more tractable distribution, q(Z), to minimise the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which can be derived from the Kullback-Leibler divergence between q(Z) and p(Z│X): (1) By maximising the ELBO, we avoid having to compute p(X) while still guaranteeing that the DKL[q(Z)││p(Z│X)] is minimised, since: (2) where log p(x) is a fixed quantity for a given X. In the case of a VAE, P(Z│X) is approximated by an encoder network qθ(Z│X) and P(Z│X) by a decoder network pϕ(X│Z), where θ and ϕ represent the trainable parameters of the encoder and the decoder, respectively. For a given data sample xn the network is optimised according to the loss function: (3) Where is the negative log-likelihood of the nth data sample (the reconstruction loss), and DKL[qθ(z│xn)│p(z)] is a regularisation term that pushes qθ(z│xn) towards some prior distribution (which can also be thought of as enforcing an expected firing rate on the neurons in the latent space). In a conventional VAE the encoder network parameterises a Gaussian latent distribution. However, we choose to have the encoder network parameterise a Bernoulli latent distribution, such that zn is sampled from a distribution of {0,1}, thus constraining the model to a spike-based encoding scheme (which allows modelled neurons to be analysed with the same methods as those used for the recorded neural data.). This sampling step is made differentiable (enabling gradient estimation of network parameters) using the Gumbel-softmax trick [54]: (4) where τ is the softmax temperature, which causes zn to become one-hot as τ approaches 0 (a value of 0.1 is used for this work), gi is a random sample from the Gumbel distribution G(0,1), defined by the probability density function: (5) and π = [p 1-p] is a vector defining the probability of a neuron spiking vs. not spiking, where p is set by the output of the encoder network for each neuron. For the Bernoulli prior, values closer to 0.5 enforce greater noise in the spiking activity of latent neurons. We choose a Bernoulli prior of p(Z = 1│X) = 0.01, which was found to enforce sparse activity in the latent space without decreasing reconstruction quality (S7 Fig, top panel). In a conventional VAE, latent neurons lack the spatial relationships that constrain neural codes in cortex. Given this, we add a simple organisational mechanism that links learning of neighbouring latent neurons, effectively implementing cortical lateral connectivity with short range excitation and longer-range inhibition, by adding an additional term to the loss function of the VAE (Eq 3). This term is constructed by first assigning a unique 2D position to each neuron in the latent space, defined by , which arranges neurons in an M × M topographic map. We then define a function, ψ, to specify the desired activity relationship between neurons. The Mexican-hat function, which transitions with distance from excitation to inhibition before vanishing [55] is a natural choice for cortical neurons (Fig 1F and 1G). For two neurons with indices, p,q ∈[1,M], the function ψ(p,q) returns the desired lateral effect between these neurons: (6) where d(ωp,ωq)2 represents the Euclidean distance between neurons with indices p and q in the cortical grid: (7) and σ is a hyperparameter defining the common length scale of local excitation and intermediate-range inhibition. As shown in Fig 1G, the transition from maximum excitation to maximum inhibition spans a distance of 2σ and the lateral effect vanishes at about 4σ. This term forms the basis of the topography in the topo-VAE, enabling it to learn both receptive field tuning properties (in an unsupervised manner through deep feature learning) and establishes a topographic relationship between neurons. To compare our modelling and recording results, we chose hyperparameters of the topographic map with consideration of 1) spatial densities of S1 neurons and 2) characteristics of the neural recording devices. The density of neurons in S1 is about 8M – 17M per cm3 [56,57] of which 70% to 90% are pyramidal cells [58]. The thickness of cortex varies from 1 mm to 4.5 mm [59,60]. The Utah electrode array has 100 microelectrodes arranged in a 10 x 10 configuration with 400 μm separation along each axis, thus spanning 3.6 mm x 3.6 mm of the cortex. We model neuronal anatomy as voxels or cubes, where the number of pyramidal cells contained within 1mm3 of cortex varies from 12,000 to 100,000, which means every 1 mm along the cortical surface crosses about 20–50 pyramidal cells (see Fig 1C). The electrode array therefore captures a grid of approximately 80 x 80 neurons (for an evaluation of how decreasing this grid size affects the reconstruction score of the learned encoding, see S8 Fig). This means the range of the lateral effect parameter σ translates to a 1–2 neuron spacing on our cortical model grid (assuming the radius of dendritic input to these cortical neurons of around 200 μm [61]). The precise value of σ was determined post-hoc using model selection by numerically sweeping through a set of values (σ = {1,2,3}) and selecting the value that best reproduced Fig 4C. It is important to note that Fig 4B and 4C were similar across all tested values of σ when the Mexican hat lateral effect was used, while no other lateral effects achieved this similarity at any value of σ. The topographic property of the VAE arises from the lateral effect component of the loss function (Eq 6). As a control, we tested our model with no lateral effects (Fig 5A–5D), and with several different distance functions (Mexican hat, inverted Mexican hat, excitation only, inhibition only; Fig 5F and 5G). The inverted Mexican hat lateral effect is the additive inverse of the Mexican hat function (Eq 6). Excitation-only lateral effect is defined as: (8) and the inhibition-only lateral effect is the additive inverse of the excitation-only lateral effect (Eq 8). From the perspective of probabilistic inference, this regularisation item is equivalent to amending the prior distribution p(z)) and modifies the target function as: (9) where the normalisation factor is a constant. In this form, both the firing sparsity and the lateral effect are expressed within the amended prior distribution p*(z) and the target function is maintained in a standard variational autoencoder framework. The overall total loss function for optimising the topo-VAE model is therefore given by: (10) where Ψ is a matrix representing the pairwise interactions between all the neuron indices in the range [1,M], with each element Ψp,q = ψ(p,q), and γ weights the importance of the KL-lateral effect terms during optimisation. For the model we present in the results, γ was chosen such that the reconstruction score of the model was not decreased by excessive topographic organisation. If γ is set too low, no topography occurs. If γ is set too high, just a few neurons (that are closest neighbours of each other) will dominate the activity in the latent space across all input stimuli, resulting in poor reconstruction. Based on this, we found γ = 20 to be an ideal value (S7 Fig, bottom panel). The encoder component of the model contains a fully connected hidden layer of size 500, with a tanh activation function, and a final linear readout layer with a sigmoid activation function. The reconstruction error of the model is measured using mean squared error. The decoder network is a linear mapping from neural activities Z to the reconstructions of the sensory stimuli . The topo-VAE model was implemented in Python using PyTorch [62] and run on a GPU workstation. All models were trained for 100 epochs using the Adam optimiser with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 400 (found using a random search over hyperparameters to maximise reconstruction score). We recorded full-body movements from 18 healthy right-handed participants in two experimental scenarios. In the natural behaviour scenario (see Figs 1B and S1), subjects performed unconstrained daily tasks in a working kitchen environment. As food preparation and feeding are universal behaviours, the only direction given to subjects was to prepare and eat an omelette. For this modelling work we used only the arm movement data (including wrist but not digits). The average recording time across subjects was 22 minutes. In the second movement scenario, a subject performed planar centre-out reaches in a 20x20 cm horizontal task space (see Fig 1C) to mimic the movement data for the monkey task. The horizontal task space was aligned 20 cm below the subject’s shoulder and centred on the mid-line at 30 cm forward of the chest. Arm movements in both scenarios were recorded at 60 Hz by an XSENS 3D motion tracking suit, a full-body sensor network based on inertial sensors. We used biomechanical models and fusion algorithms (including calibration and validation) to estimate joint angles. Fig 1A shows the biomechanical structure and coordinate system used in this paper. Arm movement datasets were formatted as time series of angles between segments following the International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) Euler angle extractions [29] in a ZXY coordinate. For the elbow and the wrist, angular rotations of Z, X and Y represent flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation, respectively. During planar movements, we used optical tracking as well as the motion tracking suit for capturing the endpoint (hand) position on the task square. Data from the inertial and optical motion tracking systems were synchronised manually via cue-based movements before, during and after the recording period. We computed angular velocity profiles from the recorded data and analysed the natural movement dataset Xnat and the planar movement dataset Xpl. The first two principal components of the planar movements explained over 95% of the total variance, but only half of the variance of the natural movements. This reveals that joint velocities of planar movements are highly constrained, as expected, to a 2-dimensional subspace. We applied the manipulative complexity metric [63] to quantify the complexity of the movements, which is defined as: (11) Where VAFi is the variance captured by the ith PC. Larger values of C indicate higher complexity and a value of C = 1 means that all PCs contribute equally to the total variance. The complexity of planar movements was 0.06, much lower than the natural movement complexity of 0.5. We defined the direction θ and speed v of planar movements in world coordinates: 90°/270° are respectively away from and towards the chest, 180°/0° are to the left and right. At training time, we also pre-process the input data. The empirical distribution of joint angular velocities during movements in our tasks is symmetric, unimodal, with sharp peaks at zero and heavy tails towards large speeds. To ensure equal contributions to model optimisation, these features are standardised without mean centring (since they are already approximately zero-centred, and to preserve the correspondence of a zero-valued input to zero joint angular velocity). This pre-processing also improves the training efficiency and convergence of our model without breaking the spatial structure of natural movements. In addition, since the original kinematic data is sampled at a frequency of 60Hz, we subsample the training data at a depth of 1%, to remove redundancy and improve training times, without significant effects on the outcome of the model. After training, we evaluate the converged model with data from the planar reaching task, which undergoes the same pre-processing steps as the training data. Preferred directions are one of the primary tuning properties used when comparing modelled and recorded neurons in this work. To calculate the preferred direction of a neuron (both modelled and recorded), we use a simple bootstrapping procedure. For each iteration, we draw random points from the dataset conforming to a uniform distribution of movement directions and fit Poisson generalised linear models (GLM) with angular velocity inputs to the firing rate for the sampled timepoints. For a given input X ‐ a T by 2 (number of velocity inputs) matrix ‐ the GLM model predicts a probability mass function of firing rates, y, according to: (12) Sampling y from this distribution gives a T (number of time points) by N (number of neurons) matrix of firing rate estimates. β is a 2 by N matrix of encoding parameters, which is optimised using maximum likelihood estimation. The preferred direction is then calculated from the encoding vector of the GLM as: (13) In these equations, a bootstrapped PD estimate of neuron i is defined by and , the GLM parameters for mapping hand velocity in the y and x directions to firing rate estimates. We take the circular mean of the PD estimates over all bootstrap iterations to find the PD for each neuron. This method of PD calculation is used for both recorded and modelled neurons. To quantify the sensitivity of neurons to specific joints (Fig 6), we individually perturb each input feature of the model and measure the Pearson correlation between individual neurons in the latent space and that feature. Since each joint is represented by three input features (angular velocity in the Z, X, and Y axes), we use the mean of the absolute correlation across all three axes to quantify the sensitivity of a given neuron to a particular joint. We used a combination of previously recorded data in which three rhesus macaques performed a planar, centre-out reaching task while seated, using a two-link planar manipulandum. A cursor displayed on a monitor tracked the position of the manipulandum and provided visual feedback for the monkey as he reached for a target on-screen. The monkey moved the cursor to a central target in the workspace. After a random delay period, 1 of 8 targets spaced evenly in a circle around the central target appeared on the screen and the monkey moved the cursor toward it upon an audible ‘go’ cue. After placing the cursor in the target for a random hold time of 0–500 ms, the monkey received a liquid reward and returned the cursor to the central target. We used 6 experimental sessions across three monkeys; two sessions contain data that has been previously published [64], and the rest will be published alongside this study. All procedures were in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Northwestern University under protocol #IS00000367. Once a monkey was trained on the experimental apparatus, a 96-channel microelectrode array with 1 mm iridium-oxide coated electrodes (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc.) was pneumatically inserted in Brodmann’s area 2, near the intraparietal sulcus [64]. The implantation site was chosen to avoid cerebral vasculature and maximise proximal arm representation. All surgery was performed under isoflurane gas anaesthesia (1–2 percent) except during intraoperative recording to identify the arm representations, when the monkey was transitioned to a mixture of <0.5% isoflurane and remifentanil (0.4 ug/kg/min). The data were recorded from the microelectrode array using the Cerebus multichannel data recording system (Blackrock Microsystems, Inc.). Thresholded waveforms and timing of behavioural task events were synchronised and recorded for offline analyses. The position of the handle was recorded at 1kHz. We discriminated single neurons using Offline Sorter (Plexon, Inc., Dallas TX). 383 recorded neurons were found to be suitable for subsequent analysis.

The sum of correlations across joints is then normalised such that a neuron with equal elbow, shoulder and wrist tuning would be positioned at 33.33% for each joint in the above plots. Each plot shows the relative tuning of each neuron (one data point) to joint inputs for the following pairs: (A) Elbow vs Shoulder, (B) Wrist vs Elbow, and (C) Wrist vs Shoulder. The colour of each dot is set by using their x, y, and z location in the plot to drive their respective red, green, and blue colour channels.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Aluminum and Aluminum Mining Stocks To Buy. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) stands against other best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks to buy. Aluminum is a versatile and lightweight metal known for its low density and being roughly one-third the weight of steel or copper. Its unique properties, such as high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, and excellent conductivity, make it essential in various sectors, including transportation, construction, and packaging. One of the primary drivers of aluminum’s growth is the increasing focus on sustainability across industries. With its recyclability and lower carbon footprint compared to other metals, aluminum is becoming a go-to material for green technologies. The automotive and electric vehicle (EV) industry, in particular, is driving demand for aluminum as manufacturers seek lightweight materials to improve efficiency and range. By incorporating aluminum into vehicle designs, automakers also meet regulatory standards for emissions reduction. Aluminum also plays a critical role in the renewable energy sector, as the production of solar and wind products requires significant amounts of aluminum. In addition to these industries, aluminum’s unique properties make it an ideal material for food packaging, and the construction sector, including infrastructure, and development. In the report, Opportunities for Aluminium in a Post-COVID Economy, conducted by CRU International, the global demand for aluminum is projected to rise by nearly 40% by 2030. The aluminum sector will need to produce an additional 33.3 million tonnes to meet this demand, with production increasing from 86.2 million tonnes in 2020 to 119.5 million tonnes by 2030 across all industrial sectors. According to the report, two-thirds of this demand growth is expected to come from China, which will require 12.3 Mt, whereas the rest of Asia will add a further 8.6 Mt. North American region will require 5.1 Mt and Europe 4.8 Mt. Together, these four regions alone will account for more than 90% of the additional aluminum required globally.

In an interview with CNBC on November 12, William Oplinger, President and CEO of Alcoa, said that he considers the Chinese market a crucial factor in the aluminum industry. He noted that China’s enormous appetite for commodities, particularly in the green sector, has a significant impact on the aluminum market. China currently produces around 45 million metric tons of aluminum, out of a global market of 75 million metric tons. However, the country has capped its production capacity at 45 million metric tons, meaning that any growth in demand will be met through secondary and recycling sources. In terms of near-term dynamics, Oplinger expressed optimism about the demand for aluminum, citing continued strength in the packaging business, growth in the automotive and transportation sector, and potential growth in building construction spurred by lower interest rates worldwide. Looking ahead to the long term, Oplinger emphasized the importance of aluminum in the energy transition economy, highlighting growth opportunities in areas such as electrical conductors, photovoltaic cells, and electric vehicles. On November 29, China’s finance ministry announced that it would be making significant changes to its export tax rebate policy, set to take effect on December 1. The ministry announced that it will cancel the export tax rebate for several products, including aluminum and copper products. The announcement had an immediate impact on the market, with aluminum prices surging on the London Metal Exchange. Traders are anticipating that the cancellation of the export tax rebate for aluminum will curb the heavy flow of Chinese aluminum exports, leading to a reduction in global supply and a subsequent increase in prices. As the aluminum industry continues to evolve amidst a changing global landscape, one thing remains certain, the growing demand for this versatile metal looks bright. With growing demand, shifting market dynamics, and emerging trends shaping the sector, now is an exciting time for investors to explore opportunities in the aluminum market. For this article, we sifted through Base Metal ETFs and online rankings to form an initial list of 20 companies that are involved in the production, extraction, processing, or sale of aluminum and aluminum-related products. We then used Insider Monkey’s Hedge Fund database to rank 10 stocks according to the largest number of hedge fund holders. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment, as of the third quarter. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A closeup of a freshly rolled aluminum product being produced in a factory. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34 Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) specializes in aluminum rolled products, structural parts, and extruded products for the aerospace, automotive, and packaging industries. The company’s clients include leading automakers and beverage companies. Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) is investing heavily in recycling technologies to enhance its sustainability profile and improve operational efficiency. On November 12, 2024, Constellium SE (NYSE:CSTM) made a significant announcement regarding a major breakthrough in aluminum recycling for the automotive industry. The company successfully implemented Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) technology at an industrial scale. This innovation addresses a significant challenge in automotive aluminum recycling, which is the proper segregation of alloy families. Traditionally, mixed alloys from scrap were downcycled, limiting their use in high-value applications. However, the LIBS sorting technology enables rapid and accurate sorting of aluminum scrap, achieving over 95% purity for both alloy families. This means that recycled aluminum can be used to produce high-quality solutions without compromising material integrity. This achievement has the potential to transform aluminum recycling practices on a global scale. The company’s Vice President of Global Automotive, Dieter Holl, highlighted the significance of this innovation, stating that it is an “unprecedented leap forward for the industry” and allows for the recovery of high-quality alloys from pre-consumer scrap, reducing the carbon footprint and supporting customers’ sustainability goals. Overall, CSTM ranks 3rd on our list of best aluminum and aluminum mining stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of CSTM to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than CSTM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Managed by Fortlake—recently named Fixed Income Manager of the Year in Australia— the fund’s units will be transformed into digital tokens, a process called tokenization, where real-world assets (RWAs) are represented on a blockchain, the companies announced exclusively to Decrypt. The collaborations seek to simplify asset management by bringing traditional financial assets on-chain and expanding access to decentralized finance (DeFi). The trio believes the fund’s tokenization leads to new opportunities within DeFi, “such as integrations with lending markets, use as a high-yield stablecoin savings solution, or as margin trading collateral.” “Partnering with Backed, Sonic, and Chainlink to tokenize the Sigma Opportunities Fund is a substantial development in the way we provide access to our fund for the rapidly growing digital asset investor base,” Christian Baylis, founder and CIO of Fortlake said in a statement. “We believe this collaboration marks the beginning of a new era in traditional asset management fundraising.” As a global fixed-income investment strategy targeting high yield, the fund targets returns between 7 and 10%, according to Fortlake’s own product disclosure statement. Fortlake has over $1 billion in assets under management across all of its funds. Tokenization will occur using Backed’s Tokenization-as-a-Service (TaaS) platform. Those tokens will be backed 1:1 by units, ensuring their value corresponds to the real-time Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund—essentially the fund’s worth per share. “Tokenizing the Fortlake Sigma Fund is a major step forward in the blockchain landscape,” said Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed. “It showcases how institutions can use blockchain technology to simplify back-office operations and reach new capital.” The tokens will then be integrated into the Sonic blockchain, a platform capable of processing 10,000 transactions per second with one-second finality. Chainlink’s SmartData technology also ensures the fund’s value is accurately recorded on the blockchain, the trio said. Chainlink’s Proof of Reserves feature verifies that the fund always backs the tokens, so investors know their assets are secure. Chainlink also uses CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) to allow these tokens to work across multiple blockchains. The partnership points to the growing interest in blockchain-based solutions for asset management. Recently, stablecoin issuer Tether launched Hadron, a tokenization platform for digital and real-world assets that lets users tokenize various assets, from stocks and bonds to stablecoins and loyalty points. A few weeks back, Japan’s SBI Digital Markets announced it is developing a cross-border framework for tokenized assets, connecting regulated digital asset exchanges across multiple regions to boost liquidity and lower costs. With institutions like BlackRock and JP Morgan exploring tokenization, the Bank of America predicts the sector could reach $16 trillion in value within the next 15 years. "The future of tokenization is accelerating toward greater institutional adoption," Jakob Kronbichler, CEO and co-founder of DeFi credit marketplace Clearpool, told Decrypt. "While tokenized treasuries and stablecoins currently dominate RWA use cases, the future promises growing traction in real estate, private credit, and other asset classes like commodities." Edited by Sebastian Sinclair Editor's note: This story was updated after publication to update the amount of assets under management at Fortlake. Comments from Clearpool have also been added.

Title: Why Is Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB) Among the Dividend Kings You Should Consider?
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-kimberly-clark-corporation-kmb-131610948.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Dividend Kings List: Top 15. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) stands against the other dividend kings you should know about. Dividend Kings are a distinguished group of companies that have achieved at least 50 consecutive years of dividend increases. While some of these companies are part of the S&P index, the two categories are not entirely overlapping. The appeal of Dividend Kings became especially clear after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. During this time, numerous companies either reduced or suspended their dividends, leaving income-focused investors disappointed. Many had assumed that dividend-paying stocks were inherently lower risk, only to face steep share price drops alongside payout cuts. However, Dividend Kings stand out for their remarkable consistency, boasting 50 years of uninterrupted dividend increases. This long history of reliable payouts provides a sense of stability, even in volatile market conditions. Investors often gravitate toward firms with a track record of consistent dividend growth, as such companies tend to perform well in declining or stagnant markets. Even during periods of strong market performance, dividend growers have captured a significant share of the gains. Following a long-term dividend growth strategy can aid in compounding returns for investors. A T. Rowe Price report highlighted that, between 1985 and 2022, companies in the Russell index that consistently increased dividends outperformed the broader benchmark. Furthermore, these companies exhibited lower price volatility compared to the overall market. Earning income through dividend stocks is a gradual process that requires patience and a commitment to long-term investing. These stocks are particularly suited for investors with a long-term horizon, as they have consistently outpaced inflation over time. According to data from Morningstar and Yale University's Robert Shiller, since 1871, the market’s dividends per share have grown at an annualized rate 1.6 percentage points higher than inflation. Moreover, the gap between dividend growth and inflation has widened in recent years. Over the past 50 years, dividends have outpaced inflation by 2.5 percentage points annually, and in the last 20 years, the margin has grown to 4.6 percentage points per year. During market rallies, dividend-growing stocks may underperform as investor enthusiasm and momentum often take precedence over fundamentals such as valuation and business quality. This trend has been especially noticeable in the recent past, with dividend stocks lagging behind the broader market. Nonetheless, maintaining a long-term strategy centered on dividend growth can be advantageous, as the benefits accumulate over time with each increase in payouts. Companies with solid fundamentals and robust financial stability are typically well-positioned to sustain and grow their dividends. In contrast, smaller or emerging businesses often prioritize reinvesting earnings into their operations to fuel growth. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend kings with the highest yields. Our Methodology: To create this list, we examined a set of over 50 dividend king companies, recognized for consistently increasing dividends for 50 years or more. From this group, we selected companies with the highest dividend yields as of December 3 and organized them in ascending order based on their yield, from lowest to highest. We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 900 as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A stack of disposable diapers in the foreground with a mother and her baby in the background. Dividend Yield as of December 3: 3.51% Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE:KMB) is an American consumer goods company that offers a wide range of related products to its consumers. Since the pandemic, many large consumer goods companies have increased their prices to counteract rising costs, which are now starting to stabilize from their peak levels.

XRP could outshine 86% of S&P 500 firms, including Pfizer and Citigroup. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. XRP’s price surge propelled its market capitalization past $150 billion, which would place it among the top 100 companies in the United States if it were a corporate entity. Data from CryptoSlate shows that the digital asset, whose value more than doubled in the past month to as high as $2.82 on Dec. 3, significantly outperformed Bitcoin by a staggering 200%. While XRP’s price has slightly retraced to $2.61 as of press time, the asset still registered an impressive 409% increase after the November US elections. Nevertheless, this surge has helped boost XRP’s market cap to around $150 billion, a more than five-times increase from around $28 billion at the beginning of November. XRP now ranks as the third-largest crypto, trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum but surpassing Tether’s USDT stablecoin, the Binance-backed BNB Coin and Solana network. Market analysts attribute this growth to several factors, including growing institutional interest. There is optimism that a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the upcoming administration could further benefit both XRP and Ripple. According to CompanyMarketCap data, if XRP were classified as a standalone company, its market cap would rank it among the top 100 US firms, surpassing notable companies like Nike and financial institutions like Charles Schwab. Further analysis with Stock Analysis suggests that XRP would be the 68th largest company in the S&P 500, surpassing 86% of the stocks within the index. Specifically, XRP would be valued higher than pharmaceutical giant Pfizer ($144 billion), Citigroup ($136 billion), and defense contractor Lockheed Martin ($122.5 billion). However, it would trail behind BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, with a market value of $160 billion, and Uber, the ride-hailing transportation company, with a valuation of $150 billion. XRP’s market value would also be more than three times greater than that of NASDAQ, valued at $46.55 billion, and gaming firm Electronic Arts, worth $43.98 billion. The S&P 500 Index, which tracks 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the US, is a key performance benchmark for the American stock market. While it is not exclusively based on market cap, it is widely regarded as a critical measure of the performance of major US equities.

Title: Conservative Microsoft Eyes Bitcoin As MicroStrategy And Nvidia Lead

Nvidia earns profits from bitcoin mining, while Microsoft contemplates investing in bitcoin (Photo ... [+] by Rasit Aydogan/Anadolu via Getty Images) Students of history know that even the most iconoclastic revolutionary sooner or later becomes a conservative. It’s no different in the tech sector. Those AI founders who are currently tearing up the rulebook? The decentralization pioneers building the next iteration of the web? One day they too will be legacy firms, grappling with upstart innovators in the battle to remain relevant. So when Silicon Valley aristocracy like Microsoft changes tack and embraces an emerging technology like bitcoin, everyone needs to sit up and take notice. Next month, the software giant that did so much to create the modern world will vote on ‘an assessment in investing in bitcoin’ — admittedly, in the teeth of opposition from many on its board. It’s not Microsoft’s sheer size that makes this so significant, although its staggering $3 trillion valuation can’t be ignored. It’s that the philosophy of bitcoin and blockchain runs directly counter to the principles of centralization on which today’s Big Tech monopolies were built. Were Microsoft to buy into bitcoin, it would be a not-so-tacit admission that the future is decentralized, and that even the world’s biggest companies have little choice but to turn their most dearly-held assumptions on their head. Microsoft is considering Bitcoin as an investment (Photo by Jeenah Moon/Getty Images) Let’s not get ahead of ourselves: there’s perhaps an equal chance Microsoft shareholders will vote not to put bitcoin on its balance sheet…at least, not just yet. The very fact they’re considering it at all, however, has ramifications for the whole crypto industry, financial markets, governments, regulators — in fact, for all of us. The early years of bitcoin were defined by intense skepticism from financial, political, and corporate elites. This didn’t stop risk-taking enterprises like MicroStrategy from going hard and going early. Michael Saylor was roundly derided for his bet on bitcoin, but the joke is now on his critics: the strategy has been insanely lucrative, with MicroStrategy reported to have made a profit of $11 billion on its investment at the last count. “Oil tanker” enterprises with a low risk appetite like Microsoft were never going to pivot so quickly. The question is, why now? Doesn’t Microsoft’s slowness, its caution, its which-way-the-wind-blows posture mean it’s late to the bitcoin party? MicroStrategy continues to invest in Bitcoin (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via ... [+] Getty Images) Quite the opposite. Microsoft is a conservative organisation, and its consideration of bitcoin is founded on a (perhaps, grudging) acceptance of important geopolitical, macroeconomic, and adoption trends. Thanks in part to visionaries like MicroStrategy along with major financial institutions like BlackRock, not to mention growing political and regulatory approval for crypto and its derivatives, bitcoin’s risk profile has changed. While Nvidia has not directly invested in Bitcoin, the company has significantly benefited from the cryptocurrency sector, particularly through the demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in Bitcoin mining. This demand has contributed to Nvidia's substantial revenue growth. Notably, Nvidia faced a shareholder lawsuit alleging that it misrepresented the extent of its revenue derived from cryptocurrency mining. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear Nvidia's appeal in this case, highlighting the company's indirect involvement in the cryptocurrency industry. Meanwhile, blockchain continues to innovate, with Layer 2 solutions adding new functionalities on a seemingly daily basis, and powering increasing convergence between the fiat and crypto ecosystems. These are just some of the key factors driving bitcoin’s transformation from a speculative asset into the basis for a conservative investment strategy. Microsoft might be classed as a “follower” compared to MicroStrategy, but it could well be a bellwether for other conservative corporations. There are many tech entrepreneurs who can relate to President-elect Trump. They see him (much as they see themselves) as the Great Disruptor: someone unafraid to shake things up, to shoot first and ask questions later; to coin a phrase, someone who moves fast and breaks things. On bitcoin, however, Trump is more of a weathervane than a signpost. His position has shifted with the wind — it wasn’t so long ago that he was calling it “a scam against the dollar”. His wholehearted embrace of bitcoin may have moved the markets towards the long-promised milestone of $100,000 mere days after his election, but the most significant developments were already in train before he’d even announced his candidacy. These were carried out not on the financial markets but in the corridors of power. Trump supporting Bitcoin. (Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images) You don’t have to be a bitcoin obsessive to know that Congress (along with other legislatures worldwide) has been working hard on developing new laws governing crypto and digital assets. This isn’t the place to cover them all, but they include legislation like FIT 21 in the US and, of course, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), widely recognised as the world’s most ambitious and comprehensive set of regulations for crypto. The intricacies and specifics of these new regulations are less important than the wider trend they illustrate. Governments, which fought for so long against the horrifying concept of money and financial networks they couldn’t control, have finally accepted bitcoin and blockchain as a fact of life. They are now drawing up a roadmap to institutional adoption. The momentum is all in the direction of regulation that brings crypto within established financial structures; this regulatory clarity in turn breeds the kind of confidence that makes even the likes of Microsoft consider moving bitcoin onto their balance sheet. The entry of conservative corporations into bitcoin has profound consequences for the currency’s trajectory. Naturally, when skeptics of this size change their mind and add bitcoin to their treasury, it is a huge vote of confidence that increases the legitimacy, not only of the currency, but of the whole ecosystem that surrounds it. Of course, Microsoft is defined by more than its age and outlook. There’s its balance sheet and previously-mentioned valuation — whales don’t come much bigger. If Microsoft enters bitcoin in a big way, it would cause tsunami-size ripples throughout the market. Moreover, remember that the company’s operating systems run most of the computers on every desk and in every home (and a decent proportion of mobile devices, too). It’s inconceivable that Microsoft would be content simply to hold bitcoin without finding ways to add value to both its business and its balance sheet by developing new crypto- and blockchain-powered utilities, and integrating them into its software empire. These are wild times for crypto, but the adoption by ‘conservative’ enterprises could also herald a new period of stabilization by reducing the influence of retail speculation on the price. A more stable bitcoin would, in turn, attract even more interest from corporations that were once reluctant to invest. Whichever way Microsoft shareholders vote, they should remember that success in business today requires the agility and drive to constantly rethink, reinvigorate, react, and reinvent. Wise words, but sadly not my own. Just some tech bro from the distant past — Bill Gates, I think was his name. Did you enjoy this story?
