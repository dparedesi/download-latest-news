Full Content:
Ireland under-20 head coach Neil Doak has named seven players with previous experience at this age-grade level in a 31-man squad for the upcoming Six Nations Championship that begins on Thursday, January 30th, with a sold-out clash with the reigning world champions England in Cork. Doak takes over from Willie Falloon – Richie Murphy coached Ireland in last year’s Six Nations before leaving to take up his current position as head coach with Ulster – who led Ireland to fourth place in last summer’s World Championship in South Africa with Andrew Browne and Seamus Toomey joining Ian Keatley as assistant coaches. Cork-born Connacht academy prospect Éanna McCarthy will captain a squad that includes prop Alex Usanov, secondrows Alan Spicer and Billy Corrigan and hookers Henry Walker and Mikey Yarr, who played in one or other tournament. Sale Sharks scrumhalf Will Wootton, younger brother of former Munster and Connacht wing Alex, was part of last year’s squad before picking up an injury. Coming off successive Grand Slams, Ireland won four and drew one match in last season’s tournament, a 32-32 thriller with the eventual Six Nations champions England saw Murphy’s charges pipped to a third title in a row by a single bonus point. The Irish 20s beat Italy and a Leinster Development XV in warm-up matches. Walker, Wootton and Daniel Green, an outhalf-cum-fullback, came through the IQ programme. Enniscorthy centre Connor Fahy, Tullamore-born flyer Páidí Farrell, who has played Sevens for Ireland at underage level, Ciarán Mangan, younger brother of Diarmuid, Usanov, Spicer, Corrigan, Boyne secondrow Mahon Ronan, number eight Aaron O’Brien, and wings Andre Ryan and Charlie Molony, all played for Leinster in the A interpros. Centres Gene O’Leary Kareem and Eoghan Smyth, outhalf Dylan Hicks and backrow Michael Foy did likewise for Munster, while former Newbridge College prop Billy Bohan, now with the Connacht academy, backrow Bobby Power and McCarthy were on the Connacht Eagles team. Scrumhalf Clark Logan, outhalf/fullback Daniel Green and hookers Henry Walker and Connor Magee played for Ulster A. Promising tighthead prop and Leinster academy member Niall Smyth, former Newbridge fullback Todd Lawlor and Shannon duo, prop Emmet Calvey and backrow forward Luke Murphy, who both played for the 20s last year, are injured, while outhalf Casper Gabriel is ineligible for the time being. Doak said of being handed the head coach role of Irish rugby’s marquee age-grade team, having fulfilled a similar role for two years with the Irish under-18 Schools team and been an assistant coach with the 20s at the World Cup last summer: “Yeah, it’s fantastic, a hugely exciting time. “One of my sons [Ulster scrumhalf, Nathan] has come through this programme as well, so I’ve been a parent, a supporter and a spectator; so now I am a coach in the middle of it. I’m really looking forward to it and hopefully we can start off a solid season with a good performance against England. “Ultimately as a coach you have to understand the players. There is no point asking players to do things that they’re not really comfortable with and so we’ll adjust as we go along. We’ll obviously look at the other teams and see where we can exploit some avenues but from my point of view, I want to play a brand of rugby that excites the players, excites spectators.” Ireland Under-20s Backs (14) Andrew Doyle (Old Wesley/Leinster), Connor Fahy (Clontarf/Leinster), Páidí Farrell (Old Wesley/Leinster), Daniel Green (QUB/Ulster), Dylan Hicks (Garryowen/Munster), Gene O’Leary Kareem (UCC/Munster), Clark Logan (QUB/Ulster), Ciaran Mangan (Blackrock College/Leinster), Derry Moloney (Blackrock College/Leinster), Charlie Molony (UCD/Leinster), Andre Ryan (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Eoghan Smyth (Cork Constitution/Munster), Sam Wisniewski (Old Belvedere/Leinster), Will Wootton (Sale Sharks/IQ Rugby).

BlackRock expands iShares Bitcoin Trust to Canada after leading US Bitcoin ETF inflows. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) emerged as a bright spot in an otherwise challenging period for US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw their third consecutive day of net outflows on Jan. 13. According to data from Farside, the Bitcoin ETF market recorded a total net outflow of $284.1 million. BlackRock’s IBIT stood out with a $29.5 million inflow, contrasting sharply with significant outflows from other ETFs. On the other hand, Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) led the losses with $113.6 million in outflows, while ARK’s Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) followed with $92.4 million. Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of $89 million, while $18.6 million exited Bitwise’s BITB. Other Bitcoin ETFs reported no activity for the day. Over the past three trading days, cumulative outflows across the sector surpassed $1 billion. This trend indicates potential shifts in institutional investment strategies or evolving market sentiment around Bitcoin. Notably, BTC’s price had declined to a two-month low of under $89,400 before recovering to $96,828 as of press time, according to CryptoSlate’s data. BlackRock is extending its reach in the Bitcoin ETF space by launching its iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) in Canada. This development follows the fund’s notable success in the United States. According to a press statement, the Canadian rollout includes two versions of the ETF. One trades under the ticker IBIT on Cboe Canada, while a US dollar-denominated version is listed as IBIT.U. These ETFs offer investors exposure to Bitcoin by tracking its performance before deducting fund-related expenses. The iShares Bitcoin ETF primarily invests in US-traded IBIT, which holds Bitcoin as long-term assets. This structure allows investors to access Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts without dealing with custody or operational challenges. Helen Hayes, who leads iShares Canada, highlighted that the Canadian expansion reflects BlackRock’s commitment to making investments more accessible. She also noted that this launch provides a convenient and cost-efficient way for Canadian investors to gain Bitcoin exposure. BlackRock’s decision to expand IBIT follows its exceptional performance in the US, where it achieved a top 1% ranking among ETFs by assets. Over the past year, IBIT has been recognized as one of the most successful ETF launches of the decade. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Gold is one of the 'least effective' inflation hedges, according to Goldman Sachs. Here are 3 investments that actually protect your portfolio.

After a stellar year of 27% returns, it may be tempting to see gold as an investing cheat code. On top of delivering market-beating price appreciation, the yellow metal has long been regarded as a tangible store of value and inflation hedge. What more could you ask for out of an investment? But Goldman Sachs' wealth-management arm says the widespread belief that gold is a useful hedge against inflation is actually wrong. "The idea that gold is a good inflation hedge is just not correct," Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, the head of the investment strategy group and chief investment officer of wealth management, said when discussing the team's 2025 outlook. This view of gold runs contrary to that of many portfolio managers and banks, but for the skeptics, Goldman Sachs points to gold's historic performance. Gold beat the S&P 500 by 2% in 2024. But if you take a step back, the returns don't look as promising. Goldman Sachs pointed out that the 2024 year-end price of gold, at $2,625 per ounce, reflected only a 3.6% average annual increase from its nominal price in 1980. Within that period, the S&P 500 returned 11.7% annualized in nominal terms. Other commodities — such as oil, other metals, and even livestock — also have a reputation as a hedge against rapidly rising prices and wages. But Goldman says this, too, is mistaken. The total returns for oil since 2010 have been negative. Additionally, the commodity market is subject to high variability among its subsectors. Areas like agriculture and energy performed poorly, dragging the overall sector down. For investors looking to beat inflation, Goldman Sachs doesn't believe it's a good idea to put your money on commodities. "Commodities and gold are the two least effective inflation hedges," Goldman Sachs said in its 2025 outlook. What about bitcoin? Some Wall Street giants like BlackRock see a case for using bitcoin to hedge against rising deficits and inflation. Mossavar-Rahmani says don't even think about it. "It's not an investable asset," she said. "It's a gambling asset." Bitcoin has no source of cash flow, and its performance isn't tied to overall economic growth like that of stocks. Not to mention the cryptocurrency's price is extremely volatile. "The history of bitcoin is limited, so we have no evidence that cryptocurrencies are a reliable inflation or deflation hedge that will store value in an inflationary or deflationary environment," the bank said in its 2025 outlook. That doesn't mean investors can't buy or trade it, but Goldman Sachs doesn't believe investors should use bitcoin to protect against inflation or hold it as a long-term asset. If gold, commodities, and bitcoin won't protect your portfolio from inflation, what will? The best answer is also one of the simplest: US equities, which investors can get exposure to through owning the S&P 500. US stocks have a perfect track record of delivering returns in excess of inflation historically. The bank says the US market has more large, high-quality companies with robust earnings growth than international markets. "We do think that the earnings advantage that the US has will continue," Mossavar-Rahmani said. Real estate is another inflation hedge, as property values tend to rise alongside inflation. Both residential and commercial real estate offer capital-appreciation opportunities. In an inflationary environment, landlords have the pricing power to raise rents. And while rising labor and materials costs create an unfavorable, supply-constrained real-estate market, investors benefit from the value of their real estate rising alongside demand, according to the asset manager Nuveen. Lastly, Goldman Sachs points to intermediate Treasurys as another asset that performs well in the face of inflation. These government bonds mature in two to 10 years. Bond yields have been creeping up since the start of 2025, fueled by a hot December jobs report and increased worries about inflation. But Goldman Sachs predicts that yields will start to come down, meaning their value will increase — to the tune of a 6.5% return, the bank said. When a bond's price rises, its yield falls. Jump to

Title: LIZ PEEK: Joe Biden crushes Democrat agenda. This is his legacy
URL: https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/liz-peek-joe-biden-crushes-democrat-agenda-his-legacy
Time Published: 2025-01-14T10:00:01Z
Full Content:
Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane reacts to President Biden's foreign policy address on 'The Story.' In six days, President Joe Biden will leave the Oval Office, a beaten man. Not only is he responsible for his party’s loss in November, but he has also presided over the slaughter of Democrats’ most sacred cows, the ideological I-beams supporting their progressive agenda. DEI, a destructive mandate which blew up into a multi-billion-dollar industry, is being abandoned. ESG, the woke global investment directive, is being tossed overboard. "Gender-affirming care," polite words to describe the mutilation of young bodies, is being challenged by people who actually care about children. Illegal and unlimited immigration is under attack, lax law enforcement is under fire and censorship, the Left’s ultimate weapon and sin, is on the run. Meritocracy is making a comeback, common sense prevails and we have elected a president, Donald Trump, who is on the right side of these issues. This is Joe Biden’s legacy. JASON CHAFFETZ: FIVE KEYS TO BIDEN'S FAILED PRESIDENCY Biden will go down in history as an immeasurably vain and pretentious man of middling intellect who planned on being a great president and failed to be even a mediocre one. Two months into his term, Axios reported he convened a secret gathering of presidential scholars to discuss, in effect, what made presidents consequential and how he could scale those heights. He reportedly said to Doris Kearns Goodwin: "I'm no FDR, but … " Imagine the pomposity. It wasn’t just the president who had delusions of grandeur. So did his inner circle. The West Wing reportedly embodied a "think-big, go-big mentality." The session with the historians, Axios wrote, involved a "discussion of how big is too big — and how fast is too fast — to jam through once-in-a-lifetime historic changes to America." Biden hoped "to jam through what could amount to a $5 trillion-plus overhaul of America, and vast changes to voting, immigration and inequality"; he was willing to destroy the senate filibuster to get his way. Thankfully, many of the damaging measures adopted by this reckless and unpopular president will soon be overturned. Joe Biden will go down in history as an immeasurably vain and pretentious man of middling intellect who planned on being a great president and failed to be even a mediocre one. Democrats pretend, still, that Joe Biden has been a successful president. They applaud the big spending bills he signed, not because they resulted in tangible benefits to the American people, but because they drove trillions of dollars to Democrat-friendly coffers and causes. The embarrassing failures to build out charging stations or expand broadband access showcase the incompetence of his White House; the pile-up of an incremental $8 trillion in debt, 30% of the total outstanding, is the bill he leaves behind. Democrats must reckon with the aftermath. Biden has not only taken the Left off the political grid, he leaves the grid in ruins. BIDEN KEEPS INSULTING AMERICANS WITH LAST MINUTE MOVES. REPUBLICANS CAN STOP IT Corporations are scaling back DEI programs dear to liberals that were widely adopted in the wake of the George Floyd riots in 2020. Walmart, Ford, Meta, McDonald’s, Harley-Davidson, Lowe’s and John Deere are among the many companies either dumbing down their DEI efforts or abandoning them altogether. Some companies are changing the terms. McDonald’s, for instance, has rightly dropped the "E" for equity, instead emphasizing inclusion and diversity. Equity promises everyone an equal outcome, anathema to those who prefer to reward talent and effort. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Corporations are responding in part to last year’s Supreme Court ruling against Harvard’s race-based admissions policies; firms are concerned that their DEI programs could also be deemed illegal. But they are also listening to their employees, and especially those who perceive in the DEI programs a reverse bias and the scuttling of meritocracy. Financial firms are simultaneously dropping ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) guidelines, which required investors to look not only at financial results but also to grade corporations by various liberal yardsticks. The fast growth of ESG investing, which aligned trillions of dollars with Leftist ambitions, was driven by the demands of woke clients and by claims that companies which took ESG goals into account would outperform those that did not. That was false; in years when oil prices and stocks went up, for instance, ESG funds underperformed. The courts have played a role here, too. Just recently, a judge in Texas said American Airlines violated federal law by making investments for its employee retirement plan based on ESG factors rather than prioritizing high returns. In 2023, the Biden administration adopted a rule allowing certain types of retirement plans to consider ESG values in making investment choices under some circumstances; Trump will overturn that regulation. Meanwhile, major investment managers, including Blackrock, run by the uber-woke Larry Fink, have quietly exited the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, while the nation’s leading banks have all terminated their commitment to Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a similar climate initiative. Elsewhere, 26 states have now banned or limited what liberals call "gender-affirming care" for teens and children, blocking treatments which can do permanent harm. These restrictions follow similar measures in Europe, where authorities are concluding that the science does not support radical treatments for young people. Unlimited immigration, another Holy Grail of the Left, is also under attack in the U.S., and in Europe. In throwing open our borders and allowing millions to enter our country illegally, Biden has angered the country -- not only at Democrats who encouraged this unwanted flood of new arrivals, but at the newcomers themselves. Illegal immigration makes a mockery of our rule of law, has overwhelmed the finances and infrastructure of numerous cities and states, allowed the devastating importation of deadly fentanyl and undermined our national security. At the top of Donald Trump’s agenda is overturning Biden’s lawless approach. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Finally, Democrats’ efforts to censor Americans (remember the Disinformation Governance Board?) are now kaput. With Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announcing his social media platforms will no longer "fact-check," a euphemism for banning non-conforming expression, the game is up. Joe Biden and others on the Left are horrified; they so want to control our discourse. A majority of the country looks forward to Donald Trump’s inauguration, an end to Joe Biden’s failed presidency and to a return to common sense. January 20 cannot come soon enough.

Title: Rebound Alert: US Bitcoin ETF Interest Picks Up Speed In 2025
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/rebound-alert-us-bitcoin-etf-interest-picks-up-speed-in-2025/

Demand for US Bitcoin ETFs has significantly increased as we enter 2025, signifying a notable reversal following a lackluster start to the year. Based on recent figures from Glassnode, net inflows for the week ending January 6 amounted to 17,567 BTC, equivalent to around $1.7 billion. This increase surpasses the weekly average inflows of 15,900 BTC documented in the final quarter of 2024 and indicates a resurgence of investor enthusiasm. Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have shown an erratic pattern. These inflows showed notable fluctuations in late 2024. In September, there was a significant decline as Bitcoin prices dropped below $64,000, leading to large withdrawals. Nevertheless, things began to change by October. Inflows increased dramatically; in few weeks, they topped 24,000 BTC. With the average weekly inflow settling at around 15,900 BTC, the increase continued into November and December, demonstrating the high demand for Bitcoin investments. After a slow start to the year, demand for US spot #Bitcoin ETFs has normalized. In the week of January 6, inflows reached 17,567 #BTC ($1.7B), which is slightly higher than the weekly average of 15.9K $BTC ($1.35B) from October to December 2024: https://t.co/0Cpfm8lpak pic.twitter.com/u4FksOSLuZ — glassnode (@glassnode) January 13, 2025 As the price of Bitcoin increased, so did ETF inflows. In December 2024, the most popular digital asset in the world reached a record-breaking high of $108,135. This association suggests that as more people switched to exchange-traded funds, investors’ confidence in Bitcoin’s worth grew, leading to a positive market sentiment. The total holdings of US spot Bitcoin ETFs as of early January 2025 are approximately 1.13 million BTC. Grayscale has 204,300 BTC, Fidelity holds 205,488 BTC, and BlackRock has 559,673 BTC, making it the largest holding. In 2024, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) garnered attention by accumulating $37.25 billion in assets during its inaugural year, securing the third position on the Top 20 ETF Leaderboard for that year. This significant surge highlights the rising institutional demand for cryptocurrency-backed financial solutions. Bitcoin ETFs look like they will do well in 2025. Experts in the field think that this year there may be a lot of new, innovative offerings on the market. There will be at least 50 new bitcoin ETFs this year, according to Nate Geraci of the ETF Store. These will cover a wide range of strategies, such as covered call ETFs and Bitcoin-denominated equity ETFs. Furthermore, there is conjecture that Bitcoin spot ETFs may soon exceed physical gold ETFs in asset size. This would represent a pivotal advancement in the development of digital assets as conventional investment instruments. Such a change would highlight a rising confidence in Bitcoin as a valid store of value and investment tool, therefore challenging the long-held view of gold as the best hedge. As financial institutions such as Vanguard investigate cryptocurrency ETF alternatives, it underscores a wider trend of acceptance and incorporation of cryptocurrencies into established financial systems.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: BlackRock is trying to avoid the hot seat as GOP takes power

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The world’s biggest money manager is trying to avoid some political headaches as the GOP prepares to take over all of Washington. BlackRock Inc. (BLK) late last week pulled out of a UN-supported climate group known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), following the exodus of several Wall Street banks from an affiliated group in the weeks before Donald Trump takes over the White House again. BlackRock also was granted more time to resolve a standoff with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over its holdings of US banks, ensuring that the dispute will now play out in the opening months of Trump 2.0. The $11 trillion financial giant has for years been a target of GOP attacks about "woke" investing, with Republicans raising concerns about whether BlackRock’s massive holdings in US corporations force companies to adopt environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has backed away from using the politically contentious acronym. And Democrats have for years also been leery about whether the heft of BlackRock could pose risks to the financial system. BlackRock, which reports its fourth quarter earnings Wednesday, will have to navigate all these political challenges as the GOP takes over the White House and Congress — a measure of control that could create new headaches for the money management giant. A report last month from the House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, mentioned BlackRock along with Vanguard and State Street (STT) in arguing that it found "evidence of collusion and anticompetitive behavior" by the financial industry to "impose radical ESG-goals" on US companies. The report also criticized financial environmental alliances, saying they have created what it called "a climate cartel." Last Thursday, BlackRock confirmed its departure from one financial environmental alliance known as the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM). The group had a pledge of support from its NZAM members to help achieve net-zero emissions carbon emissions by 2050 by using their influence within the financial sector — such as supporting climate initiatives in corporate boardrooms through proxy voting. "Our memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials," BlackRock told clients in a letter cited by Bloomberg. The company added in the letter that its portfolio managers "continue to assess material climate-related risks." On Monday, the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative said on its website that it had suspended its activities pending a review. It added in that note that "recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context." The other delicate political situation now being juggled by BlackRock is its resistance to the FDIC’s push for greater oversight. The FDIC had been asking BlackRock to sign by Jan. 10 a "passivity agreement" that would codify greater checks on the money manager’s holdings of FDIC-supervised lenders, pushing back a deadline that was previously Dec. 31 of this year. The agreement the FDIC wanted BlackRock to sign was similar to one announced with Vanguard that imposed new compliance requirements when the manager amasses more than 10% of all outstanding stock in an FDIC-supervised bank. It was designed to assure bank regulators that the giant money manager will remain a "passive" owner of an FDIC-supervised bank and won’t exert control over a bank’s board. Currently, BlackRock only has such an agreement with the Federal Reserve. BlackRock spent much of 2024 denying that it exerted undue control over companies through its investment stewardship activities. Last Friday, BlackRock's deadline to respond to information requests from the FDIC was extended to Feb. 10, punting the standoff into the start of Trump's new term as president. As a practical matter, BlackRock must either rebut any presumption it has control of more than 10% in a holding company of an FDIC-supervised bank by responding to the FDIC's most recent information requests or sign a "passivity agreement," according to one person familiar with the matter. It is not yet known how the Trump administration may decide to handle the BlackRock situation or who will run the FDIC following the Republican takeover of the White House.

Title: Elon Musk says a third patient got a Neuralink brain implant. The work is part of a booming field

Time Published: 2025-01-14T08:32:00Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, 14 Jan 2025 Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. — AP Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. “We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient – who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer – was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3D objects. The first patient, also paralysed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal Of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who’s working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a US database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach”, he said. “It’s a little early to know.” Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. “We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavours. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,” he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from US regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Dr Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analysing data. She said this regulatory process prioritises safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organisation forming the board. The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll,” said Dr Redberg. – AP Related stories: Could Neuralink's brain implant be used to control a robotic arm?Neuralink says second brain device implant ‘went well’Elon Musk’s Neuralink eyes more test subjects for its brain techDespite setback, Neuralink’s first brain-implant patient stays upbeatNeuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Neuralink says second brain device implant ‘went well’Elon Musk’s Neuralink eyes more test subjects for its brain techDespite setback, Neuralink’s first brain-implant patient stays upbeatNeuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Elon Musk’s Neuralink eyes more test subjects for its brain techDespite setback, Neuralink’s first brain-implant patient stays upbeatNeuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Despite setback, Neuralink’s first brain-implant patient stays upbeatNeuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Neuralink says implant had issues after first human surgeryElon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Elon Musk says the first human has received an implant from Neuralink, but other details are scant Topic: Report it to us.

Title: Reuters Exclusive: Investor Climate Group Suspends Activities After BlackRock Exit

A flagship coalition aimed at aligning the asset management industry with global climate goals said it was suspending its activities on Monday, days after BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, left amid a political backlash in the United States. The pause raised concerns that companies will lower their efforts on climate change even after the hottest year on record, but could buy organizers time to review what actions might still be acceptable for U.S. fund firms. BlackRock, which manages some $11.5 trillion in assets, left the Net-Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative on Jan. 9 citing confusion over its climate efforts and legal inquiries from public officials. The step followed months of escalating pressure from some Republican politicians over its stance on investing in fossil fuel companies, with concern that such pressure could rise further as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. The group counted more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion in assets as members, according to its website as of last week, before the departure of BlackRock. In a letter to its members first reported by Reuters, the partner groups which help manage the NZAM said they had decided to conduct a review of its activities. “Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context. “As the initiative undergoes this review, it is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting. NZAM will also remove the commitment statement and list of NZAM signatories from its website, as well as their targets and related case studies, pending the outcome of the review.” CONTAGION EFFECT NZAM was set up in 2020 as executives and investors grew enthusiastic about solving climate change, sentiments that have faded. Still, changes by the NZAM initiative could prevent the sort of flight by asset managers that diminished the influence of another investor climate group, the Climate Action 100+, last year. At the time, big fund firms cited independence concerns, not politics, as a reason for their dropping out. Since then pressure from U.S. Republican officials has increased on executives to back away from reflecting environmental, social and governance (ESG) assessments in their investment decisions. These include an inquiry from the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee and a lawsuit by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states that claimed that fund activism had cut coal production and boosted energy prices. For its part, the NZAM initiative has asked members to support the goal, agreed by countries, of capping global warming and aiming to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Kathy Mulvey, a campaign director for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a Massachusetts-based advocacy organization, said groups including NZAM “have been an important avenue to keep us on track” toward meeting emissions-reduction targets. Whatever the results of NZAM’s review, she said, “clearly the financial sector’s actions to advance emissions reductions and the clean energy transition aren’t going away.” Among other members of NZAM, a representative for JPMorgan’s asset management arm JPMorgan declined to comment on Monday’s move. In a statement sent by a representative, State Street’s asset management arm said it “supports the announced NZAM review and will carefully evaluate its findings upon completion.” (Reporting by Simon Jessop in London and by Ross Kerber in Boston.

The iShares Bitcoin ETF (iShares Fund) has begun trading under the IBIT ticker in Canadian dollars and IBIT.U in U.S. dollars, targeting investors seeking Bitcoin exposure without the usual complexities of direct crypto ownership. Such an investment product "helps remove the operational and custody complexities," Helen Hayes, Head of iShares Canada for BlackRock, said in a statement on Monday. Notably, the iShares Fund invests "all or substantially all of its assets" in the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in the U.S. The fund allows investors to hold Bitcoin exposure in tax-advantaged accounts through traditional brokerage platforms in a bid to address certain concerns investors have, including custody and exchange account requirements. BlackRock's entry brings institutional credibility to Canada's crypto market, with the fund joining seven other iShares listings on Cboe Canada. The exchange facilitates 15% of Canada-listed securities trading volume, per the statement. Younger investors, consistent growth Continued investment in crypto ETFs such as IBIT reflects broader demographic shifts, with younger investors showing more appetite for digital assets as concerns about inflation grow, BlackRock notes in a prospective report on how ETFs are changing Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin has emerged as a significant digital asset class in recent years, with potential appeal as a global monetary alternative during periods of institutional uncertainty. Crypto adoption more broadly is outpacing historical technology trends, reaching 300 million users faster than both the internet and mobile phones, industry data tracked by BlackRock shows. For comparison, BlackRock's research indicates that crypto only took 12 years to be widely adopted, compared to the internet's 15 years and 21 years for mobile phones. In the U.S., BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) has amassed $52.7 billion in assets under management, with net inflows reaching peaks of $1.2 billion during its strongest periods, data from CoinGlass shows. Total Bitcoin spot ETF inflows for the fund show consistent growth through late 2024 despite periodic outflows, reflecting a strong institutional appetite for regulated crypto exposure. Even still, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded significant outflows on Monday, with market leaders GBTC, FBTC, and ARKB collectively shedding over $295 million in a single day, contributing to a total market outflow of $313.6 million across the sector. On the same day, Bitcoin briefly traded below $90,000 before reclaiming the $95,000 level at press time, data from CoinGecko shows.

Title: Elon Musk says a third patient got a Neuralink brain implant. The work is part of a booming field

Time Published: 2025-01-14T05:41:01Z

Laura Ungar Associated Press Published: January 13, 2025 at 2:08 PM Laura Ungar Associated Press Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. “We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Recommended Videos Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who's working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know." Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. “We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be," he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board. The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll," said Redberg. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Title: Here’s Why Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB) Is Among Monday’s Top Losers

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Drop on Bearish Statements, Disappointing Earnings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies—mostly under the quantum computing sector—kicked off the trading week leading declines amid not-so-optimistic statements from chief executives and disappointing earnings updates that have weighed in on investor sentiment. Meanwhile, Wall Street's main indices ended mixed, with the Dow Jones and S&P’s main index the only gainers, up 0.86 percent and 0.16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.38 percent. To come up with Monday’s top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A launch pad atop a grassy hill, smoke filled sky from a successful voyage to space. Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB) tumbled by 11.15 percent on Monday, a fourth consecutive day, to finish at $23.91 each following a statement that appears to be a jab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), unveiling its own plan to return rock and dust samples that the latter has been collecting from Mars’ Jezero Crater since 2021. Earlier this week, NASA said that it needed more time to determine the path forward for its Mars Sample Return program, punting a decision until mid-2026. But Rocket Lab believes the best solution is right under the agency’s nose. “We can wait another year, or we can get started now,” the company wrote in a post on X. “This is not our first encounter with the Red Planet. The orbiters, rovers, landers, and helicopters of Mars all bear Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB)’s fingerprints. We can deliver MSR mission success too.” Overall RKLB ranks 6th on our list of Monday's top losers. While we acknowledge the potential of RKLB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RKLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: BTC vs ETH ETFs: Why investors are favoring Bitcoin right now

BTC and ETH ETFs reveal contrasting trends this week, with Bitcoin spot ETFs leading inflows and Ethereum ETFs facing a net outflow. Investor interest in crypto-focused ETFs has taken center stage as Bitcoin[BTC] and Ethereum[ETH] show contrasting trends in fund flows. While Bitcoin spot ETFs enjoy significant inflows, Ethereum ETFs grapple with notable outflows. This divergence reveals shifting investor sentiment and raises critical questions about the factors driving these dynamics. Bitcoin spot ETFs saw remarkable inflows of $307 million last week on the 6th of January, reflecting heightened investor confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF emerged as the standout performer, pulling in $498 million. This strong performance highlights the growing appeal of Bitcoin as a reliable store of value, particularly as macroeconomic uncertainties persist. However, not all Bitcoin ETFs shared this positive momentum. The Ark & 21 Shares ARKB ETF experienced a net outflow of $202 million, indicating that while institutional inflows drive the overall trend, some funds face challenges in retaining capital. Analysis of the chart illustrates the consistent rise in Bitcoin ETF inflows, showcasing BlackRock’s pivotal role in steering the market. Source: Sosovalue In sharp contrast to Bitcoin’s success, Ethereum ETFs recorded a net outflow of $186 million over the same period. This marks a continuation of Ethereum’s recent struggles to attract investor interest. Despite this, BlackRock’s ETHA ETF managed to buck the trend, achieving a modest net inflow of $124 million. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FETH ETF faced substantial outflows, totaling $276 million, further underscoring Ethereum’s challenges. ETH ETF flow chart analysis highlights this disparity, with inflows waning since late 2024. Concerns around staking risks, Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi, and competitive pressures from other layer-1 networks could be contributing to this decline in sentiment. The data paints a picture of investors reassessing Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Source: Sosovalue The divergence in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows offers valuable insights into investor psychology and market dynamics. Bitcoin’s ability to consistently attract capital signals its growing reputation as a safe-haven asset. Institutional confidence, spearheaded by major players like BlackRock, reinforces this narrative. On the other hand, Ethereum’s performance raises questions about its future. Although it remains the second-largest crypto asset, it has struggled to keep up with BTC, and there is growing competition. As Bitcoin solidifies its position, Ethereum faces mounting pressure to address these concerns and regain its footing. These BTC and ETH ETF trends are not just numbers; they reflect broader market shifts. Bitcoin’s strong inflows highlight its potential to serve as a hedge against volatility, capturing both institutional and retail attention. For Ethereum, the outflows suggest a need for clearer narratives to build confidence as a viable alternative asset class. BlackRock’s dominance in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF markets underscores the growing influence of traditional financial institutions in the crypto space. This trend signals a maturing market but also raises questions about the decentralization ethos that has long defined cryptocurrencies. – Read Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025-26 The latest ETF data highlights a tale of two cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s strong inflows reaffirm its position as the dominant force in the market, while Ethereum’s struggles emphasize the challenges it faces in maintaining investor confidence. As crypto evolves, ETF flows will remain a critical barometer of sentiment and a guide to understanding the shifting landscape.

Title: Bitcoin adoption is outpacing the internet and mobile phones – BlackRock

BlackRock also advocated Bitcoin exposure through its spot ETF, IBIT, as it deems direct exposure complex for many. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s (BTC) adoption is outpacing the transformative technologies of the past, including the internet and mobile phones, according to a recent report by BlackRock. The document highlighted that since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin has quickly evolved from a niche innovation to a globally recognized asset. It attributed the evolution to demographic trends, economic shifts, and the ongoing digital transformation of finance. Younger generations, often referred to as “digital natives,” are significantly more inclined to embrace Bitcoin compared to Gen X and Baby Boomers. Their comfort with technology and preference for digital-first solutions have positioned them as the leading demographic in crypto adoption. Regarding economic shifts, trends such as rising inflation, geopolitical tensions, and concerns over traditional banking systems have highlighted Bitcoin’s value as a decentralized asset. It added that, in uncertain times, Bitcoin’s independence from central authorities has resonated with investors worldwide. The third driver is the maturation of digital asset infrastructure, which has lowered Bitcoin’s barriers to entry while creating new use cases. As the global economy digitizes, BTC is becoming integral to the evolving financial landscape. The document also advocates using BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, to gain exposure to BTC. The asset manager argued that while Bitcoin’s adoption grows, direct investment in BTC remains complex for many. IBIT is the largest spot Bitcoin ETF, with nearly $38 billion in inflows, based on Farside Investors’ data. It holds over $50 billion in assets under management and was the largest ETF launched in 2024. Notably, BlackRock launched a new Bitcoin ETF in Cboe Canada on Jan. 13, which will be denominated in Canadian dollars and trade under the same IBIT ticker. Meanwhile, the US dollar-denominated units will trade under the symbol IBIT.U. The ETF Store CEO Nate Geraci praised BlackRock’s efforts to drive Bitcoin adoption via ETFs. He also criticized Vanguard, the second-largest asset manager by assets under management, which has taken a completely opposite approach to Bitcoin. Meanwhile, independent analyst Sam Callahan highlighted that Paragon Advisors disclosed a $21.7 million allocation to IBIT in their 13F Form for last year’s fourth quarter. Paragon has $292 million in assets under management, with IBIT comprising nearly 7.5% of its portfolio, the largest allocation.

The Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) coalition — a United Nations–sponsored collection of financial services companies that have pledged to negate their portfolio’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner — suspended activities after investment firm BlackRock announced its departure from the group, according to a press release. BlackRock, which manages over $10 trillion and has been a leader in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, announced its exit from NZAM Thursday, with its vice-chair Philipp Hildebrand saying the firm’s involvement in the environmental coalition “caused confusion regarding BlackRock’s practices and subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials.” Now, NZAM has pressed pause altogether, halting operations while it conducts a review of its activities, an NZAM press release published Monday stated. (RELATED: UN Reportedly Moves To Unlock Tens Of Millions In Climate Funding For Country Run By Terrorists) JUST IN: The UN-backed Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) group has announced that it will be shutting down completely, following @BlackRock‘s departure. pic.twitter.com/o5htgvFEiH — Will Hild (@WillHild) January 13, 2025 A slew of other financial services had left NZAM prior to BlackRock’s Thursday exit, including Goldman Sachs Group, Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. BlackRock’s exit came amid a broader corporate strategy shift away from environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, with the firm only supporting about 4% of the 493 environmental and social investment proposals shareholders put forward between the end of June 2023 and the end of June 2024, down from a rate of 47% in 2021. BlackRock was a major supporter of ESG investing in years prior, with CEO Larry Fink claiming in 2020 that “climate risk is investment risk” and that climate change would lead to a “fundamental reallocation of capital.” “The destruction of NZAM is a huge win for consumers,” Will Hild, executive director of conservative nonprofit Consumers’ Research, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Although there is a lot of work left to be done, what was effectively a cartel of asset managers has finally ceased taking the focus of businesses off of consumers, raising prices for everyday Americans everywhere from the gas pump to the grocery store.” When reached for comment, NZAM referred the Daily Caller News Foundation to its press release.

Title: Net Zero asset managers suspend operations in wake of BlackRock’s departure

A global coalition of asset managers set up to meet net-zero goals has suspended its operations after the departure of its largest member, BlackRock Inc., in the latest retreat from concerted climate action in the finance sector. The Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, or NZAMI, said on Monday it launched a review to determine whether the group “remains fit for purpose in the new global context.” That context is marked by pushback against corporate environmental, social and governance programs that has intensified with the political shift to the right, especially in the United States, along with antitrust concerns. The group, which has more than 325 signatories with a total of US$57.5-trillion of assets under management, will halt its activities while it tracks climate-related implementation and reporting among its remaining members. It also removed its commitment statement and list of signatories from its website, it said in an unsigned statement. Last week, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said it was leaving the NZAMI because its membership created confusion about its business practices and prompted “legal inquiries” from public officials. It said the move did not change the way it managed funds, and that its portfolio managers still assess climate risks. The NZAMI said it was disappointed by the move but that it respected the decisions its signatories make. NZAMI’s suspension follows a mass exodus of U.S. banks from its sister organization, the Net Zero Banking Alliance, or NZBA, raising questions about its future. Last week, JP Morgan Chase & Co. quit that organization, after the exits of Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. since the beginning of December. Each said its decision to leave the group did not mean it was abandoning its net-zero goals or efforts to help clients meet their emission-reduction targets. Canada’s Big Six banks remain members of the alliance, but the CEOs of Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal said at a conference last week that the NZBA may not be the most effective tool to encourage climate change efforts at major financial institutions. Companies still need to manage climate risks and prepare for a lower-carbon economy, but worldwide organizations may not be the best way to accomplish that given differing situations in various jurisdictions, said Baltej Sidhu, an analyst at National Bank Financial. “A large portion of this is going to be actuated toward litigation concerns, and also the politicization of the theme of ESG in the U.S.,” Mr. Sidhu said. BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink had been at the forefront of integrating climate risks and decarbonization targets into its investing activities, but in recent years has backed off prioritizing the fight against climate change in his public messaging. In November, Texas Attorney-General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock, State Street Corp. and Vanguard Group, accusing the major institutional investors of constricting the fossil fuel industry through “anticompetitive trade practices” by buying up shares and pushing green-energy goals. The fund managers have called the charges baseless. Vanguard quit NZAMI two years ago. The sector-specific alliances exist under an umbrella called Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which was unveiled with fanfare at the United Nations climate summit in 2021 as excitement over the potential for the might of the finance industry being directed at climate action crescendoed. Former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor – and potential federal Liberal leadership hopeful – Mark Carney, and Michael Bloomberg, the founder of Bloomberg L.P. and a former mayor of New York, are co-chairs.

Title: Chile Sidesteps Renewables Profit Grab in Advancing Subsidy Bill

(Bloomberg) -- Chile’s lower house approved a bill to expand electricity subsidies for lower-income families after stripping out a measure that would have raised part of the funds required by curbing profits in a segment of the renewable energy industry. The measure, which sought to alter a pricing mechanism for small electricity generators known as pequeños medios de generación distribuida, or PMGDs, was rejected Monday by a vote of 60 against versus 59 in favor. The remainder of the bill was approved 97 to 25. To be sure, the government can still restore the measure when the legislation moves up to the Senate. President Gabriel Boric’s government expects to collect $200 million per year through the measure in a bid to help lower-income households cope with rising electricity prices. Power tariffs, which had been held down since a wave of social unrest in 2019, have now begun increasing gradually. “This bill allows for immediate aid with measures that have an effect,” Energy Minister Diego Pardow said during the debate in congress. “There will be no significant changes in the way the industry works.” The controversial legislation has riled PMGD investors, who argue it contravenes Chilean law by weakening incentives meant to diversify the energy sector that were supposed to last for another decade. While some say these small, mainly solar plants have saturated the market and increased costs for the overall system, the proposed change to the rules has put a chill on investment in a country known as business-friendly. Boric’s bill contains two other funding sources. One is an additional transitory tax on carbon emissions and the other takes advantage of extra revenue from a value-added tax due to higher electricity prices. The legislation still needs to be reviewed by the Senate, where opposition to garnishing the profits of small renewable generators is expected to be stiffer should it decide to push forward. Pardo told Bloomberg news in November that he would be willing to withdraw the PMGD measure to guarantee approval of the other two funding pillars, should it fail to win sufficient support. Were that to happen, the government pledged to review the rules for small electricity generators at a later date. The PMGD system, which offer generators stable prices and therefore protection from bottlenecks and cost distortions from transmission congestion and storage shortfalls, has attracted billions of dollars in investment from companies backed by BlackRock Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

By LAURA UNGARElon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines.“We’ve got … three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X.Related Articles Nation | Today in History: January 15, US Airways jet makes emergency landing in Hudson River Nation | Biden announces 2 new national monuments in California after wildfires scuttled previous event Nation | SEC sues Elon Musk, saying he didn’t disclose Twitter ownership on time before buying it Nation | Obesity won’t be solely defined by BMI under new plan for diagnosis by global experts Nation | Lawyers for Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs say sex acts are distorted by ‘sexist and puritanical’ prosecution Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year.Musk didn’t provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones.The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess.But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better.Who’s working on brain-computer interface technology?More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington.Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces.Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation.What are the benefits of BCIs?Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis.Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know.”Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink.“We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,” he said.How are BCIs tested and regulated?Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people.While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices.Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study.Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety.She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board.The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll,” said Redberg.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Title: Wall Street Climate Group Net Zero Suspends Activities Following BlackRock's Exit

Time Published: 2025-01-13T21:48:35Z
Full Content:
The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative—a coalition of investment behemoths turned self-proclaimed climate warriors—hit a wall this week after BlackRock’s dramatic exit forced it to suspend operations. The fallout comes as U.S. political pressure mounts against the green agenda championed by corporate giants. BlackRock, the globe’s largest asset manager with $11.5 trillion under management, walked away citing “confusion over the initiative’s climate efforts” and rising legal scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. Far from serving the public interest, the Net Zero initiative that once had the enthusiastic backing. of BlackRock and other ESG cheerleaders on Wall Street is increasingly seen as out-of-touch with America’s economic needs and the political climate that is rejecting so many of the trendy causes adopted in 2020. The alliance, which once boasted over 325 signatories controlling a staggering $57.5 trillion in assets, was launched in late 2020, amid the ESG craze, the Black Lives Matter movement, and pandemic lockdowns. Its lofty promise? To push the world’s financial powerhouses toward achieving net zero emissions by mid-century. But with the political winds shifting, that dream now appears to be on ice. A letter to members—thinly veiled and light on specifics—blamed “recent developments in the U.S.” for the sudden halt in activities. Though it didn’t name names, the timing speaks volumes. With Donald Trump preparing to take office and vowing to dismantle what he calls the “green tyranny” imposed by global elites, it’s no surprise that Net Zero’s future is in doubt. “As the initiative undergoes this review, it is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting,” the letter noted, clearly signaling a retreat. For months, Republican officials have been ratcheting up the heat. In November, Texas led a coalition of 11 states in suing BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street for allegedly conspiring to choke off coal production by using their clout to push anti-competitive environmental policies. Critics accuse these firms of buying up large stakes in energy producers only to turn around and support initiatives that restrict fossil fuel development, driving up energy prices in the process. Net Zero’s policies haven’t exactly won friends abroad either. In Europe, where governments raced ahead with similar green goals, energy prices soared, and citizens bore the brunt of misguided climate experiments. Critics have branded Net Zero as nothing short of an “energy suicide pact” that puts ideological purity above economic common sense. The backlash hasn’t gone unnoticed on Capitol Hill. Just last month, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee lambasted what it described as a “cartel” of financial firms and environmental activists colluding to impose radical ESG goals on U.S. companies. The committee’s message was clear: Americans won’t stand for unelected elites forcing a climate agenda down their throats. Meanwhile, Trump is signaling that help is on the way for American energy producers. His administration is widely expected to slash environmental regulations and unleash domestic energy production by opening up more oil drilling and cutting red tape. The move could breathe new life into the fossil fuel sector, but it also further undermines the shaky foundations of climate initiatives like Net Zero. For BlackRock and its peers, the decision to exit the alliance underscores a growing realization: ESG investing, long hailed as the future of finance, is running headlong into a wall of political and economic reality. The question now is whether other firms will follow suit, leaving the once-powerful Net Zero alliance in the dust. Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: Elon Musk says third patient got Neuralink brain implant
URL: https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-says-third-patient-got-neuralink-brain-implant/7935447.html

Print Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. “We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who's working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know." Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. “We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be," he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board. The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll," said Redberg.

Title: Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative Pauses Activities Following BlackRock Exit
URL: https://www.ai-cio.com/news/net-zero-asset-managers-initiative-pauses-activities-following-blackrock-exit/
Time Published: 2025-01-13T21:26:03Z
Full Content:
The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which until last week touted 325 signatories with $57.5 trillion in assets under management that had made a commitment to achieving net-zero portfolios by 2050, will suspend its activities, the organization announced Monday. The move to suspend activities comes after BlackRock announced last week that it was leaving the initiative, following political attacks over its environment, social and governance stance, lawsuits, and divestments. Most major U.S. national banks, including JPMorganChase, have also left a similar initiative, the Net Zero Banking Alliance, in recent months. “Recent developments in the U.S. and different regulatory and client expectations in investors’ respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context,” the NZAM stated. Through its review process, NZAM signatories will be consulted while the initiative tracks signatory implementation and reporting. Pending the outcome of its review, the initiative has also removed from its web site the list of signatories and commitment statements, which also include signatories’ net-zero targets and case studies.

Sign up for CIO newsletters.  “As a voluntary initiative, NZAM has successfully supported investors globally as they have sought to navigate their own individual paths in the energy transition in line with their fiduciary duties and clients’ long-term financial objectives,” NZAM stated. Launched in December 2020, the NZAM initiative aimed to support the asset management industry’s commitment to the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner, in line with efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The initiative is managed by six founding partner groups: Asia Investor Group on Climate Change, CDP [Carbon Disclosure Project] Worldwide, Ceres, Investor Group on Climate Change, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change and the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of These 10 Firms Were Last Week’s Biggest Losers. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Edison International (NYSE:EIX) stands against other firms that were last week's biggest losers. Ten companies fell significantly last week, mirroring a broader market downturn, as investors sold off positions following disappointing news and data that weighed heavily on market sentiment. On Friday, the Dow Jones recorded its largest weekly drop, falling 1.07%, while the S&P’s main index and Nasdaq declined by 0.71% and 0.62%, respectively. To come up with this week’s top decliners, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A wide aerial view of an electric power transmission facility with lines, substations, and overhead wires. Power distribution giant Edison International (NYSE:EIX) dropped its share prices by 19.03 percent last week to $65 from the $80.28 recorded a week prior amid the ongoing Los Angeles wildfire that has resulted in dozens of deaths and billions worth of damages. It doesn’t help that the company is currently under public scrutiny due to a potential connection to the wildfire, after discovering a downed conductor at a tower near the area where the Hurst Fire broke out on Tuesday evening. Edison, however, said it was uncertain whether the damage occurred before or after the fire. At present, Edison said some areas may continue to be de-energized in the coming weeks for public safety and prevent any further wildfire conditions. Edison International (NYSE:EIX) is one of the largest electric utility holding companies in the U.S., focused on providing clean and reliable energy and energy services through its independent companies. Overall, EIX ranks 7th on our list of firms that were last week's biggest losers. While we acknowledge the potential of EIX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than EIX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Pluribus Unum ESG investments tend to underperform traditional funds by approximately 10 percent, the judge observed.A district court has ruled that American Airlines failed to prioritize the financial interests of its employees’ retirement funds by enabling fund managers to pursue environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments.The judgment came as part of a 2023 lawsuit filed against American Airlines and the company’s Employee Benefits Committee. The class action alleges that the defendants violated their duty of loyalty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which states that fiduciaries managing retirement investments must act in the best financial interest of the participants.The defendants are alleged to have mismanaged their employees’ retirement assets—401(k) plans—when they hired investment managers pursuing ESG policies to handle the funds, especially BlackRock.ESG looks at nonmonetary factors while making investment decisions. This includes a company’s carbon footprint and chemical emissions, how a business addresses LGBT interests and other political initiatives, and whether a company adopts such programs in its hiring practices.The plaintiffs said BlackRock pursued an agenda to convert their retirement plans’ core index portfolios into ESG funds and that BlackRock’s actions harmed retirement plan participants because such investments pursued socio-political outcomes rather than financial returns.On Jan. 10, Judge Reed O’Connor from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas agreed with the plaintiffs, saying “the facts compellingly demonstrated that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests.” (Excerpt) Read more at theepochtimes.com ...

The class action alleges that the defendants violated their duty of loyalty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which states that fiduciaries managing retirement investments must act in the best financial interest of the participants.The defendants are alleged to have mismanaged their employees’ retirement assets—401(k) plans—when they hired investment managers pursuing ESG policies to handle the funds, especially BlackRock.ESG looks at nonmonetary factors while making investment decisions. This includes a company’s carbon footprint and chemical emissions, how a business addresses LGBT interests and other political initiatives, and whether a company adopts such programs in its hiring practices.The plaintiffs said BlackRock pursued an agenda to convert their retirement plans’ core index portfolios into ESG funds and that BlackRock’s actions harmed retirement plan participants because such investments pursued socio-political outcomes rather than financial returns.On Jan. 10, Judge Reed O’Connor from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas agreed with the plaintiffs, saying “the facts compellingly demonstrated that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests.” (Excerpt) Read more at theepochtimes.com ...

The class action alleges that the defendants violated their duty of loyalty under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which states that fiduciaries managing retirement investments must act in the best financial interest of the participants.The defendants are alleged to have mismanaged their employees’ retirement assets—401(k) plans—when they hired investment managers pursuing ESG policies to handle the funds, especially BlackRock.ESG looks at nonmonetary factors while making investment decisions. This includes a company’s carbon footprint and chemical emissions, how a business addresses LGBT interests and other political initiatives, and whether a company adopts such programs in its hiring practices.The plaintiffs said BlackRock pursued an agenda to convert their retirement plans’ core index portfolios into ESG funds and that BlackRock’s actions harmed retirement plan participants because such investments pursued socio-political outcomes rather than financial returns.On Jan. 10, Judge Reed O’Connor from the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas agreed with the plaintiffs, saying “the facts compellingly demonstrated that Defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to loyally act solely in the retirement plan’s best financial interests.” (Excerpt) Read more at theepochtimes.com ...

The IRFU’s attempts to further develop frontrow forwards have led them to appoint Seamus Toomey as performance pathway scrum coach. In his time as forwards coach at Blackrock College, Toomey has helped develop players including Ireland internationals Oli Jager, Jeremy Loughman, Thomas Clarkson and Gus McCarthy. Toomey will work alongside national scrum coach John Fogarty and provincial coaching staff to implement the National Scrum Programme, according to an IRFU statement, in “identifying and developing a new generation of front row forwards across the system.” The Limerick man has also worked as a scrum coach with Old Belvedere and is currently part of Neil Doak’s Ireland under-20s coaching ticket. Peter Smyth, IRFU head of elite player development, said: “We’re delighted to confirm the appointment of Seamus to this new and important position within our Performance Pathway. Seamus has accumulated a vast amount of experience and expertise working with young frontrow players across our schools and club game over the course of 20 years, and he will continue to be an invaluable asset to Irish Rugby within this new role moving forward. “Identifying and developing frontrow forwards is a major focus for us and we hope Seamus’ commitment, dedication and proven success in doing so, as he works alongside John Fogarty, our Performance Pathway staff and the Provincial coaches, will drive this forward.” Toomey added: “I am delighted to join the IRFU in this new role at such an exciting time for Irish Rugby. I have worked extensively within different areas of our game over a number of years, but to now have the platform to work at a National Level and use my experience to align our National Scrum Programme across the age-grade programmes and facilitate the continued development of world-class front row players to represent Ireland is a hugely exciting opportunity.” Gerry Thornley is Rugby Correspondent of The Irish Times Sign up to the Irish Times weekly rugby digest for the view from the press box with Gerry Thornley © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elon Musk says a third patient got a Neuralink brain implant. The work is part of a booming field

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. “We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,” he said during a wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who's working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people “using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches” that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology “very exciting” with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, “we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,” he said. “It’s a little early to know." Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. “We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be," he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an “investigational device exemption” from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board. The role of such boards “is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll," said Redberg. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

Title: Climate group Net Zero Asset Managers suspends activities days after BlackRock quits
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/01/13/business/climate-group-suspends-activities-days-after-blackrock-quits/
Time Published: 2025-01-13T19:40:22Z

An alliance of investment giants-turned-self-styled climate change crusaders looks to be in tatters after it suspended its activities on Monday amid a backlash against “woke” capitalism. The Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative was rocked last week by the exit of BlackRock, the world’s biggest investor, as The Post exclusively reported. Larry Fink’s firm, which manages some $11.5 trillion in assets, cited confusion over Net Zero’s climate efforts and legal inquiries from public officials in making its decision. The step followed months of escalating pressure from some Republican politicians over the coalition’s stance on investing in fossil fuel companies, with concern that such pressure could rise further as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office. The group counted more than 325 signatories managing more than $57.5 trillion in assets as members, according to its website as of last week, before the departure of BlackRock. In a letter to its members, the alliance made a thinly-veiled accusation that Trump’s November election victory had left it with no choice. It blamed “recent developments in the US” for the decision to review its future. “As the initiative undergoes this review, it is suspending activities to track signatory implementation and reporting,” the letter, seen by The Post, reads. The Net Zero Asset Managers initiative was launched in December 2020 and claimed it would deliver “the ambitious action and investment strategies that will be necessary to achieve the goal of net zero emissions.” Countries or companies can try and reach so-called net zero by slashing or offsetting carbon omissions. It is a long-standing UN goal to hit the target by 2050. The policy has been blamed for higher prices in major European economies such as the United Kingdom, which is now more reliant on energy imports to meet its needs. Critics, however, have slammed Net Zero as an “energy suicide pact.” In November, Texas led a lawsuit of 11 Republican states against BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. The states accused the money managers of “conspiring to artificially constrict” the coal market with anti-competitive practices. They alleged the firms built up huge stakes in coal producers and then supported environmental initiatives that lessened coal production to send prices skyward. Last month, the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee claimed “a cartel” of financial firms and climate activists were colluding to “impose radical ESG-goals” on US companies. GOP campaigns against environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals, which include diversity and inclusion policies, gained steam last year in a backlash against the Biden-Harris administration. It is widely expected that Trump will embark upon a mass deregulation of the energy sector, vowing to tap more of America’s oil reserves, and slash environmental red tape once he assumes office next Monday.

Title: Treasury’s Adeyemo Heads to Columbia With Energy-Sanctions Focus

(Bloomberg) -- Wally Adeyemo, the number-two official at the Treasury Department, will leave the Biden administration for a role at Columbia University focusing on economic statecraft and energy policy, according to a person familiar with the matter. Adeyemo, 43, was one of the architects of the sweeping sanctions the US imposed on Russia after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. As Janet Yellen’s deputy, he also worked on domestic policy issues, including the administration’s major stimulus packages, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. He will have fellowships at Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs and the Center on Global Energy Policy, where is expected to focus on the use of economic tools in national security and issues related to energy security. In the early months of the administration of Joe Biden, Adeyemo presented a policy review that called for an overhaul of the use of sanctions and seemed to presage a reduction in their use as a policy tool. But in the years that followed, the US ramped up its use of the restrictions, slapping a wide range of limits on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine and using them in the Middle East after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel. The Biden administration issued more than 8,000 sanctions in four years, twice as many as President Donald Trump did in his first term or President Barack Obama did across his two terms in office, according to a Jan. 8 report from Castellum.ai. US Treasury Hires Economists to Study Consequences of Sanctions Adeyemo, who was born in Nigeria, held positions in both the Obama and Biden administrations. Between those, he was the first president of the Obama Foundation and senior adviser at BlackRock Inc. and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Title: American Airlines Mismanaged Employees’ Retirement Funds by Investing in ESG, Court Rules
URL: https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/american-airlines-mismanaged-employees-retirement-funds-by-investing-in-esg-court-rules-5790994
Time Published: 2025-01-13T18:59:58Z
Full Content:
A district court has ruled that American Airlines failed to prioritize the financial interests of its employees’ retirement funds by enabling fund managers to pursue environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments. The defendants are alleged to have mismanaged their employees’ retirement assets—401(k) plans—when they hired investment managers pursuing ESG policies to handle the funds, especially BlackRock. ESG looks at nonmonetary factors while making investment decisions. This includes a company’s carbon footprint and chemical emissions, how a business addresses LGBT interests and other political initiatives, and whether a company adopts such programs in its hiring practices. The plaintiffs said BlackRock pursued an agenda to convert their retirement plans’ core index portfolios into ESG funds and that BlackRock’s actions harmed retirement plan participants because such investments pursued socio-political outcomes rather than financial returns. The defendants allowed “their corporate interests, as well as BlackRock’s ESG interests, to influence management of the plan,” the court stated. BlackRock had managed roughly $11 billion worth of assets under American Airlines’ employee retirement plan by the end of 2022, according to the court document. The case was filed by Bryan P. Spence, an American Airlines pilot who is a participant in the company’s retirement plan. The judge said ESG investments often underperform traditional investments by roughly 10 percent. “For instance, when compared to the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000 indices in 2023, ESG funds dramatically underperformed non-ESG funds, with ESG-related funds returning about 8 percent compared to about 14 percent for both indices,” the court stated. “BlackRock managed billions of dollars in plan assets at the same time it owned 5 percent of American stock,” making it one of the largest shareholders in the company, it stated. BlackRock had also funded roughly $400 million of the airline’s corporate debt when the company was going through financial challenges, according to the court document. The court observed that BlackRock is known to have pursued ESG criteria as a policy and that the defendants enabled such a course of action because of the “outsized influence” BlackRock had on the company. “For example, as a large company who consumes copious amount of fossil fuels, American was potentially susceptible to a proxy fight of its own by failing to comply with BlackRock’s climate-related demands,” the court stated. The defendants endorsed the ESG goals of those tasked with overseeing employees’ retirement funds, had conflicts of interest with BlackRock, and also upheld a “corporate commitment” to ESG, the judge wrote, while finding that American Airlines had breached its obligatory duties to retirement plan participants. At the time, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis told The Epoch Times that Fink seemed to have “caught some heat from some folks.” “Maybe he’s needed to try to find some way to camouflage his messaging because there’s definitely been some criticism,” Patronis said. Prior to the October 2022 letter, BlackRock was downgraded by Swiss multinational investment bank UBS, with an analyst saying there was “environmental pressure to earnings and risk from the firm’s ESG positioning.” “Investment companies will not push their political agenda on Mississippians, especially through fraudulent and deceptive means,” Michael Watson, Mississippi’s secretary of state, said in a statement at the time. “All citizens should have the opportunity to make informed and educated decisions when investing their hard-earned money.” According to the spokesperson, being part of the pact led to confusion regarding the company’s practices, with public officials making legal inquiries into the business. Despite its exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, BlackRock continues to back what it calls sustainable investing.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/13/2025 10:35:54 AM PST by EBH The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation gave a fresh deadline of Feb. 10 to BlackRock to resolve an issue regarding oversight into the asset manager’s investments in FDIC-regulated banking organizations, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing three people with knowledge of the matter. The FDIC may open an investigation into BlackRock and demand more information from the company if it fails to make sufficient progress toward resolving the issues, the report said. The move by the FDIC follows a Jan. 10 deadline that BlackRock failed to meet, according to the report. snip BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street now collectively control some $26 trillion in assets. Since the financial crisis of 2009, investors have poured money into their low-cost index funds, catapulting the three firms into the ranks of the largest owners of most large U.S. corporations.

You have direct control of those votes. John Bogle, the modern father of index (passive) investing, was on record as saying no more than 25-30% of the market should be passive investing. We went over 50% in early 2024. Why is this important? If the voting control was via the vendor (i.e.-BlackRock, Vanguard, Invesco, etc.), then all the decisions are centralized by a few people who run those organizations. Too many people focus on saying these organizations CONTROL the investment companies, but they do not. Legally, the INVESTORS still own via their passive investment. But VOTING CONTROL is even more important, as so many entrepreneurs realized, like Zuckerburg, etc. If you wonder how DEI crap got so quickly into the major corporations, likely look no further than the VOTING control, not the ownership control. It needs to be made clear that the vendors DO NOT HAVE VOTING CONTROL, and proxy voting MUST be pushed to the investor, regardless of what that takes. As far as this battle is concerned, the way I read it is that BlackRock is negotiating for regulatory relief/a settlement to settle a pattern of voting that is questionable to the regulators (it could be possible they didn’t fully comply with Biden Admin requests in how they voted, hence having to deal). The attempt to stretch this out is to try to renegotiate with the incoming administration instead of now, in all likelihood. They know the current game is up, and now it is about reputation risk and staying away for being blamed for the DEI initiatives they backed when convenient but damning if continued. 7 posted on 01/13/2025 11:37:01 AM PST by LRoggy (Peter's Son's Business ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: EBH This is why cumbag Fink went to Mar A Lago. 8 posted on 01/13/2025 11:46:03 AM PST by AAABEST (That time Washington DC became a corrupted, existential threat to us all...)

Title: Here's why 2025 is shaping up to be the year of altcoins

Since bitcoin's price surged by more than 100% over the past 12 months, crypto is back in the headlines. Enthusiasts who had been waiting out the bear market are preparing for what they hope will be another round of 2021's crypto bull market. Here's why: The four-year bitcoin halving cycle, which cuts the rate of new-coin creation in half, is at the core of crypto's boom and busts. Following the event, demand outpaces tightened supply, driving prices up over the following year. As bitcoin holders reap profits from the rise, some of those gains trickle down into altcoins in a scenario resembling the tide that lifts all boats. So far, this cycle has been on repeat since bitcoin's inception in 2009. And unless something changes, investors anticipate a similar pattern will play out this year. With the latest halving in April, expectations for a 2025 rally are running high. Below is a chart that shows bitcoin's price moves over time overlaid with halving events. Matthew Le Merle, the CEO of Blockchain Coinvestors, says 14 years is enough data for crypto investors to trust a pattern. Historical context shows a cycle where bitcoin has three years of being the highest-performing asset and one of being the weakest. The slight caveat is that bitcoin tends to slow down in the third year of the uptrend, and altcoins (cryptos besides bitcoin) catch up or even outpace it in percentage gains, which could make 2025 the year of altcoins. The end of the latest crypto bull market caught many investors off guard following speculation that bitcoin could go to $100,000 and even $200,000 before entering a bear market. But those hopes were dashed after it touched only $70,000 before it plunged by about 74%. Altcoins followed shortly behind. The boom was also tainted by unprecedented investment scams and the bubble in nonfungible tokens. Bitcoin is now bouncing back, as it did in previous cycles. The table from Morningstar below shows bitcoin as the highest-performing asset globally on an annualized basis in three-year increments. Assets are listed by rows in order of performance, with the highest at the top and lowest at the bottom. In 2024, bitcoin ended the year up by about 124%, placing it as the top-performing asset for the second year in this cycle. In each of those cycles, altcoins trailed bitcoin in the first two years and rallied into steeper percentage gains in the third, according to data from Pantera Capital. The firm refers to the bitcoin-to-altcoin transitions as phases one and two, where the former is led by bitcoin price surges and the latter by altcoins. Once that has played out, the crypto market comes crashing down for the start of another bear market. "Why is that?" Le Merle said. "It's because once bitcoin has gone up three years in a row, a lot of bitcoiners have a lot of capital that they want to diversify, and they're willing to move some of their capital into the altcoins." However, some factors could hinder the two-phase transition. First, there's much more support for bitcoin because of an incoming crypto-friendly presidential administration, the addition of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, institutional money, and corporations and governments considering it in their treasuries, Le Merle said. All this could mean a stronger third year for bitcoin. The downside, he added, is the law of diminishing returns, which simply suggests that the bigger bitcoin gets, the harder it will be to compound steeper returns. The makeup of crypto's market participants has also shifted. "In blockchain and crypto, it used to be very much individuals and retail folks making personal decisions," Le Merle said. But as institutional and professional investors increasingly manage crypto, he expects the weight of the capital to shift toward top-tier crypto assets. This means larger-market-cap altcoins could be up for a big comeback. At the same time, the newer offshoots with fewer use cases could be traded among speculative retail. But that doesn't mean meme coins are falling away. Quite the contrary, traders will always be betting for a quick buck in every corner of the markets. WendyO, the pseudonym for the crypto-influencer host of "The O Show" whose YouTube channel has almost 230,000 subscribers, said this cycle is already looking much different from 2021's for a few notable reasons. First, decentralized-finance protocols and NFTs, with digital artwork such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection, were wildly popular in the last bull market. This year, not so much — instead, traders are eyeing meme coins, specifically those pegged to anything AI-related. The crazier and funnier a meme coin is, the higher it's going, said Adrian Zduńczyk, a chartered market technician already witnessing a surge in bizarre-themed coins. He expects the crypto bull market of 2021 to return with even stronger volume over the next six to seven months. Meme coins' popularity stems from their easier accessibility and community-like structure. WendyO noted that in this corner of the market, venture capitalists aren't getting in ahead of the gains or before the coin offerings. There also aren't as many founders making empty promises about use cases. So everyone knows what they're getting into, which is like a gamified gamble where you get in, make money, and then get out before it goes to zero, she said. Second, in 2021, ethereum's blockchain was highly active for altcoin creation. This time, solana's blockchain has become a popular launching pad for meme coins since it has cheaper transaction fees. In December, 1.2 million new tokens were launched on solana's chain, up from only 172 in January 2024, according to Dune. Below is a chart from CoinGecko demonstrating the number of new cryptocurrencies entering the market since 2021. As for the incoming Trump administration, WendyO believes it's too soon to be overly enthusiastic about a crypto-friendly Washington before the new policies are made clear. While she expects widespread support for digital assets, she's concerned institutional investment may be favored over retail or decentralized means of transacting. If that occurs, she believes it could bring the bull market to a premature halt. "We want to be able to transact 24/7, 365 days. We don't want to be accredited investors to participate in crypto. If we want to buy bitcoin, we don't want to be forced to go through BlackRock," WendyO said. "And that's a really big switch that we're seeing this cycle. Last cycle, we didn't have the bitcoin spot ETF, and we didn't have the ethereum spot ETFs."

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/13/2025 10:19:28 AM PST by CFW Blackrock Inc. is the latest to announce it has left a United Nations-backed Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), among several within one month and not soon after Donald Trump was elected president. It did so as it and roughly 60 companies are being investigated by Congress for allegedly colluding as a “woke ESG cartel” to “impose radical environmental, social, and governance goals on American companies.” Last month, Goldman Sachs was the first to withdraw from the alliance, followed by Wells Fargo, The Center Square reported. Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan next announced their departure. According to the "bank-led and UN-convened" alliance, global banks joined, pledging to align their lending, investment and capital markets activities with a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050. Major U.S. banks began leaving the alliance after President-elect Donald Trump vowed to increase domestic oil and natural gas production and pledged to go after “woke” companies. They also announced their departure two years after 19 state attorneys general launched an investigation into them for alleged deceptive trade practices connected to ESG. While the companies haven’t appeared to seem daunted by state investigations, Trump's reelection appears to be a different matter. (Excerpt) Read more at thecentersquare.com ...
