Title: Investors query Government cushion in €1.2bn AIB buyback

The terms of AIB’s upcoming €1.2 billion buyback of shares held by the Government – as it hastens an exit from the bank’s shareholder register – are raising questions from some other big shareholders, in light of the stock’s recent pullback, according to market sources. With good reason. AIB, led by chief executive Colin Hunt, announced earlier this week that the shares would be repurchased, subject to shareholder approval at the bank’s annual general meeting (agm) in a month’s time, at a minimum of €6.26. It would reduce taxpayers’ holding in the bank, which required a €20.8 billion bailout during the financial crisis, to about 3 per cent. The floor price was based on the stock’s volume-weighted average price – or VWAP, as it is known in the stock market – for the five business days to Tuesday of last week, less almost 37 cent to account for a planned dividend on AIB’s profit for 2024. If the average VWAP is higher than €6.26 in the five days before the shareholder meeting on May 1st, the buyback price can be adjusted upwards to that level. The problem for other shareholders – who, let’s not forget, are not being offered a chance to sell into the buyback, is that AIB’s shares have fallen over the past week or so to as low as €5.78. The shares had peaked at €7.26 early last month, the highest levels since the Government first sold shares in the bank in 2017, after the bank reported better-than-expected full year results. The subsequent pullback has come as some investors locked in profits (US investment giant BlackRock last week sold more than a 3 per cent stake on the market, reducing its holding to about 8.5 per cent), while others fretted about how US president Donald Trump’s trade war would affect the Irish economy. Concerns about the pace of new Irish house building and its effect on mortgage growth have also tempered enthusiasm towards Irish banks. Will a head of steam build up among institutional and small shareholders alike on the terms of the repurchase if AIB’s shares continue their retreat in advance of the agm? Or will they just suck it up for the sake of the bigger objective of seeing the Government off the pitch?

Title: Overview of Secular Markets

A young lady where I volunteer asked me when I started saving. I started saving as a child, but had no money saved until nearly thirty years later when I started down a “stable” career path after graduating with an engineering degree and an MBA. I described to her that Fidelity’s guideline is to have one year’s income saved by age 30 and 10 times your income by the time you retire. The next question was, “How do you protect your savings from severe corrections in retirement?” I explained that inflation is the silent risk of being too conservative and described target date funds as perhaps being ideal for someone starting out in savings when the daily challenges of home and work life weigh heavy on time requirements. Secular markets can play a major role in your success as an investor over your lifetime. Figure #1 shows the returns for the past thirty years for the S&P 500 (SPY), Vanguard Total Bond Market fund (VBMFX), Fidelity International Discover fund (FIGRX), and Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX). The obvious conclusion is that the S&P 500 has outperformed the other asset classes by a large margin, but it would be a poor assumption to assume that this holds true for the next ten or twenty years. Figure #1: Equity and Bond Markets with Valuations and 10-Year Treasury Yields Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. Three of the most important factors for future returns are starting valuations and yields, along with inflation. Ed Easterling is the founder of Crestmont Research and author of Unexpected Returns: Understanding Secular Stock and Probable Outcomes: Secular Stock Market Insights, which provide incredible insight into the relationship of these factors. For those interested in long-term trends for the stock market, I recommend reading Mr. Easterling’s The P/E Report: Annual Review Of The Price/Earnings Ratio. He concludes that the “stock market’s valuation remains too elevated for an extended period of above-average returns.” He describes that this may occur “either by a significant decline over a shorter period or by a minimal decline over a longer period.” NOTE: During the 1995 to 2012 period, real GDP averaged 2.6% annually. The population growth rate declined from 1.2% in 1995 to 0.73% in 2012. Population growth is a key driver of economic growth. Notice in Figure #1 above that the Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX) performed as well as the S&P 500 for the first twenty years. Why? For the first twenty years, the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) hovered around the long-term median outside of recessions of about 15 except for the 1997 to 2002 run-up in the Dotcom bubble, which reached 34. Secondly, an investor could make decent returns in bonds. The Vanguard Total Bond Market fund (VBMFX) had an average annualized return of about 6.5% from 1995 through 2022. The Fidelity Balanced fund (FBALX) did as well as the S&P 500 because stocks and bonds are inversely related, and when stocks decline, bonds typically go up. Also, notice that international stocks performed as well as the S&P 500 throughout most of this time period. A diversified portfolio would have performed well. NOTE: From 2013 to 2024, real GDP grew at an annualized rate of 2.5% annually. Population growth fell to 0.59% during this time period. The Great Financial Crisis of 2008/2009 changed the market environment with Quantitative Easing that the Federal Reserve began in 2008 and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) that Congress passed in 2009. They served their purpose to avert a major depression by providing stability and stimulus. However, continued easy monetary policy and more stimulus during the COVID recession have suppressed bond yields for most of the past fifteen years. The P/E ratio has risen to close to 30, which is near the expensive levels of the Dotcom years. Quantitative Tightening, a recovering economy, and Inflation have pushed bond yields back up to normal levels. The Federal deficit has risen from 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 to over 6% last year. This caused the Federal debt to rise from 65% of GDP to 122% now. This is unsustainable. The Federal Reserve released its March 19, 2025, FOMC Projections in which the median estimates of real GDP are 1.7% to 1.8% for 2025 through 2027 and 1.8% for the longer run. Inflation for Personal Consumption Expenditures is estimated to fall to 2.2% in 2026 and reach the baseline of 2.0% in 2027. The Federal Funds rate is estimated to fall gradually to 3.1 in 2027 and be 3.0% in the longer term. Of course, tariffs add uncertainty to forecasts. Davide Barbuscia reports in “Moody’s Says US Fiscal Strength On Course For Continued Decline” at Reuters that “the U.S.’ fiscal strength is on track for a continued multi-year decline as budget deficits widen and debt becomes less affordable.” Moody’s says that debt affordability is weaker than for other highly rated sovereigns. According to Moody’s, persistently high tariffs are likely to hinder growth. An inverted yield curve is when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates. It makes it harder for banks to lend money, which greases the wheels of industry. An inverted yield curve has been a reliable indicator of recessions. Figure #2 shows the inverted yield curve in September before the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates. The yield curve on Election Day suggested that investors thought the Federal Reserve might achieve a “soft landing” and avoid a recession. Parts of the current yield curve have inverted as investors are now concerned about tariffs increasing inflation and that the economy is slowing. Figure #2: Treasury Yield Curves – Past Six Months Source: Author using St Louis Federal Reserve FRED database Table #1 contains Lipper Bond Categories that I put in my long-term investment bucket strategy. Intermediate yields have been falling, so bonds with longer durations have returned 2% to 3% over the past three months. Yields are mostly over 4%, providing income for retirees. Table #1: Investment Bucket #3 – Bonds with Author’s Top-Rated Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st Table #2 shows what I call Tier One Lipper equity categories with low Price-to-Book (P/B) valuations, lower risk (Ulcer Index), and higher yields compared to the S&P 500 as of March 21st. The S&P 500 is down 4.2% for the past three months but has corrected about 10% from its February high. International equity funds have returned 8% to 13% over the past three months. The P/B is less than half of the S&P 500, and yields are two to three times that of the S&P 500. Buybacks for US companies have contributed to lower yields in the US because capital gains are generally taxed at lower rates than ordinary dividends. Rising international equity funds have reduced the impact of the S&P 500 falling in diversified portfolios. Table #2: Lipper Equity Categories with Low Valuations, Lower Risk, and High Yields Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st The Congressional Budget Office published Projections of Deficits and Debt Under Alternative Scenarios for the Budget and Interest Rates last month which analyzed the case where provisions of the 2017 tax act that changed the individual income tax are extended indefinitely, including lower statutory tax rates, the changes to allowable deductions, the larger child tax credit, the 20 percent deduction for certain business income, and the income levels at which the alternative minimum tax takes effect. They conclude that if the 2017 Tax Act is extended, “Primary deficits over the first decade of the projection period (fiscal years 2025 to 2034) are about $4 trillion larger. By 2054, the primary deficit equals 3.7 percent of GDP, 1.5 percentage points higher than in CBO’s extended baseline.” Inflation is a rise in prices for goods and services. Tariffs are a tax on importers, which undoubtedly will be passed on to consumers. Tariffs are a one-time increase in prices to a higher level. The impact is higher long-term prices until supply chains have time to at least partially adjust. Economists attribute the trade deficit to a high rate of domestic consumption and a low savings rate. High labor rates in the US compared to developing countries and mobility of technology have also contributed to the deficit. Increasing tariffs doesn’t address these factors. Mixed-Asset (MA) funds invest in multiple asset classes, including stocks and bonds, and may include international equities. I like them for younger investors who want a professional manager to select investments and rebalance. In retirement, I like having more control over withdrawal strategies and only having a small amount invested in MA funds. Table #3 contains a subset of the mixed-asset funds that I track. The return over the past three months shows how they are performing now, but I suspect it also provides a glimpse into the future. I expect funds with lower valuations, international exposure, higher allocations to bonds, and higher yields to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis. Table #3: Mixed Asset Funds with Author’s Top-Rated Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset; Morningstar for three-month return as of March 21st Figure #3 shows the three-year performance of selected funds. Below are shown some interesting possibilities. I will watch the markets for the next few months before making any decisions. At first glance, BlackRock Tactical Opportunities (PCBAX) and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return (EAGMX) appeal to me. Both are available at Fidelity without transaction fees and with the load waived. Figure #3: Selected Mixed-Asset Funds Source: Author using MFO Premium fund screener and Lipper global dataset. What has propelled the US stock markets higher over the past several years is easy monetary policy, Federal stimulus, and rising valuations. I believe that uncertainty is taking its toll on investors and consumers. A diversified portfolio with bonds and international equities should perform well in the coming decade because of favorable valuations internationally and normalized bond yields.

Jobs and investment in Scotland will be top of the agenda today [Thursday 3 April] when Scottish Secretary Ian Murray, Lord Mayor of London Alastair King and Scottish Financial Enterprise Chief Executive Sandy Begbie meet key sectors in a series of meetings in New York during Tartan Week. In a co-ordinated effort aimed at boosting growth in Scotland they will invite companies to attend the Scottish Investor Summit - organised by Scottish Financial Enterprise and The City of London Corporation - to be held in Edinburgh in October this year. The event will be key to encouraging inward investment in Scotland - investment which can boost Scotland’s economy, create well paid jobs and boost living standards, putting more money back in people’s pockets. The New York meetings will showcase Scotland’s key strengths in financial services, clean energy and life sciences to international investors. This will be held at the UK Consul General’s residence in New York and at the offices of BlackRock, a global investment management corporation with a significant presence in Scotland. Secretary of State for Scotland Ian Murray said: “At a time when we are celebrating Scotland on the international stage, we want to highlight the exceptional investment opportunities in innovative industries. These meetings and roundtables are at the heart of Brand Scotland, selling the nation on the global stage. By strengthening these international partnerships through our Plan for Change, we’re laying the groundwork for the Edinburgh Global Investment Summit.” Lord Mayor of London Alastair King said: “Tartan week is not just an opportunity to celebrate the strong cultural and economic links between Scotland and the US, it is also a chance to deepen them further especially in financial services. That is why I am in New York speaking to major US businesses and investors and promoting the forthcoming Scottish Investment Summit in Edinburgh in October “The theme of my mayoralty is ‘growth unleashed’, aiming to reignite the City’s appetite for positive risk and fully leverage the white heat of new technology to fuel economic growth across the United Kingdom. One of the best ways to do that is through greater cooperation with the US in financial services - which is a major part of both the Scottish and wider UK economy.” Chief Executive of Scottish Financial Enterprise Sandy Begbie CBE said: “Tartan week is an excellent example of the soft power which Scotland commands across the globe, but especially in the US. These roundtables provide just a small taste of the investment opportunity in Scotland. “The Scottish investment summit later this year will showcase in detail the very best of Scotland’s financial services, renewables and life science to global investors. This coupled with opportunities to engage with government stakeholders and investment prospects highlight the unique opportunity the summit will bring.” The Scottish investment summit, to be held in Edinburgh in October, will bring together major global investors, UK industry leaders, higher education institutions, and government representatives. Around 150 senior-level attendees are expected at the summit, with at least half representing significant global investors. The summit will showcase the investments that have already been made, as well as the rationale behind why firms made the decision to invest in Scotland and what have been the returns and benefits to them as a result. It will also provide opportunities for investors to engage with investment prospects that currently exist in our investment pipeline, as well as government and regulatory stakeholders.

Title: OnlyFans Founder Among Latest TikTok Bidders

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor As the deadline nears for TikTok‘s Chinese parent to cut a deal to divest controlling ownership of the app or face a U.S. ban, new bidders are coming out of the woodwork. Among the interested investors in TikTok is Tim Stokely, founder of OnlyFans — the opt-in social media platform known for hosting sexually explicit content. Stokely, who founded OnlyFans in 2016, left the company in 2021. Stokely’s new social media startup Zoop, which says it “rewards both creators and their community members for their engagement,” teamed with the Hbar Foundation, which manages the Hedera cryptocurrency network, on a joint bid for TikTok, per Reuters. Popular on Variety Related Stories VIP+ At GDC, Industry Voices Want AI to Stay Practical What's Coming to Disney+ in April 2025 In addition, Amazon submitted a last-minute offer to buy TikTok in an offer letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the New York Times reported. However, the newspaper reported, various parties “who have been involved in the talks do not appear to be taking Amazon’s bid seriously. Oracle and private-equity firm Blackrock also have reportedly been in talks about a deal to take an ownership stake in TikTok. Others that have come forward with bids include former L.A. Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, mobile-technology vendor AppLovin and AI company Perplexity. VIP+ Analysis: Meet the TikTok Rival That Gained Most From U.S. Ban – and It’s Not RedNote The value of the Zoop-led bid, which was made in conjunction with other unidentified partners, was not disclosed. Zoop co-founder RJ Phillips told Reuters, “Our bid for TikTok isn’t just about changing ownership, it’s about creating a new paradigm where both creators and their communities benefit directly from the value they generate.” President Trump was reported to be meeting with advisers Wednesday to consider next steps for TikTok. Trump set an April 5 deadline for ByteDance to either sell its controlling interest in TikTok or face a U.S. ban on national security grounds under a U.S. law that took effect Jan. 19. Supporters of the TikTok divest-or-ban law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, have said Trump’s 75-day enforcement delay did not have legal basis.

Title: Greenlane and Volvo’s bold plan to transform electric truck charging in the US

Greenlane is teaming up with Volvo Trucks North America to make charging heavy-duty electric vehicles (HDEVs) easier and more accessible. The charging network developer is now integrated into Volvo’s Open Charge service, which gives Volvo customers streamlined access to Greenlane’s public chargers. This collaboration makes Greenlane the first official Charge Point Operator (CPO) in North America to partner with Volvo. Greenlane is a joint venture between Daimler Truck North America, NextEra Energy, and BlackRock. It’s building a US-wide charging network for heavy-duty commercial vehicles, aiming to reduce costs and simplify switching to electric fleets. Through Volvo Open Charge, Volvo customers now have real-time access to Greenlane’s network, which means easier access to public charging, centralized billing, and special perks. Fleets won’t have to spend big money on their charging infrastructure. Instead, they can plug into Greenlane’s growing network, which will help cut costs and operational headaches while extending range. Patrick Macdonald-King, Greenlane’s CEO, called the partnership “a first-of-its-kind collaboration to deliver public charging solutions tailored to the needs of medium- and heavy-duty fleets.” He said it’s all about making the shift to electric trucks smoother and keeping goods and services moving while progressing toward zero-emissions freight. Greenlane’s flagship charging site is set to open in Colton, California, in April, with more than 40 publicly accessible chargers for everything from heavy-duty trucks to smaller electric vehicles. It’s part of a larger plan to build a network along the I-15 corridor, with stations roughly 60 to 90 miles apart. Future California locations are planned for Long Beach, Barstow, and Baker. Greenlane and Volvo will continue integrating new membership features into Volvo Open Charge, such as booking reservations. By letting fleets tap into an existing public network, Greenlane’s services can make the transition to electric trucking less about building infrastructure and more about just getting trucks on the road.

The metric, which tracks the rate of Ethereum removed from circulation, recently hit its lowest level since August 2021, a nagging concern among investors that’s “weighed on Ethereum’s market performance,” according to the crypto market maker Wintermute. Last week, around 53 ETH was burned per day, the firm said. Meanwhile, ETH’s supply has increased 3% since an upgrade called EIP-1559 took effect, according to Ultrasound Money. The lower burn rate underscores how ETH’s ability to accrue value has shifted since developers embraced layer-2 scaling solutions a year ago. Since then, Ethereum’s so-called issuance has been net positive, yet some experts believe institutional adoption trends could change that. During the first quarter, ETH’s price plummeted 45%, wiping away $170 billion in market value, according to crypto data providers CoinGecko and CoinGlass. That represented the third worst quarter for ETH going as far back as 2016. Years ago, user activity on Ethereum became a core driver of ETH’s value, when Ethereum developers implemented a fee-burning mechanism called EIP-1559 in August 2021. While Ethereum’s users previously paid transaction fees to miners, the network started burning them instead, reducing the asset’s circulating supply in relation to network activity. When Ethereum later transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus model in 2022, making miners obsolete and vastly reducing the network’s carbon footprint, the rate at which new ETH is issued was also reduced. Together, the upgrades made Ethereum’s circulating supply deflationary. EIP-4844, an upgrade that significantly reduced the amount of ETH burned by layer-2 networks, changed that dynamic. As user activity has gravitated toward those scaling solutions, transaction fees have fallen on Ethereum too, recently hitting a five-year low of $0.40. During the pandemic-era crypto boom, so-called gas wars plagued Ethereum users, who sometimes paid upwards of $4,000 for a single transaction. NFT projects were a common yet ultimately beneficial source of congestion, like those tied to Bored Ape Yacht Club. Tokenize Everything As Wall Street starts migrating on-chain, some analysts believe that ETH could become deflationary again, if institutions end up bringing trillions of dollars of assets with them. The process of taking real-world assets, such as stocks and bonds, and representing them on-chain as digital tokens is referred to as tokenization. In a letter to shareholders, Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, mentioned the term a dozen times. “One day, I expect tokenized funds will become as familiar to investors as ETFs,” Fink wrote. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized.” Excluding Ethereum’s layer-2 networks, $5 billion worth of real-world assets have been tokenized on Ethereum, accounting for 54% of the market, according to RWA.xyz. The measure excludes stablecoins, which are often backed by cash and U.S. Treasuries. That sum could broadly grow to $16 trillion by 2030, according to a paper published by Boston Consulting Group in October, but estimates from experts vary widely. “We're not seeing the economic benefits from tokenization yet,” Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. “This is going to take longer than people want it to because these large asset managers don't move very quickly.” Edited by James Rubin Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), the world’s largest securities settlement system, is pushing deeper into crypto with introducing a blockchain-based platform for tokenized collateral management. Collateral is a fundamental part of risk management in financial markets, ensuring stability amid market fluctuations. However, traditional systems often suffer from inefficiencies due to fragmented infrastructure and lagging settlements. DTCC said its new platform seeks to address these challenges by tokenizing collateral on blockchain rails, allowing for real-time transfers and automation through smart contracts, according to a Wednesday press release. The platform runs within DTCC’s AppChain ecosystem, which was developed on top of LF Decentralized Trust’s Besu blockchain. Read more: Why Asset Tokenization Is Inevitable "Collateral mobility is the ‘killer app’ for institutional use of blockchain," Dan Doney, chief technology officer of DTCC Digital Assets, said in a statement. "By using smart contracts to automate the full range of collateral operations, we enable complex trade execution across markets in real-time at any time, even in volatile conditions." "This platform is unique in that we’ve created something that’s more open, flexible, dynamic, and comprehensive than any previous digital collateral initiative," said Nadine Chakar, global head of DTCC Digital Assets. The initiative comes as tokenization of traditional financial instruments such as bonds, funds and other traditional investments has become one of the hottest use cases for blockchain technology. Multiple financial heavyweights like BlackRock, CME Group and Fidelity have thrown their hat in the ring pursuing benefits such as operational efficiencies, speedier settlements and increased transparency compared to using traditional financial plumbing. DTCC will showcase the platform’s capabilities at the "The Great Collateral Experiment" event on April 23, where industry participants will test how tokenized assets can be mobilized across markets. The company said it also plans to engage with regulators and industry leaders to establish global standards for tokenized collateral.

Title: China blocks its firms from investing in US ahead of trade war escalation

China is reportedly cracking down on domestic firms doing business in the United States as the world’s two largest economies gear up for an escalation in their trade war. Regulators in Beijing have been told in recent weeks to hold back on granting approvals for Chinese companies wishing to invest in the US, Bloomberg News reported. The move is intended to give China more leverage in upcoming negotiations with the Trump administration, according to the outlet. President Trump is scheduled to flesh out his plan to impose far-reaching tariffs during a news conference from the White House Rose Garden on Wednesday at 4 p.m. Chinese companies invested $6.9 billion in the US in 2023, according to figures cited by Bloomberg News. The move to curtail Chinese investments most likely will not affect existing commitments from firms in the mainland nor will it impact Chinese purchases and holdings of US Treasuries and other financial instruments, sources told Bloomberg. The Post has sought comment from the Chinese government and the White House. Last week, Chinese regulators delayed the $23 billion sale of dozens of ports worldwide — including two key ports in the Panama Canal — to a group led by US asset manager BlackRock. CK Hutchison, the Hong Kong-based conglomerate controlled by 96-year-old billionaire Li Ka-shing, announced plans earlier this month to sell 43 port facilities globally — including critical ports at both ends of the Panama Canal and near the Suez Canal — for approximately $22.8 billion. But China’s State Administration for Market Regulation unexpectedly initiated an investigation on Friday into potential violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws, effectively stalling the deal. Control of ports in the Panama Canal has become a geopolitical hot potato ever since Trump announced his intent to reassert American dominance over the strategic waterway. Chinese President Xi Jinping was reportedly “angry” over CK Hutchison’s sale of its Panama Canal port operations — particularly because the company did not consult Beijing beforehand, according to the Wall Street Journal. Last month, Trump raised tariffs on Chinese products to 20% while hitting imports from Canada and Mexico with 25% levies. Beijing retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of US farm exports. It also expanded the number of US companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. “If war is what the US wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we’re ready to fight till the end,” China’s embassy to the United States posted on X.

Title: Bitcoin ETFs Could See $3B in Q2 Inflows Even Without Price Recovery, Says Analyst

The spot bitcoin ETFs saw sizable inflows in the first quarter despite the lame price action and at least one analyst sees the next three months as even bigger even if the prices don't recover. “Even if current market conditions persist in the second quarter, we are seeing strong traction from financial advisors and institutional investors," said Juan Leon, senior investment strategist at Bitwise (whose BITB is among the bitcoin ETFs). "While retail interest is weak due to the fixation on price action, professional investors are recognizing the global adoption momentum spurred by the Trump administration’s embrace of bitcoin, and many are seeing these market conditions as an opportunity to start or increase an allocation," Leon added. The ETFs saw over $1 billion in inflows in the first quarter of the year despite a challenging macro situation that sent the S&P 500 Index into its biggest quarterly loss since 2022 and bitcoin's 13% plunge. Leon expects inflows to be even stronger in the second quarter — as much as $3 billion or even more as wirehouse platforms unlock and legislative policy progresses. ETF inflows possibly less than meets the eye The $1 billion in first quarter net flows — and whatever the second quarter brings — doesn't necessarily reflect investor interest in buying the bitcoin dip. That's because of the so-called basis trade (also known as cash-and-carry). In this, institutional players buy the spot bitcoin ETF while shorting CME bitcoin futures, picking up yield without exposure to price movement. That yield was well into the double-digits in late 2024 and remained nicely above the risk-free rate throughout much of the first quarter. It's collapsed to the 5% area of late, suggesting arbitrage-related ETF inflows may dry up. Back to bull case: It's still early “While a favorable price environment would certainly be a boost, it's important to remember that adoption of spot bitcoin ETFs by these groups is still in its infancy," said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, who is also bullish on the outlook for inflows throughout the rest of the year.. "As they grow more comfortable allocating to bitcoin, this should provide a meaningful tailwind for inflows,” he added.., While many institutions have indeed already made their first allocations into bitcoin in the past year, it represents only a small fraction of ETF investment, with most of the money still coming from retail investors — something recently noted by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, whose IBIT is the asset-gathering leader among the spot ETFs. The more favorable regulatory stance toward the industry, not to mention the government’s own potential allocation into bitcoin, however, means that ratio could soon shift significantly. During an ETF conference in Las Vegas earlier this month, a survey showed that 57% of advisors plan on increasing their allocations into crypto ETFs this year as crypto has lost its “reputational risk” attribute among advisors. The view that bitcoin could serve as a “safe haven” in times of an economic decline, which investors remain anxious about, could also boost confidence in the asset, especially as fears of a potential recession grow. “If we see continued rate cut expectations, signs of economic uncertainty, or deepening fears of a potential recession in the US, Bitcoin’s role as 'digital gold' will likely support additional inflows,” said David Siemer, CEO of Wave Digital Assets. “While some short-term traders may rotate out if price weakness persists, long-term players will continue to keep inflows strong, especially as institutional adoption takes off and drives demand throughout the year."

Title: Timeline to COVID Tyranny – The Year 2019 and the Coming Storm
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/timeline-covid-tyranny-year-2019-coming-storm/5883286

Appreciating the full impact of the covid “shock and awe” campaign requires an understanding of not only the extensive planning that went into constructing the massive pandemic machine but also an awareness of how today’s healthcare management systems are being exploited to funnel trillions of dollars into the coffers of the world’s banker barons, pharmaceutical industry, and global ruling elites. We should not underestimate the windfall that has accrued to financial institutions (publicly traded and private banks, brokerage houses, investment firms, wealthy individuals, and family dynasties) from the healthcare sector of the securities markets. In the US alone, national health expenditures (NHE) — that is, total spending on healthcare and related activities — constitute the largest sector of the US economy. Last year, NHE was more than $5 trillion, or 17.7% of the US gross domestic product (GDP). By 2032, NHE are projected to rise to $7.7 trillion, or 19.7% of GDP. In other words, “disease” has replaced war as the primary money-spinner of the US — and the globe. The titans who control the nation’s politicians and the economy’s purse strings, including the details and direction of monetary and fiscal policy, need to create lengthy, large-scale health crises in order to keep their drowning-in-red-ink financial systems afloat. Manufactured pandemics have become mammoth investment opportunities that increase the wealth of these billionaires and further consolidate their power. The covid phenomenon itself cannot be fully comprehended without understanding the behind-the-scenes, un-televised, unprecedented economic collapse of 2019–2020 that threatened the entire global financial system. In the words of David A. Hughes, author of COVID-19 — Psychological Operations and the War for Technocracy, “This was not to be just any recession, however. This was, potentially, to be a system-destroying recession.” In September 2019, world markets were faced with an emergency debt crisis that popped up in formerly (mostly) liquid markets — namely, money markets, repurchase agreement (repo) markets, and foreign exchange (FX) markets. A crisis in the US repo market saw the secured overnight lending rate briefly hit 10% (versus its prior 2019 rate of 2%–3%), prompting the Federal Reserve to step in and begin dumping hundreds of billions of dollars a week into Wall Street’s trading firms. That repo loan operation, effectively a Wall Street bailout program, started September 17 and over the next six months came to more than $9 trillion in cumulative loans made at super-cheap borrowing rates. John Titus, a lawyer by training who, ever since the pandemic, has been applying his forensic skills to rooting out banking fraud, suggests that the Federal Reserve loan activity led to the decision to put BlackRock’s “Dealing with the next downturn” plan into action. Curiously, that white paper, whose central tenet is the “going direct” plan, was written by four BlackRock investment officers even before the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the pandemic in March 2020. All of this suggests that the covid crisis was timed to coincide with the emergency debt crisis the world markets were facing. It looks like Western governments, at the beck and call of the big banks, instigated an operation to stem the cataclysmic economic landslide, bail out large investors, and proactively install a security infrastructure to control the inevitable social disorder that would result from this global catastrophe. Put another way, without an external threat like a “killer virus,” without the Covid-19 smokescreen, this massive financial collapse and historic wealth transfer would be seen for what it was: colossal theft by the ruling aristocracy of financial fraudsters. As I wrote in my January 2, 2023, article for Off-Guardian, “That’s the coup: global hyperinflation to vaporize the assets of the masses and the states in order to hand over public assets to private investors. This allows the ruling class to mop up properties (bankrupted small businesses, foreclosed homes, etc.) in order to stake limitless claims on everything in the world.” And, as John Titus wrote in his Summary — Going Direct Reset: “In a nutshell, the arrival of the 2020 pandemic was about as accidental as an assassination. The pandemic narrative is nothing but a cover story to conceal from the public what in reality is the biggest asset transfer ever.” Click here to read the timeline. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

Title: Bitcoin could be a lifeline to US global dominance as US debt doubles China

Bitcoin's potential as a reserve currency gains traction amid U.S. financial challenges. The United States federal deficit is projected to reach $1.9 trillion in fiscal year 2025, approximately 2.4 times larger than China’s estimated 5.66 trillion yuan ($780 billion) shortfall. According to Reuters, the US Treasury recorded a $1.15 trillion deficit during the first five months of the fiscal year (Oct – Feb), marking a 38% year-over-year increase. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the full-year shortfall at 6.5% of GDP, significantly above the 50-year average of 3.8%, as entitlement costs and interest payments surge. Debt servicing alone reached $396 billion during the same five months, while federal revenue growth stagnated at around 1% year-on-year. In contrast, China’s Ministry of Finance has set its 2025 deficit target at 4% of GDP, the highest in over three decades. While the nominal figure is smaller, adjusted estimates from Fitch Ratings suggest China’s actual fiscal deficit may be closer to 8.8% of GDP when off-budget borrowing is included. The increase reflects a deliberate shift toward infrastructure investment, expanded subsidies, and efforts to offset the prolonged property market slowdown, as outlined in Beijing’s Government Work Report. The magnitude and trajectory of US debt growth have reignited debate over the dollar’s long-term viability as the world’s primary reserve currency. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink recently warned that escalating US deficits could erode global confidence in the dollar and open the door for alternative financial instruments, such as Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s decentralized structure and fixed supply have led some analysts to consider it a hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Amid these concerns, the concept of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset has gained momentum in policy circles. Former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve using assets seized from criminal cases, positioning digital assets as tools for bolstering fiscal resilience. However, adoption faces challenges. Bitcoin’s perceived price volatility and regulatory direction continue to raise concerns. The European Central Bank, for example, has dismissed the idea of including Bitcoin in its reserves, with President Christine Lagarde stating it will not happen during her tenure. As US debt accelerates beyond even China’s rising fiscal imbalance, discussions about reserve diversification, particularly involving Bitcoin, are likely to intensify. Advocates cite Bitcoin’s deflationary properties and independence from central banks, while the strength of critics’ arguments on its instability and unclear regulatory frameworks is decreasing. There is growing uncertainty around the future of global monetary policy, and the search for alternative safeguards against systemic fiscal risk may well lead to Bitcoin.

Title: BlackRock $1.9B BUIDL fund’s 183% growth puts it behind just four stablecoins in tokenized dollar assets

BlackRock outpaces competition: BUIDL surpasses Ethena and Paxos in digital asset market. BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) has reached $1.92 billion in assets under management less than a month after breaking $1 billion. The explosive growth places it ahead of all but four stablecoins among tokenized RWAs, according to data from rwa.xyz. The fund, launched in March 2024 and administered via the Securitize protocol, invests in U.S. Treasuries and operates under a Reg D exemption. It has recorded a 183.97% increase in market cap over the past 30 days, driven by institutional flows and increasing adoption of tokenized money market strategies. BUIDL now ranks sixth among dollar-linked digital assets by market capitalization, just behind First Digital USD and ahead of assets such as Ethena’s USDtb, Tether Gold (XAUT), and USDD. With a $1 net asset value and 4.5% annual yield, BUIDL functions like traditional money market funds while leveraging blockchain rails for programmable liquidity. The fund spans Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Aptos, with over 90% of its supply on Ethereum. Among tokenized U.S. Treasury RWA funds, BUIDL is the largest by a significant margin, nearly tripling the size of Franklin Templeton’s BENJI and Paxos Gold (PAXG). Only Tether’s USDT, Circle’s USDC, MakerDAO’s USDS, and Binance-Peg USD maintain larger market caps in the broader digital dollar category. Institutional demand for regulated, yield-generating instruments on-chain appears to be accelerating, positioning BUIDL as a benchmark for treasury-backed RWAs integrated into public blockchain ecosystems.

Title: CBS Sports Sells MaxPreps to PlayOn in Youth Sports Media Shuffle
URL: https://www.sportico.com/business/media/2025/maxpreps-sale-playon-cbs-paramount-1234845892/
Time Published: 2025-04-02T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Jason Clinkscales Reporter/Editor, Breaking News Nine months after being put on the market, MaxPreps has a new home. PlayOn announced that it has bought the long-running prep sports media platform from Paramount’s CBS Sports. The acquisition brings MaxPreps alongside its new owners’ other high school media brands GoFan, VidSwap and the NFHS Network. The sale does not include CBS Sports’ other high school sports properties, 247Sports and Scout Media. Financial terms were not disclosed, but PlayOn CEO David Rudolph described the negotiation as a competitive process. “Like most deals … they probably would have loved for us to pay more, and we probably would have loved to pay less, which says it probably landed about where it’s supposed to,” Rudolph said in a video interview. Moving into a space long held by local newspapers, MaxPreps was launched in the summer of 2002 to cover high school sports. The site became popular due to its ability to crowdsource scores, rosters and schedules from coaches, athletes and schools. In time, MaxPreps expanded into college recruiting. Aiming to supplement its College Sports Television (now CBS Sports Network) and expand its portfolio of sports and entertainment websites, CBS acquired MaxPreps for $43 million in 2007. As he discussed the deal, Rudolph said he put the new acquisition to use to watch his daughter, a high school senior, play in her last home soccer game. “Whether you’re the fan, the student athlete, the parent, the grandparent, whatever you need to experience high school sports … we want to make it an awesome experience,” he said while noting his daughter’s team was up 1-0. “We’ve done that on the streaming side, on the ticketing side, and now bringing MaxPreps into the fold, that really lets us kind of complete that circle. “For me personally, this is the fulfillment of a 15-year vision; like we finally got the last piece to the puzzle.” PlayOn, based in Atlanta and nearby Alpharetta, was originally a division of Turner Broadcasting (and the larger Time Warner), digitally producing and streaming college sports. It was spun out of Time Warner in 2008 and began streaming high school sports in 2009. In 2013, PlayOn launched the NFHS Network, a joint venture with the National Federation of State High School Associations, as a subscription service for people to watch high school sports, including basketball, football, wrestling and cheerleading. In April 2022, PlayOn merged with GoFan, a ticketing and fundraising platform for high school sports that was founded in 2001. Though the company now owns several platforms that ideally serve the same consumers of high school sports, Rudolph said there are no immediate plans to consolidate all of them into a super app for a unified user experience. “I do think we will be looking at that, but I also think we’ve got to protect some of the custom-built consumer journeys that we create,” he said. “It’s still going to have to make it very easy and intuitive for the fan to be able to do the very specific action that they’re looking for.” Youth sports has become an active investment market recently, with private equity titans (and sports team owners) David Blitzer and Josh Harris making headway through Unrivaled Sports. PlayOn itself is a benefactor with KKR as a significant investor alongside existing shareholder and venture capital firm Panoramic Ventures. That’s not lost on Rudolph, who noted that youth sports—both through high schools and club sports—have provided lower price points for investors looking to tap into those highly engaged customer bases. “I think there are more and more people who are looking for ways to invest in sports, but don’t want to spend $6 billion to have a team that may or may not turn out to be a smart financial investment,” he said, noting the recent sale of the Boston Celtics. “I think they’re naturally looking at youth sports as a space. It’s a really fragmented space … so there are [more] opportunities to get involved.” Last June, Sportico reported that CBS Sports was exploring a sale of the site and enlisted Inner Circle Sports to assist in the process. LionTree Advisors (financial advising) and Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough LLP (legal counsel) advised PlayOn on the acquisition. The move is the latest in a string of transactions by Paramount in recent years to pay off its debt. The media conglomerate sold PopCulture and ComicBook, formerly under its CBS Interactive division, to Savage Ventures last August. In 2021, Paramount sold CBS’ famed “Blackrock” headquarters and the network’s studio center in separate transactions for a combined $2.61 billion. It has previously fielded offers for BET, the Black-themed cable network that it purchased for $2.3 billion in 2000. Paramount awaits approval of a merger with Skydance, which is expected to close at some point in the first half of this year. (This story has been corrected in the third-to-last paragraph to clarify that Sportico reported that CBS Sports was looking to sell MaxPreps.

Title: BlackRock Secures UK FCA Crypto Registration

BlackRock managed to land on the Financial Conduct Authority's tough crypto register on Tuesday, the regulators website showed. The world's biggest asset manager will be allowed to act as an arranger for iShares Digital Assets AG, which issue Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) — a financial instrument that is pegged an underlying asset, in this case a crypto asset. Registration on the U.K.'s crypto register is not an easy feat. The FCA's crypto register was set up in 2020 to ensure that crypto firms wishing to serve U.K. clients could only do so after they had registered to comply with the country's anti-money laundering rules. The U.K. has received 368 applications but only 51 firms have been approved. As an arranger, BlackRock will be able to "arrange the execution of transactions in cryptoassets to support ETP subscriptions and redemptions" between issuers and authorized participants but it will not be able to onboard any new customers. Also, it will not be able to operate a machine that "utilizes automated processes to exchange cryptoassets for money" vice versa - without written consent from the regulator. BlackRock joins the likes of crypto exchange Coinbase who recently managed to get on the register this year, though a new crypto regime awaits.

ByJabari Young ByJabari Young Forbes Staff. Aliko Dangote, the wealthiest person in Nigeria, firmly believes in the phrase “seeing is believing.” Even after years of amassing his fortune, he sought additional confirmation of his wealth. To verify this, he drove to a bank on his own, wrote himself a check for $10 million, then cashed it. “I went home and opened it,” Dangote recalled in a 2019 interview. “I looked at $10 million (in cash) and I said, ‘Now I believe I have money.’–I took it back to the bank the next day.” Now if Dangote wanted to make a withdrawal, the banks might run out of cash before he does. On Tuesday, Forbes released the annual World’s Billionaires list. Dangote, the founder and CEO of the Dangote Group, the largest conglomerate in West Africa, ranks as the 83rd-richest person—and the richest Black person—on the planet. He’s worth an estimated $23.9 billion, up from $13.4 billion on last year’s list after nearly doubling his fortune with the opening of Africa’s largest oil and gas refinery. The $23 billion project converted a Nigerian marshland into the seventh-largest refinery in the world. Among the challenges of converting a jungle were moving 365 million cubic meters of sand from the sea, building a private port and private roads, and booking a 5,000-ton crane, one of only three in the world, years in advance. “It was the biggest risk of my life,” Dangote told Forbes in a February 2024 profile. “If this didn’t work, I was dead.” Dangote is the richest Black billionaire, but he isn’t the only one. Overall, there are a record 3,028 billionaires on this year’s ranking, worth a record $16.1 trillion combined. Twenty-three of them are Black—just 0.8% of the list—but they’re a wealthy and impressive bunch. Overall, these 23 have amassed $96.2 billion in wealth, mainly from the finance, energy and technology sectors. David Steward, an American IT entrepreneur, is the second richest, worth an estimated $11.4 billion. Private equity billionaire Robert F. Smith is the third-wealthiest Black billionaire, with an estimated net worth of $10.8 billion. Palantir Technologies cofounder and CEO Alexander Karp ($8.4 billion) and Nigerian businessman Mike Adenuga ($6.8 billion) round out the top five. Sheila Johnson, the cofounder of BET, is a new Black billionaire this year, as is Herriot Tabuteau, the founder of a biotech firm focused on brain disorders. NBA Sixth Man Junior Bridgeman was also poised to debut. Bridgeman amassed an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion before his untimely death in March. He would’ve joined four other Black athletes on the list who became billionaires: Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tiger Woods. “He didn’t waste his time just thinking about the game of basketball,” James told Forbes in February when discussing Bridgeman. “He’s always had a business mindset.” Michael Prince for Forbes The founder and CEO of Dangote Group began the painful process of building Africa’s largest oil and gas refinery in 2013.

Title: The Trump ‘Threat’ Helps Sell the War Racket in Canada and Europe

Full Content:
Back at the end of February, we wondered how the Trump administration officials dressing down of the Europeans would mix with the relentless propaganda against Russia — specifically whether it would lead to a rally-around-the-EU-flag moment similar to the time after the official start of the Ukraine war in 2022. That process is now in full swing and not just in Europe, but Canada too. Support for these EU and Canadian “rearmament” initiatives are being aided along by all the Trump noise. I say noise for the following reasons: Ian Lesser, director of the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund tells the New York Times the following. “The advent of the Trump administration has given history a shove,” he said. “We’re not in a linear environment, with a linear spending trajectory.” That same New York Times report mentions — as have many others — the Trump administration still supports NATO, plans to keep the American nuclear umbrella over Europe and remains committed to “collective defense.” In the SignalGate messages, VP Vance laments “I just hate bailing Europe out again.” Vance argued that bombing the Houthis to protect trade routes through the Suez Canal would benefit Europe much more than the US since only “3 percent of US trade runs through the Suez” and “40 percent of European trade does.” Well, that assumes that the US will be successful in “protecting” trade routes by bombing Yemen — which is far from a sure thing. And the US war crimes there are much more about bailing out Israel than Europe. Nevertheless, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth agreed with Vance: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.” Vance was also miffed that the “bailing out” of Europe goes against Trump’s “message” about the EU. Even though Vance and Hegseth might be disappointed (that European nations aren’t bombing Yemen?), Trump’s “message” is still accelerating long-held dreams by neoliberal Atlanticists, such as the following: Now some EU plans look like they’re going nowhere fast. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s 800 billion “ReArm Europe” brainchild doesn’t have the full support of bloc countries it needs. And others from High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas to provide up to 40 billion euros in aid to Kiev and 5 billion euros toward providing Ukraine two million artillery shells this year are all but dead. That being said, several EU countries are dramatically increasing military spending, most notably Germany, which under incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz is losing its debt rules to spend big on its military. And the EU, even if “ReArm” never takes off, there are plenty of other options on the table. EU cohesion funds are financed by bloc governments in order to strengthen the economic, social and territorial unity of the EU through environment, transportation, and other infrastructure projects. Roughly one-third of the current seven-year EU budget of 1.2 trillion euros was for cohesion, but can now be used for defense. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is being pushed to direct more money and its AAA credit rating towards militarization. In 2022, the EIB began funding for dual-use projects, and the portion of lending going towards mitigating climate change or fostering economic growth has steadily declined as more money goes to Ukraine and military projects, but it is still unable to directly fund the production of arms and ammunition — something that helps it preserve that AAA rating. Most bloc countries are pushing for that to change. The Polish government recently announced that it will redirect 7.2 billion euros from its share of the EU’s post-pandemic recovery funds towards militarization spending. It’s the first — but perhaps not the last — bloc country to do so. None of these plans deal with the issue of the EU’s lack of soldiers and dearth of young men willing to enlist nor with the fact that even prior to Project Ukraine, NATO already massively outspent Russia on defense, yet the dramatic redirection of money from social spending to weapons companies continues nonetheless. It’s easy to see the dynamic at work here. Trump demands five percent of GDP spent on defense. NATO members go to 3.5 percent — a significant back-breaking jump from two percent. Ursula aims for 800 billion, but instead cohesion funds and EIB spending is redirected. And the more the Trump administration kicks the EU around, the more militarization initiatives in Europe gain support. That’s also the product of years of anti-Russia propaganda. One feels the table is set for the next manufactured crisis to go for broke. They’ve already got people taking to the streets to demand it. The People Want War? How genuine or realistic the Trump administration’s efforts are to end the war in Ukraine are debatable, and conclusions often change by day. (And let’s not forget Russia has the ultimate say.) But one thing is certain: just by making noise about peace in Ukraine and leaving Europe to fend for itself, Trump has helped sell European militarization spending. Here’s a piece from the Associated Press, “Tens of thousands join pro-Europe rally in Rome, amid worries over European Union’s plan to rearm.” This is in Italy, one of the least supportive publics in Europe for Project Ukraine with major class divergence on the benefits of EU membership, so that gives you an idea of the crowd likely skewed, but still. Tens of thousands of Italians joined a pro-Europe rally in Rome’s city center Saturday, waving blue European Union flags in a sign of support and unity as a European push for rearmament divides the country. The initiative, supported by most of the center-left opposition parties, despite their different positions, was launched by Italian journalist Michele Serra at the end of February, with an editorial in the Italian daily La Repubblica titled: “Let’s say something European.” “I wanted to organize a large demonstration of citizens supporting Europe, its unity and its freedom, with no party flags, only European flags,” Serra said, launching the slogan: “Here we make Europe, or we die.” The initiative was born in response to U.S. President Donald Trump ’s destabilizing policies, which created an unprecedented rift between Europe and the U.S., strained over the war in Ukraine and an ongoing tariff battle. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni has reluctantly backed an EU plan to rearm Europe over concerns that the proposal by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen might weigh on Italy’s giant debt, diverting much-needed funds to weapons spending. Depending on where you sit, getting 30,000 out to protest for weapons manufacturers profits and the gutting of social services could be considered either an impressive or depressing achievement. Nevertheless, is it representative of the wider mood? A few recent polls have some interesting findings. Eurofound shows a slight reversal in the trend of European publics souring on Project Ukraine: A more extreme case of Trump-inspired EU militarization fever can be found in bloc’s recent Eurobarometer survey. The poll, conducted for the European Parliament in January and February, found that 74 percent of EU citizens thought their country benefited from EU membership. That’s the highest recorded level since the question was first asked in 1983. Why are people feeling the love for Brussels? Because the EU “strengthens security”: There’s also this: As always, these results should be taken with a grain of salt since it’s in the EU interest for citizens to support more centralization in the name of “protection.” And so the results are also interesting for what the EP chose to emphasize and subsequent media reports chose not to highlight, including the following: Or how about the following? Most of those values are under threat from the EU, not by any outside forces. While they might have gotten numbers they craved on “the role of the EU to protect,” the increased support for Brussels comes despite the realization beginning to break through that life will not be getting any better: That will no doubt still be the case even once the Trump shock is gone and the rally around the flag euphoria wears off — just as it did following the start of Russia’s special military operation in 2022. Neoliberal Warmongers’ Reprieve One area the Trump effect is more clearly showing itself is in bumps of support for Western politicians and parties thoroughly discredited for their Project Ukraine support in recent years and the disastrous effect it has had on economies at home. Here’s FT: Canada’s ruling Liberal party was facing a humiliating loss in upcoming elections. Then came Donald Trump. Party leadership contenders vied to display strength against the US president, his tariffs and his desire to take over Canada – and Liberals’ poll ratings began surging. Under new prime minister Mark Carney, with the slogan “Canada strong”, the party is now narrow favourite to win a historic fourth straight term. The former Bank of England governor has become emblematic of global leaders enjoying a ratings bump after going head to head with Trump. Polling in several countries, from Mexico to Ukraine, shows even unpopular leaders like France’s Emmanuel Macron are enjoying some relief from voters as they seek to ward off menaces including tariffs, the withdrawal of military support and even the threat of US conquest. Even Zelesnky, who has Ukraine on the verge of extinction, has got wind in his sails: Zelenskiy’s overall approval rating has shot to 67 per cent while his net approval is 38 per cent – the highest scores since December 2023 – even as he seeks to mend relations by accepting Trump’s proposed minerals deal and partial 30-day truce. Trump’s comments were seen as “unfair, a stab in the back” and “a wider attack on the country, rather than just criticism targeting the president”, said Anton Hrushevsky of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Macron is going to need a lot more help (like, say, the barring of his main rival from office), but he’s up six percentage points to a depressing 27 percent in an Elabe survey this month. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer who’s even more impressive than Macron in that he sunk to similar approval levels in a fraction of the time, saw a double digit rise in approval rating as the UK public rallies around the Starmer slime in the face of what they view as Trump’s unfair treatment of Ukraine. Nathalie Tocci, director of Rome’s Institute for International Affairs told FT the following: “You have this bully that is smashing the system. Rather than just kissing the ring, these leaders basically stand up and politely say ‘no’, and their voters appreciate the fact that they are not being colonised.” But is that really true? Beneath the Surface It’s Business As Usual Europe still refuses to do anything about the energy elephant in the room and despite all the big talk remain mostly subservient to the US. Canadians might be flying the maple leaf everywhere you look, but how’s that surge of patriotism playing out in Ottawa? Canada is in talks to get in on the EU’s increased military spending. Brussels says it wants to prioritize European-made products, but there are doubts about that. According to the Stockholm International Peace Institute: Arms imports by European states were 94 per cent higher in 2019–23 and 55 percent came from the US, a substantial increase from 35 per cent in 2014–18. The next largest suppliers to the region were Germany and France, which accounted for 6.4 per cent and 4.6 per cent of imports, respectively. The EU, as part of the Trump spat, is looking to reduce that dependence and is hoping on Canada. According to the New York Times, “Canada, according to the terms of the discussion, would also be given preferential access to the E.U. market for military equipment, an alternative to buying equipment from the United States.” There are issues there, as well: Canada’s military industry, which is relatively small, has been used to produce Canadian equipment but has also been a regular contractor for building American military equipment or parts. Canadian factories across the vast country produce munitions, tanks, aircraft, technological defense systems and navy ships. An in-depth industry review in 2022 found that about half of Canada’s military equipment was exported and half kept domestically. The top export destination, by far, was the United States. In the meantime, Ottawa is sending billions to one of Canada’s wealthiest families in the name of defense. From The Breach: The Liberal government has handed $8 billion to one of Canada’s wealthiest families—and they’re counting on Canadians not to notice. The deal awards Irving Shipbuilding, owned by the notorious Irving dynasty, a six-year contract to start building three new destroyers for the Canadian navy. Even military insiders have slammed it as wildly overpriced. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. By the government’s own estimates, the ships won’t be finished until 2039—and by then, the total cost will have ballooned to at least $22 billion. The government boasted the deal will help protect Canada’s sovereignty and create jobs. But at a time when Canadians are struggling with the cost of living, a crumbling healthcare system, and a planetary crisis, it’s clear what this really is: a massive corporate handout in disguise. An enormous grift? Sure, but it must be done due to Trump’s threats to Canada’s national security. Canada is spending another $6 billion to develop an Arctic radar detection system — again part of the US desire to militarize the region, which European countries like Sweden, Finland, and Norway are also helping with. The UK just announced it’s going forward with buying more F-35s despite all the supposed worries about a Trump kill switch. Canada, too, has yet to cancel its purchase of 88 F-35s costing more than $14 billion — although Ottawa says it’s “doing its homework.” To make it abundantly clear where these governments priorities are, these massive expenditures come as the UK slashes benefits for those with disabilities (and won’t even make a document describing the cuts available to blind people set to have support slashed), and Canada offers more support for the disabled to die than to live. And incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz touts his plans for further cuts to Bürgergeld and other social spending as Germany authorises 1 trillion euros in new loans for militarization. Canada and the EU continue to do the empire’s bidding against the likes of China and Iran and play along in Syria and elsewhere. The Italian-owned Mediterranean Shipping Company is working with the Trump administration and Blackrock to take over a portion Middle East shipping infrastructure — a big part of the US strategy to reverse the tide of China’s growing control over global logistics. Ottawa is engaging in its own trade war against Beijing, which is approved of by Washington. The EU is making noise about rapprochement with China, but there has been no movement yet, and many in Brussels are offering to get even tougher on Beijing as a way to please the US. Meanwhile, there’s still no peace with Russia as the Atlanticists enact what have been their goals all along — primarily other members of NATO spending a lot more. As Politico put it, “One imagines that Trump administration officials are patting themselves on the back for finally getting the Germans to take more drastic action on defense spending, meeting a long-time goal of many U.S. administrations to strengthen the European pillar of the transatlantic alliance.” Yes, there have been calls for this for years, and they ramped up considerably after the beginning of Russia’s SMO. Here is just one example from the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) writing last year in Foreign Affairs about Washington’s need to focus on China: That complicated reality requires U.S. allies, especially in Europe, to take on a larger share of directing the containment of Russia. Europe has shown its political and economic resilience in the face of Russian aggression. Yet militarily, the continent remains dependent on the United States. This dynamic must change, in part because the United States must commit more of its resources to Asia. The growth of European defense spending since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is an encouraging step. In 2023, 11 NATO members hit their spending target, allocating at least two percent of GDP to national defense, up from just seven members in 2022. The rest need to follow suit. It might be a stretch to say it’s all part of a coordinated plot, but while the increase in military spending might be coming amid a war of words — and some tariffs — the Atlanticist think tanks funded by and expressing the will of American plutocrats are getting what they wanted — and in some cases even more. ‘War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.’ . – George Orwell Aye. The solution to Capitalist overproduction; the MMT Jobs Guarantee. Along with the warnings from Brian Berletic’s New Atlas series, this observation early in Conor’s grim review reminds us ” long-held dreams by neoliberal Atlanticists, such as…: The crushing of the welfare states in Europe and Canada, which goes hand-in-hand with… Rearmament. Ultimately, the benefits of rearmament go first and foremost to the Western arms companies.” Just as 70 years of economic hostility tries to crush Cuba’s exemplary welfare state, reckless warfare and economic policies elsewhere send waves of refugees across the Mediterranean to Europe, crashing welfare states and turning people against their own compassionate policies. While 1960 subtracted from 2025 does come to “only” 65 years of economic warfare, the campaign seems to be baked into Washington’s dream of an economic overthrow – for the foreseeable future – unless and until US politics can be reshuffled. This whining reminds me of something: ‘Nevertheless, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth agreed with Vance: “I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It’s PATHETIC.”’ Which is: Nothing like U.S. macho guys (and macho ladies) sniveling. When was the last time any of them asked what military bases and weapons programs are truly needed, and which are just the usual U.S. boondoggles and displays of dominance? And let’s recall the division of Europe and other little inconveniences like the division of Berlin and Gorizia. The Americans can let the leases lapse on Ghedi and Aviano. The demo organized by Michele Serra has come in for criticism for not standing for anything. Europe? Values? The word “valori” is being thrown around here in Italy these days, and I note that in the graph on values the most-voted value by the populace is peace. Oh. Maybe the social state? Italians are fully aware that after thirty years of stagnant wages the Rearm EU thingy, now called Readiness!, is guaranteed to lower Italian wages further. Five Stars (supported by AVS = Sinistra + Greens) is organizing a demo for 5 April in Roma. We will see how it goes. This is a straight-out anti-rearmament, pro-peace demonstration, rather than oooshy values-waving. As a preliminary, the CGIL and ARCI are backing a demo today here in the Chocolate City. I will walk over to the Piazza Castello later to see what’s what. As to quoting Nathalie Tocci. Foul play, Conor Gallagher! She’s a turbo-Atlanticist who sure loves those wars (as so many lady warmongers do) and regular in the propaganda-laden front pages of La Stampa. Who’s next? Pina Picierno? Say it ain’t so, Joe. On quoting Tocci: It didn’t feel great doing it, but what a perfect encapsulation of the dynamic at play. Aurelien’s observation in his most recent essay: “Take, by way of contrast, roles traditionally attributed to men and women in times of crisis and war. From the earliest times, men were expected to fight, and if necessary die, whilst women encouraged them to do so. (The “women as peacemakers” meme was commercially successful for a while, but as the example of Frau von der Leyen shows, nature generally reverts to type.) Men were biologically more dispensable than women, and indeed, once they had fathered the replacement number of surviving children, their future was of less importance anyway.” https://aurelien2022.substack.com/p/being-non-transactional On needs only to look at Naked Capitalism’s Not-So-Cold-War section each day to see a trajectory of events, and future “peace” Russia faces. Even Dima at Military Summary is saying Trump 720 degrees is/needs to find more military funding of Ukraine in the future beyond Biden’s last formal request to Congress so as to keep “diplomatic” pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire. Because “peace”. While Dima isn’t so good at interpreting US politics he is somewhat a bell weather and words things broadly if not always correctly. I’ve never been comfortable with the framing of Russia “winning the war but losing the peace.” The peace we see the West preparing for, a constant, long range, never ending war and accelerated construction of huge US miliary bases in Romania with nukes pointed directly at Russia, that we see everyday at Not So Cold War? Very good overview of the current situation. Here in Canada I think it is best to keep in mind Cockburn’s quip that you can only believe a politician when he/she denies whatever is at hand. Or in other words, when they say they are telling the truth you know they are lying. If they say it did not happen, then it really did happen. In Canada focusing on Trump and tariffs has been a godsend to the Liberals in the current election. 10 years of lacklustre minimal change in social benefits (dental care, daycare and pharmacare), the Liberals have structured these concrete improvements in people’ lives to take years to actually be meaningful for most of the population. I am cognizant that these social advances in the US would be revolutionary and maybe only legislated into practice after an overthrow of the current constitution. As to armaments and Canada participating in Europe and with Europe keep in mind that this document “NORAD modernization project timelines Fact sheet: NORAD modernization project timelines” dictates down to the size of a screw and where and how it will be used and this policy welds Canada to the US MIC and US foreign policy. Buying European arms means that Canada would have to integrate these weapons, etc. with the US MIC. Now how likely is that. If anything Canada is Trojan Horse for the US to maintain its hegemony in worldwide weapons specs and production. As to the Canadian election, Pierre “Skippy” Poilièvre’s best and only asset in Conservative circles is that he is really angry. And , and a big and, comes across as really authentic, but for the electorate there are no feasible or practical solutions being proposed to make people’s lives better. In Canada we have been living in a neoliberal hell run by Tweedledum and Tweedledummer at least since I have been old enough to vote (circa 1980). Whether you vote Team Red or Team Blue it doesn’t matter — it’s always neoliberal cola in every bottle. What few tiny improvements in social welfare that have been achieved since the ‘60s have mostly come when the Liberals are forced to include the New Democrats (NDP) in a minority parliament, so I suppose I can extend that meagre hope … Today’s NDP is a neoliberal party. Their much-touted dental plan, besides being confusing, is neither universal nor public. It’s not universal, because (a) dentists can opt out, and (b) anyone whose employer offers benefits is disqualified–even if a particular employee doesn’t actually receive those benefits. It’s not really public, because the system is managed by Sun Life. What’s worse, this plan exposes Canada’s health care system to attack under our various trade treaties. Now that a private firm can bid for health care management contracts, Canada could be sued to open the sector to competition. In other words, this dental program does NOT represent an extension of social welfare. Instead, it’s the fatal chink in the armour, that might doom universal public health insurance in Canada. But what else would you expect, from the government now headed by the typical guy from Goldman Sachs? “Smart” policy, as we like to say nowadays. And it couldn’t have happened without the NDP. I’m pleased you worked “Racket” into your title, Conor. Sadly too little has changed since Smedley Butler’s time. Against what threat does Europe rearm? Russia? It does carry on hysterically about Russia, doesn’t it? I say again, against what threat does Europe rearm? We are in Smedley Butler”s wheel house. War is a racket. The MIC are racketeers. Lindsey Graham revealed it. Ukraine is the best kind of war. Profits with little to none of “our blood.” Lindsey is a racketeer and a cheer leader for racketeering. He is one voice in a crowd of racketeers in the DC Bubble & Echo Chamber stuffing their pockets with the largesse of the MIC. It is all so stupid, so disingenuous, so callous, so self-serving, so calculating. Throw the bums out. Which bums you ask? Really? You cannot be serious. I note that Europe has a very long history of using its arms on its neighbors centuries before there was ever a military-industrial complex. By the government’s own estimates, the ships won’t be finished until 2039 By then Yemen will probably have domestic hypersonic production. Grift is an understatement. The problem with such short-term shenanigans is that they exacerbate the long-term problems that necessitate them. I haven’t seen any indication that the eurocracy has any appreciation or even an understanding of just what is driving the overall souring of the public mood and the rise of far-right populism. These are going to accelerate as the graft of Rearm Europe further concentrates wealth and resources into fewer hands. re: German incompetence in security affairs If anyone wants to read yet another document which offers proof of the utter incompetence of German “elites” to seriously change course read this 2-pager (German but quickly translatable.). Signed by some of the 15 best known “doves” in security affairs. STATEMENT “RATIONAL SECURITY POLICY INSTEAD OF ALARMISM,” March 30, 2025 Rational security policy instead of alarmism https://johannes-varwick.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Final__Rationale_Sicherheitspolitik.pdf “(…) Russia is undoubtedly a threat to European security, and aggressive intentions beyond Ukraine cannot be completely ruled out – although hybrid threats are more plausible than traditional military ones. However, a sober look at Russia’s economic and military capabilities, as well as its (realizable) intentions, reveals little evidence that Russia could or even would want to engage NATO militarily and attack its territory. A Russia that has great difficulty achieving its goals in Ukraine is a manageable military threat. Furthermore, NATO is, and will remain so for the foreseeable future, disproportionately stronger than Russia in virtually all military respects. (…) Without a reliable American security guarantee, Europe must reposition its security policy. (…)” Some of the signatories most likely are the same who early 2023 in a peace memo on Ukraine argued that the war had so far cost 50.000 civilians´ lives – because the US Armed Forces had told them so – ??? What else do you need for proof for the insanely low level we are operating here. The letter´s intention I fully agree with. But that is seriously high school level. Since the alternative would be another 30 years war or WWIII. But not this way. Which is void of any real professional insight into the matter of security. The 15 individuals who have signed in private might have certain more far-reaching expertise that would matter to this public statement. But the major thrust as presented here beyond any doubt shows you that: 1) These laughably compromising formulations are a lip service at best without any force behind them. 2) There is no substantive understanding of how military affairs have changed on the tactical and the strategic level. 3) No substantial consequences will be drawn – such as ending NATO, cancelling MDF as of 2026, cancelling F-35s, a non-nuclear European zone in conjunction with RU as laid out by RU in Dec. 2021 So part and parcel of this mindset is 1) Russia is weak because they “struggle” in Ukraine to reach their objectives (seriously???!). 2) NATO-Europe so goddam strong. 3) Russia might pose some danger. All of this makes it obvious that there is NO – and I repeat this here – NO hope for German elites and thus German public at large to resist meaningfully the sell-out via new war budget and thereof destruction of this society. If even those who are allegedly the experts (which they obviously are not at least as public statements go) fail to take a decisive position which would be the only position to open a new path towards Russia and BRICS then WHO should? Since none of this would stop Merz or anybody else for real. So if I despair this is one major reason, why. I love it. A classic case of the deranged leading the demented and dragging the despairing down with them. Soon they’ll be bickering amongst themselves, relations will start to break down and an armed conlict, fought with washing machines and fast loading broomsticks, will breakout and nobody outside “the garden” will notice Europe bleeding to death because fonda Lyin’, with the enthusiastic support of Europe’s national political élites, has turned it into a clapped out confederacy with little political and economic substance whose only value to the real world of prosperity, innovation and high per capita incomes will lie in its use as a source of low skilled bonded labour, hookers and a few slabs of stone for the tourists to gawk at in their desire to experience history flowing backwards as Europeans are forced to pay off all the debts owed to the rest of the world. re: German crisis BERLINER ZEITUNG: Letter of urgency by German family companies to Merz “The situation is dramatic”: Family entrepreneurs write open letter to Merz and SPD The CDU and SPD government plans have met with considerable criticism.

Title: Companies used to tout their climate plans. Under Trump, they’ve gone quiet.

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ Just a few years ago, pledges to tackle climate change were a staple of corporate PR. Amazon trumpeted its climate pledge and stamped it on the name of Seattle’s biggest arena. Walmart promised to slash a gigaton of carbon emissions from its supply chain, and the world’s largest money manager, BlackRock, with its $11 trillion in investments, pressured companies to come up with a plan to zero out their emissions by 2050. Now, many corporations are avoiding the subject altogether. During earnings calls, mentions of many well-known terms related to the climate are down 76 percent compared to three years ago, according to a recent analysis of S&P 500 companies by Bloomberg. The sharpest declines came from financial firms and consumer discretionary companies, the category for those offering optional purchases, like Starbucks and Airbnb. The hesitancy to talk about climate change — sometimes called “greenhushing” — could decrease pressure on the big corporate polluters that have been slow to cut their emissions. The trend has been linked to a growing backlash against sustainable investing, as well as a shifting political landscape with President Donald Trump’s second term underway. “I think large companies in particular today are very, very cautious,” said Hortense Bioy, the head of sustainable investing research for Morningstar, a financial services firm. Companies have been caught in a tug-of-war: On one hand, investors are pressuring them to be serious about the risks of climate change to their business. On the other, the mention of any word related to so-called ESG — the polarizing acronym that refers to “environmental, social, and governance” investing — threatens blowback from the Trump administration. The way to thread the needle, experts suggest, is to stay away from flashpoints like ESG and talk specifically about the financial risks that the warming planet poses to companies. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How John Marshall, the CEO of the Potential Energy Coalition, a nonpartisan marketing firm focused on climate action, says that silence isn’t a winning strategy. “We do not think that voters or consumers are at all impressed, regardless of their political stripes, by taking the concept of climate change out of any language,” Marshall said. His research shows that investors and the public want companies to talk about climate change — as an investment risk, not a matter of morality. According to a Potential Energy report from last September, 3 in 4 Americans surveyed think companies have a responsibility to limit their impact on the climate. What’s more, roughly 9 in 10 U.S. retail investors want companies to reduce emissions and prepare for the ways increasingly unpredictable weather could lead to risks like supply chain disruptions and rising insurance costs. The first signs of greenhushing appeared in 2023, when the Swiss consultancy South Pole found that a quarter of large companies around the world had decided not to publicize their progress on climate targets. The reason, South Pole later found, was that companies wanted to avoid the legal risks that came with high-profile pledges. It was a response to countries crafting new laws against “greenwashing,” the term for deceptive environmental advertising. At the same time, financial institutions were already dealing with the backlash against ESG, which heated up in 2022. Lawsuits targeted asset managers, pension funds, and federal agencies, claiming that “woke capitalism” was putting politics over financial interests. Red states including Florida and Texas pulled billions in state funds out of BlackRock and other ESG-friendly firms. BlackRock, which in 2021 had supported almost half of shareholder proposals to address environmental and social issues, pulled a U-turn. Between July 2023 and June 2024, it only backed 4 percent of them. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Here's How “They were too visible and too vocal about what they were doing in that space,” Bioy said. She expects that companies with big climate plans may now have to disclose the opposition to ESG as a risk in their annual reports. That sense of caution is showing up in the markets, too: Over the last two years, there has been more money leaving sustainable funds in the U.S. than what’s coming in, according to Morningstar’s research. Bioy suspects that trend still has room to run, given Trump’s hostility to climate action. In December, corporations including Apple, Walmart, and Siemens failed to sign an open letter reaffirming their commitment to the Paris Agreement, a letter organized by the climate coalition they joined after Trump’s first presidential victory in 2016. Bioy pointed to the guidance circulating in government organizations warning against using terms like “pollution,” “clean energy,” and “climate science.” “Companies that do business with the administration or any state organization, they will be careful not to use those terms,” Bioy said. In the past, some companies have used language around climate change that embraced a moral framing, such as “do the right thing.” But most people don’t think that’s the province of what businesses should be doing, Marshall said. Two-thirds of Americans believe that businesses should avoid taking a stance on political issues, according to his firm’s research. The moral framing provokes backlash because it feels like “forcing an idea on somebody,” Marshall said. “We have seen it’s much more effective to have language in the business community that’s about money and reality.” It raises the broader question of how regular people should talk about climate change when many of the terms environmental advocates use can provoke a knee-jerk reaction. “I think that the climate movement needs to be very thoughtful about and strategic about whether or not it is a DEI or ESG initiative,” said Austin Whitman, CEO of The Change Climate Project, a nonprofit offering tools to help businesses cut their emissions. “I think for all of us across the spectrum, regardless of what cause we’re fighting for, we need to distance ourselves from these lightning-rod acronyms and topics that are really easy to just cut down with a single swipe.” This story has been updated to clarify Apple and other corporations’ involvement in the climate coalition they joined.

Title: BlackRock approved to offer crypto services in UK, expanding digital asset footprint

BlackRock's FCA approval restricts operations to ETP support, significantly narrowing its crypto asset activities. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. BlackRock has secured approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to operate as a registered crypto asset firm in the United Kingdom. The approval places BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, among a growing list of regulated companies in the region, including Coinbase and Kraken. This milestone also marks a significant step in the asset manager’s continued expansion into the digital asset space over the past year. According to the FCA’s website, the registration allows BlackRock to support its only client, iShares Digital Assets AG, in managing crypto-related exchange-traded products (ETPs). These products offer exposure to specific cryptocurrencies and are backed by the underlying assets. However, BlackRock’s role is highly restricted and tailored to a narrow scope of services. The firm is permitted to conduct the following activities: Facilitate the execution of crypto asset transactions to support ETP subscriptions and redemptions between the issuer and designated authorized participants. Sell digital assets for fiat currency to cover operational expenses for itself and the issuer’s service providers. Convert digital assets into fiat during early redemptions of the ETP. Meanwhile, BlackRock is not allowed to onboard new clients for this service unless it receives written permission from the FCA. Furthermore, the firm is restricted from operating automated machines that convert fiat to crypto or vice versa. It is also prohibited from holding or controlling client funds. Market observers have suggested that the approval could allow the firm to expand its iShares Bitcoin ETP to the UK. Last month, BlackRock launched its iShares Bitcoin ETP for European users via the Euronext exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam, and Germany’s Xetra exchanges. This product is available to institutional and knowledgeable retail investors. It aims to provide secure and regulated access to Bitcoin through traditional stock exchanges. The ETP has a temporary fee waiver that reduces its total expense ratio to 0.15% until the end of the year. It is denominated in US dollars and backed by Bitcoin, which Coinbase holds in offline cold storage. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Bitcoin broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern and is poised to hit the $88,500 level. Bitcoin [BTC], the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, appears bullish and is poised for massive upside momentum. This bullish outlook is further supported by the recent minting of 1 billion USDT by Tether, as reported by Arkham on X (formerly Twitter), indicating increased demand from institutions or exchanges. Historically, the minting of USDT is often seen as a bullish sign for the crypto industry, especially for large assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As a result of this mint, the overall cryptocurrency market is already witnessing an uptrend, rising by 1.80% over the past 24 hours, with BTC also breaking out from a bullish pattern. According to AMBCrypto’s technical analysis, BTC has turned bullish on the smaller time frame. Recently, with ongoing upside momentum, it broke out from a bullish inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the hourly time frame. Based on the recent price momentum, if BTC closes its hourly candle above the $84,000 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 5.50% to reach the upcoming resistance at $88,500 in the near future. Source: TraduingView At press time, BTC’s price was facing resistance from the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily time frame and appeared to be breaching it as well. If this occurs, BTC could see an imminent rally. In addition to this bullish price action, the blockchain-based transaction tracker Lookonchain recently shared a post on X stating that Tether bought 8,888 BTC worth $735 million in Q1 2025. This occurred during a period when BTC experienced a price drop of over 18%, indicating that the current level could be an ideal buying opportunity. Tether is not the only major player that bought BTC during the recent price crash. Major firms like Strategy (MSTR), BlackRock, and others have also seized this opportunity and accumulated BTC. This massive purchase by these industry giants gives hope that the current level might be an ideal buying opportunity. At press time, BTC was trading near $84,100, having experienced a price surge of over 2.60% in the past 24 hours. Following the minting of 1 billion USDT and the recent breakout of a bullish pattern, traders and investors have shown strong interest in the asset, leading to a 45% jump in BTC’s trading volume during the same period. This surge in trading volume is explained by traders’ $1 billion worth of bullish bets. Today, the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass reported that traders are over-leveraged at the $81,800 level on the lower side and $84,355 on the upper level, which is on the verge of liquidation. Source: Coinglass Data revealed that traders have built $989 million worth of long positions and $287 million worth of short positions at these over-leveraged levels in the past 24 hours. So, bulls are back, and that BTC could see an impressive upside move. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: China Blocks Panama Canal Port Sale — Report Claims Xi Jinping Infuriated by Deal Sought Without His Approval
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/asia/2025/04/01/china-blocks-panama-canal-port-sale-report-claims-xi-jinping-infuriated-by-deal-sought-without-his-approval/
Time Published: 2025-04-01T22:16:54Z
Full Content:
Chinese antitrust regulators on Friday blocked a deal by the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison conglomerate to sell two ports along the Panama Canal to a consortium led by investment giant BlackRock. The $22.8 billion transaction between CK Hutchison, which is controlled by 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, and BlackRock involved 43 port facilities around the world. It was scheduled to conclude by April 2. The most strategically important, and politically explosive, acquisitions of the sale were ports located at either end of the Panama Canal. President Donald Trump has portrayed Chinese-owned ports on the Panama Canal as threats to American national security because the Chinese military could potentially use them to shut down the canal. He hailed the BlackRock deal as a major step toward alleviating that threat when it was announced in last month. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it. Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal,” Trump said on March 5. International markets seemed to like the arrangement as well, sending CK Hutchison stocks into the stratosphere. However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has not echoed this enthusiasm, according to new reporting by Al Jazeera and Watcher Guru, a finance and cryptocurrency website. Per the reports, Dictator Xi Jinping has allegedly been displeased that Li did not consult with him about the deal or clear it with Party officials. According to Al Jazeera: The Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported that anger over the deal extended all the way to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the newspaper [the Chinese state-run Ta Kung Pao] said Xi was angered that CK Hutchison had not sought his approval for the deal and that he had hoped to use the Panama Canal ports as a bargaining chip with Trump, who has pledged to “take back” the strategically important waterway. Watcher Guru also cited a recent Ta Kung Pao op-ed as describing the transaction as a “betrayal of all Chinese people.” Influential Chinese state media blasted CK Hutchison in mid-March for “spineless groveling,” while Beijing’s puppet administrator in Hong Kong, John Lee, ominously muttered that the deal deserved “serious attention” from regulators – even though there was no obvious legal pretext for the Chinese government to get involved. The necessary pretext was evidently discovered at the eleventh hour, as China’s State Administration for Market Regulation suddenly announced it would investigate the deal to “protect fair competition in the market and safeguard the public interest.” Within hours of that announcement on Friday, CK Hutchison said “there will not be an official signing of the two Panama ports deal next week.” The sale is not technically dead, but there is presently no indication of how long the Chinese government intends to continue its vague antitrust investigation. “We are confident that Panama will require the sale of these assets within its sovereign territory,” a White House official told the New York Post on Monday. The Post editorial board said Beijing’s effort to scuttle the BlackRock deal proves Trump was “dead right” about the menace China poses to U.S. interests in the Panama Canal. “China’s rulers look determined to retain control of the strategically critical maritime conduit – whether to threaten U.S. access to the key shipping lane or to ensure it will remain open to Chinese vessels no matter what,” the editors wrote. “Beijing might stand down when it realizes its heavy hand in Hong Kong’s commercial market will frighten more firms out of doing business there – yet another step toward killing the golden goose of what had been a global financial center,” they suggested. Beijing has indeed been fretting about the flight of foreign capital from Chinese markets, in part because the overbearing Communist regime has launched a string of crackdowns against both Chinese and foreign business operations. Also, despite carefully worded promises that Xi’s deranged citywide coronavirus lockdowns will never be repeated, the shadow of the immense damage from the pandemic looms large over foreign business decisions. BlackRock itself has about $16 billion invested in Chinese stocks, which might give the gigantic investment company enough leverage to get the CK Hutchison deal rolling again after a brief regulatory delay. Or Xi could use those investments as leverage against the company, threatening its portfolio to ensure BlackRock accepts the quiet demise of its Panama Canal ambitions. Al Jazeera on Tuesday suggested an internal Chinese political and cultural angle that might be almost as significant as the international ramifications of the Panama Canal deal. It suggested that there is bad blood between aging Chinese dictator Xi and the even more aged CK Hutchison tycoon Li Ka-shing. Li is something of a legend among Hong Kong investors, and Xi is severely allergic to businessmen who have a stronger grip on the public imagination than he does. Per Al Jazeera: Li’s rise from a mainland Chinese-born refugee to Hong Kong real estate tycoon holds an almost mythical status in the Chinese territory, a former British colony, where he built his reputation navigating Western business interests and the Communist Party. Li was known for his close relations with Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, who oversaw China’s economic opening between the late 1970s and early 2000s, but his political influence waned following Xi’s rise to the top job in 2012. … In 2018, Li passed control of his company to his son, Victor, but the tycoon has stayed in the limelight. The following year, Li angered pro-Beijing commentators with his ambivalent comments about Hong Kong’s mass pro-democracy protests at a time when other companies in the city were openly critical of the demonstrations. Legal and business analysts quoted by Al Jazeera tended to side with the White House official who spoke to the New York Post, predicting that it will be legally difficult for Beijing to kill the deal if Panama exercises its jurisdiction over the canal and gives its blessing. For that matter, the legal authority of Beijing’s top market regulator to quash transactions made by a Hong Kong company is dubious. The antitrust investigation announced on Friday could be an attempt to intimidate Li, his family, and CK Hutchison executives into backing out of the sale. And it could perhaps send a signal to other Chinese businessmen as the trade war heats up that no matter whose names are printed on their company letterhead, Xi Jinping is the chief executive officer of every business in China.

That, in itself, is truly extraordinary, says former SCMP editor-in-chief Wang Xiangwei. This audio is generated by an AI tool. HONG KONG: The arm wrestling between Beijing and Hong Kong's richest family, led by Li Ka-shing, over the controversial sale of Panama Canal ports to BlackRock, an American investment giant, has surprisingly persisted longer than anticipated. After two weeks of apparent silent defiance, the Li family seemed to relent on Friday (Mar 28) when local media, citing sources close to CK Hutchison, reported that the conglomerate founded by Mr Li would not proceed with the expected signing of a deal on Apr 2 to sell its two strategic ports at the Panama Canal. This development marks the latest flashpoint in the geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States. On the same day, news emerged that Beijing would launch an antitrust probe into the sale, part of a US$23 billion deal to sell 43 ports across 23 countries to a consortium led by BlackRock. While Beijing may appear to have succeeded in delaying the sale, this does not necessarily mean the deal is dead. The saga is expected to continue in the coming weeks or even months, potentially involving top leadership in both Beijing and Washington. CK Hutchison announced the deal on Mar 4. Less than 10 days later, Beijing-controlled newspaper, Ta Kung Pao, which is based in Hong Kong, published two sharply worded commentaries, urging the Li family to “stop being naïve and confused”. They criticised CK Hutchison of being unpatriotic and "selling out all Chinese people." This marks the first time Beijing has publicly singled out Hong Kong's most prominent conglomerate for sharp criticism in the 27 years since the city's return to Chinese sovereignty, causing jitters and concerns about the politicisation of business in the local and broader business community. Beijing's apparent loss of composure stems from not being informed of the deal in advance, amid US media reports that BlackRock chairman and CEO Larry Fink called US President Donald Trump to secure his blessing. Mr Trump hailed the deal as part of his administration's efforts to reclaim the Panama Canal. Despite finding themselves in a political storm, the Li family has surprisingly kept its cool. In fact, the Mar 4 announcement, which stated that the sale was purely commercial in nature and unrelated to geopolitics concerning the Panama ports, remains CK Hutchison's only public statement to date. Incensed by the silent treatment, Ta Kung Pao and another pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Wen Wei Po have published at least 20 news stories and commentaries urging the Li family to respond to "public concerns" and halt the deal in the name of national interests and security. The wrangling reached a climax on Mar 26 when Bloomberg cited sources reporting that CK Hutchison was believed to be moving forward with the deal as scheduled, despite Beijing's anger over the transaction. In response, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office again signalled its displeasure by reposting two articles published by Ta Kung Pao on Mar 26 and 27, criticising CK Hutchison for capitulating to US pressure and sacrificing national interests. The following day, CK Hutchison finally relented amid reports that the State Administration for Market Regulation in Beijing would investigate the deal "to ensure fair competition" and "safeguard the public interest." Until then, Beijing had hoped that intense media pressure would suffice to persuade the Li family to pause the deal, mindful of the potential impact on business confidence in Hong Kong and China if it intervened directly. Ta Kung Pao's use of politically charged language in its commentaries has caused dismay among Hong Kong businessmen, with accusations of "aiding and abetting evil" reminiscent of wording frequently used in China's past political campaigns. In the past, such pressure tactics would have quickly forced any Hong Kong company to capitulate. The Li family's ability to withstand the pressure for two weeks is truly extraordinary. In another extraordinary development, Richard Li, the younger son of Li Ka-shing, seems to be distancing himself from CK Hutchison, which is controlled by his elder brother Victor Li. The younger Li attended a high-profile forum in Beijing with senior Chinese officials and global executives on Mar 23 and 24, in his capacity as founder of Pacific Century Group. On Mar 28, China's leading business media outlets, including Caixin, published stories stating that Pacific Century Group’s businesses operate independently. The articles particularly noted that Richard Li resigned from all positions at CK Hutchison in 2000. What happens next? The delay could mean that the main parties involved in the deal, including CK Hutchison and BlackRock, will have to renegotiate the terms to accommodate both Beijing's and Washington's concerns. More likely, it will be a topic of discussion in an anticipated meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Trump, expected to take place in the coming months.

Title: Will TikTok Be Banned Again? As Deadline Nears, Trump Says ‘I’d Like to See TikTok Remain Alive’

By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor Here we go again! TikTok faces a potential shutdown in the U.S. after Saturday, April 5, if its Chinese parent company doesn’t reach an agreement to sell a controlling interest in the hugely popular video app. Will TikTok go dark? With just days to go before the deadline set by President Trump, it’s not clear what will happen next for TikTok, which claims to have 170 million users in the U.S. Some background: A federal bill passed last year with bipartisan congressional support and signed into law by President Biden mandated that ByteDance sell a controlling interest in TikTok to non-Chinese owners or essentially face a nationwide ban of the app. TikTok, after losing an appeal to the Supreme Court challenging the divest-or-ban law on First Amendment grounds, shut down the app in the U.S. on Jan. 18 ahead of the law’s deadline. But TikTok restored service to U.S. users about 14 hours later, citing President Trump’s pledge to not enforce the ban while he sought to broker a solution keeping the app legal. Related Stories VIP+ At GDC, Industry Voices Want AI to Stay Practical 'Last of Us,' 'Fallout' Creators Talk Future of Prestige TV Adaptations and Impact on Gaming Biz Ahead of BAFTA Games Awards: 'The Size of These Things Requires Time' Trump, who in his first term sought to force a sale of TikTok over national security concerns, now wants to keep it legal. “I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” he said in December, citing his belief that the app helped drive younger Americans to vote for him. Popular on Variety On Sunday, Trump told told reporters on Air Force One, “I’d like to see TikTok remain alive.” Regarding discussions about a sale of a stake in TikTok, he said, “We have a lot of potential buyers. There’s tremendous interest in TikTok,” adding, “The decision is gonna be my decision.” Who could end up owning a piece of TikTok? Oracle, which has an agreement to host TikTok’s U.S. user data, reportedly has been in discussions about a deal. Private-equity firm Blackstone has been mulling taking a “small stake” in the app, the New York Times reported, while others — including YouTube superstar MrBeast — have been in the mix among possible buyers. But there are wrinkles in clinching a deal. The TikTok divest-or-ban law expressly prohibits TikTok’s operation in the U.S. if it continues to use the content-recommendation algorithm controlled by ByteDance; meanwhile, the Chinese government has expressed opposition to any TikTok sale that includes the algorithm. “We see no way that the TikTok algorithm is sold as Beijing and ByteDance would view this as a non-starter in a deal,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a research note Tuesday. Last week, Trump suggested he would use U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports as a bargaining chip in trying to win approval for a TikTok deal. “Maybe I’ll give [China] a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,” he told reporters. One percentage point in tariffs with China “would probably be worth more than all of TikTok, as valuable as TikTok is,” the president added. Some observers believe if April 5 comes and goes without a TikTok deal nailed down, Trump would simply declare another extension. On Jan. 20, Trump issued an executive order deferring enforcement of the divest-or-ban law by 75 days — a move that the law’s supporters said had no legal basis. As directed by Trump, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly sent both Apple and Google letters that they wouldn’t be liable for hosting TikTok during the 75-day period, prompting both tech companies to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores. VIP+ Analysis: Meet the TikTok Rival That Gained Most From U.S. Ban — and It’s Not RedNote If there’s no deal by April 5, Trump would likely issue another order delaying the TikTok ban by “30 days or longer” to “fully iron out the complex deal structure,” according to Ives. The analyst said a point of deal negotiation would be ByteDance retaining minority ownership in TikTok “but potentially higher than the 20% threshold currently required by U.S. law.” Ives expects ByteDance will continue to control TikTok’s content algorithm. “We believe TikTok’s valuation is roughly $100 billion, but without the golden jewel algorithm the deal price/valuation is closer to $30 billion to $40 billion in our view,” he wrote. ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group, with 20% owned by its Chinese founders and 20% by employees (including U.S. employees). According to the U.S.’s divest-or-ban law that targets TikTok, ByteDance is prohibited from directly or indirectly owning more than 20% of TikTok. Amid the uncertainty about TikTok’s future in the U.S., the company has seen some senior execs exit. Those include Ole Obermann, global head of music business development, and Blake Chandlee, who oversaw ad sales and marketing as head of global business solutions. Meanwhile, TikTok last week hired Nathaniel Brown, formerly Warner Bros. Discovery’s head of corporate communications, as global corporate communications chief. It’s worth noting that ByteDance did, at one point, consider selling a large position in TikTok to U.S.-based companies. Back in 2020, after Trump ordered ByteDance to sell TikTok to U.S. entities, ByteDance reached a tentative deal with Oracle and Walmart, which under the proposed terms would have acquired a combined 20% stake in TikTok. But that was scrapped after Biden assumed office in 2021 and the new administration repealed Trump’s executive order pending further review.

Title: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is Challenging a 73-Year-Old Investing Principle

For over 70 years, professional investors have relied on an investment strategy known as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). Developed in the 1950s by Nobel Prize-winning economists Harry Markowitz and Bill Sharpe, MPT popularized the classic 60/40 portfolio—roughly 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds—as a way to diversify risk and maximize returns. But Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager, is now questioning that long-standing principle. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. As the global financial system evolves, Fink argues, a better formula to allocate assets should be something like a 50/30/20 portfolio: 50 percent stocks, 30 percent bonds and 20 percent private assets, such as infrastructure, real estate and equity in privately owned companies. Fink proposed this idea in his annual letter to investors published this week, dedicating a substantial section to private markets and calling for broader access to private assets for retail investors. Private assets encompass infrastructure projects like ports, bridges, and power grids, as well as companies that aren’t publicly traded. Historically, these investments have been the domain of governments, bank loans, and wealthy individuals who have to meet strict income or capital thresholds. While they carry higher risks, these investments also tend to offer greater returns. As more companies (especially rapidly-growing ones in Silicon Valley) stay private for longer and the demand for infrastructure surges, governments and banks are struggling to keep up. “Assets that will define the future…aren’t available to most investors,” Fink wrote. “As we enter our century’s second quarter, there’s a growing mismatch between the demand for investment and the capital available from traditional sources.” To help close this funding gap, BlackRock is channeling its clients into private market opportunities through a series of strategic acquisitions. BlackRock’s clients include institutional investors—like pension funds, university endowments and insurance companies—as well as retail investors who can own a piece of BlackRock’s portfolio through its mutual funds and iShare ETFs. In October 2024, BlackRock acquired Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), a firm owning and operating assets in energy, transportation, water and waste management, and digital infrastructure sectors. BlackRock is also in the process of acquiring Preqin, a leading data provider specializing in private markets, and HPS Investment Partners, an asset manager of private credit. Beyond access, another obstacle that discourages investors from entering private markets is a lack of transparency. “Investing in private markets feels a bit like buying a house in an unfamiliar neighborhood before Zillow existed, where finding accurate prices was difficult or impossible,” Fink wrote. “For decades, private markets have been among the most opaque corners of finance. Investors know these assets hold long-term value—but exactly how much value? That’s not always easy to determine,” he added. The answer to that questions lies in data—think how Zillow brings clarity on real estate and what Bloomberg terminals do for stocks and bonds. BlackRock aims to provide the same level of transparency to private markets through data providers like Preqin, which tracks 190,000 funds and 60,000 private asset managers globally. “Preqin effectively does for private markets what Zillow did for housing,” Fink wrote. “With clearer, more timely data, it becomes possible to index private markets just like we do now with the S&P 500,” the CEO added. “Once that happens, private markets will be accessible, simple markets. Easy to buy. Easy to track. And that means capital will flow more freely throughout the economy.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: BlackRock Plans for Texas ETF Amid Its Push Into Lone Star State

BlackRock Inc. is going even bigger in Texas. The world’s biggest asset manager applied for the iShares Texas Equity exchange-traded fund, according to a Friday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The planned ETF would be passively managed and invest in companies that are headquartered in Texas. It’s the latest in a charm offensive of sorts in the state for the investing giant and founder Larry Fink after the firm’s embrace of environmental, social and governance investing drew the ire of Republican lawmakers. BlackRock, alongside Citadel Securities, is also an early backer of the upstart Texas Stock Exchange, which aims to begin trading in 2026. While declining to comment on the ETF beyond the filing, a BlackRock spokesperson said there’s client demand for Texas exposure. “Our clients have expressed interest in accessing the Texas economy, which has a GDP of $2.6 trillion according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and would be the eighth largest economy in the world on a standalone basis,” a BlackRock spokesperson wrote in an email. Nasdaq announced earlier this month that it would open a regional headquarters in Dallas, stating that it has about 800 clients in Texas. About 200 companies listed on Nasdaq are headquartered in the Lone Star state. The New York Stock Exchange said in February that it would launch a fully electronic exchange in Dallas and reincorporate its NYSE Chicago operations in Texas. Fees and a ticker for the fund were not yet listed in the filing. While many asset managers — including BlackRock — control single-country equity funds, state-specific stock funds are far less common. The Texas Capital Texas Equity Index ETF (ticker TXS) and the Texas Capital Texas Small Cap Equity Index ETF (TXSS), which both launched in 2023, have amassed about $28 million and $12 million, respectively. “The rationale here is that Texas is a good environment for businesses, and a lot are moving there,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said. “Anybody can buy this if it starts to crush it, and if it starts to crush it, then the narrative will kick in.” Topics Texas

Title: Kevin Mayer Talks Candle Media, Tightening Content Market, YouTube, TikTok and Blackstone at Paley Dialogues Event

Hollywood content 'is becoming less and less relevant' to young consumers, a trend that creates a 'substantial secular challenge,' veteran executive says By Cynthia Littleton Business Editor Fiddling while Rome burns? Candle Media co-CEO Kevin Mayer asserted that Hollywood should be much more concerned about demographic shifts and changes in consumer behavior as the math doesn’t look good for the traditional TV and film business. Mayer spoke Monday evening at the Paley Dialogue session hosted by the Paley Center for Media at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. In the session moderated by Jenelle Riley, deputy awards and features editor for Variety, Mayer said the traditional entertainment industry needs to act with more urgency to find new ways to reach consumers. Since the dawn of the millennial generation, time spent with traditional TV shows and movies is falling by double digits every couple of decades, he asserted. Related Stories VIP+ New Ubisoft Subsidiary for ‘Assassin’s Creed’ Underscores Need for IP Preservation in Transmedia Era Indian Premier League 2025 Launch on JioStar Smashes Viewership Records “Not only is Hollywood becoming less and less relevant and less and less time spent on it, the time is spent is less profitable,” Mayer said, citing the economics of streaming content versus linear TV of old. “So there is a very substantial secular challenge that the industry is facing. There’s been some alarm, but maybe not quite enough.” Popular on Variety Mayer, who spent more than 15 years as a senior executive at Disney and then briefly served as CEO of TikTok’s U.S. operations in 2020, cited the dramatic shifts in the content marketplace that have emerged since the end of the pandemic and the double strikes that crippled the industry in 2023. Candle Media was created in 2021 by Mayer and his former Disney colleague Tom Staggs on the theory that high-end independent production would become more valuable in a world increasingly dominated by verticially integrated studios and streamers — like the operation he helped build at Disney. Mayer acknowledged that the sharp post-strikes contraction in content commissions by global giants has created some challenges for Candle. But the other foundational idea behind the company has proven to be very prescient given all the industry gyrations and the embrace by younger consumers of social-driven video platforms. “So it’s been much harder to sell content than the streamers now than it was three years ago when we launched,” Mayer said. “So that part of our thesis was pretty incorrect. The other part of the thesis was that there would be a flywheel that would evolve. And this is something that came from my TikTok days — that if you marry social media storytelling with traditional media storytelling, film and TV, on platforms where there’s an interactivity and you can interact with your audience and gain their trust and then sell them things, then commerce would be a big thing. And that is what we call content, community and commerce. That’s a flywheel that we felt would be a really powerful one. And that is definitively true today.” Candle’s early spree of acquisitions — including Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine and “Cocomelon” producer Moonbug Entertainment — were financed by coin from private equity giant Blackrock. Despite the shifting sands in the content marketplace, Mayer assured the crowd of industry insiders that Blackstone remains steadfast in its Candle investment. “We have an incredibly great private equity partner, Blackstone, which is the biggest alternative investment manager in the world by quite a big margin. They are super0supportive,” Mayer says. They’ve been with us through thick and thin. And when we find great acquisitions, they’re ready to go and support us quite well.” Mayer suggested that future acquisitions would be “on the Moonbug side,” presumably focused on digital native content with a strong social media component. Mayer and Riley spent a good deal of time talking about the importance of YouTube as a distribution platform. “YouTube has been slogging away for 20 years, and it’s the biggest out there,” Mayer said. Most important, he added, is that YouTube shells out real money to the most popular content creators. “They pay content creators now — no one else does that. You can make money on Instagram and TikTok by going directly to a marketer and cutting a deal with them for doing an influencer marketing campaign. But the player that actually directly pays in a meaningful way its creators is YouTube.” The conversational naturally wound its way around to AI and the impact of powerful new generative AI and machine learning tools on the craft and business of entertainment. Mayer said he absorbed enormous lessons after in four months at the helm of TikTok in the U.S. “TikTok really derives its value due to his AI recommendation,” he said. “It really is another form of AI which just understands your preferences and can react and get your recommendations. And that’s what Tiktok engine is. This algorithm is one big AI code that detects your most nuanced usage of the app and can tell you exactly what you love in a way that even you don’t even know.” His four-month run as CEO of TikTok USA and COO of parent company Bytedance was more turbulent than he could have imagined. It was clear after a short time that it was untenable during President Donald Trump’s first term. Four years later, however, Trump gave TikTok a stay of digital execution as he returned to the White House. He allowed the app to resume limited operations, after the Biden administration set a deadline for the app to be sold to an American-owned firm or go dark in the U.S., while stepping up efforts to find a buyer. “I was there for a short period of time because Trump was shutting us down and issued executive orders shutting down TikTok –it was very tough to be an American executive and be the head of that company. So I stepped away from that,” he said. “I don’t know for sure what’s going on there. Seems like it has a decent chance of sticking around. But the story about TikTok is almost as interesting as using TikTok itself.” A Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast The Business of Entertainment
