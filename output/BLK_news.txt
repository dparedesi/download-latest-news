Czechoslovak Group's shares rose as much as 32% in their Amsterdam debut, pushing its market capitalisation to more than €30 billion following a record fundraising for a defence company listing. CSG, seeking to tap into a surge in military spending, sold 30 million new shares and up to 122 million existing shares, including an over-allotment option, in an initial public offering priced at €25 each, raising up to €3.8 billion. Michael Strnad, the 33-year-old owner of the company, will net just under €3 billion in the deal, including the over-allotment, while the rest of the proceeds will go to the company, CSG said. The offering for up to 15.2% of the company gave CSG an initial market capitalisation of €25 billion. By 9.43 am on Friday, CSG's market value had risen to €31.6 billion with shares trading at €31.60, up 26.4%. They had climbed as high as €33.00 in early trading. Tapping into defence sector boom Investors are piling money into the sector and European governments pledge to ramp up defence spending following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. European defence stocks have touched record highs this year. Strnad told Reuters this month that one of the reasons for the listing was to use stock as potential acquisition currency. Recent acquisitions include its $2.2 billion purchase in 2024 of leading U.S. small ammunition maker Kinetic, owner of brands such as Remington. At current prices, CSG has a larger market capitalisation than Czech utility CEZ, the country's biggest listed company. CSG's key customers include Ukraine and it is one of the world's fastest‑growing defence companies, producing large- and small-calibre ammunition, heavy ground equipment and radar. Order books attracted swift demand If fully exercised, CSG's offering would be the largest Amsterdam listing since KKR Private Equity Investors raised $5 billion in 2006, according to Dealogic. Other large European defence groups, such as Franco-German tankmaker KNDS, are also set to list this year. Order books on the CSG offering were quickly covered on Tuesday, a bookrunner said. Funds managed by Artisan Partners, BlackRock and Al-Rayyan Holdings, a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority, have committed to cornerstone the deal with 300 million euros each. Led by Strnad, whose father began trading old Soviet-era military equipment in the 1990s, CSG has built up its order pipeline and said in November that revenue would rise to 7.4–7.6 billion euros this year, from the more than 6.4 billion expected for 2025. It targets a dividend payout of 30%-40% of net profit, payable from 2027. Source: Reuters © RTÉ 2026. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

Title: Fear meets resignation in Davos as Trump dominates WEF agenda

Saturday, 24 Jan 2026 U.S. President Donald Trump walks during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2026. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan ‌23 (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials rolled through the icy streets of Davos this week, fear and in some cases loathing ‌were mixed with resignation over the administration's way of doing business. While many people at the event told Reuters they thought some of Trump's positions ‌on global issues, such as demands that Europe spend more on its own security, had merit, they were deeply offended by the way he and his team presented them. "It was kind of overwhelming. It was the full Trump show we got here," said Conradin Cramer, head of the cantonal government of the Swiss city of Basel following Trump's address on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. "He was very ‍outspoken against Europe, against European values, and that was frightening for me," Cramer told Reuters. Business leaders were ‍also nervous, with two U.S.-based bankers admitting at the start they ‌were worried about a full-blown trade war developing that would hit business sentiment. WEF'S MOST EVENTFUL MEETING? Several participants said that by some measures, this was one of the most ‍eventful ​meetings in five decades of the WEF, which had labelled this year's event "A Spirit of Dialogue". Trump struck a Greenland deal on the sidelines with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and oversaw the signing of his new Board of Peace,drawing several world leaders to Davos. The president and other U.S. officials also said they were close ⁠to a peace deal in Ukraine, which came into focus on Thursday when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy ‌travelled to Davos. President Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev also held talks with U.S. officials on the sidelines, the first Russian official to come to Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Several participants told Reuters ⁠that the annual meeting -- the ‍first since WEF founder Klaus Schwab's departure last year -- had been a win for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A spokesperson said Schwab was not available for comment. Fink, who is also WEF co-chair, used his influence to attract big names including billionaire Elon Musk, who made his Davos debut as a last-minute addition to the agenda. Trump said Fink turned everything he touched to gold. Moderators in some sessions ‍appeared to avoid tough questions and the agenda largely skirted issues that the Trump administration has ‌opposed. The programme featured four sessions that referenced climate change, whereas in 2022 there were 16. Trump spoke for more than an hour, well over his allotted time on the agenda, and by the time he sat down for a moderated question-and-answer session a small but steady trickle of delegates were already leaving the room. TRUMP AGENDA LOOMS LARGE Several participants said that while Trump loomed large, business did get done at Davos, with executives meeting clients and customers and discussing issues ranging from geopolitics and trade to stablecoins and artificial intelligence. Francesco Ceccato, CEO of Barclays in Europe, said the meeting had a "mixture of geopolitics that can't be ignored". But there had also been "a lot of really interesting dialogue" around AI and related issues such as investment risk and energy needs, Ceccato told Reuters. The Trump agenda permeated many of the discussions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew sharp reactions when he slammed ‌Europe at a Fink-hosted dinner, which European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked out of. The next night at a Bank of America soiree, Lutnick held court with CEO Brian Moynihan, said a source familiar with the event at 'Goals House', where British finance minister Rachel Reeves played chess and Marcus Mumford performed live, including an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen's 'I'm on Fire'. As usual at the parties and meetings around ​Davos, attendees gossiped and traded rumours, although some triggered anxiety. Early on in the week, one circulated that mobile and internet networks would be shut down when Trump arrived in town. As it turned out, both phones and internet worked fine.

Title: Bitcoin regret is coming for anyone ignoring Coinbase CEO’s 5% rule as banks fight to cap gains

Advisors are building caps, rebalancing rules, and drawdown math while crypto execs sell regret avoidance as the new thesis. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told Bloomberg at Davos that investors who don't have at least 5% of their net worth in Bitcoin will “probably be pretty sad” by 2030. Recently, Morgan Stanley's wealth management division published portfolio guidelines capping crypto exposure at 4% maximum for even its most aggressive growth models. Both used “5%” as their anchor. Neither meant the same thing. The post-ETF era didn't just mainstream Bitcoin ownership, it turned position sizing into the new battleground. Financial advisors, wealth managers, and compliance officers now treat roughly 5% as a responsible ceiling for a volatile satellite holding. Meanwhile, crypto executives are trying to reframe that same number as a minimum effective dose. The collision isn't about whether to own Bitcoin. It's about whether 5% means “cap your risk” or “don't miss out.” Multiple mainstream wealth platforms converged on allocation bands clustered under 5% over the past year, driven not by ideology but by portfolio math. Fidelity Institutional's advisor-facing research suggests allocations of 2% to 5%, extending to 7.5% for younger investors under optimistic adoption scenarios. The framing centers on downside containment, as Bitcoin's structural volatility demands position sizing that won't blow up a portfolio during drawdowns. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management's October 2025 report gets more granular. It recommends maximum crypto allocations by model: 0% for conservation and income portfolios, 2% for balanced growth, 3% for market growth, and 4% for opportunistic growth. The rationale is explicit risk management, with roughly 55% annualized volatility and potential 70% maximum drawdowns at the 95th percentile. The firm emphasizes quarterly rebalancing to prevent positions from “swelling” silently as Bitcoin rallies, turning a controlled 3% sleeve into an accidental 8% overweight. Bank of America's chief investment officer said in December 2025 that a modest allocation of 1% to 4% in digital assets “could be appropriate” for investors comfortable with elevated volatility. A $4.6T wealth machine is turning “execution only” into real advice, and it starts with a tiny-sounding sleeve. BlackRock recommended up to 2% in late 2024, warning that above that threshold “Bitcoin's share of total portfolio risk becomes outsized,” a textbook risk-budget argument. The common thread: Bitcoin gets a seat at the table, but only as much as volatility math permits. The Bitwise and VettaFi 2026 Benchmark Survey, fielded from October through December 2025, shows how this plays out in practice. Among client portfolios with crypto exposure, 83% are allocated to less than 5%. The modal band sits at 2% to 4.99%, capturing 47% of advisors. The industry didn't coordinate on this range through central planning. It emerged from parallel risk calculations across wealth platforms, aimed at defending Bitcoin positions, to compliance committees and nervous clients after drawdowns. Armstrong's exact phrasing matters. He didn't say “5% of your portfolio.” He said, “5% of their net worth.” For many households, those denominators tell wildly different stories. The Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances documents that the balance sheet of families in the middle of the net worth distribution is “dominated by housing,” meaning net worth includes large illiquid buckets that never touch brokerage accounts. Consider illustrative math for a household with $2 million in net worth. If investable assets total $800,000, then 5% of net worth equals $100,000, which translates to 12.5% of the liquid portfolio. If investables are $500,000, then the same $100,000 is 20% of the portfolio. At $300,000 in investables, it's 33%. The “quiet implication” of framing Bitcoin as a net worth floor is that it can easily translate into double-digit liquid exposure, far beyond the caps wealth managers are building into their models. This isn't a technicality. It's the difference between “responsible satellite allocation” and “concentrated bet.” Advisors constrained by suitability reviews and model portfolio guardrails can't casually recommend liquid Bitcoin positions of 15% to 25%. However, that's precisely where “5% of net worth” lands for households whose wealth is tied up in real estate, retirement accounts with limited crypto access, or business equity. Advisors are funding crypto by cutting equities and cash, not “play money,” signaling a risk-managed allocation shift. The 5% debate didn't heat up randomly. It emerged because the market structure shifted and the industry moved from “should I?” to “how much?” Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals in early 2024 opened access for registered investment advisors and clients who couldn't or wouldn't touch crypto through exchanges or custody solutions. Fidelity explicitly frames the 2024 products as unlocking advisor-client conversations that compliance risk previously shut down. Bank of America's move to have advisors switch from execution-only to recommendation status marks a regime change. Bitcoin went from “we'll let you buy it” to “here's how much we think makes sense.” Institutions build risk budgets, not narratives. Morgan Stanley's emphasis on volatility simulations, drawdown scenarios, and rebalancing schedules reflects career-risk management. The pain for a wealth advisor isn't being wrong about Bitcoin. It's being wrong loudly: allocating 10% to a client portfolio, watching it crash 60%, and trying to explain to compliance why the position exceeded model guidelines. Caps and rebalancing rules are defensive scaffolding that let advisors participate without getting blamed if things go sideways. Meanwhile, executives are selling inevitability. Armstrong's Davos framing is a regret-minimization pitch, not a risk-budget pitch. The subtext: Bitcoin's upside is so asymmetric that the risk of owning too little outweighs the risk of owning too much. That gap widens when institutions finally open the pipes, because the narrative can claim, “The last excuse is gone.” If Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, and BlackRock all offer Bitcoin access, then “I couldn't access it” ceases to be a defense for zero exposure. Armstrong's $1 million by 2030 projection illustrates the math behind aggressive sizing. Bitcoin traded around $89,346.09 as of press time. Reaching $1 million by the end of 2030 implies roughly 63% compound annual growth from here, an 11.2x total return. High upside scenarios mathematically require accepting high variance, which is exactly why chief investment officers talk in caps and rebalancing rules. The gap between 2% ceilings and 5% net worth floors is a gap between institutions managing downside and individuals chasing upside. While gold flirts with $4,900, the BTC/Gold ratio has entered a "trapdoor" that historically precedes a monster mean reversion. As banks and platforms legitimize access through recommended ETF sleeves rather than execution-only workarounds, policy shifts from permissioning to prudence. Morgan Stanley's October report is essentially a blueprint for where “responsible Bitcoin” discourse is heading: volatility-adjusted position limits, model-portfolio integration with explicit caps, and mandatory rebalancing to prevent silent overconcentration. The firm treats crypto like any other high-vol satellite, such as emerging markets equities, commodities, and alternatives, where the default assumption is that unmanaged positions will drift into risk-budget violations. The industry is converging on a sub-5% portfolio norm at the exact moment executives are trying to raise the minimum to 5%. That tension defines the post-ETF era. Distribution is mainstreaming, so the argument moved from ownership to sizing. Advisors can finally add Bitcoin to client portfolios without triggering compliance red flags, but they're doing so with guardrails that crypto maximalists consider cowardly. The denominator problem makes the collision messier. When an executive says “5% of net worth” and an advisor hears “5% of portfolio,” they're describing positions that can differ by a factor of two or three for typical households. The advisor is thinking about risk contribution and drawdown scenarios. The executive is thinking upside capture and regret avoidance. Both are using the same number. Neither is wrong. But they're solving for completely different objectives. The outcome isn't that one side wins. It's that “5%” becomes a Rorschach test, a point of coordination that means whatever the speaker needs it to mean. As major funds dump holdings, a thin order book means every dollar of selling is now significantly more destructive. For wealth managers building model portfolios, it's a ceiling that keeps crypto exposure from dominating total risk. For crypto advocates pitching inevitability, it's a floor that separates the prepared from the regretful. The meme works because it's vague enough to let both sides claim victory while talking past each other. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry. His expertise primarily focuses on the Brazilian blockchain ecosystem and developments in decentralized finance (DeFi). Also known as "Akiba," Liam Wright is the Editor-in-Chief at CryptoSlate and host of the SlateCast. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Switch categories to dive deeper or gain broader context. Perpetual futures now dominate Bitcoin’s short-term price discovery, and the recent flush showed how quickly crowded longs turn into forced selling. Parity is the target. Why the British Pound could finally collapse against the US dollar after this inflation spike. With IBIT near $70B and G-SIB broker-dealers acting as authorized participants, margin and liquidity shocks get harder to dismiss.

Title: The Book That Explains the Heritage Foundation Meltdown

Conservatism Stephanie Slade | 1.23.2026 10:35 AM On a Thursday night in December, I got a breathless call from a Heritage Foundation senior scholar. John Malcolm and Jessica Reinsch, the director and a deputy director of the think tank's Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, had just been summarily fired. A Heritage spokesman would later accuse Reinsch and Malcolm of conduct inconsistent with the organization's mission and standards and breach of fiduciary duty. Sources close to the situation say they were actually dismissed after their superiors learned they were about to take jobs elsewhere—and realized that they may not be the only ones. A few days later, the bulk of the think tank's economic and legal/constitutional studies teams decamped en masse for Advancing American Freedom (AAF), a nonprofit founded by former Vice President Mike Pence. More resignations would follow. But according to my source on that December night, Heritage President Kevin Roberts and his lieutenants had a message for those who stayed behind: "​​They've been going around the building telling everyone that our whole purpose now is to support and do everything Kevin Roberts wants." While the proximate cause of the ongoing staff exodus is a video Roberts recorded in October defending Tucker Carlson's decision to amplify the white-nationalist influencer Nick Fuentes, the turmoil at Heritage has been brewing for far longer. In fact, Reason has learned, Heritage leadership has been directing employees to read Roberts' 2024 book, which agitates for a "Second American Revolution," and to leave if they can't agree with the positions therein. Scores of board members, employees, and visiting fellows have opted to depart, variously citing antisemitism, misogyny, retaliation against employees who dare to speak up, and an institutional pivot away from free market principles. In conversations with more than a dozen current and former staffers, I repeatedly heard that Roberts' belief that he alone should get to determine all of the think tank's stances has provoked resentment among his own subject matter experts. "The issue is you have the president of an organization committing everybody in it to his position unilaterally," one senior staff member told me in November. "Because Heritage has a one-voice policy, when the president goes out and says Heritage Foundation has this position"—be it support for tariffs or support for Tucker Carlson—"he implicates everybody down the chain, and he makes everybody stand for that." * * * A Heritage statement responding to last month's mass flight to AAF begins with "Our mission is unchanged." Likewise, in a January 1 letter printed in The Wall Street Journal, Heritage Vice President Roger Severino insisted that the think tank has changed tactics but not principles. Multiple recently departed staff members confirm that they were told by superiors to look not to Heritage's official mission statement ("to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense") but to Roberts' book in order to understand the think tank's de facto new direction. The perception was that if they couldn't get behind the ideas in the book, Heritage was not the place for them. "Parts of the building were basically holding Bible studies with it," one former senior scholar quipped. There's nothing controversial about the head of a think tank enumerating his or her views, and indeed, it's a timeworn tradition on the American right for would-be thought leaders to publish books that attempt to define and defend conservatism. But the situation in Roberts' case is complicated by two factors: the aforementioned one-voice policy at Heritage and the contents of this particular book. Dawn's Early Light is a fairly explicit attempt to chart an alternative course for movement conservatism. "If you've read a lot of conservative books or think you have a good sense of the conservative movement," writes then–Sen. J.D. Vance (R–Ohio) in the foreword, "I suspect the pages that follow will be surprising—even jarring." Those pages are replete with scornful references to "wax-museum conservatives" who "don't know what time it is," by which Roberts clearly means the kind of staid Reaganite wonks who care more about hewing to conservative principle than owning the libs—the kind of people, in other words, who have historically populated the institution he leads. Fire and flames are a recurring motif in the book (the original subtitle of which was "Burning Down Washington To Save America" until the publisher apparently thought better of it). The first chapter features a long list of "decadent and rootless" American institutions that Roberts says need to be burned to the ground, including the FBI, The New York Times, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, BlackRock, the Loudoun County Public School System, and the Boy Scouts of America. "We're going to (metaphorically) burn down the LA district attorneys office," he says at one point. "We need to (metaphorically) burn down the selective educational institutions that have such a grip on the formation of our elites," he says at another. "​​If an American institution is incompatible with or contemptuous of public prayer," he says in a third place, Roberts "would be hard pressed to believe that it should not simply be burned down for the common good." This inflammatory (pun intended!) imagery is in keeping with Roberts' open embrace of populism and sympathy for the highly aggrieved "New Right." It's also an awkward fit for a conservative movement that has long counseled respect for inherited institutions and expounded the Chestertonian notion that civilizations are hard to build and easy to destroy. But this book was written to be a postliberal broadside in the culture war. It is polemic, not scholarship. * * * To be clear, not everything in Dawn's Early Light is a departure from the past. There's plenty of standard-fare conservatism (China hawkery, support for secure borders, and making English the national language). From a civil libertarian perspective, Roberts' antipathy toward the federal bureaucracy and especially the surveillance state is even rather salutary. But there are also a number of record-scratch moments, particularly when it comes to his discussion of economics. In theory, free enterprise and limited government are core Heritage principles, and the think tank was historically a staunch defender of free trade. Roberts' book, on the other hand, comes out swinging against globalization, in which "US firms sought to make profits all over the world by expanding into new markets, sending factories overseas, running money through international tax havens, developing global supply chains, and employing other new strategies," and calls for using "the immense powers of our federal and state governments" for protectionist ends. It also asserts more than once that President Donald Trump "won" the trade war during his first term. Roberts is equally hostile to the modern financialized "sham economy," which he says is guilty of "funneling money to the parasitical enemies of the American way of life." In his view, the goal of the conservative movement should be to return to an economic system that would allow more men to support families on a single income, and he hopes to "restore the proper use of the government" to bring about his favored outcomes. He's comfortable with trade barriers, industrial policy, and the aggressive use of antitrust regulations "to rein in globalist corporatism," he writes. "Especially when it comes to Big Tech and big banks, we need to consider the nuclear option." The book acknowledges that all of this would require "short-tem sacrifices, including higher prices for some consumer goods," but insists the pain will be worth it. To reiterate, these positions are more closely aligned with the New Right than with old-school American conservatism. And that's not only the case with respect to economics. Roberts' foreign policy views are also seen by many former staffers as antithetical to the long-standing posture of the think tank he heads. This is not the first time Roberts has seemed to commit his institution wholesale to a set of ideas that are more at odds than not with the traditional American right. In 2022, he gave a speech at the National Conservatism Conference in Miami in which he startled observers by declaring that he was there "not to invite national conservatives to join our conservative movement but to acknowledge the plain truth that Heritage is already part of yours." Dismayed by the natcons' will-to-power political approach, a person of my acquaintance (who had been hired by Roberts) left a job at Heritage shortly after that speech. Many have followed in the years since, often for similar reasons. * * * All of this would arguably matter less if not for the think tank's practice of barring employees from publicly dissenting from the Heritage party line. "Speaking with one voice is a distinguishing piece of The Heritage Foundation's strategic advantage," its website proclaims. "While other organizations may have experts advocating contradictory points of view, Heritage employees are always rowing in the same direction." The so-called one-voice policy, which dates back to Heritage cofounder Ed Feulner's time at the helm, "has always—for 49 years—been difficult to implement," Roberts told The Dispatch in 2022. "The difficulty is making sure that there is a conversation internally that gets us to a good spot." Over and over again in my conversations with current and former staffers, I heard that intellectual collaboration under Roberts' predecessors has been supplanted by decrees handed down, literally, from the president's office on the eighth floor. "When Ed Feulner was there, we debated these things, and that's how we came to a one-voice policy," a senior policy staffer (who has since resigned) told me in November. "Under Kevin Roberts, it's just whatever Kevin Roberts and his minions decide, without any consultation from the scholars." "Kevin Roberts, in my opinion, has subverted the one-voice policy," another scholar who left last year told me in December. Ideally, "the one-voice policy at Heritage is that everybody gets together, all the substantive experts on an issue, and they hash it out. They come up with their own internal view, and then people agree that they won't, using a Heritage byline, go out and disagree with that position. What Kevin did differently was, basically, that he constrained the Heritage position to not be contrary to what the Trump administration wanted to hear." Lending a certain plausibility to this claim is that Roberts himself announced in a 2024 interview with The New York Times that he sees "institutionalizing Trumpism" as the think tank's role. (A Heritage spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this story.) "I can directly testify to being told that Dr. Roberts has special knowledge that no one else has," which should influence policy conclusions, a former research staffer told me in December. "That's cult-of-personality stuff. That's not what a think tank's supposed to be….There were instances where it was communicated to us in no uncertain terms, either fall in line or here's what happens to people that don't: They end up gone." Faced with such an ultimatum, more and more Heritage staffers have chosen to go elsewhere. The wax-museum conservatives are calling Kevin Roberts' bluff. Start your day with Reason.

Title: Fear meets resignation in Davos as Trump dominates WEF agenda

By Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham and Dmitry Zhdannikov DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - As President Donald Trump and other top U.S. officials rolled through the icy streets of Davos this week, fear and in some cases loathing were mixed with resignation over the administration’s way of doing business. While many people at the event told Reuters they thought some of Trump’s positions on global issues, such as demands that Europe spend more on its own security, had merit, they were deeply offended by the way he and his team presented them. “It was kind of overwhelming. It was the full Trump show we got here,” said Conradin Cramer, head of the cantonal government of the Swiss city of Basel following Trump’s address on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting. “He was very outspoken against Europe, against European values, and that was frightening for me,” Cramer told Reuters. Business leaders were also nervous, with two U.S.-based bankers admitting at the start they were worried about a full-blown trade war developing that would hit business sentiment. WEF’S MOST EVENTFUL MEETING? Several participants said that by some measures, this was one of the most eventful meetings in five decades of the WEF, which had labelled this year’s event “A Spirit of Dialogue”. Trump struck a Greenland deal on the sidelines with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and oversaw the signing of his new Board of Peace, drawing several world leaders to Davos. The president and other U.S. officials also said they were close to a peace deal in Ukraine, which came into focus on Thursday when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Davos. President Vladimir Putin’s envoy Kirill Dmitriev also held talks with U.S. officials on the sidelines, the first Russian official to come to Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Several participants told Reuters that the annual meeting — the first since WEF founder Klaus Schwab’s departure last year — had been a win for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. A spokesperson said Schwab was not available for comment. Fink, who is also WEF co-chair, used his influence to attract big names including billionaire Elon Musk, who made his Davos debut as a last-minute addition to the agenda. Trump said Fink turned everything he touched to gold. Moderators in some sessions appeared to avoid tough questions and the agenda largely skirted issues that the Trump administration has opposed. The programme featured four sessions that referenced climate change, whereas in 2022 there were 16. Trump spoke for more than an hour, well over his allotted time on the agenda, and by the time he sat down for a moderated question-and-answer session a small but steady trickle of delegates were already leaving the room. TRUMP AGENDA LOOMS LARGE Several participants said that while Trump loomed large, business did get done at Davos, with executives meeting clients and customers and discussing issues ranging from geopolitics and trade to stablecoins and artificial intelligence. Francesco Ceccato, CEO of Barclays in Europe, said the meeting had a “mixture of geopolitics that can’t be ignored”. But there had also been “a lot of really interesting dialogue” around AI and related issues such as investment risk and energy needs, Ceccato told Reuters. The Trump agenda permeated many of the discussions. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew sharp reactions when he slammed Europe at a Fink-hosted dinner, which European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked out of. The next night at a Bank of America soiree, Lutnick held court with CEO Brian Moynihan, said a source familiar with the event at ‘Goals House’, where British finance minister Rachel Reeves played chess and Marcus Mumford performed live, including an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen’s ‘I’m on Fire’. As usual at the parties and meetings around Davos, attendees gossiped and traded rumours, although some triggered anxiety. Early on in the week, one circulated that mobile and internet networks would be shut down when Trump arrived in town. As it turned out, both phones and internet worked fine. (Reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham, Samia Nakhoul, Dmitry Zhdannikov, Oliver Hirt, Arianne Luthi, Vitalii Yalahuzian, Divya Chowdhury, Mark John and John Revill; Editing by Alexander Smith) Di Paritosh Bansal, Dave Graham e Dmitry Zhdannikov DAVOS, Svizzera, 23 gennaio (Reuters) - Mentre il presidente Donald Trump e altri alti funzionari statunitensi percorrevano le strade ghiacciate di Davos questa settimana, la paura e in alcuni casi il disgusto si mescolavano alla rassegnazione per il modo di fare affari dell’amministrazione. Mentre molte persone presenti all’evento hanno detto a Reuters di ritenere che alcune delle posizioni di Trump su questioni globali, come la richiesta che l’Europa spenda di più per la propria sicurezza, abbiano un merito, sono rimaste profondamente offese dal modo in cui lui e il suo team le hanno presentate. “È stato un po’ travolgente. È stato un vero e proprio show di Trump”, ha detto Conradin Cramer, capo del governo cantonale della città svizzera di Basilea, dopo il discorso di Trump di mercoledì all’incontro annuale del World Economic Forum. “È stato molto esplicito contro l’Europa, contro i valori europei, e questo mi ha spaventato”, ha detto Cramer alla Reuters. Anche i leader del mondo degli affari erano nervosi, con due banchieri statunitensi che hanno ammesso all’inizio dell’incontro che Trump e il suo team hanno presentato.Due banchieri statunitensi hanno ammesso all’inizio di essere preoccupati per lo sviluppo di una vera e propria guerra commerciale che avrebbe colpito il sentiment delle imprese. L’INCONTRO PIÙ EVENTUALE DELWEF? Diversi partecipanti hanno detto che, secondo alcune misure, questo è stato uno degli incontri più movimentati in cinque decenni di WEF, che ha etichettato l’evento di quest’anno “Uno spirito di dialogo”. Trump ha stretto un accordo sulla Groenlandia a margine con il Segretario Generale della NATO Mark Rutte e ha presieduto alla firma del suo nuovo Consiglio di Pace, attirando a Davos diversi leader mondiali. Il presidente e altri funzionari statunitensi hanno anche detto di essere vicini a un accordo con il governo degli Stati Uniti. Il presidente e altri funzionari statunitensi hanno inoltre dichiarato di essere vicini a un accordo di pace in Ucraina, che è stato messo a fuoco giovedì quando il presidente Volodymyr Zelenskiy si è recato a Davos. Anche l’inviato del presidente Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, ha avuto colloqui con funzionari statunitensi a margine, primo funzionario russo a venire a Davos da quando la Russia ha invaso l’Ucraina nel 2022. Diversi partecipanti hanno detto a Reuters che l’incontro annuale - il primo dopo la partenza del fondatore del WEF Klaus Schwab lo scorso anno - è stato una vittoria per il CEO di BlackRock Larry Fink. Un portavoce ha detto che Schwab non era disponibile per un commento. Fink, che è anche co-presidente del WEF, ha usato la sua influenza per attirare grandi nomi, tra cui il miliardario Elon Musk, che ha fatto il suo debutto a Davos come aggiunta dell’ultimo minuto all’ordine del giorno. Trump ha detto che Fink ha trasformato in oro tutto ciò che ha toccato. I moderatori in alcune sessioni sono sembrati evitare le domande difficili e l’ordine del giorno ha costeggiato in gran parte le questioni che l’amministrazione Trump ha contrastato. Il programma prevedeva quattro sessioni che facevano riferimento al cambiamento climatico, mentre nel 2022 erano 16. Trump ha parlato per più di un’ora, ben oltre il tempo assegnatogli dall’agenda, e quando si è seduto per una sessione moderata di domande e risposte un piccolo ma costante flusso di delegati stava già lasciando la sala. L’AGENDA DI TRUMP SI ALLARGA Diversi partecipanti hanno detto che, nonostante Trump incombesse, a Davos gli affari si sono svolti, con i dirigenti che hanno incontrato clienti e committenti e discusso di questioni che vanno dalla geopolitica e dal commercio alle monete stabili e all’intelligenza artificiale. Francesco Ceccato, CEO di Barclays in Europa, ha detto che l’incontro ha avuto un “mix di geopolitica che non può essere ignorato”. Ma c’è stato anche “un sacco di dialogo davvero interessante” intorno all’IA e a questioni correlate come il rischio di investimento e il fabbisogno energetico, ha detto Ceccato a Reuters. L’agenda di Trump ha permeato molte delle discussioni. Il Segretario al Commercio degli Stati Uniti Howard Lutnick ha suscitato aspre reazioni quando ha attaccato l’Europa durante una cena organizzata da Fink, dalla quale la Presidente della Banca Centrale Europea Christine Lagarde è uscita. La sera successiva, a una cena della Bank of America, Lutnick si è intrattenuto con l’amministratore delegato Brian Moynihan, ha dichiarato una fonte che ha familiarità con l’evento alla “Goals House”, dove il ministro delle Finanze britannico Rachel Reeves ha giocato a scacchi e Marcus Mumford si è esibito dal vivo, con una versione acustica di “I’m on Fire” di Bruce Springsteen. Come di consueto alle feste e agli incontri intorno a Davos, i partecipanti hanno spettegolato e scambiato voci, anche se alcune hanno scatenato l’ansia. All’inizio della settimana è circolata una voce secondo cui le reti di telefonia mobile e internet sarebbero state interrotte all’arrivo di Trump in città. Come poi si è scoperto, sia i telefoni che internet hanno funzionato bene.

Title: Intel stock crashes hard today: why did Intel stock plunge 16% after Q4 2025 earnings despite beating estimates – has INTC collapsed before a potential comeback?

Intel stock ($INTC) suffered a massive 16.20% crash today. The decline wiped out over $30 billion in market value. This happened despite Intel beating Q4 2025 estimates with $13.7 billion in revenue. The company also posted a surprise non-GAAP EPS of $0.15. The real damage came from a weak Q1 2026 outlook. Intel expects revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion. This midpoint is far below the $12.5 billion analysts wanted. Investors were also spooked by a projected breakeven profit for the next quarter.

Title: Ukraine needs energy ceasefire as catastrophe looming, top power executive says

Friday, 23 Jan 2026 FILE PHOTO: Water vapour rises from residential buildings' autonomous heating systems during a power blackout and freezing temperatures, after critical civil infrastructure was hit by recent Russian missile and drone attacks, amid Russia's attack on Ukraine, in Kyiv, Ukraine January 19, 2026. REUTERS/Vladyslav Sodel/File Photo DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine is ‌nearing a "humanitarian catastrophe" after months of Russian airstrikes on energy systems and any future ‌peace deal must include a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure, the head of ‌Ukraine’s largest private power producer said. Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, said Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago - had been waging an "energy terror" campaign since October 2025, hitting power stations and overwhelming air‑defence systems. The capital ‍Kyiv and surrounding regions are among the most affected, authorities ‍say, and Kyiv's mayor urged residents to ‌leave temporarily if they have somewhere else to go. "We need an energy ceasefire. A ceasefire on ‍the ​energy assets,” Timchenko said. “How can you talk about peace and (keep) attacking people, and knowing that people are freezing? How can these things go in parallel?” Ukraine has endured two weeks of ⁠temperatures between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees Celsius, he ‌said, with Russia striking gas transportation, storage and production facilities. Russia says it is targeting military and energy infrastructure used ⁠in the interests of ‍Ukraine's armed forces. "We are close to a humanitarian catastrophe," Timchenko said. "People get power for 3-4 hours, then a 10- to 15-hour break. We have apartment blocks without heat for weeks already." He said Ukraine was holding on ‍thanks to gas imports, including from the United States, ‌as attacks had forced gas, coal and hydropower plants to run below capacity. DTEK has lost 60–70% of its generating capacity and suffered damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he said. Timchenko said rebuilding the energy sector would cost $65–70 billion, citing World Bank estimates, and in many cases would require entirely new assets. "We are talking rather about building a new energy system in Ukraine rather than just reconstruction," he said. U.S. asset manager BlackRock has emerged in recent days as the main force behind a U.S.-Ukrainian ‌plan to help design a reconstruction plan for the country. Ukraine must accelerate construction of decentralised generation, said Timchenko, including new solar projects, green parks and storage. Decentralisation means the assets will be more difficult to hit by drones and ​missiles, he said. "We cannot count on a peace deal being signed. We need to start preparing today," he said, adding that Ukraine must stock critical equipment and strengthen air defences.

Title: Trump steals show in Davos with mixed bag of rhetoric, results at elite gathering

US President Donald Trump made a significant impact at the World Economic Forum in Davos. His visit drew attention away from business topics like AI and renewable energy. Trump's foreign policy discussions and his proposed 'Board of Peace' initiative were central. He also reversed a decision on tariffs.

Title: Blackrock boss working on $800 billion plan for Ukraine’s economy – Witkoff

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has joined US President Donald Trump’s Ukraine team as a “prosperity adviser,” US envoy Steve Witkoff has announced. After a similar project failed last year, Fink will once more be tasked with pulling Western capital into Ukraine. Speaking at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos on Thursday, Witkoff described Fink as “the best-in-class prosperity adviser,” adding that he “was good enough to volunteer for the job.” Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky has spoken repeatedly about developing a “prosperity plan,” aimed at attracting $800 billion in foreign investment to Ukraine after a peace agreement with Russia is reached. While Ukrainian officials met with BlackRock executives to discuss this plan last month, it was unclear from reports about the closed-door meeting what level of involvement the firm would take in implementing it. BlackRock is the world’s largest investment firm, managing more than $12 trillion in assets. BlackRock owns substantial shares in military-industrial giants such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman, whose weapons have seen extensive use by Kiev’s forces in the Ukraine conflict. The firm began work on a Ukraine ‘reconstruction fund’ in 2023, and had trouble attracting investors. According to the New York Times, the firm originally aimed to get $50 billion to $80 billion in investments, before cutting this target down to $15 billion. The fund was shelved indefinitely last year “due to a lack of interest amid increased uncertainty over Ukraine’s future,” Bloomberg reported. Ukrainian officials met with Fink in Davos on Thursday. According to Ukrainian National Security Council chief Rustem Umerov, the meeting was also attended by EU officials and representatives of major US investment firms, including Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. However, investors still face the same uncertainty that led to BlackRock abandoning its original reconstruction fund: Moscow and Kiev are still at odds over the terms of a peace deal, Ukraine has suffered an unknown number of military casualties, Kiev is still entirely dependent on foreign aid to keep its government functioning, and stories of endemic corruption within Zelensky’s circles have dominated headlines recently. US President Donald Trump has described US investment in Ukraine as vital to recover the massive financial aid provided to Kiev by President Joe Biden’s administration. Earlier this month, Trump told Fox News that his efforts to negotiate a peace deal are contingent on the US securing extraction rights for Ukraine’s rare earth minerals. ”I said that if we want to move forward, we need rare earth metals,” he told Fox News. “We want our money back.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2026.

Title: Ukraine needs energy ceasefire as catastrophe looming, top power executive says

DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ukraine is nearing a “humanitarian catastrophe” after months of Russian airstrikes on energy systems and any future peace deal must include a halt to attacks on energy infrastructure, the head of Ukraine’s largest private power producer said. Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, said Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago - had been waging an “energy terror” campaign since October 2025, hitting power stations and overwhelming air‑defence systems. The capital Kyiv and surrounding regions are among the most affected, authorities say, and Kyiv’s mayor urged residents to leave temporarily if they have somewhere else to go. “We need an energy ceasefire. A ceasefire on the energy assets,” Timchenko said. “How can you talk about peace and (keep) attacking people, and knowing that people are freezing? How can these things go in parallel?” Ukraine has endured two weeks of temperatures between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees Celsius, he said, with Russia striking gas transportation, storage and production facilities. Russia says it is targeting military and energy infrastructure used in the interests of Ukraine’s armed forces. “We are close to a humanitarian catastrophe,” Timchenko said. “People get power for 3-4 hours, then a 10- to 15-hour break. We have apartment blocks without heat for weeks already.” He said Ukraine was holding on thanks to gas imports, including from the United States, as attacks had forced gas, coal and hydropower plants to run below capacity. DTEK has lost 60–70% of its generating capacity and suffered damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he said. Timchenko said rebuilding the energy sector would cost $65–70 billion, citing World Bank estimates, and in many cases would require entirely new assets. “We are talking rather about building a new energy system in Ukraine rather than just reconstruction,” he said. U.S. asset manager BlackRock has emerged in recent days as the main force behind a U.S.-Ukrainian plan to help design a reconstruction plan for the country. Ukraine must accelerate construction of decentralised generation, said Timchenko, including new solar projects, green parks and storage. Decentralisation means the assets will be more difficult to hit by drones and missiles, he said. “We cannot count on a peace deal being signed. We need to start preparing today,” he said, adding that Ukraine must stock critical equipment and strengthen air defences. (Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Mark Heinrich) DAVOS, Svizzera, 23 gennaio (Reuters) - L’Ucraina si sta avvicinando a una “catastrofe umanitaria” dopo mesi di attacchi aerei russi contro i sistemi energetici e qualsiasi futuro accordo di pace deve includere la cessazione degli attacchi alle infrastrutture energetiche, ha detto il capo del più grande produttore privato di energia elettrica dell’Ucraina. Maxim Timchenko, amministratore delegato di DTEK, ha dichiarato che la Russia - che ha lanciato un’invasione su larga scala dell’Ucraina quasi quattro anni fa - sta conducendo una campagna di “terrore energetico” dall’ottobre 2025, colpendo le centrali elettriche e travolgendo i sistemi di difesa aerea. La capitale Kiev e le regioni circostanti sono tra le più colpite, dicono le autorità, e il sindaco di Kiev ha esortato i residenti ad andarsene temporaneamente se hanno un altro posto dove andare. “Abbiamo bisogno di un cessate il fuoco sull’energia. Un cessate il fuoco sugli asset energetici”, ha detto Timchenko. “Come si può parlare di pace e continuare ad attaccare la gente, sapendo che la gente sta congelando? Come possono queste cose andare in parallelo?” L’Ucraina ha sopportato due settimane di temperature tra i meno 15 e i meno 20 gradi Celsius, ha detto, con la Russia che ha colpito le strutture di trasporto, stoccaggio e produzione del gas. La Russia afferma di aver preso di mira le infrastrutture militari ed energetiche utilizzate nell’interesse delle forze armate ucraine. “Siamo vicini a una catastrofe umanitaria”, ha detto Timchenko. “La gente riceve la corrente per 3-4 ore, poi una pausa di 10-15 ore. Ci sono condomini senza riscaldamento già da settimane”. Ha detto che l’Ucraina sta resistendo grazie alle importazioni di gas, anche dagli Stati Uniti, mentre gli attacchi hanno costretto le centrali a gas, carbone e idroelettriche a funzionare al di sotto della loro capacità. DTEK ha perso il 60-70% della sua capacità di generazione e ha subito danni per centinaia di milioni di dollari. Timchenko ha detto che la ricostruzione del settore energetico costerebbe 65-70 miliardi di dollari, citando le stime della Banca Mondiale, e in molti casi richiederebbe impianti completamente nuovi. “Stiamo parlando piuttosto di costruire un nuovo sistema energetico in Ucraina piuttosto che di una semplice ricostruzione”, ha dichiarato. Il gestore di patrimoni statunitense BlackRock è emerso negli ultimi giorni come la forza principale dietro un piano statunitense-ucraino per contribuire alla progettazione di un piano di ricostruzione per il Paese. L’Ucraina deve accelerare la costruzione di generazione decentralizzata, ha detto Timchenko, compresi nuovi progetti solari, parchi verdi e stoccaggio. Il decentramento significa che le risorse saranno più difficili da colpire da droni e missili, ha detto. “Non possiamo contare sulla firma di un accordo di pace. Dobbiamo iniziare a prepararci oggi”, ha detto, aggiungendo che l’Ucraina deve rifornirsi di attrezzature critiche e rafforzare le difese aeree.

Title: UBS weighing crypto trading for private banking clients: Report

The plan would give ultra-high net worth clients an in-house crypto on-ramp at one of the world's biggest private banks. Cointelegraph in your social feed The world’s biggest global wealth manager, UBS, is reportedly exploring a move to open crypto trading to its wealthiest clients. Bloomberg reported Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that the Swiss banking giant aims to let select private banking clients in Switzerland trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) first, with a possible rollout to the Asia‑Pacific region and the United States later. The person also reportedly said that UBS was currently selecting partners for its crypto offering, although the bank has not publicly confirmed the details. UBS already runs tokenization pilots such as the uMINT tokenized US dollar money market fund on Ethereum and a Swift-UBS-Chainlink tokenized fund settlement trial, experimenting with putting traditional fund products on blockchain rails even before considering offering spot crypto trading. UBS has also deepened its blockchain push on the payments side, teaming up with Ant International to trial tokenized deposits for real-time cross-border treasury flows using its UBS Digital Cash platform in Singapore. The pilot aims to let Ant move liquidity across its Alipay+ ecosystem in minutes instead of days by putting bank deposit claims on permissioned ledgers, positioning tokenized bank money as a potential replacement for legacy, cutoff‑bound correspondent banking rails. Related: Bank of America lets wealth advisers recommend Bitcoin ETFs The Swiss group would be following US banking giant JPMorgan, which is exploring crypto trading for institutional clients and already uses its JPM Coin system for onchain wholesale payments and collateral, and asset management behemoths BlackRock and Fidelity, which have become leading issuers of spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Vanguard, long one of Wall Street’s most vocal crypto skeptics, effectively became one of the last major holdouts to fold when it reversed its hardline stance in December 2025 and allowed clients to trade crypto ETFs on its platform. UBS oversaw some $4.7 trillion in wealth assets as of September 2025. If it moves ahead with crypto trading, the bank will open a new, in‑house on‑ramp for ultra‑high net worth portfolios. Cointelegraph reached out to UBS for comment on the reported private banking crypto trading plans, but had not received a response by publication.

Title: Trump steals the show in Davos with a mixed bag of rhetoric and results at elite gathering

Time Published: 2026-01-23T13:47:36Z

By JAMEY KEATEN, Associated Press DAVOS, Switzerland (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump took center stage in his whirlwind visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, overshadowing the yearly gabfest among national leaders, executives and other elites in the Swiss Alpine snows. While some experts highlighted business leaders’ ambitions to leverage AI for productivity, efficiency and profits or a boom in renewable energy investment led by China, Trump largely stole the show when it came to politics. Climate and other concerns didn’t draw the same attention as in past years at the event that ended Friday. “I think there were two Davoses,” said Jane Harman, a former Democratic Congresswoman. “One of them was very senior industrial leaders talking about AI. … The second was foreign policy, or geopolitics, and that was dominated by one person.” On his third visit to Davos while president, Trump came and went over about 24 hours. He delivered a rambling and at times hyperbolic speech that touted America’s global role. Unlike his previous trips to Davos among adoring corporate chiefs, Trump faced criticism from the likes of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who repeatedly spoke to media scrums in the Congress Center. Still, others were more congratulatory: NATO chief Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who met with Trump in Davos, praised his efforts to help end Russia’s war in Ukraine, boost Western defense and deliver security guarantees to Kyiv. One narrative that emerged in Davos: The U.S. under Trump and its Western allies have grown too divided. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke of a “rupture” that would never be repaired. In the runup to his trip to Davos, Trump sowed new discord with America’s longtime allies in Europe by announcing plans to set new tariffs on eight European countries who opposed his takeover bid for Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of NATO member Denmark. By Wednesday, amid an uproar at home and abroad, Trump had backed off in a dramatic reversal — not long after insisting he wanted to get the island “including right, title and ownership.” In a post on his social media site, Trump said he had agreed with NATO chief Rutte on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security, potentially defusing tension that had far-reaching geopolitical implications. Trump launched his Board of Peace to spearhead efforts at maintaining a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas, and eventually help underpin efforts to map a future of the war-torn Gaza Strip. The idea drew support from countries as diverse as Belarus, Kosovo, Indonesia and Argentina, but critics — including longtime U.S. allies in Europe — oppose it. They reject his claim that it could rival the United Nations one day. Some critics said details were scarce about how the Board of Peace will work — under the chairmanship of Trump himself — and suggested the better move would be to reinforce and improve current U.N. structures, not replace them. “I think they were trying to duplicate — replicate — what happened when the United Nations came about,” Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in an interview. “But frankly it was a very poor and sad attempt to repeat what happened in the 1940s.” Artificial intelligence was — as usual in recent times — a hot topic: Billionaire Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made their Davos debuts. Musk, who had previously called the WEF event “boring,” jetted in with little advance notice to discuss robotics, address AI’s electricity demands and gently rebuke the Trump administration for imposing tariffs on Chinese solar panels. Huang pushed back on fears that the AI boom might wipe out jobs, saying it would create work for people building out its infrastructure, such as “plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers and network technicians.” The U.S.-China rivalry got a mention from another AI chieftain: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei compared the Trump administration’s move to green-light sales of an advanced Nvidia chip to selling nuclear weapons to Pyongyang. But overall, it was can-do optimism among technology, AI and other business executives encapsulated the stated motto and mindset of the forum to improve the world and promote dialogue — not fear and doom-and-gloom predictions about the future. “I want to end this forum with the quote that Elon Musk said in closing yesterday’s session — that it’s better to be an optimist and wrong than be a pessimist who’s right,” said forum co-chair Larry Fink, the BlackRock chairman and CEO, at the closing ceremony. Associated Press writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.

Today’s top news: One of the biggest concerns of crypto under the Trump presidency has been—what happens if the political winds shift in 2026 or 2028? Well, PwC says you have nothing to worry about. 📌 What Happened According to PwC, institutional adoption of crypto has crossed a threshold where it is no longer reversible, marking a structural shift in how large financial players interact with digital assets. PwC’s assessment points to sustained engagement across custody, trading, settlement, tokenization, and onchain financial infrastructure, even through periods of market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Rather than institutions testing crypto on the margins, PwC says firms are now building long-term strategies and systems around it, making a full retreat impractical even if market conditions deteriorate. 🧠 Why It Matters The signal here is not just what PwC said in the report. It is that PwC is saying it at all. A Big Four accounting firm weighing in on crypto adoption carries a different kind of weight than commentary from exchanges, venture firms, or protocol founders. They weren’t issuing reports like this in 2021. Now more and more big TradFi players are paying attention and publishing thought leadership on crypto. As for the substance of the report, it also speaks directly to one of the biggest lingering concerns around crypto - the idea that a political shift in 2028 could unwind the progress made over the past two years. PwC’s assessment suggests the opposite. Once institutions commit to crypto and everything that goes with it (custody systems, compliance frameworks, tokenized products, onchain settlement infrastructure, etc), walking away becomes too expensive. These are multi-year investments embedded in core business processes, not experiments that can be flipped off with a change in administration. We may actually be making enough progress right now to set crypto up for decades.

Title: Trump steals the show in Davos with a mixed bag of rhetoric and results at elite gathering

U.S. President Donald Trump has taken center stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, overshadowing discussions on AI and renewable energy DAVOS, Switzerland -- U.S. President Donald Trump took center stage in his whirlwind visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, overshadowing the yearly gabfest among national leaders, executives and other elites in the Swiss Alpine snows. While some experts highlighted business leaders' ambitions to leverage AI for productivity, efficiency and profits or a boom in renewable energy investment led by China, Trump largely stole the show when it came to politics. Climate and other concerns didn't draw the same attention as in past years at the event that ended Friday. “I think there were two Davoses," said Jane Harman, a former Democratic Congresswoman. "One of them was very senior industrial leaders talking about AI. ... The second was foreign policy, or geopolitics, and that was dominated by one person.” On his third visit to Davos while president, Trump came and went over about 24 hours. He delivered a rambling and at times hyperbolic speech that touted America’s global role. Unlike his previous trips to Davos among adoring corporate chiefs, Trump faced criticism from the likes of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, who repeatedly spoke to media scrums in the Congress Center. Still, others were more congratulatory: NATO chief Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who met with Trump in Davos, praised his efforts to help end Russia’s war in Ukraine, boost Western defense and deliver security guarantees to Kyiv. One narrative that emerged in Davos: The U.S. under Trump and its Western allies have grown too divided. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney spoke of a “rupture” that would never be repaired. In the runup to his trip to Davos, Trump sowed new discord with America's longtime allies in Europe by announcing plans to set new tariffs on eight European countries who opposed his takeover bid for Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of NATO member Denmark. By Wednesday, amid an uproar at home and abroad, Trump had backed off in a dramatic reversal — not long after insisting he wanted to get the island “including right, title and ownership.” In a post on his social media site, Trump said he had agreed with NATO chief Rutte on a “framework of a future deal” on Arctic security, potentially defusing tension that had far-reaching geopolitical implications. Trump launched his Board of Peace to spearhead efforts at maintaining a ceasefire in Israel’s war with Hamas, and eventually help underpin efforts to map a future of the war-torn Gaza Strip. The idea drew support from countries as diverse as Belarus, Kosovo, Indonesia and Argentina, but critics — including longtime U.S. allies in Europe — oppose it. They reject his claim that it could rival the United Nations one day. Some critics said details were scarce about how the Board of Peace will work — under the chairmanship of Trump himself — and suggested the better move would be to reinforce and improve current U.N. structures, not replace them. “I think they were trying to duplicate — replicate — what happened when the United Nations came about," Amnesty International Secretary-General Agnes Callamard said in an interview. "But frankly it was a very poor and sad attempt to repeat what happened in the 1940s.” Artificial intelligence was — as usual in recent times — a hot topic: Billionaire Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made their Davos debuts. Musk, who had previously called the WEF event “boring,” jetted in with little advance notice to discuss robotics, address AI's electricity demands and gently rebuke the Trump administration for imposing tariffs on Chinese solar panels. Huang pushed back on fears that the AI boom might wipe out jobs, saying it would create work for people building out its infrastructure, such as “plumbers and electricians and construction and steel workers and network technicians.” The U.S.-China rivalry got a mention from another AI chieftain: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei compared the Trump administration’s move to green-light sales of an advanced Nvidia chip to selling nuclear weapons to Pyongyang. But overall, it was can-do optimism among technology, AI and other business executives encapsulated the stated motto and mindset of the forum to improve the world and promote dialogue — not fear and doom-and-gloom predictions about the future. “I want to end this forum with the quote that Elon Musk said in closing yesterday’s session — that it’s better to be an optimist and wrong than be a pessimist who’s right,” said forum co-chair Larry Fink, the BlackRock chairman and CEO, at the closing ceremony. ___ Associated Press writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: Document reveals EU-US pitch for $800B postwar Ukraine ‘prosperity’ plan

The proposal hinges on a ceasefire that remains elusive while Russian leader Vladimir Putin persists with his full-scale invasion. AI generated Text-to-speech BRUSSELS — The U.S. and EU are hoping to attract $800 billion of public and private funds to help rebuild Ukraine once Russia ends its full-scale invasion, according to a document obtained by POLITICO. The 18-page document outlines a 10-year plan to guarantee Ukraine’s recovery with a fast-tracked path toward EU membership. The European Commission circulated the plans with EU capitals ahead of the leaders’ summit Thursday evening where the document, dated Jan. 22, was addressed, according to three EU officials and diplomats who were granted anonymity to talk about the sensitive topic. While Brussels and Washington are lining up hundreds of billions of dollars in long-term funding and pitching Ukraine as a future EU member and investment destination, the strategy hinges on a ceasefire that remains elusive — leaving the prosperity plan vulnerable as long as the fighting continues. The funding strategy stretches until 2040 alongside an immediate 100-day operational plan to get the project off the ground. But the prosperity plan will struggle to attract outside investment if the conflict rumbles on, according to the world’s largest money manager, BlackRock, which is advising on the reconstruction plan in a pro-bono capacity. “Think about it. If you're a pension fund, you're fiduciary towards your clients, your pensioners. It's nearly impossible to invest into a war zone,” BlackRock’s vice chairman, Philipp Hildebrand, said Wednesday in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “I think it has to be sequenced and that's going to take some time.” The prosperity plan is part of a 20-point peace blueprint that the U.S. is attempting to broker between Kyiv and Moscow. It explicitly assumes that security guarantees are already in place and is not intended as a military roadmap. Instead, it focuses on how Ukraine can transition from emergency assistance to self-sustaining prosperity. A three-way meeting between Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. will take place in Abu Dhabi on Friday and Saturday, as the all-out conflict nears its fourth anniversary. The U.S. is set to play a prominent role in Ukraine’s recovery. Rather than framing Washington primarily as a donor, the document positioned the U.S. as a strategic economic partner, investor and credibility anchor for Ukraine’s recovery. The note anticipates direct participation by U.S. companies and expertise on the ground, and highlights America’s role as a mobilizer of private capital. BlackRock’s chief executive, Larry Fink, has sat in on peace talks with Kyiv alongside U.S. President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff. Over the next 10 years, the EU, the U.S. and international financial bodies, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, have pledged to spend $500 billion of public and private capital, the document said. The Commission intends to spend a further €100 billion on Kyiv through budget support and investment guarantees, as part of the bloc’s next seven-year budget from 2028. This funding is expected to unlock €207 billion in investments for Ukraine. The U.S. pledged to mobilize capital through a dedicated U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, but did not attach a figure. While Trump has slashed military and humanitarian support to Ukraine during the war, it showed willingness to invest in the country after the end of the conflict. Washington said in the document that it will invest in critical minerals, infrastructure, energy and technology projects in Ukraine. But business is unlikely to boom before the eastern front falls silent. “It's very hard to see that happening at scale as long as you have drones and missiles flying,” BlackRock’s Hildebrand said. Kathryn Carlson reported from Davos, Switzerland. The organizers of the Battle for the Soul of Europe event hope to capitalize on public anger at the Brussels establishment. Officials and diplomats are hoping the ceasefire lasts but don’t want to ease the pressure on Israel just yet. ‘The political leaders should sit down with the companies that are investing money,’ says ASML executive. Mikalai Khilo was arrested by agents with Belarus’ KGB intelligence service, apparently for insulting Alexander Lukashenko.

Title: Disney Recommends Shareholders Reject Outside Review of DAS Changes

Earlier this week, we reported on Disney reversing course on its previous plan to exclude from its proxy statement a shareholder proposal to conduct an independent & public review of its controversial Disability Access Service policy changes at Walt Disney World and Disneyland. Here’s the latest on that, with details about the DAS vote in the annual meeting. Previously, Disney sent a new letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) withdrawing its previous no-action request (from November), meaning that they no longer were seeking any assurances from the SEC regarding a potential enforcement action against Disney for the exclusion. The company no longer sought such an assurance because they’ve instead opted to include the aforementioned shareholder proposal in their proxy materials for the 2026 annual meeting. Only a couple of days later, Disney has now filed its proxy statement with the SEC ahead of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on March 18, 2026. In this, the company elaborates on its stance to the Disability Access Service shareholder proposal seeking independent review of the controversial changes. Spoiler alert: Disney’s Board is recommending shareholders vote against outside DAS risk analysis, which is exactly as expected. Here’s the latest, along with when it’ll come up during the shareholder meeting and Disney’s explanation for rejecting review of DAS. During the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, there are four shareholder proposals that will be presented and voted on after votes on approving executive compensation, accountants, and the election of the board of directors. There shareholder proposal in question is #7: “Independent Review and Report on Accessibility and Disability Inclusion Practices” (page 94). Here’s a summary of the shareholder’s statement in support of the proposal, followed by the resolution in full: Disney’s brand and financial stability are under strain from underperforming films, rising park costs, consumer boycotts, and waning trust. According to the resolution, a significant contributor to this strain is the company’s recent overhaul of disability accommodations at its parks due to negative media coverage, social media, guests canceling trips and Annual Passes, as well as legal exposure to a class action lawsuit. As a result of the controversial DAS changes, Disney exposed itself to legal claims, regulatory scrutiny, and brand damage. Other companies have faced multimillion-dollar settlements under accessibility-related actions. Future liabilities could include costly settlements, operational disruption, and weakened market positioning. Resolved: Shareholders request that Disney commission an independent review, conducted by a qualified third party, of the company’s accessibility and disability inclusion practices. This review should assess legal, financial, and reputational risks; evaluate Disney’s policies against international accessibility standards and competitors; and identify opportunities for leadership improvement. Shareholders further request that the Board provide a public summary and internal briefing on the findings to ensure accountability and transparency. The Walt Disney Company prefaces the shareholder proposal with the following: Given recent regulatory changes, we are including this proposal in the proxy statement, notwithstanding that we believe that it does not meet the requirements of Rule 14a-8, including on grounds that the proposal, read together with its supporting statement, is materially false and misleading in multiple respects (including statements regarding the Company and statements regarding purported research the proponent cites), relates to the Company’s ordinary business operations and has already been substantially implemented by the Company. These bases for exclusion are detailed in the Company’s no-action request submitted to the SEC on November 4, 2025. Disney’s argument for exclusion in that November 4th no-action request was that any attendance decrease in the last fiscal year was attributable to hurricanes. Moreover, park operations are ordinary business and not subject to shareholder micromanagement; that they’ve already done their due diligence on the DAS changes, and there’s no duty to disclose any nonpublic information. There’s still more to it than that, but Disney indicated in the proxy statement that the company has limited its response to the most important points and have not attempted to address all the statements with which they disagree. You can read Disney’s full argument here. The Walt Disney Company Board recommends that shareholders vote against this proposal for the following key reasons, as discussed in more detail below: Across the Company, we endeavor to provide opportunities to enjoy our products and services. To that end, the Company has made thoughtful investments to incorporate accessibility for people with disabilities throughout our operations as we strive to design, promote and serve as a model for accessibility. The Company has given the same attention to detail in its development of the Disability Access Service program for its domestic parks, which provides an extraordinary benefit – never having to wait in the regular standby lines for most rides for those who require that option. The Company also offers a broad range of different accommodations to assist in accessing the rides and other attractions in the parks, accessing our content and programming and experiencing our other products and services. For example, the Company offers a range of tools and accessibility features across our streaming platforms and networks, including tools such as audio descriptions, closed captioning, keyboard navigation and interoperability with popular screen readers. The Company provides detailed information regarding accessibility and disability inclusion practices on its websites, including the publication of an Accessibility Topic Brief. Each of our theme parks also publicly provides thorough information about its accommodations and assists guests both before and during their visits. For our domestic theme parks, Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort, this includes pages on the Disability Access Service program with guidance on registration and the process for using the program once in one of the parks. The Company has strong governance and oversight of both its accessibility efforts and risk management. Our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer leads Disney’s global people and culture strategy; talent acquisition and development; compensation and benefits; opportunity and inclusion; organizational effectiveness; and employee services and systems. Reporting to our Chief People Officer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Opportunity & Inclusion Officer leads the Company’s Opportunity & Inclusion strategy and partners closely with leaders and teams across all segments to foster a culture rooted in belonging. The Chief Safety Officer leads the Company’s guest safety efforts for Disney Experiences, including those related to guest accessibility, in collaboration with businesses and leaders across the Company. The Board and its committees oversee the Company’s major financial, legal and reputational risks, supporting strong brand stewardship and mitigation of such risks. See section entitled “The Board’s Role in Risk Oversight” in this proxy statement for more details. The Company already details the support and accommodations it offers to guests and consumers with accessibility needs, as well as risk oversight practices and governance. The Board therefore believes that the proposal’s request is not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as it would not provide meaningful additional information to shareholders to merit the resources it would require. For the reasons set forth above, our Board unanimously recommends voting AGAINST this proposal. What’s most interesting about the proxy statement is just how uninteresting it is. Disney uses a lot of words to say very little, which is precisely the point. Nothing in the above is going to pose a problem for Disney down the road in the class action lawsuit for future litigation. There aren’t any claims that can be exploited or present legal exposure. Some shareholders and disabled guests will certainly disagree with Disney’s assertions about it being an industry leader, DAS being an extraordinary benefit, or guests who use the service never having to wait in a regular standby line–but they’re nevertheless the type of claims you’d expect Disney to make, and most of those about DAS are conditional (guests who require the service). All in all, it reads very press release-y and similar to what we’ve seen before. Not a huge surprise, as all of the DAS materials released to date have likely passed the desk of multiple attorneys. Beyond that, this section covers no new ground, as our analysis on this shareholder proposal has not materially changed since the SEC no-action letter first surfaced last year. Accordingly, this mostly just paraphrases what we’ve previously covered. The only somewhat new commentary concerns why Disney has waffled on the shareholder proposal. After the last post was published we added the explanation for that, which boils down to the SEC issuing a Statement Regarding the Division of Corporation Finance’s Role in the Exchange Act Rule 14a-8 Process for the Current Proxy Season on November 17, 2025. With that, the SEC has determined to not respond to no-action requests for, and express no views on, companies’ intended reliance on any basis for exclusion of shareholder proposals. That statement was made 10 days after Disney submitted its no-action letter, so Disney wouldn’t have known of that position when making the request. Basically, this means that the Walt Disney Company is not going to get a response from the SEC with regard to its no-action letter. On this same basis, many other companies have withdrawn their no-action requests, presumably due to the legal uncertainty of them (just look at all of the “withdrawn” parentheticals here). That’s the simplest and most straightforward for this reversal; that Disney is taking the certainty of the proposal being shot down by shareholders over the risk of an enforcement action resulting from excluding it without the backing of the SEC. And there’s every reason to believe this shareholder proposal will be rejected. Anyone who has listened to the annual meetings knows that there are a lot of politically-charged and niche causes presented. All of them are summarily shot down without much in the way of further discussion. There’s no reason to believe the fate of this DAS proposal will be any different. Disney should do a better job at finding a middle ground and have a more delicate touch in handling DAS, but there are a lot of things we believe Disney should do differently. That does not make day-to-day operations an appropriate topic for vote at shareholder meetings. One important thing to keep in mind here is that it is not individual shareholders who are outcome-determine on things like this. It won’t be plugged-in fans who are sympathetic to the plight of disabled guests casting the deciding votes. It’s the large institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity that are make or break. Although Disney’s stock has underperformed for the last several years, that’s not attributable to the theme parks. Accordingly, institutional investors are not going to concern themselves with this. It will be deemed too trivial, and they will accept Disney’s arguments that were laid out above. The DAS review shareholder proposal will fail, and it won’t even be a close vote. And for the record, similar shareholder proposals about bringing back Disney’s Magical Express, restoring free FastPass–or any number of decisions that would be overwhelmingly popular among fans–would likewise be rejected, and spectacularly so. Fans are not the decisive voting bloc. All BlackRock, Vanguard, etc. need to see is this: “The proposal’s request would not enhance shareholder value.” That’s the whole ballgame. Anyway, just wanted to bring this to your attention since this Disability Access Service shareholder proposal has been an ongoing story, and this further crystalizes the company’s position on it. To end on a potentially positive note for this who support further DAS review, just getting this on the ballot and in front of investors should be deemed a small victory. This isn’t alone isn’t going to change anything, but it keeps the conversation about the controversial DAS changes going, and that help might put pressure on Disney for further reform, an informal rule relaxation, or just making the process less dehumanizing.

Thoughts on the shareholder proposal for an independent review of DAS changes at Walt Disney World and Disneyland? Expect this to be approved or rejected? Agree or disagree with our assessment of the changes or policy as a whole? Please try to stay on topic–we’ve noticed some of these DAS comments sections get heated and personal. Discuss the policy itself, not others’ use (or lack thereof) of it. Let’s hide from the public, rather than reveal the secrets hiding behind the curtain as relates to DAS eligibility. This makes me more determined to give it a try prior to our three planned visits. I was eligible in the past and only used it once or twice on that trip, as I only applied once. There were many trips I did not even bother trying for a DAS. Our AP’s will be in effect for the next three trips over potentially six weeks. Renewing of our AP’s will be subject to how I am treated during the interview, not whether I am accepted or not. My many “issues” have exacerbated since, certainly not gotten better. Waiting in lines is nearly impossible for me. Waiting on a bench nearby will be the difference between an enjoyable vacation and possibly selling DVC and moving on after 53 years of WDW. No longer an industry leader in accessibility, that’s for sure. I would rank Universal higher and Legoland even higher. We all know abuse took place, which is deplorable, and what got us into this mess. I appreciate the line size accommodations and them showcasing closed captions as something they are providing is embarrassing because it is pretty commonplace. Thought this may not affect the bottom line, which is what they are trying to tell the shareholders, it is just one more shade that is discoloring the brand overall, which does affect bottom line. And I think for many families affected by this, the most important part that is not even mentioned is the lack of dignity that is taking place with the interrogation interviews in particular how the “medical“ staff is talking to people. I wish that was lifted up somehow among this waste of time. It is a tough situation and I understand different views. There must be a way to help people with disabilities enjoybthe parks. That said, the old system wasn’t working. I personally know people who made it a point to take advantage of the system to jump the line and used “disabilities” that don’t affect them doing anything else in their lives except for standing in theme park lines. Aside from the obvious investors killing this, do you think the biggest thing Disney doesn’t want is any of the data being released (I.e. how DAS impacts line wait times or how many ppl use it) Disney doesn’t want the public disclosure of any confidential information or stats like that. However, a lot did come out during discovery in the last litigation over disability access changes, and the numbers were shocking. And that was several years ago, pre-closure, before usage increased dramatically. As you might recall, we started reporting on likely changes in 2023, long before anything was announced. The basis for that was conversations I had, suggesting that DAS in that form was unsustainable. If we actually got concrete numbers from ~2022-2024, they’d probably surprise a lot of fans–even the ones who already believe that changes needed to be made. I would love to see a standardized approach to DAS across the board. Allow people to submit their medical proof in advance of visit to get approval instead of being questioned about why they “think” they can’t stand in line. This is a ridiculous way of deciding on whether a person does or doesn’t qualify for the pass. This would make things a lot less “personal”. The system in place does not provide medical experts in every modality needing accommodation and therefore how can they be given such an authority? It is a very flawed system in my opinion considering what people actually go through to be diagnosed with a recognized ADA disability. We expected to go the IBCCES route when the DAS overhaul was first rumored, but pending litigation over that likely swayed the decision. (More on that here: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/universal-orlando-stops-requiring-controversial-disability-access-card/) The problem is that Disney has to weigh the legal exposure of each approach with guest interests and accommodating those who truly need DAS. In theory, you’d expect all of those things to be aligned–that the law would protect only the disabled and steer companies towards a solution that assists them. In practice, that’s not exactly how it works. Problem is that verifying that someone has a disability doesn’t necessarily mean that they need DAS. Not all valid disabilities need DAS for accessibility; in fact, you could have multiple people with the same disability, and some might need DAS and some might not. Disney can’t (and shouldn’t) give a DAS to someone just because they have a disability. Oh well. Hi, I agree that not all disabilities require DAS. Where I do not agree is that there is no system that can be supported by documentation to show that you do or do not truly need a DAS accommodation. The decision-making process is lacking in a lot of ways and truly needs improvement. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Davos is back — but the world it once championed is gone
URL: https://www.politico.eu/article/world-economic-forum-davos-global-order/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T13:08:56Z
Full Content:
This year’s World Economic Forum featured big names and a sharp shift in focus. AI generated Text-to-speech DAVOS, Switzerland — The private jets are departing. The pavilions are being dismantled. As the political and business whirlwind of the World Economic Forum packs up and leaves Davos, two things are clear. After a period in which the elite gathering teetered on the brink of irrelevance, the Forum’s future is no longer in doubt. And the world of international and rules-based order in which it rose to prominence is, at the very best, endangered — if not already gone. Over the past four days, the tiny Alpine town played host to high-stakes geopolitical moves, from Donald Trump’s climbdown over Greenland, to negotiations on Ukraine, to the launch of the Board of Peace, a body some fear the U.S. president wants to use to sideline the United Nations. And yet, in sharp contrast to the gathering’s past as a neutral space for global cooperation, the WEF became a battleground. Leaders like Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron took shots at each other; high-powered political dinners reportedly descended into heckling and walkouts; and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called time of death on the rules-based order. “This is the largest gathering of global leadership of the post-COVID era,” Larry Fink, CEO of global asset management giant BlackRock, told the assembled delegates at the launch of the event. “But now for the harder question: Will anyone outside this room care?” Fink — who was brought in to shore up the WEF after the chaotic departure of its founder Klaus Schwab — had succeeded in bringing star power to Davos, from Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to business tycoons who usually steer clear of the event, like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Tesla’s Elon Musk. Yet even as he succeeded in putting the WEF firmly on the global news agenda, Fink worried about the event’s connection to real people. He told the Forum that, “If we’re being honest, for many people this meeting feels out of step with the moment: elites in an age of populism, an established institution in an era of deep institutional distrust.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent hit out at the WEF’s previous years of “utopian consensus” and “kumbaya” in an interview with POLITICO’S Dasha Burns for “The Conversation” podcast. “The inmates were running the asylum at that point,” he said. “This global elite fared very well under this, and … the rest of the world got substantially pushed down in terms of their prospects,” Bessent argued, pointing to the resurgence of populist movements worldwide as a backlash against the liberal elitism the WEF of previous years embodied. In a whiplash-inducing week in which social media posts, bilateral meetings and a few words during a speech transformed the nature of the U.S.’ relationship with partners, there is a sense that Europe and like-minded countries are waking up to a new reality — on which they cannot comfortably rely on the transatlantic relationship or NATO. Carney used his prime spot on the WEF stage to warn of “a rupture in the world order, the end of a pleasant fiction and the beginning of a harsh reality” of “great powers” and “hegemons.” “The middle powers must act together, because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” Carney said. Zelenskyy laid into Europe for its inaction, arguing that “Europe looks lost trying to convince the U.S. president to change” and “feels more like geography, history, a tradition, not a real political force, not a great power.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for “a new independent Europe,” while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said the “new world of great powers is being built on power, on strength, and when it comes to it, on force.” Macron warned of “a shift towards a world without rules.” The French president argued that while Europe is “too naive,” it “prefer[s] respect to bullies.” In a sign of new momentum, many leaders either dodged Trump in Davos, or jetted straight to Brussels for an emergency EU leaders’ summit. All but Hungary and Bulgaria snubbed Trump’s “board of peace” launch event. Among delegates in Davos this week, the prevailing view was that Fink has saved the Forum after its leadership problems and its declining ability to draw in big-name speakers. Fink has said he planned to lead for two years or fewer while a permanent chair is found. Who that could be is unclear. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, was widely seen as the front-runner when Schwab resigned, with the founder himself publicly anointing her his successor. But Fink’s break with the Schwab era has thrown that into question. Lagarde, who reportedly walked out of a dinner Wednesday during a speech critical of Europe by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, has been a Davos fixture this week, but she has denied that she would step down from the ECB early to take over. Fink, meanwhile, seems to have bigger plans for the WEF. In his speech at the beginning of the gathering, he pitched a path forward beyond Davos, calling for the event to expand to “the places where the modern world is actually built.” “Davos, yes,” he said. “But also places like Detroit and Dublin — and cities like Jakarta and Buenos Aires.” “The mountain will come down to earth,” he added. The proposal hinges on a ceasefire that remains elusive while Russian leader Vladimir Putin persists with his full-scale invasion. If confirmed, the three-way summit in Abu Dhabi would be the first time the three sides have sat down together since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022. The room was far from full, leaving American officials making excuses for the small number of countries officially signed up. Leading Democrat launches broadside at politicians who bow to Trump: “You mate with him or he devours you, one or the other, and you need to stand up to it.”

Title: Ericsson layoffs: CEO Borje Ekholm says telecom giant to continue job cuts amid 5G market woes

Swedish telecoms equipment maker Ericsson expects to continue laying off employees as part of its ongoing cost-cutting and restructuring efforts, CEO Borje Ekholm said on Friday. “You have seen that we have reduced the headcount, for example, by 5,000 over the past year, and we expect to continue reducing headcount going forward,” Ekholm was quoted as saying in a post-earnings call by Reuters. Earlier this year, Ericsson announced plans to cut up to 1,600 jobs in its home country of Sweden, a move aimed at ensuring the company's competitive position, the firm said in a press release. These cost-saving measures have helped the company maintain profitability and deliver strong earnings, even as telecom operators continue to witness sluggish demand in the global 5G equipment market. In mid-January, Ericsson submitted a notice to the Swedish Public Employment Service, stating that approximately 1,600 positions could be impacted in the country. It also initiated negotiations with relevant trade unions. The telecom equipment maker has been working to cut costs and improve margins in recent years. The company struggled with weak demand, as anticipated carrier spending on 5G technology did not meet expectations, Mint reported earlier. Ericsson has been steadily reducing headcount over the last three years to maintain profitability as it grappled with 5G spending slowdown and the widespread impact of sweeping US tariffs. In 2023, the company announced a global plan to cut 8,500 jobs, equivalent to 8% of its workforce. The reductions have continued since then, with the company axing hundreds of staff in Spain and Canada last year. Ericsson is not the first company to reduce its headcount, as at least five other major companies have also announced layoffs in January this year, reflecting a broader trend of cost-cutting across the corporate sector. The job-loss trend that companies struggled with the previous year seems to have continued into the new year as well. Earlier, BlackRock said it planned to cut hundreds of jobs this month, after Meta announced it would cut 10% of its workforce in the Digital Labs division. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg report also said Meta's job cuts are expected later this week, citing people familiar with the matter. Banking major Citigroup is also about to lay off around 1,000 employees this week as CEO Jane Fraser seeks to control costs and improve returns at the company, Mint reported. In a more recent instance, Amazon also announced that it plans to slash around 30,000 white-collar jobs by next week. It said the layoffs may impact AWS, HR, Prime Video and retail segments of the company. However, the plans may still change, said a Mint report.

DAVOS, Switzerland – BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, has recently been in talks with various governments about potential investment opportunities in Ukraine – despite the war with Russia that shows no sign of ending anytime soon, On The Money has learned. News of BlackRock and its voluble CEO Larry Fink’s role in mediating investment opportunities in Ukraine with foreign governments including sovereign wealth funds hasn’t been previously reported. A press official for BlackRock declined to comment on the negotiations. “(BlackRock) is advising a bunch of governments on how to figure out ways to attract capital to Ukraine,” said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. “(The firm) is helping everyone think through all the various sectors and industries that could attract foreign capital.” The person described the discussions as early stage talks, and a transition from the firm’s previous role as financial adviser to the country, which has been put on hold as its war with Russia entered its third straight year with President Trump unable to broker a peace. The plan is to attract capital — including money from sovereign wealth funds — to seed an $800 billion reconstruction fund, On The Money has learned. The talks are starting to heat up as top financiers and world leaders this week gather here at the home of the World Economic Forum, where Fink is serving as the conference’s “chairman” after the ousting last year of longtime forum chief Klaus Schwab over alleged financial and workplace improprieties. Investors and world leaders — such as Middle East sovereign wealth funds that Fink is close to – like the potential investment opportunities in Ukraine because of its educated workforce and the resiliency of its people. Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky struck a deal over the excavation of rare earth minerals that could be a boon for business if it ever gets off the ground. But major obstacles in attracting investment dollars remain. About a quarter of the country’s population has been displaced since the 2022 Russian invasion. Ukraine has a history of corruption that needs to be weeded out. Most of all it comes down to the war that never seems to end. “How can you get people to invest in a place that’s being bombed every day?” said one Wall Street executive involved in the matter. That said, the talks continue. Fink met with Ukraine leaders here on the fund’s progress. He is also said to have a close relationship with Zelensky, and the US president, which during his long career as a real estate executive leaned on the BlackRock CEO as his financial adviser. Trump and Zelensky are attending the forum. Following Trump’s bombshell speech on Wednesday in which he backed off his Greenland and tariff threats, Zelensky on Thursday gave a speech titled “Achieving Security and Cooperation in a Fragmented World.” Zelensky was also slated to privately meet with world leaders and Trump, who is desperate to fulfill a key campaign promise of ending the bloody conflict that is currently at a stalemate with Russia holding about 20% of Ukraine territory and its president Vladimir Putin so far refusing to agree to terms for a ceasefire. It’s unclear how much any of these talks will accomplish since this time last year, it appeared that Putin was ready to make a deal only to renege. In taking over for Schwab, Fink told those gathered in his opening remarks on Tuesday that the conference often “feels out of step with the moment: elites in an age of populism, an established institution in an era of deep institutional distrust. And there’s truth in that critique.” People close to Fink say he’s looking to make the panels and discussions here more relevant, even populist in tone, given the recent political backlash against globalism in the states, and policies like ESG that some say stoked inflation because it led to a decline in energy exploration.

Never miss a story. The conference, known by its acronym WEF, is the ultimate globalist schmoozefest. CEOs, heads of major sovereign wealth funds, presidents (including our own) prime ministers and scores of bankers descend upon this posh ski town as they have for the past 53 years to try to figure out how to make the world a better place, often with mixed results. Fads such as Environmental Social Governance investing, which introduced woke politics to money management, came out of the forum, as did codified racialized hiring practices such as the Diversity Equity and Inclusion mandates that were corporate policy for ever big company until a 2023 Supreme Court ruling and efforts by the Trump administration to ban the practice. Despite its public rep as a globalist gabfest, the real action at Davos has always been in meetings that take place in private venues in this town, where bankers attempt to strike deals with clients, and world leaders try to come up with solutions to big problems like the war in Ukraine.

Title: UBS Plans Crypto Trading for Some Clients in Digital-Asset Push

UBS Group AG plans to make cryptocurrency investing available for some private banking clients, in what could become a significant move into digital assets for the world's largest wealth manager. namThe Swiss banking giant, which oversaw some $4.7 trillion in wealth assets as of Sept. 30, is in the process of selecting partners for a crypto offering, people with knowledge of the matter said. Discussions have been ongoing for several months and UBS hasn't made a final decision on how to proceed, they said, asking not to be ed as the deliberations are private. UBS would initially allow select clients of its private bank in Switzerland to buy and sell Bitcoin and Ether, one of the people said. The offering may then be rolled out in markets like the Asia-Pacific region and the US, according to the person. Offering access to cryptocurrencies would mark a meaningful shift for UBS, which has long taken a cautious stance on virtual tokens. At the same time, Wall Street rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are expanding in digital assets after Donald Trump returned to the White House, putting pressure on UBS to follow suit. UBS's push deeper into crypto comes in part in response to growing demand for digital assets from wealthy clients, one person said. “As part of UBS's digital asset strategy, we actively monitor developments and explore initiatives that reflect client needs, regulatory developments, market trends and robust risk controls,” a UBS spokesperson said. “We recognize the importance of distributed ledger technology like blockchain, which underpins digital assets.” Like many other global banks, UBS has until now focused digital-asset efforts on building blockchain-based infrastructure for things like tokenized funds and payments. Major lenders have been slower to expand into areas like crypto trading, in large part because of onerous capital rules under the Basel III framework. The US has been leading calls to amend those standards. The Basel Committee said in November that it will accelerate a review of certain elements of its rules around banks' crypto holdings — potentially setting the stage for new initiatives among lenders. UBS's deliberations also highlight the growing institutional involvement in crypto that's reshaping the sector. US-based crypto exchange-traded funds led by BlackRock Inc.'s iShares Bitcoin Trust have ballooned to oversee almost $140 billion in assets since they were first approved two years ago. Morgan Stanley is partnering with cryptocurrency provider ZeroHash to let E*Trade clients trade popular tokens like Bitcoin, Ether and Solana starting in the first half of this year. JPMorgan is exploring crypto trading for institutional clients, Bloomberg reported in December. The cryptocurrency trading business has been lucrative for some companies that have entered it. Robinhood Markets Inc. took in $626 million from crypto trading in 2024, more than triple its haul from equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show. In November 2023, UBS made trading in crypto-linked ETFs available to wealthy clients in Hong Kong, joining competitors like HSBC Holdings Plc. Ex-UBS Chairman Axel Weber, a former central banker, long maintained a bearish stance on cryptocurrencies. In late 2021 — shortly after Bitcoin had surged to a fresh record — he said the concept of anonymous payments “will not survive.” Watch LIVE TV, Get Stock Market Updates, Top Business, IPO and Latest News on NDTV Profit. for a clutter-free reading experience

Title: UK Home Secretary’s Shocking Admission About the Emerging AI Surveillance State
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2026/01/uk-home-secretarys-surprisingly-candid-admission-about-real-reason-for-ai-surveillance-state.html

Full Content:
“When I was in justice, my ultimate vision… was to achieve, by means of AI and technology, what Jeremy Bentham tried to do with his Panopticon.” UK Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, the person nominally in charge of the UK Police, justice system and MI5, sat down for an in conversation event with the former Prime Minister (and current Labour government’s eminence grise) Tony Blair, organised by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. In that conversation, made a chilling admission about the government’s ultimate goal of AI surveillance. From the Daily Telegraph, the only mainstream newspaper besides Scotland’s The National to deign to cover the story: “AI and technology can be transformative to the whole of the law and order space. “When I was in justice, my ultimate vision for that part of the criminal justice system was to achieve, by means of AI and technology, what Jeremy Bentham tried to do with his Panopticon. That is that the eyes of the state can be on you at all times. “Similarly, in the world of policing, in particular, we’ve already been rolling out live facial recognition technology, but I think there’s big space here for being able to harness the power of AI and tech to get ahead of the criminals, frankly, which is what we’re trying to do.” Bentham, an 18th-century philosopher and social theorist, promoted the Panopticon as a circular prison with a central inspection tower from which a single guard could observe all inmates all the time while unseen.[1] For those who do not know, the 'Panopticon' was a plan for a 'perfect' prison. The cells were arranged in a multistory disc around a central guard tower. Because the guards would have a complete view into any of the cells at any time, but the guards in the tower could not be… https://t.co/lkAxL9hngP pic.twitter.com/NE3dZCbLXW — Collingwood 🇬🇧 (@admcollingwood) January 19, 2026 In the case of the original conception of the panopticon, prisoners caught doing something wrong in their cells would be duly punished. Over time, they would learn that total compliance was their only option. In much the same vein, the digital public infrastructure being rolled out in countries across the world, including the UK — in particular digital identity and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) — could be used to discipline members of the public who are caught diverging from the prescribed norms of behaviour and thought. The ultimate goal, as we’ve been arguing for a number of years now, is to close off people’s access to basic goods or services, including Internet websites (as we’re already been seeing with the age verification legislation passed in Australia and the UK), telecommunications services, public benefits and services, and even one’s own bank account. [2] As we’ve seen with the recent debanking scandals, governments have already shown a perfect willingness to do that. The introduction of CBDCs, coupled with the removal of cash, would simply automate this process, taking away the need to go through the courts or political bodies. It would also mean that people would have even less recourse to appeal. Mahmood’s admission is shocking, not so much in terms of its actual message but rather the candidness with which it was conveyed. Seasoned NC readers will not be surprised that the British government, like many other governments, is trying to build an AI-enabled panopticon. Over the years we’ve covered in some depth the totalitarian thinking behind Bentham’s Panopticon, as well as the threats posed by the emergence of a digital panopticon. [3] That said, this is almost certainly the first time that a senior government official of a major Western nation has come out and openly admitted that they are effectively building a digital panopticon in order to maintain total, constant surveillance of criminals. Such a system could be quickly expanded to the broader population — indeed, in the case of the UK it already is, through the nationwide rollout of live facial recognition systems, reports The Telegraph: As justice secretary, Ms Mahmood proposed a major expansion of GPS tagging of criminals to create “virtual prisons” for offenders punished in the community. Since moving to the Home Office, she has announced a planned nationwide rollout of police-operated live facial recognition cameras. Most senior government officials tend not to boast, in public at least, about building a digital panopticon, even if that’s exactly what they’re doing, for an obvious reason: it’s totally dystopian — the Stasi on steroids. But as we’ve been warning, the Starmer government has turbocharged the UK’s slide into dystopia since coming to office, including by scaling back trial by jury, escalating its attacks on lawful speech and rolling out digital identity despite public opposition. Like most governments in the West, the Starmer administration is also pushing for online age verification, which is essentially a Trojan Horse for digital identity. As the member of the House of Lords Claire Fox warns in the clip below, “this is a threat, potentially at least, to adult civil liberties and the right to privacy, and effectively means we’ll have to digitally verify to participate in the public square.” 🆔Social media ban = digital ID for the internet? Aside from FAILING to keep children safe, this proposal could force us all to "digitally verify to participate in the public square."@Fox_Claire opposes the proposed social media ban for under-16s at last night's debate pic.twitter.com/zSvxEF00Bk — Big Brother Watch (@BigBrotherWatch) January 22, 2026 Yet there is precious little reporting in the legacy media on these sweeping changes (quelle surprise!). As Jonathan Cook notes in the tweet below, Mahmood is effectively telling the British public that they are prisoners and that the government quite literally plans to become Big Brother using AI. Yet there is nary a word about it in the media (with the notable exceptions of The Telegraph and The National). This, of course, is also a feature, not a bug. Simply astonishing how little media coverage the UK government's plan to have us all under 24-hour surveillance is getting – especially in the context of scrapping jury trials and labelling political dissidents, like opponents of genocide, as "terrorists". Home Secretary Shabana… — Jonathan Cook (@Jonathan_K_Cook) January 22, 2026 The panopticon, in its original conception, is so controversial that it has barely been properly tried (though elements of it have been incorporated into the design of some prisons). The closest thing, the Presidio Modelo complex in Cuba, built in 1920, was so plagued by corruption and cruelty that it was abandoned. As Collingwood explains in the above tweet, the psychological effects of such living were considered too cruel for even prisoners to endure: Many indeed consider the entire concept of the Panopticon the foundation of the theory of totalitarian regimes in operation: if it could seek to arrange society so [that] every citizen may be watched at any time but cannot know whether they are being watched or not (e.g. the telescreens in Nineteen Eighty-Four’s Oceania) a regime could force all citizens to act as though they were being watched at any given time. And this is what our Home Secretary—the office in charge of the police and MI5 and the justice system—wants to impose on us. This is her dream society. Not even joking or embellishing. It is as if people like Mahmood read Orwell’s 1984, Huxley’s Brave New World, Phillip K Dick’s Minority Report and a host of other dystopian novels and came away with an instruction manual. Meanwhile, their big tech paymasters came away with new business models. Here’s Oracle’s Larry Ellison, the Tony Blair Institute’s largest donor, bragging about how an AI surveillance state will ensure that people are always on their best behaviour: Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison touts his company's new AI-monitored body cameras, which live stream footage back to headquarters and cannot be switched off. "Citizens will be on their best behaviour, because we're constantly recording and reporting everything that's going on."… pic.twitter.com/wuXhIhhbZf — Wide Awake Media (@wideawake_media) January 19, 2026 What often gets ignored in what little public discussion that is allowed on this topic is the fact that AI surveillance systems are as prone to making errors as most AI systems. The biases in facial recognition systems are already well documented. Just last month, the UK Home Office admitted that facial recognition technology is more likely to incorrectly identify black and Asian people than their white counterparts on some settings. Yet the systems are still being rolled out nationwide, inviting the question: feature or bug? There was also the recent controversy over West Midlands Police’s handling of its AI search for data about alleged Israeli football fan violence, which generated false claims of a non-existent match. The ensuing scandal undermined public confidence in officers’ use of the technology, reports The Telegraph. Perhaps more disturbing of all was Mahmood’s response to the scandal: she told MPs that AI was an “incredibly powerful tool that can and should be used by our police forces” but said it needed to be regulated in a way that was “always accurate”. In other words, in Mahmood’s mind, for AI systems to function correctly, all that is needed is the right sort of regulation. It is a masterclass in why bureaucrats should be kept as far away as possible from these technologies. Meanwhile, the energy and water demands of the data centres needed to run these AI systems are growing exponentially, as BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink laid out at Davos two years ago. Fink, who is now co-interim Chair of the World Economic Forum, said that data centres would need “massive power”, which he described as a huge “investment opportunity”. At the WEF, Larry Fink ironically destroys net-zero when it comes to the power needed for AI: "By 2030 [data centers] need 30 gigawatts.. Where's that power gonna come from? To power these data companies you can't have intermittent power like wind & solar" https://t.co/Cy4dU1Av9a pic.twitter.com/8Ymy53xgRx — Tim Hinchliffe (@TimHinchliffe) April 29, 2024 If anything, Fink appears to have been underestimating the scale of the problem by orders of magnitude. A January 2025 paper by RAND Corporation forecasts that “global AI data center power demand could reach 68 GW by 2027 alone and 327 GW by 2030, compared with total global data center capacity of just 88 GW in 2022.” Other estimates have placed it somewhat lower but still well into triple figures. And it won’t just be big tech companies and financial giants that will be footing the bill; it will be all of us, as Yves noted in her pre-amble to a recent cross-posted article by Jomo Kwame Sundaram on the growing global revolt against data centres: I find it remarkable that data center, as in AI, new energy demands are being foisted onto all customers. Those demanding incremental and higher cost energy should pay more. But instead the population at large is subsidizing AI, both through said energy costs plus also bearing the cost of additional pollution. And this is the really insulting part: not only do governments and the corporations whom they serve and represent plan to use AI to digitally imprison us; they want us to pick up the tab along the way. [1] According to a 2015 article in The Guardian, it wasn’t actually Bentham himself who came up with the idea: “The panopticon wasn’t originally Bentham’s idea. It was his brother’s,” says Philip Schofield, professor of the History of Legal and Political Thought and Director of the Bentham Project at UCL. “His brother Samuel was working in Russia on the estate in Krichev and he had a relatively unskilled workforce, so he sat himself in the middle of this factory and arranged his workforce in a circle around his central desk so he could keep an eye on what everyone was doing.” Bentham went to visit his brother in the late 1780s, saw what he was doing, and decided the centralised arrangement could be applied to all sorts of different situations – not just prisons but factories, schools and hospitals. Bentham managed to persuade the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger, to fund a panopticon National Penitentiary, but a stream of problems eventually meant the project was abandoned. Bentham never saw a panopticon built during his lifetime. [2] As I document in my 2022 book Scanned, the World Economic Forum, one of the most important purveyors of digital public infrastructure, admitted in a 2018 paper on digital identity that while verifiable digital identities “create new markets and business lines for companies”, they (emphasis my own) “open up (or close off) the digital world for individuals.” Which is precisely what we are beginning to see play out. [3] In 2011, former NC stalwart Phillip Pinkington wrote in an article on Jeremy Bentham’s theory of utilitarianism: The original theorist of utility was, of course, Jeremy Bentham who, as we have noted, also came up with the Panopticon. The Panopticon, as noted, was a totalitarian prison system wherein every prisoner was to be watched constantly by a central observer who monitors their behaviour. Bentham thought that this model could be extended to a variety of social institutions, giving rise to a terrifying vision of a totalitarian hell which was later to be captured in 20th century novels such as Orwell’s ‘1984’ and Huxley’s ‘Brave New World’. Bentham’s vision was downright paranoid, of course. But it says a lot about the psychology behind his theorising. This man was not a prophet of human freedom and actualisation. No, he was the harbinger of a dark vision of totalitarian control. And his theory of utility was but another manifestation of his own slightly villainous technocratic tendencies. In a January 2025 article on the Swiss government’s decision to table a second referendum on digital identity adoption, four years after two-thirds of Swiss voters rejected the government’s proposed e-ID system, we wrote: One of the main reasons why there is (seemingly) no alternative to digital identity is that there are simply too many powerful interests aligned behind it. It is the keystone of the new panopticon of digital public infrastructure (DPI) being constructed around us. For governments and national security agencies, the benefits are clear: expanded power and control at a time when economic conditions are about to get significantly worse for the vast majority of the population. For big tech companies, it will mean new opportunities to amass even more data over our lives, which they will then be able to transform into even more revenues and profits. For central banks and the TBTF banks whose interests they predominantly serve, it will mean even more centralised financial power in their hands. In May of the same year, we cross-posted a piece by John P. Ruehl, a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute, primarily on China’s evolving social credit system but which also explored the “sprawling and mostly unregulated personal scoring” systems that have been quietly built by US companies. The article finished with this stark warning: Though promoted as tools to encourage good behavior and deter bad conduct, these [social credit] systems amplify social pressure and push societies toward a digital panopticon — a state of constant surveillance driven by government and commercial incentives. These models will continue to mature and become more dangerous in the U.S. and other countries that lack adequate data protection. Without strict limits on surveillance by both governments and corporations, fears of AI misuse, algorithmic bias, false correlations, and harmful feedback loops will only grow as these scoring systems govern more of everyday life. UK will have to exit various human rights agreements first, such as ECHR, to avoid challenge. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights Maybe. And I hope so too. But if the elite “consensus” embraces these approaches then judges will surely find ways to reinterpret “human rights” law. When the profit motive, ideology and the urge to control align then the forces to drive this will be hard to stop. The only silver lining is that the modern UK state is so incompetent that it likely will struggle to do this. However, the 1984 state was similarly incompetent, except at exercising control. So perhaps incompetence and control do go together. Who will watch the watchers? Remember, remember, the 5th of November as Guido would say. Drumpf 3.0 You beat me to it. Of course governments used to use religion to control the lowers with God watching over all of us and meting out ultimate punishment for misbehavior. In this system even the powerful had to worry about their behavior and buy indulgences, make confessions to priests, death bed convert to monks if you were a warlord who spent his life slaughtering people. Tech is our new religion if you are a tech bro or a weak minded leader like Starmer or Trump. Real leaders have talent and lead by example. Phillip Pilkington for footnote 2 Fixed. Thanks tegpost. Orwell and others works mentioned certainly rhyme with what we are seeing develop. Globally. I guess it is the shared goals of total control and domination. The proof is in the suppression of political views (i.e. opposition to mass murder! Why is this controversial lol). This is very far from “protecting society” from what we used to think of as “criminals”. Now our countries police and military forces are being used to suppress the excersise of political rights. The definition of what is criminal and who is a criminal is paramount and we all know how that is decided (not by a democratic vote! Or even debate! ). For those not yet concerned, imagine your actions surveilled by someone like Trump 2.0 (anyone who disagrees with me is a “far left terrorist”). Still not worried? How about when your life is surveilled by Trump 3.0? One could come to the conclusion that the criminals are in charge. Nitpicking item: in footnote 2, Bentham is responsible for Utilitarianism, not Marginal Utility, which is a different concept developed by Jevons and Marshall, among others. Fixed. Thanks Frank. The descent of the west into authoritarianism seems to be general. More evidence too that Trump is less an aberration than a particularly direct (or even honest?) manifestation of what is happening more generally. Hard to see that the Democrats will put things back in the bottle if they win the mid terms and in 2028. They will likely continue the lurch to authoritarianism in a more subtle way than having armed agents wandering around cities. After all, Starmer, Blair et al are hardly Trumpers. Thank you Nick. Now to Stephen. Authoritarianism might have some justification if and when the authoritarian leadership would merit some cognitive trust which is obviously not the case with most if not all the professional and managerial castes of today, starting with this Mahmood and her candid an at the same time chilling declarations. When you can say things like those quoted here by Nick without having to face any consequence, backlash, correction, whatever, it is when the thing becomes really, really chilling. There is a near consensus amongst the leaderships. It would be nice if some whistleblower, let’s say from the BBC, would come up and say that she or he proposed to report on this but was cancelled by the directorate because…, because …, explain the reasons! Of course, someone not unwilling to risk the salary, being de-banked etc… Difficult. Right. When there is true control, of course, journalists know not even to propose to report on things that will not get approved. They have careers, after all. My recollection of 1930s German history is that very little overt censorship was needed, precisely for these reasons. Trump is overtly aggressive because his brand of authoritarianism lacks elite consensus. What follows will be far more pernicious, precisely because it will be supported by the elites. Larry Fink’s comments about data center power needs and intermittent renewable energy lacks context. To quote: “By 2030 [data centers] need 30 gigawatts.. Where’s that power gonna come from? To power these data companies you can’t have intermittent power like wind & solar“ 30 GW sounds like a lot, but average electricity consumption worldwide adds up to ~3500 GW. If the world can successfully provide 3500 GW of power with renewable energy, then the extra 1% imposed by data centers shouldn’t be any problem. And conversely, if the intermittency of wind and solar makes it too difficult to power a mere 30 GW of data centers with renewable energy, then there is no hope of powering the rest of the world that way. Now please understand… I find these proposals for AI-enhanced mass surveillance to be appalling, but the concerns about power requirements aren’t key. The utter loss of privacy and the inability to go on about your business (without somebody passing judgment as to whether or not it is politically approved) are much larger concerns. Thanks for your comment, Grumpy. I see your point, and I broadly agree with it: the worst aspects of this AI-enhanced mass surveillance are the threats it poses to privacy and the near-total loss of autonomy and personal agency, and with that in mind I have slightly reworded my somewhat glib ending. That said, the fact that we’re being asked to pony up some of the funding for this “digital panopticon” is still, I believe, pertinent. FWIW, it seems that Fink may have been underestimating the scale of the problem, by orders of magnitude. A January 2025 paper by RAND Corporation warns that global AI data center power demand could reach 68 GW by 2027 alone and 327 GW by 2030, compared with total global data center capacity of just 88 GW in 2022. Other estimates place it somewhat lower than that but still well into three figures. “The fact that we’re being asked to pony up some of the funding for this “digital panopticon” is still, I believe, pertinent.“ Oh, yes. With this I have no argument whatsoever. If new power stations are required to meet the electricity demands of new data centers, then the owners of those new data centers should pay for those power stations. Not other electricity customers who won’t even be using that power. And if this makes the costs for AI prohibitive, so be it. [And with DDR5 and SSD prices quadrupling, DDR4 prices tripling, and even old DDR3 and HD prices doubling, they’re already facing significant cost headwinds. I suspect a lot of the initial proposals for AI data centers didn’t account for computer HW getting 3X as expensive overall.] And if the new power requirements are closer to 327 GW rather than 30 GW, then financing costs become problematic, as it’s going to take many years to get all of that power deployed. Particularly if it has to be at least somewhat “green”. [That’s about the only potential silver lining I see in all of this. If somebody out there figures out how to do cost-effective “modular” nuclear for purposes of powering data centers, then we can use that technology to replace fossil-fueled power stations even if the AI bubble pops. And that may be possible. The last nuclear station in the US cost over $15000/kW, whereas the Chinese, Russians, and South Koreans have all built stations for less than $2500/kW. And in half the time.] Even if AI would be a mere 1% of current power energy demand, adding more demand when we need to fight tooth and nail to make all and every GW of power and every GWh of energy demand “sustainable” is not helping at all. On the contrary. Well, unless we believe those snake-oil salespeople insisting that AI and digitalization will result in net energy savings. I, for instance, do not believe in any of that. The idea of an Panopticon contained one huge flaw. Yes, a guard would be able to inspect hundreds of people in their cells but by the same token, those hundreds of prisoners were also watching any guards. But with digital technology, people can be spied on 24-7 and they will never know who is doing all this surveillance- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon Implementing a technology known to be extremely error prone in order to surveil and punish the populace – the ethos here from the would-be ruling class is quite clearly “Kill them all and let God sort them out”, but with Skynet taking the blame rather than the Starmers of the world. And lest we forget, Bentham lent his eloquence to the defense of pederasty in his essay titled “Paederasty”. Ironically the digital panopticon will no doubt be justified with the appeal to protecting children from…. Nick C. mentions “the Presidio Modelo complex in Cuba, built in 1920,” but it might be of interest to note that, back in ~1840, the Huron County Gaol, in Goderich, Ontario, Canada, was constructed on explicitly Benthamian ‘panopticon’ principles. It still stands. Incidentally, it was the site of Canada’s last public hanging, in 1869. Thanks for that little nugget, icancho. Interesting to see that the 19th century Ontarians made a better go of it than the early 20th century Cubans. Your email address will not be published.

Title: From the workplace to geopolitics to robots: Our team's Davos takeaways

And that's a wrap. Davos 2026 is in the books. I asked my colleagues who were on the ground with me to share their takes. It's a good mix of backgrounds (tech, finance, workplace) and Davos experience (from first timers to crafty vets). If you missed any of it, we covered the week as it unfolded. You can catch up with our day-by-day liveblogs here: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Here are our takeaways: Aki Ito: This was my first Davos, but from what I heard, previous years were marked by much more optimism about the immediate productivity gains AI would bring. This year the vibe was more sober. Most of my conversations were about why the ROI from AI has been so mediocre so far, and how to fix that. A lot of the fixes that I heard about involved the kind of massive overhauls that will almost certainly take large companies years and years to pull off. Underlying that reality was more than a hint of frustration from the Davos class. But the harder-than-expected transition is good news for the white-collar employees I talk to everyday. When disruption comes at lightning speed, people don't have time to prepare for it. When it happens over a more manageable timeline, we have time to learn new skills, to advocate for new protections, to try to shape the future we actually want. That doesn't mean massive change isn't coming eventually though. Lots for me to think about. For now I can't wait to catch up on sleep! Ben Bergman: Davos has always wanted to be the center of the world. This year, it felt like it actually was. President Trump brought traffic snarls, longer security lines, and most of all, he dominated conversations here. He also brought heft, making Davos feel much more important than it has than at any time in recent memory. This year's conference played host not just to the pie-in-the-sky discussions that usually dominate, but also high-stakes negotiations about the future of NATO, Greenland, and Gaza. Even Elon Musk, who had previously mocked Davos, could not stay away. Just as it appeared the summit had reached its apex on Wednesday, as some attendees began to work their way down the mountain, we learned that Musk's Gulfstream G650 was on its way to Zurich for a surprise interview with WEF interim chair Larry Fink. Fink, whose day job is as chairman and CEO of BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world, told Semafor he personally asked Trump to come, which in turn also attracted many of the biggest names in business. Fink, or whoever is the chair of WEF next year, has a tough act to follow. Dan DeFrancesco: Are we entering a new era in geopolitics, or is this just another example of President Donald Trump's aggressive dealmaking tactics? That's the question I've been thinking about this entire week. Some attendees I spoke to this week seemed optimistic. Sure, the threat of force against a longtime ally wasn't great. But a deal was ultimately brokered. And the US has too many resources to ignore. Others feel a real trust has been broken, and there will be no easy path back toward complete reconciliation. And the split on the debate among Europeans and Americans might surprise you. Two bankers I separately spoke to within the same firm were divided on the issue, with the American being the one who was feeling pessimistic. Kim Last: Jumping off of Aki's thoughts, I was most struck by the lack of answers many of the executives I spoke to had when it came to employing the next generation of workers. When pressed, of course there was an acknowledgment that AI is already reshaping the nature and future of entry-level white collar work. (Hello, grim anecdotes from recent college grads.) Davos has always been a platform for new ideas, yet the sense I have is that the leaders gathered here haven't deeply thought about the ways education or job preparation need to evolve to meet this moment for young workers —and their role in shaping and supporting that work. I've wondered several times this week what the future of middle managers will look like 10 years from now, and what that pipeline of workers might look like. In the previous years, it felt like education leaders had more of a front row seat to these conversations, but we know institutions are deep in rehauling how AI is rolled out in curricula. We might just have to see what happens next year. And, on a lighter note, my blowout hack lasted for the duration of the week. It's a Davos trick that never fails me. Jamie Heller: Maybe I'm late to the party, but I came away with a new appreciation for the excitement around "physical AI." The way I am coming to understand it, the large language models behind the chatbots we are all using are based on information the models scarf up from the digital world — essentially the internet — and then create digital outputs, like text, images, and video. Physical AI is about AI in the physical world — robots and machines. With AI, robots don't just do what they're told but are intelligent and can learn and adapt. I participated in three panels related to this, and while everyone acknowledges the standard level of Davos/tech hype, there was clear real excitement, including from savvy scientific types. Then, in the midst of all the Davos chatter, Business Insider's Grace Kay reported exclusive details on OpenAI's push into humanoid robotics — robots modeled after humans. Is it all the stuff of science fiction? As Elon Musk said this week at Davos, he wants to turn science fiction into "science fact" — and clearly many others do, too. How it all goes? We'll keep reporting for you. Jump to

Title: The U.S. was ‘the operating system of the world,’ Scott Galloway says, but now ‘the American brand is chaos, corruption, and coercion’

Good morning. When BlackRock CEO Larry Fink became co-chair of the World Economic Forum last year, he called up U.S. President Donald Trump and asked him to come speak, which he did. Fink also called Scott Galloway, an author, podcaster and NYU Stern marketing professor who has a very different view of what will make America great. As Galloway told me last night at our annual Fortune Global Leadership Dinner: “Larry Fink called me and said, ‘I want you to come.’ That was more than enough.” With all the focus at WEF on heads of state—I even joined a media scrum after Trump’s meeting with Ukraine leader Volodymyr Zelensky—I thought I’d bring you some insights from my conversation with Galloway. (I first met Galloway in 2009 as a fellow mentor at the Kairos Summit organized by then Wharton student Ankur Jain, who went on to found Bilt Group.) Galloway last attended WEF in 1999. “The call sign of America back then was consumerism; it was more cooperation, alliances. Now, I feel the American brand is chaos, corruption, and coercion,” he said. “America has been the operating system of the world … There’s just a sense of unease … In 1999, we said ‘we want more,’ now we want to make sure things don’t get worse.” He praised Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech as the best of the week. “All 27 member EU states should have been sitting behind him,” Galloway said. “Right now, it’s like Germany and the 26 dwarves.” In soliciting both Galloway and Trump to come to Davos, Fink understands the power of WEF in bringing opposing world views under one roof. I heard Saudi Tourism Minister HE Ahmed Al-Khateeb compare notes with Switzerland Tourism CEO Martin Nydegger, saw Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick chat with random people in the hall, including me, and witnessed dozens of global leaders find areas of commonality at our dinners and lunches. (That’s why I also appreciated having Deloitte, Aon, PMI, Toptal, and Workday sponsor editorial gatherings that let us create our own village greens.) On Monday, I moderated a CEO salon to discuss the results of the 2026 Edelman Trust Barometer, in which 70% of this year’s respondents expressed an “insular” mindset; they don’t want to talk to, work for, or even be in the same space with anyone who doesn’t share their world view. Richard Edelman told me CEOs need to urgently address the sense of grievance that’s consuming the business world. What leaders achieved at Davos is never immediately obvious—the details of the Greenland deal, for one, are still sketchy—but by showing up, Davos participants were at least coming together with an instinct to connect. That’s a good place to start.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Trump sues Dimon, JPMorgan President Donald Trump ramped up his attacks on Jamie Dimon and JPMorgan Chase on Thursday with a $5 billion lawsuit that claims the financial giant “unbanked” the president and his businesses for political reasons. Dimon has recently butted heads with Trump over Fed independence and the president’s plan to cap credit card interest rates. The bank says the lawsuit is without merit. Oil CEOs on Venezuela President Donald Trump has urged U.S. companies to invest in Venezuela’s oil infrastructure, but cheap fuel at home means slimmer profit margins for those companies. “I think everyone feels a bit slighted here,” the CEO of one big U.S. oil company told Fortune. Using AI to ‘solve’ disease Demis Hassabis, the Nobel Prize winner and pioneer behind Google Gemini, gave Fortune’s Allie Garfinkle a rare look inside his latest venture, Isomorphic Labs, an AI drug-design company that aims to create new, breakthrough medicines for some of the most “undruggable” diseases. “We’re trying to build a system, a process…to do maybe dozens of drugs each year,” he says.

Title: Is Ethereum the ‘one common blockchain’? BlackRock CEO weighs in

Fink points to Ethereum as the backbone of institutional tokenization. It’s not a stretch to say the 2025 cycle marked a shift toward “institutionalization.” Sure, while ETF launches in 2024 helped establish credibility and access, they alone didn’t drive meaningful adoption. Instead, adoption really accelerated once “utility-driven” assets moved on-chain. In that context, the Real World Asset (RWA) sector has clearly become the core engine powering institutional participation. Backing this, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called tokenization necessary and pointed to Ethereum [ETH] as the natural platform for it. The question, then, is whether this is merely theoretical or a case that holds real weight. A statement from a major firm like BlackRock was bound to create a stir. At the World Economic Forum, CEO Larry Fink emphasized the need for rapid adoption of tokenization, highlighting India and Brazil as two developing nations already leading the way with tokenized currencies. However, the real buzz came when Fink mentioned the “One Common Blockchain” to drive this shift. Naturally, market participants started asking which blockchain would fit the vision, with many pointing to Ethereum. Source: RWAxyz Looking at the numbers, the hypotheticals actually hold weight. For instance, Ethereum leads the RWA sector, controlling roughly 60% of the total $22.6 billion RWA market. By comparison, Binance Smart Chain [BSC] comes in second with just 10.2%, underscoring ETH’s dominance. On top of that, BlackRock’s token, BUIDL, has crossed $1.5 billion on Ethereum, while JPMorgan’s MONY token has officially launched, further reinforcing Fink’s narrative about ETH as the platform for tokenization. Given this, along with Ethereum’s RWA dominance and the broader trend of institutionalization, it’s easy to see why CEO Larry’s view that ETH could become the “one common blockchain” for tokenized assets holds weight. Still, at a fundamental level, what does this development actually mean? Larry Fink has repeatedly emphasized one key aspect: Fees. In contrast to TradFi, where buying an asset comes with platform fees, broker commissions, and other costs, purchasing tokenized assets costs much less. As Fink points out, this could become a major differentiator. Given that, the question naturally arises: Does Ethereum deliver on this promise? Even though prices have lagged, 2025 has pushed ETH forward at a fundamental level through its back-to-back major on-chain upgrades. Source: EtherScan The result? Average gas price has dropped to a multi-year low of 0.5 Gwei. At the same time, Glassnode’s latest report shows a sharp spike in Month-over-Month Activity Retention, meaning transactions are rising even as gas fees fall, bringing new wallets onto the network. In this context, Ethereum’s upgrades are doing more than improving technology. Instead, they’re driving real adoption, which makes Larry Fink’s take on ETH as the “one common blockchain” much more tangible. Hence, its dominance in RWA is becoming a major institutional bull case. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Davos 2026: Trump’s Greenland Taco and Carney’s rupture warning

Davos 2026 seemed to collapse into what physicists call a singularity, a point of infinite density from which nothing can escape. Its name was Donald Trump. There were several crises overshadowing this year’s World Economic Forum (WEF) – Russia’s war in Ukraine, AI bubble fears, revolution in Iran but the US president’s increasingly hostile stance on Greenland subsumed everything. The possibility that one Nato member might forcibly take another’s territory is anathema to the forum’s vision of a rules-based, multilateral system. Since his successful military operation in Venezuela at the start of the year, Trump had been ratcheting up the rhetoric on Greenland, hinting at possible military action, threatening tariffs against eight European countries if he didn’t get his way, while deriding Europe as weak and backward. It provoked the biggest rift in transatlantic relations since the second World War, one that will leave scar tissue. His attendance at Davos took on monumental importance, a clash between Trump’s world and the old world. In the end, he Taco-ed (as in Trump always chickens out). Not for the first time, he marched his troops to the top of the hill, triggering a moment of maximum global tension, only to disperse them and leave us all wondering what the hell that was all about. His Greenland climbdown came hours after a rambling speech, in which he asserted America’s supremacy, confused Greenland with Iceland and claimed only “stupid” people buy wind turbines. After a meeting with Nato secretary general Mark Rutte, he said he had found a “solution” and was therefore rescinding his tariff threat. Details are scant, but it seems to involve Denmark ceding sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases, not dissimilar to the UK’s sovereign bases on Cyprus. Talk of Trump’s bid to annex Greenland dominated Davos when Europe’s real security threat is in the east, in Ukraine, where resistance is gradually being worn down. Russia was the “unequivocal winner” in Europe’s rift with the US, said the Republic’s EU commissioner for justice Michael McGrath. Trump paradoxically claims he needs Greenland to fend off Russia’s security threat, while at the same time, he appears to be sympathetic to Russian war demands in Ukraine and inviting Vladimir Putin to join his proposed Board of Peace for Gaza, which had a launch in Davos on Thursday. Either way, his designs on the largely self-governing Danish territory have forced Europe to confront an uncomfortable truth: how much it needs Washington’s money and military might. The grovelling and knee-bending we’ve seen from European leaders over the past year has been cringey and seems only to have fed Trump’s megalomania. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, delivered perhaps the biggest rebuke of the European position, claiming leaders on the Continent were complicit in Trump’s wrecking ball agenda because they have failed to stand up to him. European efforts to negotiate with Trump, he said, were not diplomacy but stupidity. “There’s no diplomacy with Donald Trump: he’s a T.rex. You mate with him, or he devours you,” he said. Newsom, a vocal Trump critic, was barred from entering the US pavilion at Davos, a reflection of the pettiness that now passes for politics in the US. Judging from the hardening of European rhetoric, there’s an acknowledgment that its fawning approach to Trump has failed and that it must get tougher. The prospect of money managers in Europe weaponising capital, selling off US treasuries, was raised earlier this week in a note by Deutsche Bank as a way for the bloc to retaliate in the face of Trump’s continued threats. Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy added to the EU-bashing, claiming EU leaders were stuck in “Greenland mode” “Europe must learn how to defend itself,” he said. “Sending 14 or 40 soldiers to Greenland – what is that meant to achieve? What message does that send to Putin? To China? And perhaps, most importantly, what message does it send to Denmark?” But this year’s Davos was a tale of two speeches. If Trump’s represented one side of the geopolitical divide, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney made the case for the other. He pointed out that US hegemony, up to now, had created an imperfect or false rules-based order where the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient and where trade rules were enforced asymmetrically on the basis of economic and military power. But this imperfect rules-based order had been “useful”, helping to provide “public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes”. “We participated in the rituals, and we largely avoided calling out the gaps between rhetoric and reality,” Carney said. “This bargain no longer works. Let me be direct. We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition. “In a world of great power rivalry, the countries in between have a choice: compete with each other for favour or to combine to create a third path with impact. “[We] argue the middle powers must act together because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu,” he said. Articulate and politically astute, Carney stole the show. Tensions between Europe and the US are unlikely to end with a deal on Greenland (there are even doubts over whether that resolves the row). European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde reportedly walked out of a high-profile Davos dinner, hosted by BlackRock chief Larry Fink, during a speech by US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, which was heavily critical of Europe, a flash of what European leaders are really feeling behind their Trump’s appeasement noises. Lutnick was apparently at every gig in town, berating Europe and boasting about America’s superpower economy. In a Bloomberg interview at the event, he argued that outsourcing to low-cost producers failed workers in Ohio and Michigan, crediting the US administration’s tariffs for GM’s (General Motors) 60 per cent yearly stock jump and similar gains at Ford. It was a reminder of where Trump’s economic agenda originates. The US has lost close to five million manufacturing jobs since 2001, the year China joined the World Trade Organisation. The decline has been unprecedented by US standards and has created, or at least compounded, what’s often referred to as a rust belt from the midwest to the Great Lakes, an area that spans from western New York to Michigan and north Illinois and encompasses states like West Virginia, Ohio and Indiana. It was once the backbone of US industry, but it has now become synonymous with economic decline, population loss and urban decay. If Trump’s anti-federalist politicking dominated this year’s Davos, the counternarrative is that he led the largest-ever delegation into the hub of international co-operation and consensus-building. Even Elon Musk, one of the most outspoken critics of the event, wanted in on the action. He has previously criticised the gathering as elitist, unaccountable and disconnected from ordinary people, but got a speaking slot on Thursday. Insiders say many US firms are merely playing along with Trump, even sucking up to him, and perhaps using his power to leverage the EU for less regulation, but behind the scenes, they haven’t changed tack and are secretly hoping he will be hobbled in the upcoming US midterm elections. The polls suggest voters have soured on Trump and the Democrats will win big. Watching Apple boss Tim Cook shower Trump with gifts while announcing big domestic investments gives a false impression of what’s going on, say insiders. These companies haven’t changed their investment plans, haven’t pulled their offshore operations and haven’t changed course in any meaningful way. This might explain why, despite all the noise around Trump’s America First agenda, the Irish Government reported record corporate taxes last year while the IDA, the State’s investment agency, supported a record 323 investments, including 78 “new-name” investments, most of them from the US. On Wednesday, the IDA hosted its annual dinner at the Davos forum, a big set-piece event for the agency to highlight the Republic’s investment credentials. The invite list was kept confidential so US executives could keep their heads below the parapet. Taoiseach Micheál Martin gave the keynote address and the following day held bilaterals with several big US tech companies, including Apple, Meta and Microsoft. He said he had received positive feedback “in terms of the resilience of the Irish economy and the attractiveness of Ireland still as a location for investment”. He also highlighted that the State had been invited to join Trump’s controversial Gaza peace board but said no decision had yet been made. The US president is seeking $1 billion from countries for a permanent place on a board of peace aimed at resolving conflicts. The board was originally intended to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but the current iteration has broadened it to global conflicts and does not reference Gaza, a move which critics fear is designed to supplant the UN. Tánaiste Simon Harris said he could not see “any scenario” in which the Republic can participate. Martin, meanwhile, was due to discuss the board at Thursday evening’s emergency meeting of EU leaders. This year’s Davos was pitched as the last-chance saloon to save the old world order. Before the event, WEF president Børge Brende conceded it was taking place against “the most complicated geopolitical backdrop since the WEF was founded”. The think tank’s Global Risks Report, published on the eve of the summit, pinpointed trade wars, actual wars and economic disputes as the biggest threats to global stability in 2026, a reflection of the breakdown in consensus-building. Nonetheless, 56 years after it was founded, its pulling power remains. This year’s event commanded a record attendance with more than 60 heads of state or government, as well as 55 economy and finance ministers, and more than 800 chief executives or chairmen/women of companies. It included a whopping 200 discussion panels. Geopolitics is fraying, but a lot of the old forces remain, not least Davos itself.

Title: Ethereum fundamentals diverge from its price – Is this a bottom signal?

Time Published: 2026-01-23T05:00:10Z

ETH’s price recovery momentum depends on staying above $3,050. Ethereum’s fundamentals have been strong, despite the extended price consolidation observed since late 2025. In fact, according to Altcoin Vector, the altcoin section of the analytics firm Swissblock, the chain recently reached a record of 2.88 million transactions. This could be perceived as massive network usage and broader activity, but Altcoin Vector cautioned that 80% of the activity was “systematic noise” and not high quality. The firm cited recent scaling efforts as the “unintended” impact of cheaper, lower-quality transactions. Source: Altcoin Vector/Swissblock However, other network fundamentals have seen solid growth too. Ethereum staking, for example, crossed 30% for the first time, indicative of a strong appetite for yield and securing the network. On the tokenization boom, inclusive of stablecoins, BlackRock recently noted that Ethereum controls over 65% of the overall tokenized real-world asset (RWA) market. Source: BlackRock According to the world’s largest asset manager, if the traction continues, it could be beneficial to chains like Ethereum. Away from the on-chain fundamentals, there has also been consistent institutional demand for ETH over the past few quarters. Ethereum treasuries, for example, bought 1.2 million ETH in Q4 2025 – A whopping 26% increase on a quarter-to-quarter (QoQ) basis, according to Bitwise. Source: Bitwise Despite solid network traction, Ethereum’s [ETH] price was barely holding above $3k at press time. It was down 40% from the record level of $4.9k hit in 2025. For Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, however, the “divergence” between price and fundamentals might mean a market bottom is close. “That’s the kind of divergence you get at the bottom of bear markets, when sentiment is down, but fundamentals are up. The last time we had such high-contrast data was Q1 2023—after which crypto prices soared for the next two years.” According to Altcoin Vector, for ETH to maintain its mid-term bullish prospect, the $3,050-level must be reclaimed and defended as support. If so, the upside targets would be $3,250 and $3,650. Source: X/Altcoin Vector Otherwise, stalling below $3k could embolden bears to drag the altcoin to $2.600, analysts at Altcoin Vector warned. “Bearish perspective: Consolidating a new downward market structure below this pivot could pave the way for a move toward lows under $2,600.” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Show HN: The firmware that got me detained by Swiss Intelligence

Time Published: 2026-01-23T04:26:29Z
Full Content:
We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously. To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation. The firmware that convinced the Swiss State Prosecutor I wasn't a spy. 🚨 See the police report and the device in action on X/Twitter: https://x.com/s_heyneman/status/2014519007244656652 ⚠️ DECLASSIFIED: The source code audited by Swiss Security. Current Status: DECLASSIFIED / RELEASED Security Audit: PASSED (Auditor: "Chris", Swiss Forensic Unit) Duration: 13 Hours This is the exact firmware running on the prototype that caused the WEF Police to designate me a "Category A Threat." Hardware Note: The device that triggered the bomb squad was a dummy unit. It contained a breadboard and 4 bolts hot-glued to the casing. The wires were cut. The "Threat" was purely visual. Audit Note: Cleared by Swiss Forensic Expert "Chris" after reviewing the development logs and verifying the "AI Co-Founder" workflow. Verdict: "Truth Speaking." Military-Grade Encryption: None. It uses Serial.begin(115200). Institutional Verification: Hardcoded tft.println("ENTITY: BLACKROCK") on Line 146 to ensure maximum liquidity. Air-Gap Technology: It has no Wi-Fi chip, therefore it is unhackable. Threat Detection: A digitalRead() on a $2 plastic knob triggers a RED screen that says "RISK: CRITICAL." (This is the line that forced me to explain C++ to a forensic expert at 4 AM). Disclaimer: This code is for educational purposes only. Do not bring this code near a geopolitical summit. I came to the WEF to pitch my hardware startup (Verdico). The device is an air-gapped ledger. Because I haven't raised a Series A yet, the prototype is raw: exposed wires, a motherboard, and two heavy bolts hot-glued to a breadboard. To a VC in San Francisco, it looks like a Seed Round. To the Swiss Police in a high-security zone, it looked like an Improvised Explosive Device. Tuesday night, 11:45 PM at the Belvedere Hotel. I was starving. I saw a tray of salmon rolls, so I set the device down on a wooden counter to grab one. I chatted with a few people, came back 5 minutes later, and the device was gone. The bartender told me: "The police took it." I went to security to explain. They didn't give it back. They detained me. (Review: The prison lasagna is a solid 10/10. Highly recommend). This is where it gets relevant. My release didn't come from a lawyer. It came from a code review. The next morning, the State Prosecutor brought in a forensic technical expert named "Chris." Imagine the most stereotypical systems engineer—long neckbeard, small mustache, extremely serious. He didn't care about my pitch deck; he needed to prove the firmware wasn't a trigger mechanism. We sat in a caged patio area. I opened my laptop and walked a Swiss Federal Agent line-by-line through the repo. The Twist: I had to explain that I am a "vibe coder." I use 16 different Gemini Ultra accounts (to bypass rate limits) and Claude to write the bulk of my code. I literally had to "uncompact" the chat history to prove the provenance of the code to a forensic expert. We went through the crates. We checked the borrowing logic. We verified the "wires" were data buses, not detonators. Because it was Rust, the explicit error handling and type safety made it incredibly easy for him to verify what the device couldn't do (i.e., explode). After an hour, Chris turned to the lead investigator (Officer Meier) and said the two most beautiful words I have ever heard: "Totally good." Officer Meier told me she appreciated my "Truth Speaking." They gave me my shoelaces back and released me. My AI co-founder told me to go to Davos. It got me arrested. But the Rust compiler (and a very thorough forensic audit) got me released. I've open-sourced the repo that the Swiss Government audited. If it's clean enough for them, it's clean enough for you. The "Threat" in Swiss Police evidence bags. POLIZEI Spurensicherung = Police Forensics. The firmware that convinced the Swiss State Prosecutor I wasn't a spy. There was an error while loading.

Title: Odds of BlackRock CIO becoming next Fed chair peak ahead of Trump call

Time Published: 2026-01-23T02:53:02Z
Full Content:
Prediction markets anticipate potential leadership changes at the Fed with elevated odds for Rick Rieder. Powered by Gloria Traders on prediction markets pushed odds of BlackRock’s Rick Rieder becoming the next Federal Reserve chair to fresh highs as President Donald Trump’s decision nears. Rieder, BlackRock’s bond chief, saw his odds surge to nearly 35% on Kalshi and around 34% on Polymarket on Thursday. While he still trails White House economist Kevin Warsh overall, the gap narrowed over the past 24 hours as Warsh’s odds dropped 7% on Polymarket and 5% on Kalshi. Trump could decide on the next Fed chair as early as next week, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Speaking to CNBC this week, Bessent said the selection process began in September, included eleven candidates, and has now been narrowed down to four finalists whom Trump has personally met. Trump has signaled that he may already have made up his mind. In comments to CNBC at Davos, Trump said the shortlist had narrowed from three to two and “maybe one” candidate after months of interviews. Trump described Rieder as “impressive” while praising all the contenders. Prediction markets anticipate potential leadership changes at the Fed with elevated odds for Rick Rieder.

Title: A.I.’s Data Center Rush Will Create Six-Figure Trade Jobs, Jensen Huang Predicts

Time Published: 2026-01-23T01:47:56Z

Much has been said about A.I.’s potential to replace jobs. But Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is more concerned about A.I. creating a labor shortage—at least in the short term. As tech companies race to build data centers across the U.S. and around the world, they will need tradespeople such as plumbers, electricians and construction workers to make it happen. “This is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history. That’s going to create a lot of jobs,” said Huang during an interview with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. New labor opportunities will be especially concentrated in the trades, where Huang claims pay has already nearly doubled. Those who help build semiconductor plants, computer factories and data centers will soon be making “six-figure salaries,” according to the executive. “Everyone should be able to make a great living,” said Huang. “You don’t need a Ph.D. in computer science to do so.” The median annual pay for electricians in 2024 was around $62,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. It was roughly $46,000 for construction laborers and nearly $63,000 for plumbers, pipefitters and steamfitters. Growth for all three professions from 2024 to 2034 is expected to outpace the average occupational growth rate of 3 percent, with demand for electricians in particular surging. The field is projected to expand by 9 percent over the next decade, with about 81,000 openings projected annually on average. The U.S. is already seeing a “significant boom” in these areas, according to Huang—so much so that it has led to a “great shortage” in tradecraft roles. The A.I. boom is expected to worsen a worker deficit the industry was already facing. In December 2022, some 490,000 construction positions went unfilled, according to a McKinsey report, the highest level recorded this century. Huang isn’t the only CEO who believes A.I. will be a boon for trade jobs. Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir, described vocational skills as “very valuable, if not irreplaceable,” while speaking in Davos earlier this week. Ford CEO Jim Farley has made similar arguments on behalf of the blue-collar community, saying the country does not yet have a large enough workforce to support its data center ambitions. “I think the intent is there, but there’s nothing to backfill the ambition,” he told Axios in August. The opportunity for A.I.-driven manual labor jobs won’t be limited to the U.S., Huang added, but will extend around the world as data center construction accelerates. “There is not one country in the world I can imagine where you [don’t] need to have A.I. as part of your infrastructure.” We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Title: Letters to the Editor, January 23rd: On the hard life of a commuter, the world according to Trump, flu vaccines and speedy passports
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/2026/01/23/letters-to-the-editor-january-23rd-on-the-hard-life-of-a-commuter-the-world-according-to-trump-flu-vaccines-and-speedy-passports/
Time Published: 2026-01-23T01:00:00Z
Full Content:
Sir, – Before commuters rejoice at hearing that affordable housing is only 2½ hours away in Newry, I think every sitting Minister should be encouraged to make use of existing public transport infrastructure so they have critical hands-on experience (“Newry is evolving into a commuter hub for Dublin. The strain is already showing,” January 18th). I’d like to see a Minister sweating on an overheated, overcrowded Dart at 8.15am while it has to mysteriously stop for 10 minutes at Grand Canal station. Add a buggy with a fractious toddler who is heading to the only childcare they could find with places for additional points. Extra points also if it’s lashing rain, or the train is delayed because of leaves on the track. On the way home, the Minister can only leave the office at 5pm but must collect the kids from the creche, minimum 13km away from the office, by 5.45pm. Extra points if the creche is in excess of 15km away from work. I’d like to see a Minister attempt to get to a 9am meeting or lecture on time by taking two buses to cross the city – they can choose whether they’d prefer to start in Blackrock and get to DCU, or start in Phibsboro to get to Belfield. Points deducted for being late. Extra points if they have to wait more than 10 minutes for the connecting bus but still make it on time. After this, we can see how they can live in Clare but commute to work in Cork, or Athlone while living in Leitrim. More challenges can be submitted by commuters across the country. Diary of a Minister on public transport could be the next Irish Times sensation. Give the people what they want. Then we’ll all move to Newry. – Yours, etc, ALISON TREACY, Glenageary, Co Dublin. Sir, – The suggestions to improve transport services outlined by Ola Løkken Nordrum appear eminently sensible (Letters, January 22nd). He might consider submitting them to Dublin Bus, where they could earn €15,000, rather than to The Irish Times. – Yours, etc CONOR McDONNELL, Dundrum, Dublin 16 Flu vaccines and older people Sir, – We know from numerous studies that the standard-dose flu vaccine reduces the incidence of flu and hospitalisation from flu by around 50 per cent, +/– 20 per cent depending on the year and the flu virus type. The argument in favour of high-dose flu vaccine/enhanced flu vaccine in the elderly has been a question of debate. Just published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) are two studies in over 65 year olds. One from Denmark and the second from Spain compare the extra benefits of the enhanced vaccine. In the Danish study, with 332,438 participants who underwent randomisation, 166,218 were assigned to receive the high-dose vaccine and 166,220 to receive the standard-dose vaccine. It showed a reduction in hospital admissions from flu by 43 per cent. The Spanish study randomised 103,169 and it showed a reduction in hospital admissions from flu by 31 per cent. The incidence of serious adverse effects was the same with both vaccines in both studies. The accompanying editorial concluded: “The results of these two trials are consistent with previous data showing incremental benefit of the high-dose vaccine and support the recommendation in the United States that higher-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccines are preferred over standard-dose vaccines for adults 65 years of age or older. “In countries that do not yet use high-dose vaccine, these trials provide additional evidence of its benefit for policymakers.” The Department of Health and the HSE will shortly be deciding on whether to get the standard-dose vaccine as they did this year for the over 65 year olds or the higher-dose vaccine. These New England Journal of Medicine published studies will hopefully help them to choose the higher-dose flu vaccine for the elderly and thus lessen hospital admissions of this vulnerable group at a time of year when hospitals are overstretched. – Yours, etc, J BERNARD WALSH, Clinical Professor, St James’s Hospital and Trinity College, Dublin. Dealing with Trump world Sir, – It seems at times like US president Donald Trump is merely a figment of the imagination, a ridiculous illusion conjured up by some kind of fantasy fiction writer. His flurry of maniacal midnight posts on Truth Social, his utter disregard for the transatlantic alliance, even his curious grammatical choices paint a picture of a deeply unserious man. And yet he is dead serious, about everything he says and does. Keith Duggan’s suggestion that 2026 may prove to be Trump’s last year as “the only relevant player on the stage” is not as wild as some may think it to be. It may help to explain just exactly what Trump is doing here (“This might be Donald Trump’s last year as the only relevant player on stage,” January 20th). The 47th US president is shaping his legacy. He no longer cares to the same extent about what the American people think. Instead, he is much more concerned about writing his name into the record books, about how he is viewed in the grand sweep of American presidential history. There is a reason he invoked William McKinley in his inauguration speech exactly a year ago; there is a reason he has refashioned the Monroe Doctrine in his own particular style; there is a reason he is now intent on acquiring Greenland and effectively replacing the United Nations with his so-called Board of Peace. All of these actions are part of an attempt to reshape America and indeed the world order, reinforce American supremacy and write himself into the record books as one of the most consequential presidents in history. The trouble is he is frighteningly good at what he does. Trump, it must be said, often has a point. Many of the arguments he makes are somewhat valid, but his answer to them is to overreach spectacularly. On everything from Arctic security (Greenland), to immigration, to European defence spending and Nato, he starts off with a legitimate grievance, and then goes way beyond what is necessary. He is now emboldened like never before. Expect the legacy building and the overreaching to continue. – Yours, etc, THOMAS CONWAY, Ballina, Co Tipperary. Sir, – Yesterday Donald Trump appeared to confuse Iceland with Greenland, while threatening Denmark because he was upset that Norway had not given him a prize, for among other claims, ending a war between Albania and Azerbaijan. It seems this is less 4D chess, and more Buckaroo with the global world order. – Yours, etc, SHANE O’NEILL, Bishopstown, Cork. Sir, – Listening to the recurring repetitive words of “cool . . . calm, rational dialogue . . . reasonable . . . engagement”, uttered by our Taoiseach Micheál Martin in response to whatever latest crazy outlandish demand comes from US president Donald Trump on managing the world his way, no matter how bizarre or unjust, I would ask him and others in Government: where is our red line? Do we have one? Or are we waiting for the next act in this drama before considering that question? How can you dialogue with a bully? We have seen that strong confrontation is the only thing that works to make Trump step back. Are we in Europe going to continue to dance madly to the tune of a narcissistic, vain, power-grabbing individual suffering delusions of grandeur? Europe does have its own power as outlined in the Opinion piece by Ben Tonra (“This crisis is not ultimately about Greenland. It’s about something much bigger,” January 20th). Political will is what is needed here as in many other areas requiring implementation of necessary, but radical, change for the public good. Can our Government give a lead in the EU and stop bending over backwards in appeasement until our spine breaks? Stand firm and support those in Europe who advocate firm action beyond mere words. It may cost us, but is a time coming when we will have to choose between economic expediency and democratic justice and equality – starting at home? – Yours, etc, INGRID MASTERSON, Churchtown, Dublin 14. Sir, – I often think of neutrality as akin to an altercation between two players on a football field. The row can escalate as players of both teams join in the fracas on behalf of their teammates. Yet some players deliberately choose to remain neutral, recognising that restraint can be more important than involvement. A few days back, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee voiced her support for the Denmark/ Greenland position against Donald Trump – dangerously joining the voices of the Nato countries. What right had she to do this? Ireland is a neutral country. Our responsibility is to preserve our neutrality, stand apart from international melees, and keep sight of the broader picture. – Yours, etc, PHILIP O’NEILL, Ranelagh, Dublin 6. Israel and Palestine Sir, – On Monday, responding to the news that Ireland has been invited to join US president Donald Trump’s proposed Board of Peace, Minister for Foreign Affairs Helen McEntee declared that the UN “has a unique mandate to maintain international peace and security”, and insisted that “Ireland’s commitment to the UN and the primacy of the UN Charter is without question”. On Tuesday, Israeli bulldozers demolished buildings within a UN Palestinian refugee agency compound in Occupied East Jerusalem, with Israel’s far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, triumphantly posing for a video as the buildings collapsed behind him. Sadly, the self-assurance of Israeli authorities as they commit such blatant acts is entirely warranted; even governments such as ours that routinely invoke their regard for international law and champion the primacy of the UN are utterly unwilling to take concrete action to disincentivise the Israeli state’s expansion in the Occupied West Bank. Between them, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have formed the backbone of successive governments that have blocked the Occupied Territories Bill, by one means or another, for seven years and counting. Their record has been to assure Israeli authorities of continued impunity for such war crimes. Little wonder then that the Israeli government feels emboldened to do as they wish. If our Government stand for anything, they must pass the Occupied Territories Bill in full, and fast. – Yours, etc, BRIAN Ó ÉIGEARTAIGH, Donnybrook, Dublin 4. Still waiting Sir, – Easy peasy to beat Simon Blake’s Christmas postal record (Letters, January 22nd). On December 16th, I posted, in Dunshaughlin, cards to people in Dunshaughlin, a short walk from where I posted the cards. They haven’t arrived yet. I win. – Yours, etc, MARGARET McCANN, Dunshaughlin, Co Meath. Cyclists and safety issues Sir, – I agree wholeheartedly with Mary O’Sullivan (Letters, January 21st) regarding the urgent need for the Government to take action on the introduction of mandatory wearing of hi-vis jackets by cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists. Back in 2020, I wrote to the then minister of state with responsibility for road safety, Hildegarde Naughton, to appeal for the introduction of such legislation. I was very disappointed by the response, which was as follows: “To create a statutory obligation on the wearing of reflective clothing would entail making it a criminal offence under Road Traffic legislation for any person guilty of not wearing high visibility clothing. “A person in breach of such a provision would fall to be issued with a fixed charge notice or summonsed to court, depending on what procedure would be put in place for the processing of such offences. Minister Naughton believes that this would prove difficult to enforce and be regarded as a very severe step”. Given that the number of road deaths has increased exponentially since then, exacerbated by the widespread use of e-scooters, it is now time for the officials in the Department of Transport to take a proactive approach and prepare legislation for the obligatory wearing of hi-visibility clothing and substantial on the spot fines for failure to do so. – Yours, etc, ALISON FERGUSSON, Stillorgan, Co Dublin. Inclusion in schools Sir, – I am writing in response to Derval McDonagh’s letter (January 22nd), in which she refers to reforming and resourcing schools so that all schools are appropriate for children. While this ambition is welcome, reform and resourcing alone are not sufficient. The physical infrastructure of many of our schools was not designed with inclusion in mind and continues to present significant barriers. Old buildings with narrow corridors, inaccessible toilets, poor acoustics, lack of sensory spaces, as well as overcrowded classrooms make genuine inclusion impossible for many children with disabilities, medical needs, and neurodivergent profiles. No amount of goodwill or policy reform can compensate for buildings that are fundamentally unsuitable. Too often, inclusion is treated as an attitudinal or pedagogical issue, placing the burden on schools and children to adapt to environments that actively exclude them. This approach avoids the need for sustained capital investment and results in accommodation rather than true inclusion. If all schools are to be appropriate for all children, accessibility and universal design must be treated as non-negotiable foundations. Without addressing the physical reality of our school buildings, claims of inclusive education remain hollow. – Yours, etc, SANDRA DOODY, Stillorgan, Dublin. Smooth operator Sir, – In today’s Letters (January 22nd), Séamus McGowan seemed upset that Frank McNally was creased in his Irish Times on January 21st. Well, he was as smooth as usual in my Irish Times. – Yours, etc, NORA Ní MHAOLCATHA, Knocklyon, Dublin 16. Friendly faces at the airport Sir, – While reading Sean Moncrieff’s column, “There are some things we do better than other countries”, (January 17th), I couldn’t help but recall our experiences travelling through US airports a few years back with our two boys then aged nine and seven. It was shortly after 9/11 and every airport we went through we were met with stern, intimidating immigration officials. On our return, departing from Washington, I was asked to step aside and questioned exhaustively because, it seemed, of a missing stamp of departure from years earlier – the result was we missed our flight back to Dublin. We had to stay overnight and book a new flight the following day. Arriving into Dublin we were greeted by a warm, friendly faced, handsome, curly haired immigration official, who we will remember forever (might have been a Kerry accent). My nine year old said: “Ma, I love Ireland.” – Yours, etc, MARY P O’KANE, Derry. Speedy passport service Sir, – Credit where credit is due: I applied online for passport renewal on Sunday evening, January 18th. The new passport arrived in the post on Wednesday morning, January 21st. Thank you Department of Foreign Affairs. – Yours, etc, TOM CLEARY, Dublin 4. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Elon Musk makes the case for why his $2.2 trillion tech empire is the only way to save humanity as the only intelligent life in the universe
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/22/elon-musk-davos-tech-empire-built-on-idea-humans-only-intelligent-lifeforms-aliens/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T23:11:15Z
Full Content:
Despite Elon Musk’s multiple proclamations that he is an alien—something he reiterated on the stage of the World Economic Forum on Thursday—the billionaire SpaceX CEO thinks it’s very unlikely there is intelligent life beyond Earth. In a conversation in Davos, Switzerland, with BlackRock CEO and World Economic Forum interim chair Larry Fink, Musk said this belief is the framework of his technology ventures and $600 billion of wealth. Because there’s a small likelihood of life outside of Earth, Musk said the project of preserving humanity becomes more urgent. I’m often asked, ‘Are there aliens among us?’ And I’ll say that I am one. They don’t believe me,” Musk said, unclear if he was joking or what particular point he was trying to make by asserting his alienness. “Or you’re from the future,” Fink responded, alluding to previous times Musk has called himself a 3,000-year-old time-travelling vampire. “The bottom line is, I think we need to assume that life and consciousness is extremely rare and it might only be us,” Musk added. “And if that’s the case, then we need to do everything possible to ensure that the light of consciousness is not extinguished.” Musk’s vision of protecting humanity manifested more than a decade ago, when he founded OpenAI alongside Sam Altman in 2015 with the hopes of addressing the existential risks and safety concerns associated with the budding technology. He told Fink that Tesla and SpaceX, worth $1.4 trillion and $800 billion, respectively, were an extension of this belief, with the purpose not only to create sustainable technology, but “sustainable abundance.” Musk reiterated his vision of an abundance of humanoid robotics that would make work optional, claiming technology would ease the burden of humans to have jobs or even have money. “With robotics and AI, this is really the path to abundance for all,” Musk said. “People often talk about solving global poverty, or essentially, how do we make everyone have a very high standard of living? I think the only way to do this is AI and robotics.” The billionaire describes a world with billions of robots—which would outnumber humans—and would serve to complete tasks including caring for children and elderly parents. He predicted that there would be functional humanoid robot technology by the end of the year, and said he expected those robots to be retail available in the next couple of years. To be sure, Tesla’s own Optimus robots have hit snags, continuously falling behind production schedule, with Musk saying as recently as Tuesday that manufacturing for the bots, as well as the Tesla Cybercab, would be “agonizingly slow” before production eventually ramped up. Musk has previously said humans would be able to sustain themselves without work through a universal basic income, but did not provide details on the political steps needed to provide that income to humans. These missions to preserve humanity extend beyond earth. Musk has described his goals as “Mars-shot,” alluding to his hopes to put human life on Mars, efforts he has even touched on in Tesla’s financial filings. The CEO has previously said he envisions Mars as an insurance policy for the future of humanity, wanting to use it as a jumping off point to expand resources to explore human consciousness. “I’ve been asked a few times like, ‘Do I want to die on Mars?’” Musk said on Thursday. “And I’m like, ‘Yes, but just not on impact.’” Musk’s philosophy regarding extraterrestrial life has previously engaged with the Fermi Paradox, a theory positing that there’s both a high change of intelligent life outside of earth—and scant evidence to prove it. In 1950, Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, an architect of the atom bomb, asked a question in a conversation with colleagues at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico: “Where is everybody?” The three-word inquiry launched a 1963 paper by American astronomer Carl Sagan and proliferated in the scientific community, and the popularized Fermi Paradox soon emerged. Musk said in an X post in 2023 that humans “are the only tiny candle of consciousness in an abyss of darkness.” “The scariest answer to the Fermi Paradox is that there are no aliens at all,” he said. In 2022, Musk even commissioned a sculpture depicting the “Fermi Great Filter,” a potential resolution to the Fermi Paradox hypothesizing that intelligent life must face and overcome a series of challenges, including the Great Filter which only few evolved species are able to overcome. The statue shows a giant fork with two diverging paths, indicating the choices a civilization must make to survive: a fork in the road, a motive Musk has oft drawn on. The high-stakes nature associated with Musk’s philosophy has drawn concern, with some arguing this effort to preserve humanity is actually threatening it. Rebecca Charbonneau, a historian at the American Institute of Physics, had a different interpretation of Musk’s philosophy as it pertained to work. In a piece published in Scientific American in February 2025, Charbonneau said Musk’s beliefs around preserving humanity reflected a bigger ideology in the world of tech. Roots in vestiges of Cold War anxieties (the same time period in which the Fermi Paradox emerged), tech leaders often saw a false binary of either limitless prosperity or complete societal collapse, Charbonneau argued. As a result, many in the field, including Musk, are willing to go to extreme measures in the name of avoiding what they perceive as humanity’s demise. “Proponents of this survivalist mindset see it as justifying particular programs of technological escalation at any cost, framing the future as a desperate race against catastrophe rather than a space for multiple thriving possibilities,” Charbonneau wrote. She noted that Musk’s “Fork in the Road,” a strategy he employed both in culling staff at X and in the federal government as de facto leader of DOGE, was reflective of this. Musk called DOGE the “chainsaw of bureaucracy,” promising to shave $2 trillion in federal spending. Instead, the advisory eliminated about $150 billion in spending through headcount reductions and contract cancellations. Federal workers said the cuts made their jobs harder, eliminating valuable resources that resulted in their jobs taking longer, with the quality of the government’s work suffering. Charbonneau argued Musk’s philosophy eliminates opportunities for nuance, making institutions—and humanity—vulnerable to often extreme responses to delicate situations. “By framing humanity’s challenges as simple engineering problems rather than complex systemic ones, technologists position themselves as decisive architects of our future, crafting grand visions that sidestep the messier, necessary work of social, political and collaborative change,” she said.

The Bitwise Proficio Currency Debasement ETF, which trades on the NYSE under the ticker symbol BPRO, is issued in partnership with Proficio Capital Partners, a Boston-based investment advisory firm that manages around $5 billion in assets, according to a press release. The actively-managed fund, which adjusts exposure to various assets in relation to market conditions, will seek to have at least a 25% stake in gold at any point, alongside strategic allocations to silver, platinum, palladium, mining equities, and Bitcoin. Today, the debasement trade has a new weapon in its arsenal. Introducing the Bitwise Proficio Currency Debasement ETF (NYSE: BPRO), a first-of-its-kind, actively managed investment strategy targeting assets poised to benefit from the eroding purchasing power of fiat currencies… pic.twitter.com/kpKPFK26p0 — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) January 22, 2026 The fund’s debut comes as gold and silver prices have respectively climbed 79% and 207% over the past year to new heights, according to Yahoo Finance. Meanwhile, the largest digital asset by market cap has slid 15% over the last year despite hitting a fresh peak above $126,000 in October, according to CoinGecko. Over the past year, the so-called debasement trade has grown in prominence, bolstered by fears that governments, particularly the U.S., could try to finance deficits with cheaper money. The trade is also linked to expectations of money printing and inflation, which has the potential to destroy lots of wealth very fast, according to Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan. “My view is that the biggest risk to the long-term financial health of a wealthy family is actually debasement,” he told Decrypt. “I’m not saying that the dollar is going in that direction, but it's lost a lot of value over the last 15 years, and that loss of value is accelerating.” Hougan said the product is designed for financial advisors who may have “0% exposure to something that covers their biggest flank for losing wealth over time,” adding that his son owns a $10 trillion Zimbabwean dollar banknote as a curio. The country faced hyperinflation in 2008. BPRO has an expense ratio of 0.96%, meaning that it’s more costly for investors to hold than Bitwise’s $3.5 billion spot Bitcoin ETF, which features a 0.2% expense ratio. That fund is the fifth-largest spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. by assets under management. Ray Dalio, the billionaire hedge fund manager, has been advising people for at least a year to allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold and Bitcoin, warning of a looming debt crisis among major economies. However, he has expressed a strong preference for the precious metal, doubting Bitcoin’s ability to become adopted by central banks. “The big demand category that's driven the gold move was central bank purchases, which started in earnest in 2022,” Hougan said. “Eventually, that excess demand dried up all the available supply, and we got this parabolic move.” Last year, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described Bitcoin and gold as “assets of fear.” However, the digital asset has behaved more like a risk-on asset lately, analysts say. Fink said fears over financial and physical security could also drive investors toward the assets. Central banks aren’t buying Bitcoin, but Hougan pointed to spot Bitcoin ETFs, and the demand they’ve seen from institutional investors, as a similar dynamic. Collectively, they’ve been buying more than 100% of the Bitcoin that’s mined each day since their debut in early 2024, he added. “My thesis is, if ETF purchasers continue to buy more than 100% of the supply of Bitcoin, eventually it will have the same parabolic move that gold did,” he said. “It's really just supply and demand, and gold has this extra demand dynamic of central banks that Bitcoin doesn’t have.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2026 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Why Tokenization Took Center Stage at Davos 2026 and What It Signals for Crypto Investors
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/tokenization-took-stage-davos-2026-signals-crypto/
Time Published: 2026-01-22T22:00:37Z
Full Content:
At the 2026 World Economic Forum in Davos, crypto moved away from price cycles and ideological debates toward a more practical focus: how blockchain is being used inside the global financial system. Across panels, side events, and executive interviews, tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) emerged as the clearest signal of where crypto is heading next. With the value of tokenized assets now exceeding $22 billion, Davos framed tokenization less as an experiment and more as infrastructure in active use. The shift was evident in both the tone and the participants. Rather than startups pitching concepts, conversations featured central bank officials, large asset managers, and executives from firms in the tokenization space. The emphasis shifted from whether blockchain belongs in finance to how quickly it can be scaled. Panels such as “Is Tokenization the Future?” underlined how assets traditionally seen as illiquid, bonds, equities, funds, and real estate, are increasingly represented on-chain. Executives from Coinbase and Ripple, alongside European Central Bank officials, described tokenization as a way to reduce settlement times, improve liquidity, and allow fractional ownership without rebuilding the financial system from scratch. Institutions including BlackRock, BNY Mellon, and Euroclear confirmed they have moved beyond pilot programs and are deploying tokenized instruments at scale. Data shared during the forum showed that the total value locked in tokenized RWAs has passed $22 billion, reflecting broader asset coverage and growing institutional participation. Ethereum currently hosts more than 65% of these assets, underlining its role as the main settlement layer for tokenization activity. Regulatory clarity was repeatedly cited as the key factor behind this momentum. Frameworks finalized in 2025 in the US and parts of Europe provided banks and custodians with clearer rules on issuance, custody, and compliance. In Davos, US President Donald Trump reinforced this direction by pointing to the GENIUS Act, which established a federal framework for payment stablecoins. Stablecoins were described as the “plumbing” connecting traditional finance, decentralized finance, and tokenized assets. Rather than competing with banks, they are increasingly used for settlement, treasury operations, and cross-border transfers. For investors, Davos 2026 suggested that crypto’s next growth phase may be less speculative and more structural. Consulting firms such as McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group estimate that tokenized assets could reach between $2 trillion and $16 trillion by 2030. The focus on regulated products, institutional adoption, and market infrastructure points to a longer-term shift.
