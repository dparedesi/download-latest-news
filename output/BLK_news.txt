Title: Kevin Power: Literary magazines are all the more vital for operating off the commercial grid

Last week, my Irish lit-mag slog took me through the uplands and lowlands of nonfiction country, with its personal essays and activist journalism, its mixed-media photo-essays and longform critical badgerings. This week, we’re doing the fiction and the poetry. I might as well say at this point that I feel largely unqualified to judge contemporary poetry. If pushed, I work with a flexible axiom, to wit: I don’t know much about poetry, but I know what I like. You have been warned. I’ll begin with The Stinging Fly, by now a grandparental presence on the Irish lit-mag scene. The Fly’s founding editor, Declan Meade, has now stepped backward or upward to oversee a miniature publishing empire, and the magazine proper is edited by the novelist Lisa McInerney (author of The Glorious Heresies). But the spirit of the mag feels consistent, which is to say that it continues to publish elusive, modernist-inflected short fiction that makes you laugh when it doesn’t make you scratch your head (and you could say the same about the poetry). [ Lisa McInerney: ‘I’m a hoor for attention. It has to be good attention, though’Opens in new window ] Highlights of the Winter 2024-25 issue include The Wrong Thing, a story about grief, shock, and consciousness itself by Keith Ridgway; a pleasantly meandering personal essay about a 2005 visit to Sudan by Eimear McBride; and a spooky, memorable story by a young writer appropriately named James Young, called Long Term Parking. This starts out like a chatty blog post about a Sopranos episode (Long Term Parking) and becomes something much deeper and darker by gradual strange degrees. Potent stuff. Also potent: a poem by Karl Parkinson called Don’t Want to Die, which would suffer in quotation; buy the issue, read the poem. Banshee, founded in 2014 by Claire Hennessy, Eimear Ryan, and Laura Cassidy, appears twice a year. In spirit feminist and Irish (hence the name), Banshee nonetheless publishes ecumenically across all genders, and each issue contains a mixture of poetry and prose. Issue 18 (Autumn/Winter 2024) features an extract from Rosita Sweetman’s forthcoming memoir, which is wonderfully titled A Girl with a Fork in a World of Soup, and which, on the evidence of this extract, has an equally wonderful first line: “The first thing I remember is being in Mum’s womb.” [ Rosita Sweetman: As a wife and mother I learned feminism all overOpens in new window ] Banshee Issue 18 also includes Memory Prompts, a personal essay by Ruby Eastwood about various visits to her father in Barcelona: “Remember that his carefulness is not just the carefulness of the very drunk, that he’s like this even in his brief moments of sobriety.” The “memory prompts” of the title are instructions composed on the Notes app of Eastwood’s phone, “a series of imperatives” – self commanding self, that is, to recall the vital details of this most vexed, and most personal, of relationships. It’s a powerful piece. Ragaire, published out of Galway, is a newcomer; Issue 1 appeared this summer. A “ragaire”, the editors tell me, is someone who enjoys walking at night, when things look and feel secretive, different. The Ragaire vibe is one of disquiet; I like it. Issue 1 features both poetry and prose. Even Keel, a poem by Helen Campbell, is laid out like a right-angled triangle: “A/tiny/pill will/give you the/illusion of skimming/over the surface of life,” it begins, and ends with its longest line: “someday you will wake up to know that sailing is not a substitute for living.” Striking work. Ragaire also includes Tepid, a five-page short story by Phoebe Santow about a young woman spending a college semester abroad in Dublin. That description might ring alarm bells (not another one!), but this strange, numb story, with its perfectly controlled paragraphs, generates real insight and a deep sense of unease. Last line: “My hands grip his back like a retreat into childhood.” That’s the good stuff. The Four-Faced Liar is published out of Cork (but nobody’s perfect); it is a conspicuously beautiful object, a large-format magazine with photographs and artwork gorgeously printed. It offers a poetry and prose mix, or perhaps buffet is the word I’m looking for. The vibe is bouncy, funny, with underlying darkness. Issue 2 contains a short story about grief by Conor Griffin, Too Good for Charity, which begins with the line, “In some ways I enjoyed the aftermath of my father’s death,” and only gets better from there. “In school I was the type […] who induced a sigh of relief from many a father when I showed up shy-eyed and strangling a wilting corsage to collect his daughter for the debs.” Jokes in fiction are a sign that the writer’s intelligence is operating in high gear. A joke that also beautifully reveals character? In the trade, we call that a twofer. Also worth picking up a copy of The Four-Faced Liar for is a very short story called Unsent Application to Become a Foster Parent by Andrew Rucker Jones. This takes the form of increasingly long, increasingly funny, and increasingly heartbreaking responses to the questions posed by the eponymous application form. It stayed with me. Flash fiction, like poetry, occupies a zone of literary achievement to which I am largely a stranger (look, we’re all philistines about something). Splonk, an online flash-fiction journal edited by the novelist Nuala O’Connor, therefore introduced me to what is, I think, essentially a non-narrative form, or perhaps a narrative halfway house between the prose poem (which no one has ever satisfactorily defined) and the vignette or sketch (also never satisfactorily defined). Issue 12 of Splonk features The Questions by the splendidly named poet Partridge Boswell; its elusive and allusive paragraphs seem to be about a father speaking to a son, and its closing lines achieve a unique effect, not quite that of a conventional short story: “Life is so f**king long, my favourite professor told me at a back porch kegger after graduation. Tap in hand, I nodded and refilled his cup. I didn’t have the heart then to tell him what I don’t have to tell you now. He was wrong.” Sinéad Creedon and Orla Murphy, Dublin-based writers and editors, have been publishing Sonder since 2019; they’re now up to Issue X, and Belfast-based writer Aisling Kearney has since joined the editorial squad. Each issue has a theme (Identity, Belonging, Madness); most issues also have a “featured writer.” Since the featured writer for the current edition, (theme: Need), is Kevin Power (sterling work, a name to watch), I’d better limit my remarks to Issue IX (theme: Madness), whose featured writer is the journalist, novelist and memoirist Sophie White; she contributes a funny, dark vignette about female bodies and death. Sonder offers shoestring shelter to some extremely impressive work by younger writers. Issue IX contains two short pieces by Lea McCarthy, who (according to her bio note) studied Creative Writing at NUIG. I Believe in Something Something is about Knock airport (no, really); it recounts the vision of Mary beheld by Mary Byrne and Mary McLoughlin in 1879; it contains this sentence: “The Marys (the solid Marys) ran home and spread the gospel.” The solid Marys: deft, funny. Heads Up, Ladies, also by Lea McCarthy, is about an under-15s ladies’ Gaelic football team – their lives, their world: “This muddiness, this cold hard smack, this pitch with the wonky white lines and the nepotistic linesmen.” In two pages, it’s all there. Shakily funded, sometimes shakily produced, lit mags are not just the staging area for the “real” (that is, moneymaking) literary culture. They are themselves a literary culture Also worthy of mention, from Sonder Issue IX, is Alicia Bones’s short story, The City After Dark. A married office worker surreally parts company with his own life across a single evening. Like a sour Murakami, or the earlier novels of Ottessa Moshfegh: “She pushes me into an empty room. ‘My mother forgot my birthday today, you s**t.’ I can relate.” The Pig’s Back, edited by Dean Fee and Emily Cooper (both also writers), is published out of Letterkenny; it’s “a literary prose journal that aims to bring the rest of Ireland – and in turn, the world – to the northwest”. I didn’t, alas, receive a hard copy of the latest issue, but the website presents some excellent work. Direct Message, a short story by Grace Banks, is about a young queer woman, Mia, who can’t get over her ex, and who manipulates the rules of social media (and of social actuality) to perpetrate a kind of revenge. Another relative newcomer is Profiles, a Dublin literary and visual arts journal edited by Clare Healy & Sarah Sturzel. On the evidence of issue iii, Profiles is the real deal: the art and design are spectacular, and the fiction is unusually good. Loss Adjustment by Dara Higgins, about a middle-aged man who quits his job to write poetry and can’t, might be the best short story I encountered in any of these journals: hilarious, empathetic, stylish. Irish Carnage?: Essays on Political Violence by Chris Beausang is an unnerving bit of modernism, in the form of an academic book review that is also a memoir and an essay on, of course, political violence. Southword, edited by Patrick Cotter and Billy O’Callaghan and published by the Munster Literature Centre, is another venerable presence on the lit mag scene. It publishes both poetry and prose. Issue 47 features Vigilante, a short story by Karen Jennings. A female academic moves house after a break-up; little happens, until you realise the story is about “material culture,” which is both the academic’s field of study and the physical basis of emotion in our lives. Also an excellent poem, Tigers by Jonathan Edwards, about zoos, animals, us. So, that’s that. What have I learned? Everyone who thrives on the literary scene agrees that we need a thriving literary scene. But the real question is, why? What are lit mags for? They are not, surely, just a greenhouse for new writers who will later be ground up by the Big Five commercial-publishing agribusiness machine. Shakily funded, sometimes shakily produced, lit mags are not just the staging area for the “real” (that is, moneymaking) literary culture. They are themselves a literary culture, all the more vital (and vital, here, means both “necessary” and “alive”) for operating off the commercial grid. Oh, sure, they’re a counterculture, the house journals of a priestly and passionate underground. Hardly anyone reads them, measured by head of population. But that’s the good news. When most people aren’t paying attention, you never know what you might get away with. Kevin Power is an assistant professor of English at Trinity College Dublin.

Title: GitLab Inc. (GTLB): A Bull Case Theory
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gitlab-inc-gtlb-bull-case-231340686.html

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on GitLab Inc. (GTLB) on High Growth Investing’s Substack by Stefan Waldhauser. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on GTLB. GitLab Inc. (GTLB)'s share was trading at $55.66 as of Dec 19th. GTLB’s trailing and forward P/E was 69.44 according to Yahoo Finance. A corporate executive standing in front of a large monitor, demonstrating the DevOps package repository. GitLab (GTLB), a standout from the 2021 IPO cohort, has navigated a turbulent journey in the public markets. Like many high-growth tech companies of its era, GitLab’s debut came at a premium valuation, leading to an inevitable correction as its stock shed nearly 80% of its value during the market downturn of 2022-2023. However, since mid-2024, GitLab has staged an impressive recovery, buoyed by solid financial performance and growing investor confidence. GitLab provides an all-encompassing platform for software development, catering to the DevOps and DevSecOps ecosystems. This integrated approach streamlines collaboration between development, operations, and security teams, enabling organizations to enhance the efficiency, speed, and quality of their software development cycles. Originating as an open-source project in 2011, GitLab has evolved into a full-fledged enterprise offering under the leadership of co-founder Sid Sijbrandij, who transitioned to Chairman at the end of 2024 due to health reasons. Its seamless blend of version control, issue tracking, continuous deployment, and compliance tools positions GitLab as a premier DevSecOps solution, differentiating it from competitors like GitHub and Bitbucket. GitLab’s commitment to innovation and automation, underpinned by AI and machine learning capabilities, has established it as a leader in a growing market projected to reach $40 billion. Its land-and-expand strategy has been remarkably effective, reflected in a net retention rate of 124%. With over 30 million registered users and a robust enterprise customer base—including over 1,100 organizations paying annual fees exceeding $100,000—GitLab continues to expand its footprint in the software development sector. This dynamic customer base underscores the platform's significance to large enterprises, many of which have committed to multi-year contracts as evidenced by GitLab’s $812 million in remaining performance obligations (RPOs). The company’s financial results for Q3 FY25 showcased its resilience and growth trajectory. Revenue rose 31% year-over-year to $196 million, while RPOs surged 48%, signaling strong long-term commitments from customers. With 70% of FY25 revenue already locked in and the potential for significant upselling, GitLab’s growth slowdown appears to be temporary. Its exceptional gross margin of 89% highlights its scalability and profitability potential. Over the past two years, GitLab has dramatically improved operational efficiency, with marketing and sales expenses dropping from 60% to 40% of revenue and administrative costs falling from 20% to 14%. Consequently, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 1,000 basis points to 13% in Q3 FY25. GitLab achieved free cash flow breakeven a year ahead of schedule in FY24 and has since demonstrated a robust cash flow profile, despite minor fluctuations in recent quarters. These results underscore its ability to transition from a high-growth company to a cash-generative enterprise as it scales further. With a total addressable market still in its early stages of penetration, GitLab is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for unified DevSecOps platforms. In summary, GitLab represents a compelling investment opportunity with strong fundamentals, a dominant market position, and a clear path to sustained growth. Its recent operational improvements and financial discipline have set the stage for significant value creation, making it an attractive addition to any growth-focused portfolio. GitLab Inc. (GTLB) is not on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 43 hedge fund portfolios held GTLB at the end of the third quarter which was 39 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of GTLB as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GTLB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: It’s Not Unusual: Stablecoin Platform Altcoin USUAL Bucks Crypto Downtrend Following Binance Listing

The native token of a decentralized fiat stablecoin-issuing platform is rallying against the dipping crypto markets. Two days ago, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, Binance, added support for Usual Protocol (USUAL). “Binance is excited to announce that Usual (USUAL) will be added to Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Binance Convert, Binance Margin, Binance Auto-Invest, and Binance Futures at the respective dates and timings listed below.” According to a post on the social media platform X from Usual in response to the Binance listing, the team says the protocol aims to usher in a “stablecoin renaissance”. “90% for the Community: Usual is built to empower, with the majority of tokens for users. No VC (venture capital)/Team Dumps: Just 10% allocated to insiders, cliffed for one year. 100% Revenue for the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization): Every $ of revenue belongs to USUAL holders” According to the Usual Protocol’s website, USUAL acts as a governance token performing two major functions: “1. Usual is a multi-chain infrastructure that aggregates the growing tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) from entities like BlackRock, Ondo, Mountain Protocol, M0 or Hashnote to transform them into a permissionless, on-chain verifiable, and composable stablecoin (USD0). 2. Usual is built around the redistribution of power and ownership to users & third parties, akin to a scenario where Tether’s TVL providers would own the company and the associated revenues.” USUAL is going for $1.43 at time of writing, up 17% on the day. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap is down 6% over the same period. Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.

Title: Why SolarEdge (SEDG) And Shoals (SHLS) Are Climbing
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-solaredge-sedg-shoals-shls-210325181.html
Time Published: 2024-12-20T21:03:25Z
Full Content:
We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. SolarEdge (SEDG) stock is soaring 15% today. The shares appear to be rallying due to residual momentum from a rare double upgrade of the shares by Goldman Sachs earlier this week. Meanwhile, another name in the sector, Shoals (SHLS), is also rising sharply today after it was upgraded by Morgan Stanley on Tuesday. SolarEdge manufactures solar inverters that convert power from solar panels into usable electricity, while Shoals develops and markets electrical balance of systems that enable the safe and efficient transportation of electricity from the solar panels to their destinations. A photovoltaic field at dawn, its solar panels shimmering in the light of a new day. On Dec. 17, Goldman Sachs raised its rating on SolarEdge to Buy from Sell. Moreover, the investment bank hiked its price target on the shares to $19 from $10. According to Goldman, the risk-reward ratio of SEDG stock is positive. That's because worries about the company's ability to make $350 million of debt payments in 2025 are overdone, according to the bank. Moreover, SolarEdge's cost-cutting efforts and more favorable product mix should combine to lift its free cash flow, margins, and bottom line, Goldman believes. Also importantly, Goldman expects the U.S. and European rooftop solar markets to resume expanding in 2025, and it believes that the utility-scale solar sector could also grow next year. What's more, the increased demand for electricity in the U.S. may make investors more bullish on solar stocks, according to Goldman. Also on Dec. 17, Morgan Stanley upgraded Shoals to Overweight from Equal Weight. Writing that SHLS stock had reached "an attractive entry point," the investment bank predicted that the company's revenue would increase about 10% in 2025. And from 2024 to 2027, Morgan Stanley predicts that the company's sales will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. While we acknowledge the potential of SEDG and SHLS, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SEDG and SHLS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: DeFi Protocol Usual's Surge Catapults Hashnote's Tokenized Treasury Over BlackRock's BUIDL
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/20/de-fi-protocol-usuals-surge-catapults-hashnotes-tokenized-treasury-over-black-rocks-buidl
Time Published: 2024-12-20T20:16:30Z
Full Content:
There's been a change of guard at the rankings of the $3.4 billion tokenized Treasuries market. Asset manager Hashnote's USYC token zoomed over $1.2 billion in market capitalization, growing five-fold in size over the past three months, rwa.xyz data shows. It has toppled the $450 million BUIDL, issued by asset management behemoth BlackRock and tokenization firm Securitize, which was the largest product by size since April. USYC is the token representation of the Hashnote International Short Duration Yield Fund, which, according to the company's website, invests in reverse repo agreements on U.S. government-backed securities and Treasury bills held in custody at the Bank of New York Mellon. Hashnote's quick growth underscores the importance of interconnecting tokenized products with decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and presenting their tokens available as building blocks for other products — or composability, in crypto lingo — to scale and reach broader adoption. It also showcases crypto investors' appetite for yield-generating stablecoins, which are increasingly backed by tokenized products. USYC, for example, has greatly benefited from the rapid ascent of the budding decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Usual and its real-world asset-backed, yield-generating stablecoin, USD0. Usual is pursuing the market share of centralized stablecoins like Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC by redistributing a portion of revenues from its stablecoin's backing assets to holders. USD0 is primarily backed by USYC currently, but the protocol aims to add more RWAs to reserves in the future. It has recently announced the addition of Ethena's USDtb stablecoin, which is built on top of BUIDL. "The bull market triggered a massive inflow into stablecoins, yet the core issue with the largest stablecoins remains: they lack rewards for end users and do not give access to the yield they generate," said David Shuttleworth, partner at Anagram. "Moreover, users do not get access to the protocol’s equity by holding USDT or USDC." "Usual’s appeal is that it redistributes the yield along with ownership in the protocol back to users," he added. The protocol, and hence its USD0 stablecoin, has raked in $1.3 billion over the past few months as crypto investors chased on-chain yield opportunities. Another significant catalyst of growth was the protocol's governance token (USUAL) airdrop and exchange listing on Wednesday. USUAL started trading on Binance on Wednesday, and vastly outperformed the shaky broader crypto market, appreciating some 50% since then, per CoinGecko data. BlackRock's BUIDL also enjoyed rapid growth earlier this year, driven by DeFi platform Ondo Finance making the token the key reserve asset of its own yield-earning product, the Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries (OUSG) token.

Title: Is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) the Best Growth Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A semiconductor production line, showing the complex procedures of chip manufacture. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading GPU maker driving innovation in artificial intelligence, gaming, creative design, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. In the third quarter of 2024, the company generated revenue worth $35.1 billion, up by 17% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. Most of the demand was propelled by the market’s growing AI needs in hardware especially. The company’s growing demand for its data center services and its Blackwell AI chip has ramped up expectations for the coming year. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been lagging compared to its record close last month. However, despite that analysts remain bullish on the stock, tying great expectations to its growth potential. On November 21, CFRA Research senior equity analyst, Angelo Zino, joined Yahoo Finance where he discussed his thesis on the stock. Zino shared that the stock has enormous cash flow potential, given the demand projections for its Blackwell AI chip and data center services. He also added that the stock has solid financials and will continue to exceed expectations in the coming year. Zino emphasized that investors must not read “too much” into the guidance especially because making a complex technology demands time. Overall, analysts are also bullish on NVDA and their median price target of $175 points to an upside of nearly 35%. Ithaka Group’s Ithaka US Growth Strategy stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the market leader in visual computing through the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). The company targets four large and growing markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. NVIDIA’s products have the potential to lead and disrupt some of the most exciting areas of computing, including: data center acceleration, artifi cial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and autonomous driving. The reason for the stock’s appreciation in the quarter was twofold: First, the stock benefi ted from tremendous excitement surrounding the further development of generative AI and the likelihood this would necessitate the purchase of a large number of Nvidia’s products far into the future; Second, Nvidia posted another strong beat[1]and-raise quarter, where the company upped its F2Q25 revenue guidance above Street estimates, showcasing its dominant position in the buildout of today’s accelerated computing infrastructure.” Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Yesterday Archer disclosed that it had earlier in the week received a certificate of occupancy for its 400,000-square-foot aircraft factory. Automaker Stellantis (STLA), Archer's partner, will also be involved with the management of the facility, Archer indicated. Specifically, the two companies are negotiating a deal that will involve Stellantis collaborating "with Archer as its exclusive contract manufacturer to mass produce Archer’s Midnight eVTOL aircraft at this facility.," Archer stated. Additionally, Stellantis will provide Archer with "capital, advanced manufacturing technology and expertise and experienced personnel." The two firms intend to manufacture 650 aircraft each year at the facility by 2030. As for Joby, the eVTOL maker disclosed that it had carried out a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test that's in a category called Type Inspection Authorization.

(Reuters) - Wells Fargo has withdrawn from a group of global banks committed to curbing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing the number of high-profile firms exiting climate initiatives amid mounting political pressure. The bank has ended its membership in the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, a spokesperson said on Friday, two weeks after another notable exit by Goldman Sachs. Financial firms, which have long been criticized for their ties to the fossil fuel industry, have tried to integrate net-zero standards more prominently into their operations. But more recently, they have started to scale back some of those initiatives to avoid irking Republicans. GOP officials have cracked down on companies they view as climate-friendly. Last month, asset management giants BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street were accused of violating antitrust law through climate activism in a lawsuit by Texas and 10 other Republican-led states. Wells Fargo, however, did not give a reason behind the move. "The alliance prefers not to see any bank leave but respects the decision Wells Fargo has made based on its own individual circumstances," an NZBA spokesperson said. The NZBA is a group of banks "committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net-zero emissions by 2050," according to its website. Since the UN-backed alliance was founded in April 2021, it has attracted over 100 banks while five have left, the group's spokesperson said. "The overall increase in membership indicates how important understanding climate risk and the transition to net zero has become to banks and companies around the world," they added. Wells Fargo's exit was first reported by Bloomberg News earlier on Friday. (Reporting by Niket Nishant in Bengaluru; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri) Sign in to access your portfolio

We recently compiled a list of the 11 Important AI News and Ratings for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Dynatrace, Inc.’s (NYSE:DT) stands against the other AI stocks. The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have raised both opportunities and concerns, especially regarding its safety and the ethical implications of its widespread use. Establishing regulatory frameworks for AI is essential to ensure its responsible development, protecting against potential risks while maximizing its positive impact across industries. The Future of Life Institute released its 2024 AI Safety Index, evaluating the safety practices of leading AI companies including Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, x.AI, and Zhipu AI among others. The review panel, consisting of prominent AI experts, found significant gaps in the companies' risk management and safety strategies, especially regarding their ability to ensure that advanced AI systems remain beneficial and under human control. Despite some positive steps in certain areas, the panel expressed concern that these companies are not adequately addressing the existential risks associated with AI development. The report highlighted the need for improved accountability, transparency, and safety frameworks, as competitive pressures seem to be overshadowing safety considerations. The index aims to provide the public with insights into AI companies' safety efforts and encourage better practices within the industry.

In a CNBC interview, Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute and MIT professor, emphasized the need for AI safety standards, drawing a parallel to regulated industries like aviation and medicine. He highlighted the current lack of clear plans to ensure AI safety, especially as systems like chatbots and autonomous vehicles become more integrated into real-world applications. Tegmark advocates for policy changes to make AI companies prioritize safety, much like other industries, to prevent potentially dangerous outcomes. While the situation is concerning, he believes that proper regulation could lead to significant benefits. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

While buzzwords like AI took center stage in 2024, millions of Americans kept collecting regular dividend checks to fight inflation and seek financial freedom.

"Worked my guts out in my 20s, retired on a paradise beach in Southeast Asia in my 30s," he commented during a discussion on Reddit. "Honestly, it’s the best life, feels like a dream," he said on another occasion.

Title: Man secures €600,000 settlement over alleged brain injury from Christmas Day fall on sister’s driveway

Time Published: 2024-12-20T15:41:07Z

A financial consultant who alleged he fell and fractured his skull as he left his sister’s house on Christmas Day and ended up with a severe brain injury has settled a High Court action for €600,000. Anthony O’Riordan (81) was stretchered from the driveway of the house in Dalkey, Co Dublin after what is thought to have been a tumble as he attempted to get into a taxi on the driveway. His counsel, Bruce Antoniotti, instructed by Augustus Cullen Law, told the High Court Mr O’Riordan suffered a brain injury and has been left with cognitive deficits following the incident 12 years ago. Counsel said Mr O’Riordan had arrived with his wife and daughter at his sister’s house at 4pm on Christmas Day in 2012. The driveway where the fall allegedly occurred had a 9.5 degree slope. The O’Riordans were leaving about four hours later when he “disappeared from view” having apparently lost his balance after walking around the back of their taxi, counsel said. “We don’t know what happened and Mr O’Riordan does not remember the incident. We don’t know if he tripped, slipped or stumbled,” counsel said. The most likely explanation was that Mr O’Riordan stumbled, said Mr Antoniotti, noting the wing mirror of the taxi car broke off, which was consistent with somebody stumbling and grabbing the wing mirror. Mr O’Riordan, of Mount Merrion Avenue, Blackrock, had through his wife, Hilda, sued Irene and Robin Hennessy, of Knocknacree Road, Dalkey, over the incident. All of the claims were denied. He claimed he was negotiating the steep driveway and attempting to enter the taxi when he slipped and fell. He alleged there was a failure to ensure his safety, health and welfare while he was a guest on the premises and a failure to ensure that the cobble lock paving was cleaned with a power hose to ensure it was free from any build-up of grime liable to render the surface slippery, particularly in the winter months. It was alleged that Mr O’Riordan hit his head and was unconscious for about 20 minutes. He was diagnosed with a skull fracture and brain bleed that required surgery. Mr Antoniotti told the court that expert engineers on his client’s side were not critical of the driveway slope and said the rough surface was safe. A year and a half after the incident it was noted on inspection of the driveway that it was in pristine condition. Outlining the risk of further litigating the case, counsel said he had grave concerns and he could not say they would succeed if the case went to trial. Approving the settlement, Mr Justice Paul Coffey said there was no evidence as to how Mr O’Riordan fell and there was no criticism of the slope by the engineers. Noting the litigation risk, the judge said the offer was fair and reasonable. He said it must have been a very shocking event for the family and Christmas must now be a very difficult time for them. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock is tumbling 21% today after individuals who received the company's experimental weight-loss drug shed many fewer pounds than expected. Specifically, the weight of patients who received Novo's anti-obesity drug, CagriSema, declined by an average of 20.4% in 68 weeks, versus the 25% average weight loss that Novo had expected the treatment to produce. A closeup shot of a laboratory technician handling a medical device used for fertility treatments. The company, however, stated that if all the patients who were tested had complied 100% with the treatment requirements, their mean weight loss would have been 22.7% and 40% of the trial participants would have shed at least 25% of their weight. Reporting that only 57% of patients in the trial received the highest dose of CagriSema, Novo stated that it was "encouraged" by the data and added that it intends to launch an additional trial of the drug by June 2025. Roughly 3,400 individuals were involved in the trial. Taken weekly as an injection, CagriSema consists of semaglutide and cagrilintide. Semaglutide, which is similar to the hunger-suppressing hormone called GLP-1, is also the main ingredient of Novo's anti-obesity drug, Wegovy. The latter treatment is already being widely used to combat obesity in the U.S. Cagrilintide acts similarly to a pancreas-based hormone called amylin. The average weight loss of the patients who took CagriSema was similar to the mean weight declines of individuals who have taken Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound treatment. Novo Nordisk had hoped that CagriSema would surpass Zeopbound's performance. LLY stock is advancing 7.5% in early trading. While we acknowledge the potential of NVO, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Latest Stocks: 23 Stocks He Just Talked About. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cencora (NYSE:COR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. With the Federal Reserve's December meeting over, Wall Street has now shifted into a new paradigm. While the central bank did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in a widely anticipated move, the bank also signaled that 2025 might be accompanied by fewer interest rate cuts than many might have anticipated. In fact, not only are markets convinced that the Fed will cut less in 2025, but some even believe that the interest rates might be hiked especially since the central bank's median 2025 inflation outlook is 2.5% which is higher compared to the earlier 2.1%. While the Fed's announcements and the press conference sent the flagship S&P index by 3.2%, Jim Cramer explained how the stock market as a whole isn't doing that well. On the episode of Squawk On The Street the day of the interest cut, he stated "Look at the material stocks, look at anything related to industrial export. Look at the housing stocks. David, there are cohorts that are indeed rolling over. It isn't like everything is just super strong and everything is quantum computing and Rocket Lab!" Cramer added that while some believe that sections of the economy such as retail are strong, there might be a need to look deeper. "Look there's this growing consensus not represented necessarily in these Fed fund futures but that just says why are they doing this? And I come back and say why are they doing this," said Cramer, adding "So I think that the talking heads, and boy are there ever a lot of talking heads, have decided that look that if you look at what we're seeing in some retailers, things are strong. By the way in retail, it's not strong either if you count colds." Going against the trend, he stressed the need to look into the data to find the right stocks. According to him, "I don't know where these people get that things are strong, they look at the aggregate numbers, I look at the individual companies, I am trying to find companies that are strong." Cramer was also perplexed by the Atlanta Fed's Q4 3.2% GDP growth estimates. He shared that he's "trying to find why. I'm trying to find where that is. You know David that travel's very strong yeah. Leisure's very strong. Dining out's very strong. These are strong and by the way, they're very obvious, they look obvious to the Atlanta Fed. I don't know what kind of weighting they have but wow." The American economy wasn't the only economy on Cramer's mind. While he might be having a hard time believing the GDP estimates, there isn't a doubt in his mind that the US is the best place to invest. Cramer shared that he's "trying to find countries, maybe Argentina making a comeback, but it's very difficult to find a country that I would invest in," but it's very difficult to "find a country that isn't upset in turmoil or something." Speaking of other countries, Cramer believes that China "is behind so much of what's going wrong. But they are never, other than [BY] Peter Navarro, called out." On how the "media and other coverage says that China is in a depression," Cramer has "to believe it because I don't believe a single number they send. We used to be able to look at their electric power. . . . .how about when they used to do employment of youth." One economic sector that he's worried about is the automobile industry. Cramer doesn't "understand why the problems with autos are not so visible among the cognoscenti," something he believes is very important since autos "is a huge industry. Employs a lot of people. And the layoffs and the ramifications of what could happen here and other mergers." China is "getting away with murder, they really are, they're getting away with wiping out industries all over the world," Cramer said, adding that "there's only one guy who actually stands up them, and even he was saying that he has a good relationship with Xi. And that is President-elect Trump." However, on an optimistic note, Cramer believes that the "Mag 7 seems almost immune even to China. Which they never really got into." Our Methodology To make our list of the latest stocks on Jim Cramer's mind, we made a list of the stocks he talked about during a fresh episode of CNBC's Squawk In The Morning. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A closeup of pills in a pharmacy, representing the high quality medications of the company. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 45 Cencora (NYSE:COR) is one of the biggest pharmacy distributors in America. Recent events surrounding the pharma and healthcare benefits management industry have placed its shares on the backfoot. Cencora (NYSE:COR)'s stock up 6% over the past month as investors reevaluate consumer perceptions of the benefits industry. The sentiment surrounding its sector has not been helped by President-elect Trump's blunt statements of 'destroying' the healthcare middleman. On a firm-specific level, Cencora (NYSE:COR) has benefited from its portfolio of specialty drugs that help treat diseases like cancer. These drugs are pricier than other medications, and they enable pharmacies to post robust margins. Cramer believes that taking on giants like Cencora (NYSE:COR) will be quite hard as they've withstood similar attempts in the future. According to him: "Cencora. It used to be a, had a different name. You cannot attack Cencora. They are Teflon. Cencora always wins." Overall COR ranks 17th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of COR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than COR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Stock Prices May Fall On More Inflation, Slower Growth, Bitcoin Risk

396930 01: Traders and clerks work on the Eurodollar Futures floor of the Chicago Mercantile ... [+] Exchange November 6, 2001 after the FOMC announced an interest rate cut. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half-percentage point bringing the cost of short-term loans to their lowest level in 40 years after a flurry of grim economic reports. In cutting rates for a third time since the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Fed cited unusual forces restraining demand and left the door open to even more rate cuts. CME's flagship Eurodollar contract is the most actively traded short-term interest rate futures contract in the world, and the benchmark for short-term U.S. interest rates. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images) With the U.S. government careening toward a shutdown this weekend and a key inflation report due today, stock futures — led by a 1% drop in Nasdaq-100 futures — were down, according to the Wall Street Journal. Does this drop foreshadow declining stock prices in the next few years? Lacking a crystal ball, my prediction is yes. That’s because the scenario that strikes me as most likely will send stock prices down for four reasons: If you are not prepared to wait out a long period of stock market decline and a gradual recovery, taking equity profits could be a wise move. After two failed efforts to fund the government through March 2025; absent a deal today, the government could shut down at 12:01 a.m. on December 21. The economic consequences of such a shutdown would be significant. For example, “millions of federal employees and military service members” could be furloughed and Americans relying on federal assistance could face service disruptions, noted Seeking Alpha. Moreover, an extended government shutdown could cause flight delays since some TSA employees and air traffic controllers might call in sick, reported Axios. Leading the fall are technology stocks and bitcoin as investors await an inflation report that could send stocks down further. As semiconductor industry stocks — such as ASML, TSMC, AMD, Broadcom, and Nvidia — fell, bitcoin’s price dropped 12% from its peak to $95,000, the Journal reported. Fortunately for bulls, a report on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge — the Personal Consumption Expenditures index — was better than expected. The PCE rose 0.1% in November — less than the expected 0.2%, according to CNBC. Some economists forecast tariffs imposed by President-Elect Donals Trump could revive inflation. Trump has announced a variety of tariff proposals — some linked to conduct of the countries whose goods would affected. During the election campaign, he pledged to impose 20% tariffs on all U.S. imports, reported the Journal. Following the November election, Trump also Executives of companies that import goods — which would likely be faced with higher costs when they pay the tariffs — have so far failed in their efforts to quash the Trump tariffs, noted the Journal. Economists envision tariffs could boost inflation. If tariffs push up consumer prices, businesses and individuals might be primed to react by hoarding products or paying more, they argue. Tariffs could go up “in the context of an economy where the embers of inflation are still smoldering,” KPMG chief economist Diane Swonk told the New York Times. “It can rekindle.” On December 18, the Dow plunged 1,100 points after the Fed signaled fewer 2025 rate cuts than investors expected. If inflation rekindles, the Fed could stop cutting rates — or even raise them. “Today was a closer call, but we decided it was the right call,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting. He later added, “From here, it’s a new phase, and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts,” according to the Wall Street Journal, Investors did not take into account how the Fed’s forecast might change in light of the election results. One economist concluded the Fed’s slower rate of interest rate cuts was a result of uncertainties related to tariffs and immigration policies. “This wholesale change in their views are clearly tied to uncertainty and risks around as-yet-enacted tariff and immigration policies and have far less to do with changes to the economic landscape,” Inflation Insights Founder Omair Sharif told the Journal. Economists are uncertain about the rate of economic growth. “It is a very uncertain outlook, and most of that uncertainty comes from potential changes in policy,” Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. economist Michael Gapen told the Times. Nevertheless, Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street economists forecast gross domestic product growth will slow from 2.5% in 2024 to 2% in 2025. While rising stock prices and higher home prices could boost consumer spending — which accounts for 70% of economic growth, tariffs and stricter immigration policies could increase prices. Such stagflation — slower growth and higher prices — is the worst case scenario of one economist. “Trade and immigration policy could be extremely disruptive to the economy,” American Enterprise Institute economist Michael Strain told the Times. Strain envisions a stagflation scenario in which prices — of imported goods, groceries, restaurant meals, and homes — rise as economic growth slows. The reason? “Steep new tariffs discourage investment, mass deportations limit employers’ ability to find workers and mounting deficits drive up borrowing costs,” reported the Times. Finally, just as subprime mortgage-backed securities found their way into the financial mainstream — contributing to the 2008 financial crisis — there is a risk of bitcoin and other risky tokens doing something similar in the future. Bitcoin more than doubled in 2024 and popped 40% since November 5 on “hopes that a second Trump administration will usher in a golden age for digital currencies,” reported the Wall Street Journal. Individual investors are pouring cash into exchange traded funds linked to cryptocurrencies. Such ETFs — notably from Fidelity and BlackRock — have attracted $36 billion of new money since their launch — with their assets totaling about $116 billion, the Journal noted. ETFs get paid to accumulate assets in classes investors desire. “Asset managers’ jobs are to build products where there is demand from their clients so they can charge fees on it,” ETF Action Founder Mike Akins, told the Journal. “Let us not forget they also had no problem packaging up subprime mortgages and delivering them to their clients.” Could the inherent volatility of bitcoin and other risky tokens clip those investors’ wings and cause another financial crisis? The involvement of Fidelity and BlackRock gives me little comfort about the safety of bitcoin as an investment. After all, Akins’ comment reminds me how Lehman Brothers — which accumulated a highly leverage portfolio of subprime mortgage-backed securities — was a respected investment bank until Sept. 15, 2008 when it filed a $639 billion bankruptcy. The median Wall Street forecast sees a 9% rise in the S&P 500 in 2025, according to MarketWatch. While I hope I am wrong, tariffs, inflation, higher-than-expected interest rates, slower economic growth, and bitcoin volatility risk could make that forecast look overly optimistic. One Community.

Title: A Teenager’s Lawsuit: Taking on the Global Food Giants. Colin Todhunter
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/teenager-lawsuit-global-food-giants/5875443
Time Published: 2024-12-20T14:03:02Z
Full Content:
In a bold move, 18-year-old Bryce Martinez from Pennsylvania has taken a stand against some of the world’s largest food corporations. Martinez has filed a groundbreaking lawsuit against 11 major food companies, including household names like Coca-Cola, Nestlé and Kraft Heinz, alleging that their ultra-processed foods (UPFs) led to his development of Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at the age of 16. This legal action brings to light the growing concern over UPFs, which are foods that have undergone multiple processing steps and often contain additives, preservatives, and artificial ingredients. These products, ranging from sugary cereals to packaged snacks and soft drinks, have become staples in many households, particularly appealing to children and teenagers. Martinez’s lawsuit argues that these companies have engaged in practices reminiscent of the tobacco industry, prioritising profits over the health of young consumers. His legal team contends that the food giants have exploited children’s vulnerability to marketing and their natural preference for sweet and salty flavours. It argues that these companies have deliberately engineered their products to trigger addictive responses, making it difficult for young consumers to resist or moderate their intake. The case details Martinez’s personal story, describing how he regularly consumed popular UPFs throughout his childhood, unaware of the potential long-term health consequences. His diagnosis with Type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease at 16 came as a shock, prompting him to investigate the root causes of his health issues. This lawsuit raises important questions about the food system in the face of rising childhood obesity and diabetes rates. It challenges the food industry’s long-standing defence that consumers have free choice in their dietary decisions. Martinez’s lawyers argue that when it comes to children, this notion of free choice is compromised by aggressive marketing tactics and the addictive nature of these products. The case also highlights the growing awareness of the link between diet and long-term health outcomes. Public health advocates have long warned about the potential dangers of a diet high in UPFs, but this lawsuit brings these concerns into the legal arena in an unprecedented way. The case draws parallels to the landmark tobacco lawsuits of the past, which resulted in significant changes to how cigarettes were marketed and sold. If successful, Martinez’s lawsuit could have similar far-reaching implications for the food industry, potentially leading to stricter regulations on food marketing, more transparent labelling practices and a shift in public perception of UPFs. Moreover, this case may inspire other individuals or groups to take similar legal action, potentially opening the floodgates for a wave of lawsuits against food companies. This could force coopted governments and the industry to reckon with their role in the global obesity epidemic and other diet-related health issues. While Martinez’s lawsuit focuses on the direct health impacts of UPFs on individuals, it’s crucial to understand this case within the broader context of the global food system. This is something I have been drawing attention to for many years, offering a critical lens through which to examine how the industrial food system, driven by profit motives, perpetuates health crises, environmental degradation and socio-economic harm. The rise of UPFs is emblematic of a food system shaped by capitalist imperatives. These foods, often laced with harmful chemicals and produced using toxic agrochemicals, are not only detrimental to health but also highly profitable for corporations. The same companies that dominate the UPF market are deeply intertwined with investment firms like BlackRock and Vanguard, which also hold stakes in the pharmaceutical industry. This dual investment creates a cycle where corporations profit from both the sale of harmful foods and the treatment of diseases caused by these products—a ‘win-win’ scenario for them but a devastating one for public health. A complex web of influence shapes global food policies and scientific research. Any talk about corporate influence and lobbying must include the role of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). Despite claiming to be an independent scientific organisation, the ILSI functions as a powerful lobby group for the food industry. The ILSI plays a crucial role in promoting narratives that benefit its corporate funders, often at the expense of public health. We have a food system where corporate lobbying exerts significant influence over policies and ensures harmful practices remain largely unchecked. The proliferation of UPFs has been linked to rising rates of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. In high-income countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, UPFs account for more than half of total calorific intake, exacerbating these health issues. Yet corporate-backed narratives often downplay these risks or frame them as issues of personal responsibility rather than systemic problems. High-level ‘experts’ and scientists with ties to major food corporations have argued against demonising UPFs, despite overwhelming evidence linking them to poor health outcomes. Addressing the harms caused by UPFs requires more than individual lawsuits — it demands a rethinking of how food is produced, marketed and regulated. Bryce Martinez’s lawsuit against food corporations represents a critical challenge to a system that thrives on ‘sickening profits’. This case is part of a larger struggle against a global food system that prioritises corporate wealth and power over health and food sovereignty. Whether through legal action or the work of grassroots movements, dismantling and rejecting this harmful system is essential for creating a healthier and more equitable future. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: Middle East – Towards Endless Chaos?
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/middle-east-endless-chaos/5875360
Time Published: 2024-12-20T14:00:45Z
Full Content:
With the Ashkenazi-Zionist-Israel rapid expansion towards a Greater Israel, the sudden fall of Syria, the silence of Iraq, Iran scared to intervene, when Russia is folding up its tents in Syria and is getting the hell out of there — what else, but chaos? See also this analysis by Paul Craig Roberts. Well, the West’s unquestioned support for Israel, or what is still called Israel, though in the hands of mass murderers going by the name of Ashkenazi-Zionist – no original Jews, what can be expected from the region, other than an ever-faster downfall into full chaos? Chaos is usually what the rulers want. That is what Washington manages best. The US-Pentagon-NATO have a long history of letting chaos reign for control. This time though it seems to be different. The chaos is happening because of the West’s collective inaction; possibly negligence of their own interests. Just to be sure, Syria has not collapsed because of an “internal” civil war. There NEVER was a civil war; a civil war as we know by its true term where the local people rise up against their ruler. That never happened. Never listen to western media, which would like you to believe that Bashar al-Assad was fighting against a country full of Syrians who disliked him. That is a load of bull***t, as strong as it comes. Mr. al-Assad’s Syria was infiltrated since before the year 2000, still during his father Hafez Assad’s reign by US-UK-Israeli created terror groups, which lasted up to this day, plus new ones, to which Turkey later also contributed. Today they are called ISIS, IS, al-Qaeda, and finally by Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a coalition of northern Syria-based Sunni Islamist insurgent groups that evolved from Jabhat al-Nusrah, or “Nusrah Front,” al-Qaeda’s former branch in Syria. For sure there are others. For now, HTS seems to be in control of Syria, if anybody is. Turkey, the flip-flop nation, a so-called NATO heavyweight claiming to be also friends with Russia – but when it comes down to it, Turkey under Erdogan is a traitor of everyone. Erdogan has dreams of grandeur, to bring back the Ottoman Empire. Should he ever be trusted? Washington wanted to dominate Syria for decades. Why? Her oil riches are much larger than is being officially estimated, her geographic strategic situation is unique to control the region – and not least, Syria is part of the Zionists’ dream of becoming the Greater Israel, the Land for the Chosen People. One can only wonder, what kind of God would choose such horrifying people? Syria is central to the downfall of the entire Middle East. That descent into chaos has started long ago, but accelerated to warp speed in the past weeks. It may go on for an undetermined period of time. It will affect Iran, though Iran, a new BRICS country and part of the Chinese Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), is expected to have Russian and Chinese support. However, recent events have shown that none of this can be taken for granted. So, for practical reasons Iran is on her own, internally still torn apart between the adherents of western values and those who trust the east. Of course, the western faction is heavily paid, infiltrated and trained by CIA and associated secret services to foment resistance and, if needed, facilitate assassinations of (western) undesirable leaders. And what about the Saudis? They are selling their hydrocarbons to China in Yuan, an indication that they would lean towards the East, China. However, when a year ago they were offered a place in the new BRICS, though they had officially accepted, but as of today they have not fulfilled any of the conditions laid out for the BRICS members. For example, they are adamant not letting go of the US dollar, not meaning de-dollarization, but trading among each other in their respective currencies. De-dollarization was never a condition for BRICS membership. But the sheer fact of being a member of the BRICS, pulling them closer to China and Russia, scares them. Remember, they are full with US military bases – a tit-for-tat – when they agreed in the 1970s as head of OPEC to trade hydrocarbons only in US dollars, Washington promised to “protect” them from potential enemies by dotting their country with US bases. The very bases from which the US is aggressing her chosen enemies, not only in the Middle East, but all over the world. The population of the Middle East is about half a billion people (2024 estimate), and growing. That is only about 6% of the world’s population but extremely rich in natural resources, including energies. . . Does anybody expect these people just to let go, being overrun and their resources – the world’s energy – being stolen by supremacists, who call themselves the Chosen People, without a fight? Not likely. What incoming President Trump will do to bring Peace to the Middle East is anybody’s guess. From the supposed key positions to be confirmed, with responsibilities for the Middle East, including his VP and Secretary of State – and others of course – the course of unquestioned support for Israel, or let’s call it by the true name, the Ashkenazi-Zionists, seems guaranteed. Mr. Trump has not made any indication that he wants Peace with Iran. That pits East against West in the Middle East which controls as it is today, between 55% and 60% of all known hydrocarbon reserves. Many countries around the globe depend on these reserves. For the foreseeable future the world’s economies are not going to be run by alternative “renewable” energy, like windmills or solar panels. By now, most people know that this is a joke. The climate hoax behind it is also about to collapse. The Green Deal people will soon get a hefty blow. Financial giants like BlackRock / Vanguard are clearly distancing themselves from this lie. Syria was a shining light in the region. But for most, she was unexpectedly overrun with apparent ease. All prepared for over 30 years, already when Hafez al-Assad was in power, the US started meddling. They intensified their interference in the early 2000 with a supposed pipeline from Qatar through Syria, which was probably planned by the US in connivance with Qatar, knowing that Syria would never allow it to protect her ally’s, Russia, gas market in Europe. But it gave the US yet another argument to further destabilize Syria. Chaos, upheaval and destruction; murdering of the worst kind in Syria of anybody who can still be linked to Bashar al-Assad. Human rights abuse, torture no end. Listen to this remarkable discussion between Mike Robinson and Vanessa Beeley about the events of the past week in Syria, including Vanessa’s escape from the terrorists (50-min podcast): Alternatively, you may listen here. The west is cheering, and the rest of the world is just looking on. Now the total downfall, total chaos of the Middle East is almost a given. Will Trump want to find a solution? The world needs a peace-loving leader from the East or from the West. Not a globalist, because globalists want Power not Peace. The current chaos is what the west wants – the US, UK, Europe, Israel and even Turkey. But it is doubtful that chaos in the Middle East would be in the long-term interest of the self-proclaimed masters of the universe. Somalia may be a good example of man-made chaos and kept as continued chaos. For decades Somalia has followed a similar pattern as is now inflicted in the Middle East. When it gets out of hand, and risks to spread to other areas and countries, inconvenient to the west, the US air force comes in on a flash, dropping a few bombs until the chaos becomes normal and manageable again. Will President Trump leave Syria to the old terror groups set up by the US et al. in the first place – and new ones to be created, which arm themselves largely from the weapons shipments to Ukraine, of which at least 70% goes directly to the black market, already reported on over a year ago by BBC and CNN? Some analyst-pundits predict that 30 to 50 years from now, the Middle East may become a nuclear-contaminated, uninhabitable, literally untouchable piece of land. Let us hope this can be avoided. If a genuine peace-leader, either from the west or the east, were to intervene in the Middle East by stopping the Zionists’ march towards a Greater Israel, restoring old frontiers, giving back Palestine to the Palestinians, there is a chance that the Middle East could become a viable partner to the rest of the world — with the hydrocarbon reserves continuing driving the world economy, towards a civilization of shared values and shared benefits. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

Title: SEC Greenlights First Combo Bitcoin-Ethereum ETFs From Hashdex And Franklin Templeton
URL: https://zycrypto.com/sec-greenlights-first-combo-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-from-hashdex-and-franklin-templeton/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T13:35:38Z

After multiple delayed reviews, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally given its regulatory greenlight the first spot exchange-traded funds tracking both Bitcoin and Ethereum. The approval extends the access of traditional institutional investors to the two largest crypto assets through spot-based investment products. According to a Dec. 19 notice, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the Hashdex Crypto Index US ETF, which will trade on the Nasdaq stock market. The Wall Street top financial cop also greenlighted the Franklin Crypto Index ETF to be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange. “The proportion of bitcoin and ether to be held by each Trust will be based on free-float market capitalizations,” the notice reads. Franklin Templeton’s updated filing, submitted earlier on Wednesday, was approved on an “accelerated basis” due to compliance with existing commodity-based trust share structures. The SEC also stated that the proposals satisfied the criteria of the Exchange Act, which requires ETF providers to have sufficient rules to deter fraudulent and manipulative actions and protect investors, among other requirements. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, observed in an X post that it would be “interesting” to see if other issuers, including Wall Street giant BlackRock, will seek to introduce similar investment products following the SEC’s recent approval. “Regardless, I expect there will be meaningful demand for these products. Advisors LOVE diversification. Especially in an emerging asset class such as crypto,” Geraci added. The regulatory green light comes amid a Federal Reserve-spurred crypto market rout. The leading cryptocurrency has fallen over 7.5% on the day to $94,301 as of press time. Solana’s SOL, ETH, and Cardano’s ADA have dropped as much as 17.2%. Meanwhile, the OG meme coin Dogecoin has tumbled by 20.6% over the last 24 hours at a current price of around $0.2861.

Title: Uber Technologies, Inc. (UBER): Among Tiger Global Management’s Long-Term Stock Picks

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Tiger Global's 15 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against the other stock picks. Even as the venture capital efforts of Tiger Global Management come under increased scrutiny on the back of reportedly disappointing post-pandemic performance, the 13F portfolio of the fund seems to be performing exceedingly well to taper over these concerns. From the beginning of 2023 through to the end of the first quarter of 2024, the public long positions of the fund returned more than 80% to investors. These were dominated by prominent stakes in hyperscalers riding the AI boom. The rate of return posted by the fund was more than double the returns of the benchmark S&P 500 over the period. In contrast, a recent report by news publication Bloomberg reveals that the sixteenth private markets fund of Tiger Global, which set out with a target to raise more than $6 billion in funding back in 2022, closed with $2.2 billion in funding earlier this year. Tech news platform TechCrunch reports that the VC efforts of Tiger Global are suffering from a reputation of making bad bets during the pandemic. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Even though perfectly-timed bets on tech stocks are the claim to fame for Tiger Global in the past few years, a team from the fund recently noted in an investor letter that 30% of its exposure sits in businesses other than the AI-driven tech sector. Per the fund, these positions have roughly doubled over the last fifteen months with an 80% hit rate. Compared to these astute bets, the venture capital efforts of the company paint a grimmer picture. For example, a recent report by the California State Teachers’ Retirement System reveals that the paper losses on the fifteen private markets fund stood at more than 15% at the end of June 2024. This fund had raised more than $12.7 billion back in 2021 to invest in high growth areas. Data from PitchBook Benchmarks shows that the steep losses of this fund place it in the bottom 10% of all venture funds raised in 2021. However, there is still time for some of these investments to bear fruit in the long term. The investment team at Tiger Global is certainly losing no sleep over these numbers. In a letter to investors, the fund has noted that the private holdings of the fund generated positive returns in the first quarter of 2024. This year, the VC arm of Tiger Global has invested in many prominent startups, including Waymo, OpenAI, Scale AI and Wiz. The Tiger Global team stressed in the letter that a meaningful portion of the private exposure of the public fund is concentrated in global market leaders who are performing well and awaiting attractive opportunities to go public. The team further added that it was also encouraged by the signs of life in the IPO market following relative dormancy over the last two years. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities. For this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Tiger Global Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Only the companies that have been in the 13F portfolio of the fund consistently for the past three years were selected. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close up view of a hand holding a smartphone, using a ride sharing app. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136 Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) develops and operates proprietary technology applications worldwide. Even though the fund trimmed its stake in the company by 14% in the past few months, the firm is still one of the top long term stock picks of Tiger Global. It has featured in the 13F portfolio of the fund constantly since the second quarter of 2019. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, Tiger Global owned close to 2.6 million shares in the ride hailing firm worth close to $200 million, representing 0.83% of the portfolio. Just like Tiger Global, Wall Street analysts are also bullish on Uber Technologies, Inc.(NYSE:UBER). Investment bank Goldman Sachs recently termed the firm as one of its top stock picks for 2025. In an investor note, Goldman analyst Eric Sheridan said Uber's risk-to-reward balance was among the most attractive heading into 2025. Sheridan highlighted that Uber was mired in a series of short-term debates, including discussion on pricing inflation and competition impact on mobility growth, as well as medium/long-term industry concerns over the impact of autonomous vehicles on supply/demand if not outright disintermediation. Against that backdrop, we see a company that can continue to deliver on its February 2024 Investor Day commitments despite the rise of autonomous vehicles, countered Sheridan. Overall UBER ranks 9th on our list of Tiger Global Management's long-term stock picks. While we acknowledge the potential of UBER as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than UBER but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) a Cheap NYSE Stock to Invest in Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Cheap NYSE Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) stands against other cheap NYSE stocks to invest in now. The stock market appears poised for another year of impressive returns, likely extending into 2025. However, concerns about high valuations persist. To gain insight into this, Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at NYU Stern School of Business, recently joined CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ on December 14. Damodaran recognized that it’s tough to keep up after two years of returns over 25%. He mentioned that if the market stays stable until the end of the year, it would be similar to the high points seen in the 1950s and mid-1970s. However, he was doubtful about being able to keep this strong performance going, as it’s challenging to continue rising after such big gains. When asked if the market is overvalued, Damodaran said that while prices are high, they haven’t reached the level of a bubble yet. He compared the current situation to the late 1990s but clarified that he doesn’t plan to sell all his investments. Instead, he is hesitant to invest cash right away because staying in cash might mean losing out on potential gains. He also mentioned that while there may be limited growth in price-to-earnings ratios in 2025, there could still be good returns due to better-than-expected earnings growth from new government policies. Damodaran believes that a return of 8% to 10% would be satisfactory for him, as he prioritizes preserving wealth over aiming for very high returns. The US stock market currently presents a mixed valuation picture. According to Morningstar, Large growth stocks have experienced significant price appreciation. However, their current valuations may not fully reflect the inherent risks associated with high growth expectations and potential competition. Consumer defensive stocks tend to be less volatile during economic downturns, but the current valuations may be inflated due to a perceived safe-haven status. Utilities may be currently overvalued relative to their historical performance and future earnings potential as interest rates rise. The industrial sector may be overvalued due to concerns about potential economic slowdowns and rising input costs, although some sub-sectors may offer value. Conversely, the communication services sector may present attractive opportunities for investors. While facing challenges such as increased competition and regulatory scrutiny, certain companies within this sector may be undervalued relative to their long-term growth prospects. The energy sector has experienced significant volatility in recent years. However, with increasing global energy demand and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, certain segments of the energy sector may be undervalued at current prices. Markets are constantly evolving, influenced by various factors such as economic growth, interest rates, and geopolitical events. Damodaran’s insights reflect a cautious view of market prospects heading into 2025, emphasizing careful investment strategies amid high valuations. We sifted through the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of the top NYSE-listed stocks. We then selected the 10 stocks with a forward P/E ratio under 15 that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Aerial view of a major oil rig in the middle of the sea, pumping crude oil. Current Forward P/E as of December 16: 12.5 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 86 Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) is a global leader in the oil and gas industry. It focuses on upstream operations, which encompass the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas. It is also a major producer of a variety of advanced plastics, including polypropylene and polyethylene. Its third-quarter 2024 earnings of $8.6 billion were driven in part by the successful integration of Pioneer Natural Resources, a major independent oil and gas exploration and production company in the US which is primarily focused on the Permian Basin in Texas. Exxon Mobil Corp.’s (NYSE:XOM) Upstream segment’s year-to-date 2024 earnings doubled compared to 2019 to reach $10.00 per oil-equivalent barrel. This is attributed to the acquisition of Pioneer, which added 770,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of high-quality production to the company’s portfolio. Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) leverages its technology and Pioneer’s Permian Basin acreage for efficiency gains. Industry-leading laterals (including a recent 18,250-foot well and planned 20,000-foot well) reduce well counts, minimize surface impact, and improve capital efficiency. This drives Upstream success and strong shareholder returns. Overall, XOM ranks 6th on our list of cheap NYSE stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the growth potential of XOM, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than XOM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has plummeted toward $90,000 per bitcoin, dragging the wider crypto market lower and wiping away around $500 billion worth of value from the $3.2 trillion crypto market. Bitcoin's drop of around 10% in the last 24 hours was dwarfed by ethereum and smaller, top ten cryptocurrencies—including solana and dogecoin—that crashed back by between 15% and 25%.

[+] bitcoin price and crypto market sell-off. This week, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell disappointed traders when he warned interest rates would not come down as quickly as the Fed had previously thought, reducing its planned number of cuts to just two in 2025, from four previously. 12/21 update: The bitcoin price has bounced back, climbing to within touching distance of $100,000 per bitcoin after the latest inflation data from the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index showed a smaller than expected rise of 2.4% rise in November, just below the 2.5% estimate of economists polled by Reuters. Other major cryptocurrencies that had crashed lower, including ethereum, Ripple's XRP and dogecoin, also rebounded, with the combined market recovering around $300 billion of value as traders increase their bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts next year. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood, the founder of the Ark Investment Management hedge fund, reiterated her bullish bitcoin price prediction in a Bloomberg interview, forecasting that the bitcoin price will top $1 million by 2030—something that would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $20 trillion. "[Bitcoin] is becoming even more scarce than gold," Wood said. "The difference between gold and bitcoin is, when the gold price goes up, as it has, production goes up, the rate of increase in the supply goes up—that can not happen with bitcoin." Over the next few weeks, bitcoin and crypto market watchers expect the bitcoin price to remain prone to wild swings. "In terms of what is coming over the holiday period, the first rule of bitcoin is that it is always volatile in the same way water is always wet," James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said in emailed comments. "It’s behavior is always mixed and there is zero discernible pattern at the end of the year and going into the next. Sometimes the price rises in the new year and at other times it falls. So, historically, we can say that bitcoin exhibits typically mixed behavior over Christmas and New Year," Toledano added, pointing to incoming U.S. president Donald Trump's January 20 inauguration as an important date to watch for the bitcoin and crypto market. "Comments from the Federal Reserve were a wake-up call," Danni Hewson, AJ Bell's head of financial analysis, said in emailed comments. "Inflation is proving sticky and tax cuts and tariffs could be a recipe for reflation. "Risk appetite has been pared back.

Title: C21’s most read stories of 2024

As we bring down the curtain on 2024 with our final newsfeed of the year, this countdown of our 40 most-read news stories highlights an industry hyper-focused on threats, opportunities and money. Amazon Prime’s The Rings of Power failed to halt job losses at the streamer I’ll be honest, dear reader, sometimes you guys break my heart. That exclusive we spent weeks on, that story we fought with the lawyers over, that line we spent months double sourcing, that saucy bit of industry gossip we worked so hard to stand up… then I pull up our most read stories at the end of the year and proudly top of the pile is a news brief about a Turkish drama being renewed for a sixth season. That is, thankfully, not the case for 2024. In fact, this year’s top 40 countdown of our most read news stories re-affirms our editorial priorities when we sit down every morning at 06.30 (slightly later if QPR have won the night before) and start putting together our daily newsfeed. Those priorities, other than ‘have we got this exclusively?’, can most simply be categorised into one of three piles: Is this a threat? Is this an opportunity? Is this about money? Just about every one of the stories on our top 40 countdown this year fits one of those categories. The most clear and obvious threat, all year, was job losses. We started the year in New Orleans listening to factual producers talking “Survive to 25” and, sure enough, it’s been a bloodbath out there. “Amazon axing ‘several hundred’ jobs across Prime Video and MGM Studios” at number one, “500 more jobs to go at BBC as BBCS sales suffer in a ‘challenging’ market” at number 10, Paramount’s ongoing cuts and merger chat at 12, and 19, myriad crises in Canada (30), and New Zealand (40). There were late year entries for the looming spectre of AI, most notably OpenAI’s Sora launch at Content London and the subsequent fall out which saw Simon Mirren label the tech “the greatest IP theft in history” (7) and the outright panic among natural history filmmakers in particular at WildScreen the month before (6). AI continued to make the headlines in 2024 AI could of course be an opportunity as well. Embattled, skint production companies able to save huge amounts of time, resource and money on the wage bill by having the tech do the dog work. Minority voices may also be more empowered to tell their stories with the boundaries of money and commissioners stripped away. Still though, individual execs moving around feature heavily in our countdown as always. Has my favourite commissioner just lost her job, and what does that mean for my prospects at that network? Are they moving to a bigger, better network that I haven’t worked with before and now have an ‘in’ at? Or, perhaps you lot are just nosey, gossipy sorts. Either way André Renaud heading to Warner Bros from BBC Studios (2), Charlie Irwin stepping up as Jonno Richards leaves the forever merging/separating Fremantle labels Talkback and Thames (11), Elizabeth Randell at BBC Studios Kids & Family (14), Alexandra Finlay’s departure at A+E Networks (16), Rola Bauer’s latest movements (21), and new gigs for Channel 4 alums Carline Horlick (29) and Phil Harris (32) show this is still a people business – the machines haven’t taken over just yet. Money looms large over this list. More so than the content, which is really only represented by a handful of stories mostly about Netflix (4th, 22nd, 31st, 34th). Who’s got it, who don’t got it, and how can I get some? Problems facing studios space in the UK (5), companies like Anton/Blackrock splashing cash (24), financials at Channel 4 and Netflix (26 and 27) and the latest state of British exports and copro market (36) all rated highly. It’s the economy, stupid. Threat, opportunity, money. Your success or otherwise in 2025 will likely depend which of those three piles we find ourselves placing the majority of stories about your company… The top 40…

Title: Greystar buys Dublin student housing scheme for around €150m
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/12/20/greystar-buys-dublin-student-housing-scheme-for-around-150m/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T10:54:27Z
Full Content:
A US-headquartered property investor has acquired the largest purpose-built student accommodation development in the Republic for around €150 million, marking the biggest residential property deal of the year. Greystar, the South Carolina-anchored property investment company, has agreed to buy the Michael O’Flynn-developed Point Campus scheme in Dublin’s docklands from German asset manager DWS. The deal marks Greystar’s first foray into the student housing market in the Republic and the €150 million price tag makes it the largest single residential property deal in the Republic in 2024. The second biggest was DWS’s €97.5 million deal for the 207-unit Hayfield apartment project in Killiney. In a statement on Friday, Greystar said the fully occupied 966-bed Point Campus development will be operated by its student housing platform Canvas, which currently operates beds in the UK, the Netherlands and Spain. Claire Solon, managing director of Greystar Ireland, said the group is “excited to enter the student accommodation market” in the Republic. “We believe the business is well positioned to benefit from strong ongoing demand from Irish and international students, given the undersupply of high quality and professionally-managed accommodation.” Originally developed by Mr O’Flynn and global fund giant BlackRock in 2016, Point Campus was acquired by Deutsche Bank subsidiary DWS in 2020, reportedly for some €172 million. In addition to the bed spaces, the building includes a cinema, a gym, a common room and a roof terrace and is adjacent to the Point Square shopping centre and the 3Arena in the north docklands. Greystar has been involved in several high-profile property deals, including its 2022 acquisition of Dalguise House in Monkstown, South Dublin for around €30 million. The firm subsequently applied for permission to build 488 apartments on the site. An Bord Pleanála approved a scaled-down scheme in February, ordering the removal of 101 units from the plan. Market dynamics in the Republic remain extremely favourable for purpose-built student accommodation investors, with Dublin alone experiencing an acute shortfall of between 25,000 and 65,000-bed spaces relative to demand, according to estimates. However, the industry voiced its concern earlier this year after the Government legislated over the summer to effectively ban the practice of large-scale student landlords offering 51-week-only leases at their properties. The new law, which means student housing operators must also offer standard 41-week leases to students, more in line with the typical academic year, followed a decision by some large-scale operators to switch to a 51-week-only lease model. The change by operators was criticised by the then-minister for higher education Simon Harris and Sinn Féin’s higher education spokeswoman Mairéad Farrell as well as student unions and the representative body for Ireland’s university sector. An amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act, effectively banning companies from offering only lengthier leases, was passed by the Dáil in July, prompting threats of legal action from some companies.

UPDATED 00:01 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 by Duncan Riley The enterprise technology market is set to undergo transformative changes in 2025, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, crypto and vertical integration, according to the annual 2025 Enterprise Technology Outlook report from PitchBook Data Inc. To no one’s surprise, given the massive growth in the sector through 2024, the report leads with AI and machine learning. OpenAI set a high-water benchmark for AI startups, reaching a $157 billion valuation. 2024 also saw private companies, including ByteDance Ltd. and SpaceX, hit or surpass $100 billion valuations. PitchBook used the term “centicorn” to describe them. The report predicts that 2025 will see the rise of more “centicorns” in the AI sector, with private companies such as Anthropic PBC, CoreWeave Inc. and Databricks Inc. set to follow OpenAI’s trajectory. Anthropic, backed by Amazon Web Services Inc. and others, is on track to exceed $1 billion in revenue by leveraging its privacy-focused models to capture a significant share of the generative AI market. Likewise, CoreWeave’s hardware-centric business model is forecast to achieve a 230% revenue increase in 2025, driven by demand for inference computing. Another contender for centicorn status, Databricks, recently raised $10 billion on a $62 billion valuation and is predicted by PitchBook to be a strong candidate for a $100 billion valuation in 2025. The developments highlight the expanding market opportunities and investor confidence in AI as a key driver in enterprise innovation. On the cryptocurrency front, PitchBook forecasts a resurgence in venture capital funding, with annual investments projected to exceed $18 billion in 2025. The forecast marks a significant recovery from the more subdued levels over the last two years, when funding hovered at about $9.9 billion annually. The report attributes the revival in the cryptocurrency sector to growing institutional involvement from major players such as BlackRock Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whose regulatory credibility and established networks are driving broader market confidence. The report also notes a shift in investment priorities within the crypto ecosystem. PitchBook believes that generalist VCs will reenter the market in 2025 with a focus on startups with clear use cases in decentralized finance, Web3 infrastructure and consumer-facing applications. The renewed interest is anticipated to result in larger funding rounds and higher valuations, especially for late-stage investments. For the enterprise software-as-a-service market in 2025, the report comes back to AI, specifically the rise of autonomous AI agents in reshaping operations and customer engagement. AI agents, autonomous systems powered by AI designed to perform specific tasks or make decisions with minimal human intervention, are expected to streamline workflows and automate complex tasks across sectors such as human resources, analytics and customer relationship management. Integrating into existing SaaS ecosystems, agents are expected to allow businesses to drive efficiency while enhancing the quality of customer interactions. PitchBook believes that AI agents will particularly disrupt customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning platforms, where AI agents are already delivering real-time, personalized support and decision-making capabilities. SaaS vendors are increasingly adopting AI agents to create tailored, industry-specific solutions that boost customer loyalty and reduce operational costs. Other trends forecast for 2025 in the report include a growing role for regulatory technology in enterprise fintech mergers and acquisitions, driven by its niche specializations despite underfunding in the sector. Consolidation in DevOps is also anticipated next year as major SaaS providers acquire startups to streamline fragmented markets and enhance competitive offerings. Additionally, insurance technology is noted as seeing increased vertical integration, with companies adopting seamless models that combine products, insurance and services to improve customer experiences and operational efficiency.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other best growth stocks. Is a December rally in store for stocks in 2024? Some investors are expecting a surge in stocks from the 24th of December to the 3rd of January, 2025, also referred to as the Santa Claus Rally. On December 17, Ryan Detric, Chief Market Strategist at Carson Group, Joined Catalysts on Yahoo Finance to discuss whether he expects December to be a record-breaking month for the stock market. Historically, the first half of December is usually slow for the stock market, while the second half is faster, suggested Detric. He also added that compared to election years in the past, this December has been very “flattish” so far. He also suggested that the Fed is going to continue the easing cycle and with the CPI declining, the current market conditions are favorable. Detrick then added that despite macroeconomic conditions and the performance of the Dow Jones index recently, he expects to see a record surge this month and expects “Santa Claus” to make an appearance this year. Since the elections, stocks have been rallying with high hopes for the future. On December 18, Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities, joined Market Domination on Yahoo Finance to discuss his outlook on Big Tech and the new administration. Ives emphasized that the autonomous robotics and disruptive technologies sectors are going to benefit strongly from the new administration and its policies, despite concerns over tariffs. He also discussed the growing relationship between the new administration and Elon Musk, and how the two parties “need each other” to thrive, suggesting that Musk’s company has solid growth potential in the coming year and AI innovation will strengthen the collaboration immensely. He also added that the environment is extremely bullish for Big Tech and expects growth in the coming year. Ives shared that while there are a few road bumps, especially from the Chinese market, the environment in retrospect is positive. Speaking of the electric vehicle market, he emphasized that new policies in the US coupled with international consolidation, especially in Europe and Asia, will benefit EV makers in the United States immensely. The expectations from growth stocks are immense as the AI revolution takes precedence. To come up with the 10 best growth stocks to invest in now, we went over multiple rankings on the internet to compile an initial list of growth stocks. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment of each stock and picked the most popular ones. Our list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A robotic arm holding a semiconductor chip, emphasizing the precision and quality of the company's production equipment. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 107 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks ninth on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. The semiconductor and IT company produces accelerators that are capable of managing complex AI workloads, because of high bandwidth memory and a huge memory density. Previously in October, the company unveiled new processors to power the next generation of commercial PCs and launched high-performance computing solutions to keep up with the AI computing era. Fast forward to December 10, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) announced the expansion of its AMD Versal adaptive system-on-chip (SoC) portfolio with the new Versal RF Series. The new series offers unmatched compute performance and precise observability. In the third quarter of 2024, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) generated $6.8 billion in revenue, up by 18% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. The company attributed its strong financial results to revenue growth in data center and client segments. Overall, the company is leading the AI and technology wave with its advanced accelerators and processors and expects to deliver strong results over the next few years in data center and client segments. Overall, AMD ranks 9th on our list of the best growth stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The video, which is housed on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF page on BlackRock’s website, spends three minutes walking viewers through the evolution of money and key fundamentals of Bitcoin. One of those fundamentals is Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed token supply. While the video explains the pros of Bitcoin’s fixed supply, a caption simultaneously cautions viewers with a disclaimer: “There is no guarantee Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap will not be changed.” That’s a sore spot for Bitcoin maximalists, who hold Bitcoin’s fixed supply as a nearly sacred tenet that ensures the cryptocurrency’s status as “hard money.” The caption remains for approximately five seconds, eventually fading away as the narrator elaborates on the benefits of a fixed supply, never addressing the potential change. Most crypto observers might have missed it if not for MicroStrategy founder and massive Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor sharing the video on his X account on Tuesday. BlackRock explains #Bitcoinpic.twitter.com/X2fPl8tL2s — Michael Saylor⚡️ (@saylor) December 17, 2024 And despite being just a footnote in the video, crypto observers have now latched onto the disclaimer and raised alarms. “This is the problem with tradfi,” Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko commented on X, referring to traditional finance and Wall Street. “They see crypto as an investment into a thing external to them,” he posted. He then challenged both BlackRock and Saylor to commit to running their own full nodes—that is, the software that operates the Bitcoin network—and guarantee they would only ever support the fork that maintains a fixed 21 million supply. “They need to become the decentralized network, not be investors of it,” Yakovenko said. This is the problem with tradfi. They see crypto as an investment into a thing external to them. What blackrock and saylor needs to commit to is that their own full nodes will always guarantees 21m supply and they will only call the fork that their full nodes follow Bitcoin.… https://t.co/h4oHMQyse7 — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) December 19, 2024 Part of the reason this has got Bitcoiners and other crypto users so worked up is because it isn’t the first time BlackRock has made such a disclaimer. The company included a note in its June 2023 ETF filing which indicated that “a hard fork could change the source code to the Bitcoin network, including the 21 million Bitcoin supply cap.” Some of the more paranoid in crypto began speculating immediately that BlackRock might use its newfound power as one of the biggest Bitcoin holders in the world to influence changes to the network, including the BTC supply. Commenting yesterday on the new ad, author and philosopher Steve Patterson said on X: “You really think your little fucking node running on a Raspberry Pi is going to prevent Blackrock from uncapping the supply of Bitcoin?” Are these concerns unfounded? Probably, but it’s got the Bitcoin community talking, including Blockstream founder Adam Back and early dev Peter Todd (who HBO recently suggested could be Satoshi Nakamoto himself). A hard fork would require a majority of the Bitcoin miners, or those producing blocks and verifying transactions, to agree on new supply mechanics—something most in crypto suspect will never happen. Still, Todd today reminded the community that it is technically possible. “Obviously, if the community agrees to change the 21 million limit they can,” he posted on X. I wrote an entire article on tail emission: https://t.co/ChNUpifYUo Obviously, if the community agrees to change the 21 million limit they can. — Peter Todd (@peterktodd) December 19, 2024 Nevertheless, Bitcoin stakeholders agreeing to change something as fundamental to Bitcoin’s core as its fixed supply would appear to run counter to the financial incentive that exists to maintain the status quo. So why would BlackRock continue to make it an issue? Responding to criticism regarding the “silence” from Bitcoin OGs on BlackRock’s perceived misstep, Back said: “Obviously their lawyers made them write that as they sell investment products and they don’t have control.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Aptos Labs CEO steps down, Avery Ching takes over as the new CEO

Time Published: 2024-12-19T22:36:59Z

Mo Shaikh, co-founder and outgoing CEO of Aptos Labs, has announced his decision to step down, marking a new chapter for the blockchain company. Shaikh, who has been deeply involved in the blockchain space since 2016, co-founded Aptos Labs three years ago with Avery Ching. Together, they aimed to create a scalable, resilient blockchain foundation to support fair and efficient products for the future. In a heartfelt post on X, Shaikh expressed his pride in what the company has achieved. Aptos has grown to become one of the most robust ecosystems in the blockchain space, trusted by over a thousand builders and innovators around the globe. The platform, which leverages the Move programming language originally developed for Facebook’s Diem project, has successfully raised $400 million in venture capital funding from top-tier investors like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Mastercard, Google, and PayPal. Shaikh acknowledged the contributions of early builders and partners who have helped shape the ecosystem, including Merkle Trade, Thala Labs, Kyd Labs, Econia, MyCo, and Aave, among others. He emphasized the importance of the collaboration between Web3 and Web2, which Aptos is at the forefront of driving. Reflecting on his departure, Shaikh noted his true passion for building companies from the ground up and the pride he feels in Aptos Labs’ world-class team. While stepping back from the daily operations, he will remain a strategic advisor to the company and continue to support its mission as Aptos’ most established layer-1 blockchain. Over the coming months, Shaikh plans to take time to reflect on the future of blockchain technology and explore ways to evolve financial systems to maintain Aptos’ leading role in the space. As Aptos enters its next phase of growth, Ching will take over as the CEO, a decision Shaikh says he is confident will drive the company towards even greater success. In his own post, Ching expressed excitement and determination to lead Aptos Labs into its next phase of growth. “Supporting and growing the ambitious Aptos builders and community, pushing the boundaries of innovation in Web3 technology, and high-velocity pioneering products are my immediate priorities,” Ching wrote. The start of Ching’s leadership marks a new era for Aptos, as the company aims to continue driving innovation and scaling possibilities across the ecosystem. Notably, Shaikh’s departure and Ching’s appointment come at a pivotal time for Aptos, as it remains at the cutting edge of blockchain technology, poised to shape the future of decentralized finance.

Title: Could Bitcoin Become DeFi’s Collateral of Choice? Lombard Finance Says So

A war for on-chain market dominance may be brewing. The question: What will be the collateral of choice in the decentralized finance (DeFi) economy? As of press time, DeFi protocols across all ecosystems have locked in almost $126 billion in value, according to DeFiLlama data, inching closer every day to their 2021 high of $175 billion. The majority of those pledged funds take the form of ether (ETH) and derivatives like yield-producing staked ether liquid tokens (stETH) and wrapped eETH (weETH), with wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) and stablecoins as a whole competing for fourth and fifth place. But the team behind Bitcoin-based DeFi protocol Lombard Finance intends to shake things up with LBTC, a new liquid bitcoin token. The idea, according to Lombard co-founder Jacob Philips, is to dethrone ETH and stETH and install bitcoin as the collateral of choice in the entire on-chain economy. “On centralized venues, bitcoin is the prime collateral. There's no question about this. Why is it not the case in DeFi?” Philips told CoinDesk in an interview. “Bitcoin only does one thing well, and it's being a rock-solid store of value. It is the perfect collateral. There's no reason that we shouldn't be building DeFi on top of bitcoin.” Bitcoin has had a formidable year, surging 124% since January 1 thanks to political tailwinds in the U.S. and the massive success of its almost year-old spot exchange-traded funds. Ether, for its part, has underperformed significantly by “only” rising 48% in the same period of time, despite being four times smaller in terms of market capitalization. With demand for bitcoin increasing by the day — and ever-increasing chatter about a potential U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve under the incoming Trump administration — it isn’t crazy to think the asset could play a bigger role on-chain. That, in turn, could transform the way DeFi as a whole operates. “Bitcoin is going to be the next big source of liquidity for every DeFi protocol, on every chain. It’s just a massive influx of net new capital,” Philips said. Noting that bitcoin has a market cap close to $1.9 trillion, he said: “Even if we only get a fraction of that, it would still put a ton of new activity into the ecosystem and make DeFi more efficient — maybe even get to the point where DeFi protocols, through passive liquidity, rival the liquidity on centralized exchanges.” A big difference between bitcoin and ether is that you can lock in the latter asset on the Ethereum network — a process called staking — to help secure the blockchain, and earn interest, paid in ETH. At press time, staked ether offers a 3.19% yield annually, according to CoinDesk's composite ether staking rate (CESR) index. The Bitcoin network doesn’t offer such capabilities, but Lombard aims to provide a yield-bearing bitcoin token through Babylon, a protocol designed to let users stake bitcoin in order to secure other blockchains. It goes like this: Users give Lombard some bitcoin, Lombard stakes these coins through Babylon, then it mints one LBTC token for each BTC staked. These LBTC tokens follow the ERC-20 standard, meaning they can be used across Ethereum and all of its protocols. That interest rate on LBTC will be paid by the blockchains secured through Babylon, or so the theory goes. Nine different projects — Corn, BOB, Cosmos Hub, Nubit, Fiamma, Manta, LayerEdge, Chakra and Pell — have started or completed integration to Babylon’s blockchain development environment, or devnet, so far, Coleman Maher, growth lead at Babylon, told CoinDesk. These integrations should go live next year, after Babylon’s own layer 1 goes live. Babylon isn’t giving out any staking rewards right now, but that hasn’t prevented the protocol from accumulating $5.4 billion in value, making it the 10th biggest protocol by value locked across all of DeFi, according to DeFiLlama. So why are people so eager to lock up their bitcoin on Babylon? Possibly because it’s running a points program, meaning that early depositors could eventually receive an airdrop. The Babylon team did not comment on whether a token would ever be issued. Out of the $6 billion staked on Babylon, over $1.4 billion was plugged through Lombard to create LBTC tokens. In the absence of Babylon-issued staking rewards, these tokens aren’t providing any yield yet. “Users aren't choosing to hold ether or bitcoin based on staking yield alone,” Philips said. “There are much broader reasons why they're choosing one or the other," such as the potential U.S. bitcoin reserve and regulators’ views towards the two assets. "And the yield is a little bit of a cherry on top.” It’s important to note that DeFi users already can use bitcoin as collateral (although without any yield) thanks to wrapped bitcoin. At press time, wBTC’s market capitalization stood at $12.9 billion. That’s only 22% away from its 2021 all-time-high, despite concerns that wBTC’s issuer, crypto custody and trading firm BitGo, is sharing custody of the underlying bitcoin with BiT Global, an entity partially owned by TRON founder Justin Sun. Sun has been accused of fraud and market manipulation in the U.S. Even so, as of December 6, wBTC only accounted for $5.7 billion worth of collateral in some of the largest DeFi protocols, per Lido data, whereas $14.5 billion in ETH was being used, and $11.1 billion worth of stETH. Even "wrapped ether," or eETH — a relatively new liquid token that allows users to benefit from EigenLayer restaking rewards at the same time as native ETH staking yield — provided $5.8 billion in collateral. In fact, stETH and weETH have been slowly eating into other coins’ market share, to the point that ARK Invest stated in a recent report that the entire DeFi economy was reorganizing itself around stETH and the benchmark yield provided by staked ETH. Other tokens — like Solana’s SOL or Avalanche’s AVAX — offer higher interest rates for staking, the implication being that these assets, being more volatile, are riskier to hold in the long run. Stablecoin lenders have also felt pressure from stETH’s ascent, ARK Invest said, with Sky (SKY) (formerly MakerDAO) increasing locked DAI’s interest rate, while rewards for lending stablecoins on Aave (AAVE) and Compound (COMP) have grown, because users would rather lend stETH and borrow stablecoins than lend stablecoins directly. Not to mention the various tokenized money market funds being developed by financial giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton, which could end up allowing DeFi users to gain exposure to U.S. Treasury bills and use such tokens as collateral. So LBTC is facing tough competition. But Philips says the token can succeed where wBTC has struggled thanks to that extra little push afforded by its yield. “Staking yield will be generated in time. The LBTC yield is expected to be in the range of the ETH staking rate,” he said. “Lombard’s initial goal is just to get people to take their bitcoin out of the coldest of cold storage, and just take the most primitive step into on-chain finance. And then we'll show you the battle-tested protocols, safer than your bank, that exist out there,” Philips added. “It's possible that the yield could dry up. LBTC as an asset, producing any amount of yield, would still be an attractive asset.” The pitch has certainly been met with interest. Lombard raised $16 million this summer from a number of heavy-hitters, including Polychain Capital, Franklin Templeton and Nomad Capital. Philips said that entities already familiar with DeFi had been the most enthusiastic. “Anybody who has dabbled in crypto already, it's an easy pitch to get them onboard for bitcoin staking. Or at least they're very open to the conversation.” Tom was sucked into crypto in 2020 and is very much enjoying the ride.

Title: Jim Cramer on Eli Lilly and Company (LLY): ‘I See Things Going Back To Normal For Eli Lilly’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 6 Stocks Jim Cramer Talked About This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer talked about this week. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, recently reflected on how investors often overlook obvious opportunities, particularly with cult stocks, which in hindsight appear to be clear success stories. He discussed how, sometimes, the fundamentals that guide traditional investing can hold investors back from seizing these opportunities. Cramer acknowledged that many investors, himself included, have missed out on these types of stocks and emphasized that it’s important to examine why these opportunities were missed to avoid making the same mistake again. He mentioned that, early on, he and others mistakenly believed that fundamentals were always the key to making sound investments, only to realize that in certain situations, that’s not the case. Cramer highlighted that in the case of cult stocks, the stock price can sometimes move independently of the company’s underlying performance. These stocks can experience long-term growth due to a fiercely loyal shareholder base, and as a result, they may not follow traditional market behavior. He explained that while meme stocks might follow similar trends, cult stocks have staying power and can defy expectations. “There’s a lesson here and it is a brutal one. Sometimes conventional methods of valuation are completely worthless, and you need to embrace the dynamics of cult stocks. The trick is to recognize when we’re in one of those moments. In 2025, let’s strive to find the stocks of companies that do defy orthodoxy.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer’s Lightning Round: 7 Stocks to Watch and Jim Cramer’s Game Plan for This Week: 8 Stocks in Focus Shifting the focus to the healthcare sector, Cramer noted that although the market has seen significant gains in recent weeks, it has become increasingly difficult to find promising investment opportunities. However, he believes that healthcare could be the place to look as 2025 approaches. Cramer explained that healthcare stocks have significantly underperformed this year, trailing behind the broader market, which has created an opportunity. “Now, it's hard to bet on healthcare when the Fed's cutting rates because these are textbook slowdown stocks and thrived when the economy was not doing so hot, but the election was also a clear negative catalyst for the group.” He noted that President-elect Trump’s potential appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to head the Department of Health and Human Services is a major concern for the industry, especially given Kennedy’s reputation as a vaccine skeptic. Cramer also warned that if the second Trump administration attempts to dismantle Obamacare, it could lead to many Americans losing access to affordable health insurance, which would add further risk to healthcare stocks. Despite these concerns, Cramer believes that, at some point, all the negative factors will be factored into healthcare stocks, and that moment is fast approaching. He stated that the damage done to healthcare stocks, particularly in biotech and pharmaceuticals, has been severe, but he sees an opportunity as these stocks have become too cheap relative to their long-term potential. “With so many groups hitting new highs, I think it's worth taking a step back and putting money to work in one of the most hated groups out there, healthcare. These stocks have simply gotten too cheap given its prospects, especially Eli Lilly, Vertex Pharma, and Bristol-Myers.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 6 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episode of Mad Money on December 16. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). An array of pharmaceutical pills with the company's logo on the bottle. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106 Cramer noted that Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is being careful with its promotion and predicted that the company will be back to its full strength soon enough. “Eli Lilly is at the top of the list. Now we own this one for the Charitable Trust and it's earned, it’s nearly [at] $740 billion market cap. But with the stock in the high $700s, it has pulled back almost 20% from its highs in late August. As recently as late October, this stock was still sitting in the low $900s. But Lilly got hit real hard after reporting a seemingly not-so-hot quarter. And then it got hit again after the election, reportedly on an idea that RFK Jr. is not a fan of GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Lilly's Mounjaro. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), a leading global pharmaceutical company, is recognized for its extensive range of treatments, particularly in the areas of diabetes and obesity. The company has gained significant attention for its diabetes medication Mounjaro and its companion drug for chronic weight management, Zepbound. These products have rapidly become key drivers of its growth. Reporting its third quarter, the company stated that U.S. sales of both Mounjaro and Zepbound were impacted negatively due to a reduction in inventories within the wholesaler channel. It should be noted that the sales of both drugs were still strong. Mounjaro alone was responsible for 27.3% of the total revenue, reflecting a remarkable 121% growth compared to the same quarter in the previous year. Zepbound also made a substantial impact, accounting for more than 11% of the revenue in that period. The company’s CFO, Lucas Montarce, mentioned during the earnings call that wholesalers had reduced inventories of diabetes and obesity medications, describing this as a temporary issue. Looking ahead to 2024, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) revised its earnings forecast, expecting a non-GAAP EPS between $13.02 and $13.52, down from its prior projection of $16.10 to $16.60. This change is largely due to the acquisition of Morphic Holdings. Lastly, the company is anticipating data from late-stage trials on its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, with results expected in April 2025, according to a top executive at the company. The pill belongs to a class of medications called incretins, which are designed to replicate the effects of the GLP-1 hormone. This hormone helps control blood sugar levels, slows the rate at which food leaves the stomach, and reduces appetite. Overall LLY ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer talked about this week. While we acknowledge the potential of LLY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LLY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
