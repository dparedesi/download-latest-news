Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Photo: Panama Canal Authority (Bloomberg) — One of the biggest infrastructure deals in recent years has a clear winner on Wall Street: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Goldman is currently the only investment bank working on the sale of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. ports to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc., according to people familiar with the matter. The transaction — with proceeds of $19 billion — includes two ports on either side of the Panama Canal, which Donald Trump has long wanted in US hands. A small group of Goldman bankers from Hong Kong to New York, led by senior executives John Waldron and Raghav Maliah, hammered out the transaction in just a couple of weeks. They moved quickly to avoid any leaks, reaching out to various potential suitors including industry players and infrastructure-focused firms, the people said. Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. also considered bids. While other investment banks missed out, former Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat, who founded consultancy firm Teton Advisors, also advised CK Hutchison on the deal, the people said. The Art of the Canal Deal: How BlackRock Brokered Trump Win in Panama The BlackRock consortium isn’t using financial advisers for now, but banks are gunning to land advisory and financing roles with the group, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Data compiled by Bloomberg show that Goldman has historically been the top adviser to CK Hutchison, founded by billionaire Li Ka-shing. One of Hong Kong’s most prominent companies, CK Hutchison trades locally under the ticker 1.HK. Once the BlackRock consortium showed interest in the port assets, which include the two in Panama and more than 40 others worldwide, there was a rush to sign a memorandum of understanding and file it to the Hong Kong stock exchange ahead of Trump’s address to Congress in Washington, D.C., the people said. In a statement announcing the transaction, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said the deal resulted from a “rapid, discrete but competitive” process — and was unrelated to politics and reports on the Panama Canal ports. CK Hutchison to Sell Panama Port Assets at Center of Geopolitical Storm Corbat and a representative for Goldman declined to comment. CK Hutchison referred questions to its statement. BlackRock didn’t respond to requests seeking comment. The role in such a high profile deal is a boost for Goldman, which is already leading the global M&A league table this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. CK Hutchison investors got a boost too. The company’s shares jumped 22% in Hong Kong on Wednesday. That’s the biggest one-day gain since 1998, a year before the US gave the government of Panama control of the Panama Canal. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: The Art of the Canal Deal: How BlackRock Brokered Trump Win in Panama

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. Photo: evenfh / Shutterstock (Bloomberg) — Donald Trump promised on Day 1 to seize the Panama Canal. “We’re taking it back,” the US president declared in his inaugural address. Within weeks, Wall Street billionaire Larry Fink was on the line with the White House. His pitch: Fink’s investment company, BlackRock Inc., was interested in buying the ports on either side of waterway, shifting them into American hands, according to people familiar with the discussion. And with that, there would be no need to have the US take the century-old canal by force. So went days of whirlwind negotiations that now are set to deliver control of those ports to a consortium led by BlackRock, the $11.6 trillion investment giant Fink has run for almost four decades. The deal, which will hand the seller $19 billion, reflects an extraordinary confluence of Trump’s America First vision and Wall Street’s globe-spanning quest for profit. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to regain US ownership of the Panama Canal, which he has claimed, without evidence, is run by China. Fink capitalized on that desire to secure the biggest infrastructure deal in BlackRock’s history – handing Trump a win as the president flexes over international trade, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, NATO and more. The deal is also a sign of Fink’s and BlackRock’s ambitions to clinch major deals in far-flung private markets and compete with the biggest alternative asset managers. In a statement announcing the transaction Tuesday, he boasted of BlackRock’s ties to companies and governments around the world, noting: “We are increasingly the first call.” When Trump took the lectern Tuesday night for a primetime address, he hailed the deal as a step toward “reclaiming” the canal for the US. He didn’t use BlackRock’s name. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals,” he said. “The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others.” BlackRock said it agreed to buy the two ports in Panama and more than 40 others around the world from CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., the sprawling conglomerate controlled by the Li family, one of Asia’s richest clans. In recent months, the Hong Kong family found itself thrust into the center of a political firestorm over who controls the crucial waterway and key ports. For Trump, having a US investment company take over the ports would reduce China’s influence in the region, according to people familiar with the talks, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity given the delicate diplomacy. The deal wouldn’t have come together without Trump’s support, these people said. BlackRock is acquiring the operations with Global Infrastructure Partners, an infrastructure firm it bought last year and is headed by Adebayo Ogunlesi. Other investors include Terminal Investment Ltd., which operates ports served by the world’s largest shipping company, Mediterranean Shipping. Fink has moved in Trump’s circles for years, and people close to the deal say his personal involvement was crucial. In recent days, Fink briefed Trump as the talks quickly unfolded. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were also kept in the loop. In a statement, Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said the deal resulted from a “rapid, discrete but competitive” process — and was unrelated to politics. Blackstone Inc. and KKR & Co. also considered bids, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Representatives for both firms declined to comment. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment. CK Hutchison’s American depositary receipts rose as much as 3.4% to $6.02 at the start of trading Wednesday. They gained 17% on Tuesday. Panama will review the transaction and an audit of the Panama Ports contract will continue, according to a statement posted on Panama President Jose Raul Mulino’s account on X. Under terms disclosed Tuesday, BlackRock, GIP and Terminal Investment will acquire units that hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group. The consortium will also acquire 90% of Panama Ports Co., which operates the two ports in Balboa and Cristobal, on either side of the Panama Canal. “We’ll probably have ownership of the Panama Canal ones very shortly,” Fink told a financial industry conference Tuesday. As Trump publicly complained about China’s influence over the canal, Panama’s government weighed whether to cancel its contract with CK Hutchison to operate the ports, Bloomberg reported last month. That arose even though CK Hutchison is based in Hong Kong, a Chinese territory with its own borders, currency and legal system. Beijing has clamped down on the former British colony since 2020 when it imposed a broad national security law that paved the way for a crackdown on dissent. Reached Wednesday morning in Asia, CK Hutchison referred to Sixt’s earlier statement. In it, he said, “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Panama president says Trump is lying about reclaiming Panama Canal

Watch CBS News March 5, 2025 / 11:21 AM EST / CBS/AP Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress that his administration was "reclaiming" the Panama Canal. Mr. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Hong-Kong based group that operates ports near both ends of the Panama Canal. The announcement came after the president alleged Chinese interference with operations of the critical shipping lane. Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. "reclaiming" of the canal. Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction. Mulino, in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. "I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation," he wrote in the post translated from Spanish. He accused Mr. Trump of "lying again." "The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else," Mulino continued. CBS News fact-checked the president's remarks to Congress here, reviewing his claims about the Panama Canal in addition to other issues. Mr. Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. Mulino previously denied publicly the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free. The Panamanian leader said in early February that he had told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that he could not set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them, adding at the time that he was surprised the State Department had issued a statement suggesting otherwise. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino around the same time and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal's operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations. "Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest," Mulino wrote. "It doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty." In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama's government. The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Trump has claimed that Carter "foolishly" gave the canal away. Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was "the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received." "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," Sixt said. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Title: Improving Blockchain Data Usability: A Key to Unlocking Institutional Capital

Data is an essential element of an efficient market. If market efficiency is the degree to which prices reflect all available information, having quality information is crucial. And to get to information, you need data. Traditional financial markets are data-rich and have high levels of standardization and accessibility, giving market participants abundant avenues for analysis. Digital asset markets are awash in data, but this data has less structure and little standardization, complicating many aspects of fundamental and quantitative analysis. It’s somewhat ironic that data is a sticking point for digital assets since a much-lauded aspect of public blockchains is their transparency. Transactions and data on the blockchain are available essentially immediately to anyone with access to the system. But transparency does not equal accessibility and, much less so usability. Without prioritizing accessibility, dissemination and context, masses of raw blockchain data won’t automatically improve crypto market efficiency. And while blockchain data complexity may create alpha for savvy analysts, the lack of consistent data likely contributes to volatility, deterring institutional capital. You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Until now, the somewhat disjointed state of blockchain data has not been an issue given a market dominated by retail flows. But if the market is to ultimately become institutionalized (that is, garner the involvement of serious allocators like pensions, endowments, and insurance), it needs to evolve. To improve, the digital asset space can learn from traditional market approaches. Tokens are expected to accrue value in line with a project’s success. Thus, key performance indicators (KPIs) should be readily accessible, acting like “investor relations” pages for token holders. It’s unrealistic for start-up crypto projects to disclose information like public corporations do, but interim steps can improve the situation. For example, there are data points that could be relevant for almost all projects to disclose, including: supply schedules (with details of inflation and burn mechanisms, as well as unlocks), fees, active users and daily transactions. Naturally, projects will not have all the same indicators — for example, KPIs for a smart contract platform will look different than those for an application or DeFi protocol. Smart contract platforms may want to show how many apps are deployed in the ecosystem. DeFi protocols may want to showcase TVL or volumes. Regardless of utility, each project should make an effort to disclose as many data points as possible. Critically, this data should have detailed definitions and methodologies, along with reproducible code for how the information is derived from the blockchain. It should also be available with complete histories through time, and be easily downloadable or accessible via APIs. Efforts by projects to systematically disseminate key information should reduce uncertainty (and thereby volatility) and aid capital inflows into the crypto space. Investors should expect this level of transparency and reward projects that prioritize showcasing KPIs, while pushing for improvement at portfolio companies that do not. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, noted in a recent earnings call that more transparency and analytics could broaden digital asset investment, akin to the evolution of markets like mortgages and high-yield bonds. There are already strong players like Artemis that are providing blockchain data and analytics and setting standards for digital finance. Such providers will be essential, just as platforms like Bloomberg and S&P’s Capital IQ are in the traditional markets. However, each project building digital assets should do their part to enhance data availability for investors. As the crypto market matures in transparency and analytics, as many other nascent markets did before it, the scope for investment in the space should expand materially.

Title: US: Supreme Court blocks Trump's freeze of $2 billion in aid

The US president revised the 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico a day after implementing them. Meanwhile, Canada filed a WTO complaint against the new US tariffs. This blog has been closed. Thanks very much for reading. Below you can review developments from Donald Trump's first weeks in office on Thursday, February 13, 2025: New Zealand has dismissed its ambassador to the United Kingdom, Phil Goff, over comments critical of US President Donald Trump. Goff seemingly questioned Trump's understanding of history in comments at a forum organized by the Chatham House think tank in London on Tuesday. "President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?" Goff said. Goff contrasted Trump's stated policy of seeking a peace deal with Russia in Ukraine with British leader Winston Churchill's criticism of his predecessor, Neville Chamberlain, over signing the Munich Agreement that allowed Nazi Germany to annex the Sudetenland area of Czechoslovakia a year before the start of World War II. New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters described Goff's remarks as "deeply disappointing." "They do not represent the views of the NZ Government and make his position as High Commissioner to London untenable," he said. The chief of staff to House Speaker Mike Johnson, Hayden Haynes, was arrested on Tuesday night after he crashed into a police vehicle following Donald Trump's address to Congress. Haynes was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence and was later released. Police said that Haynes had "backed into a parked vehicle" shortly before midnight. Johnson's office said that the speaker was aware of the incident. "The Speaker is aware of the encounter that occurred last night involving his Chief of Staff and the Capitol Police," spokesperson Taylor Haulsee said. "The Speaker has full faith and confidence in Hayden's ability to lead the speaker's office." The Trump administration's decision to pause US foreign aid would undo progress made in containing tuberculosis (TB) infections across low- and middle-income countries,the World Health Organization said. "Without immediate action, hard-won progress in the fight against TB is at risk. Our collective response must be swift, strategic, and fully resourced to protect the most vulnerable and maintain momentum toward ending TB," said Tereza Kasaeva, director of WHO's Global Program on TB and Lung Health. Critical international aid, particularly from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), helped avert about 3.65 million deaths from the deadly disease last year alone, according to the agency. The US has historically contributed about one quarter of the total international donor funding for TB programs, which amounts to about $200 million (€185.3 million) to $250 million annually in bilateral funding, the WHO said. USAID has been one of the major targets of the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the federal government, a campaign spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk, who heads Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The Trump administration is looking to cut back over 80,000 jobs at the Department of Veterans Affairs, an agency that provides health care and other services for millions of veterans, according to an internal memo seen by news agencies. The internal memo, first reported by Government Executive, looks to "resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure." The memo calls for agency officials to work with the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency to "move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach" to the Trump administration’s goals. The VA’s chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, told top-level officials at the agency Tuesday that it had an objective to cut enough employees to return to 2019 staffing levels of just under 400,000.

The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) blocked the USDA from terminating probationary employees for 45 days. allowing the board to investigate the firings. The decision, issued by board member Cathy Harris, comes a day after a federal judge prevented Trump from removing her from her position. The move is seen as a significant obstacle to the Trump administration's efforts to carry out mass layoffs. Canada has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) against the United States. Canadian Ambassador to the WTO, Nadia Theodore, said her government had "requested WTO consultations with the government of the United States regarding its unjustified tariffs." WTO consultations are the first step of the international body's dispute settlement procedure. The two parties have 60 days to settle the matter before the claimant can request that a panel be set up to rule on it. A WTO official confirmed to AFP that "Canada initiated dispute proceedings yesterday against the US at the WTO on the additional tariffs," following a similar complaint filed by Beijing over fresh US levies on Chinese goods. Donald Trump says he will grant a one-month exemption for US automakers from new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. The US president's 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada took effect on Tuesday, along with a doubling of duties on Chinese goods to 20%. The White House, however, said on Wednesday that after talks with Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis, Trump will allow a one-month exemption from tariffs on auto imports from the neighboring countries. Tariffs create significant challenges for North American automakers. They build vehicles in all three countries and often move parts across international borders several times while assembling them into systems and finished vehicles. In an online post, President Donald Trump said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had called him "to ask what could be done about Tariffs." "I told him that many people have died from Fentanyl that came through the Borders of Canada and Mexico, and nothing has convinced me that it has stopped," Trump wrote. "He said that it’s gotten better, but I said, 'That’s not good enough.'" The US president also said that the call ended in a somewhat friendly manner. Trump has imposed broad tariffs on Canada, Mexico on Tuesday, citing an "extraordinary threat" from illegal immigration and drugs. Trudeau slammed the tariffs on calling it a "very dumb thing to do" and announced retaliatory measures. Trump also accused the Canadian leader of playing up a Canada-US trade war to cling to power. Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January, is to step down after a Liberal party leadership contest this weekend which will choose his replacement US President Trump was considering modifying the 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said. The announcement could come as early as Wednesday, only a day after Trump's tariffs were imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China. Lutnick dismissed the possibility of lifting the levies completely but signaled potential relief for specific sectors such as automakers. "But what he's thinking about is which sections of the market that can maybe, maybe, he'll consider giving them relief until we get to, of course, April 2," Lutnick said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls "reciprocal" tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes, and subsidies from other countries. However, Canada has already stated that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not willing to lift Canada's retaliatory tariffs unless Trump removes all tariffs. "We're not interested in meeting in the middle and having some reduced tariff. Canada wants the tariffs removed," Canadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the Canadian national broadcaster. In his address to Congress, US President Donald Trump accused Mexican drug cartels of already "waging war on America," adding that "it's time for America to wage war on the cartels." The accusations were launched on the same day his administration announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Trump claims the tariffs are an appropriate response to what he believes is a failure of the Mexican government to stop illegal drugs from entering the US. "The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control," he told Congress. Mexican president Claudia Sheinbaum last month announced a deployment of additional 10,000 troops to the US-Mexico border. The US Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that President Donald Trump's administration cannot stop payments to foreign aid organizations for work they have already completed for the government. The court supported US District Judge Amir Ali's decision, which ordered the Trump administration to quickly release funding to contractors and grant recipients from the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department for their past work. Ali had ordered the US State Department and USAID to pay nearly $2 billion to contractors by midnight on Wednesday last week. The Trump administration turned to the Supreme Court as the deadline approached. They argued that handling claims properly in such a short time was impossible. By a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court told Ali to "clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines." The court's decision, however, keeps Ali's temporary restraining order in place, which stopped the spending freeze.

In his first speech to Congress after becoming president again, Trump welcomed a deal by a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock to acquire two Panama Canal ports He described this deal as an early step in his administration's plan to "reclaim" the important waterway. President Mulino, however accused Trump of "once again lying" in a post on X, formerly Twitter. "The Panama Canal is not in the process of being reclaimed... the Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!" Panama, took over control of the crucial international waterway in 1999 under a treaty negotiated with the United States 20 years earlier. Trump has repeatedly threatened to "take back" control of the Panama Canal. A consortium led by US firm BlackRock has agreed to purchase the ports of Balboa and Cristobal on either end of the canal from a Hong Kong-based company CK Hutchison. The canal is home to several other ports. Greenland's prime minister said, "Greenland is ours" and cannot be taken or sold. This was in response to President Donald Trump, who told Congress the United States would acquire the territory "one way or another." "Kalaallit Nunaat is ours," Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede wrote, using Greenlandic for the "Land of the People" or the "Land of the Greenlanders." Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in an interview with broadcaster TV2, echoed Egede in repeating that Greenland is not for sale. Located in the Arctic Circle, Greenland sits between Canada and northern Europe. Although an autonomous territory, it is still ruled by the Danish crown. Any American effort to acquire Greenland would therefore have to include Denmark.

PANAMA CITY (AP) — Panama President José Raúl Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was “reclaiming” the Panama Canal.Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal.Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group’s operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. “reclaiming” of the canal. Panama’s government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction.Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. “I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,” he wrote. He accused Trump of “lying again.”Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal’s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations.“Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,” Mulino wrote. “It doesn’t have anything to do with ‘reclaiming the canal’ nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.”In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt. The deal has to be approved by Panama’s government.The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter “foolishly” gave the canal away.Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was “the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.”“I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Sixt said.

Title: Ethereum 2025 Price Prediction as Trump Announces US Crypto Reserve

Time Published: 2025-03-05T15:30:18Z

Following its inclusion in Donald Trump’s newly announced US Crypto Reserve, Ethereum’s price prediction for 2025 has become one of the hottest topics of debate among crypto enthusiasts and pundits. While a vast majority is expecting $ETH to ride the positive momentum and finally break out of its long-drawn sideways channel, some say there’s more price correction in store. In this guide, we’ll let Ethereum speak to us; we’ll analyze its technicals and fundamentals to draw out a clear picture of where we think the second-biggest crypto in the world could be headed in the coming 10 months. If you’re after a quick answer, here’s everything you need to know about $ETH’s upcoming performance: Overall, since the higher timeframes override the smaller ones, and because the market sentiment also screams bullishness, $ETH’s larger picture looks very positive. Once it breaks and holds above a lower high, many feel we can expect $ETH to reach new highs, including the $6K mark, in 2025. The best way to go about technical analysis is to start from the higher timeframes and then scoot lower. This helps establish a strong understanding of the overall direction of the cryptocurrency — whether certain short-term trends are aligned with the larger picture or just temporary price corrections. With that in mind, we’ll start our analysis at $ETH’s weekly chart. Right off the bat, we notice that Ethereum is at a major support zone (between $1.9K and $2.3K). This is where $ETH took support in November last year before bouncing to $4K. Additionally, this support zone also contains the $2K mark, which is an important psychological number. For those unaware, round figures such as this often act as strong support and resistance levels. The $2K level, in particular, is a very notable one, seeing as $ETH has reacted to it almost every single time ever since it first touched it all the way back in February 2021. Another massive positive sign is that $ETH (on the weekly chart) is currently at and reacting to the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is one of the most prominent indicators of technical analysis. Given that $BTC (on the daily chart) bounced off the 200 EMA less than a week ago, we can expect $ETH to do the same. According to Glassnode, a blockchain analytics firm, the $1.9K price point is also a major accumulation zone, with over 1.82M $ETH being bought at it by long-term investors since August 2023. Having mentioned the various reasons $ETH looks ripe for an upward rally, the biggest clue we get about its upcoming prices is through the good old rectangle pattern. Simply put, Ethereum has been trapped between the $2K and $4K levels. Plus, given that this has been the case for almost a year now, a breakout above the ceiling ($4K) could see $ETH reach a new high that’s as far away as the breadth of the rectangle. The upper and lower limits of the rectangle, in this case, are $2K apart, meaning we can expect $ETH to cross $6K once it breaks above $4K. Although the weekly timeframe is the boss and dictates the larger picture, the daily and 4-hour timeframes often provide an excellent outlook for the short term. Unfortunately, though, the two major moving averages (50 EMA and 200 EMA) are both sloping downwards on these timeframes. This suggests that institutional buying is yet to enter the market. However, trends in crypto could change in hours because large buying often results in towering candlesticks, and just a couple of those would be enough to throw $ETH over the EMAs. $ETH is up 5.75% today and is currently trading at around $2,200. The latest surge in its price is likely due to its inclusion in Trump’s Crypto Strategic Reserve. It is, after all, one of the only five cryptos that made it to the list. Not only is the amount huge, but $ETH also makes up nearly 65% of the firm’s entire $300M+ crypto portfolio. Clearly, Trump is backing Ethereum to hit it out of the park, which is one of the biggest reasons the $6K target looks extremely realistic. Also, Ethereum is the only other crypto besides Bitcoin to have spot ETFs (exchange-traded funds), which is a huge positive as far as investor participation in $ETH is concerned. The fact that BlackRock ‘likes’ Ethereum is nothing to sniff at, either. The asset management company launched a tokenized money market fund last year, and it chose Ethereum as its blockchain of choice for this fund. In other news, Ethereum is also nearing a huge Pectra upgrade. It was successfully deployed on the Sepolia testnet today, and Pectra’s mainnet is expected to launch in April. This update will consist of 11 major features, which will together make the Ethereum ecosystem more user-friendly, affordable, and efficient. For instance, the validator staking limit will be increased from 32 $ETH to 2,048 $ETH. In addition to being a game-changer for validators, who will be able to compound their earnings, this move is expected to reduce selling pressure over a long enough time period. What’s more, we’ll see a bunch of wallet and security improvements, too. These include batched transactions, gas sponsorship, application-wise spending limits, and different recovery mechanisms. With Ethereum expected to nearly triple in price this year, it’s certainly shaping up to be a great investment choice for traditional crypto traders. However, for those with an appetite for higher risks and rewards, the Meme Index ($MEMEX) presale could be a better pick. The $MEMEX presale is fast approaching the $4M mark, and each token is currently available for just $0.0166883 — here’s how to buy $MEMEX if you’re looking to get in as an early investor. What’s more, you’ll also be able to benefit from the project’s 579% staking rewards. Last but not least, we’d like to mention that although our analysis and experience tell us that both $ETH and $MEMEX are excellent crypto investment opportunities, this article shouldn’t be considered a substitute for professional financial advice. You must always do your own research before investing. Krishi is in charge of covering the latest crypto news, sharing valuable information in an easy-to-read manner.

Title: BlackRock’s $23-billion deal to strengthen US control over Panama Canal Ports, global trade sees rising American presence in other strategic assets

Global trade observers, who continue to assess the changing geo-political power equation and subsequent probability of tariff war and control over strategic assets like ports, say this implies US control extending to multiple entities in nearly two dozen countries, on a key trade route that will include a presence in Europe, Egypt, and Asia, among others. However, there will be no direct impact on India, senior Shipping Ministry officials here told businessline. “Not much of our cargo goes through the Panama Canal, so the impact on trade is limited. But, we will have to keep a watch on how things progress,” the person tracking these developments said. “But, the US’ presence through a BlackRock-led consortium will expand to many strategic assets possibly,” a second official said. Concerns on how retaliatory tariffs could impact container freight rates have also surfaced, but it’s early days still. The $23-billion deal BlackRock’s deal with Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison is worth $22.8 billion. The companies in a joint statement said they have reached in-principle agreements whereby the BlackRock-TiL Consortium will acquire HPH’s 90 per cent interests in the Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama (also called the Panama Terminals); and 80 per cent of CK Hutchison’s effective and controlling interest in subsidiary and associated companies - owning, operating and developing a total of 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries. The ports sale does not include any interest in the HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China. Control for Panama Canal This sale is being seen as a major victory for US President Donald Trump, who has been insisting on taking control of the Panama Canal. This transaction is “purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” asserted CK Hutchison Co-Managing Director Frank Sixt in a statement. Nearly 40 per cent of American ships use the Panama Canal, but it accounts for about 5 per cent of global trade, and is a key link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The canal is used extensively for trade between the US East Coast and Asia. According to Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, Senior Director & Global Head (transport, mobility, and logistics) at Crisil Intelligence, the BlackRock deal means the US is “securing its supply chain”. “So the US will have more control over the ships; and a better hold over supplies entering through the country’s east coast, one of its major trade routes,” he said. Padmanabhan says there will be hardly “any direct impact on the trade with India”, but the more important issue to be looked into are “how the retaliatory tariff action will play out”. “Normally, you will continue to see export activity happening from the East Coast – Asia, including India – to the West – USA; and empty containers moving out of the US,” he said. Container price movement According to the Drewry container index, prices decreased 6 per cent to $2,629 per 40 ft container beginning March, 75 per cent below the pandemic peak of $10,377 (September 2021), and the lowest since May 2024. Freight rates from Shanghai to Los Angeles decreased 11 per cent or $411 to $3,477 per 40ft container, closely followed by the rates on Shanghai to New York, which decreased 10 per cent or $533 to $4,593 per 40ft container. Rates from Shanghai to Genoa fell 2 per cent or $90 to $3,747 per 40ft container, and those from Shanghai to Rotterdam and Rotterdam to New York reduced 1 per cent to $2,586 and $2,374 per 40ft container, respectively. On the other hand, rates from Rotterdam to Shanghai, and New York to Rotterdam increased 1 per cent to $503 and $835 per 40ft container, respectively. Meanwhile, rates from Los Angeles to Shanghai remained stable. Drewry expects rates to continue to decrease next week due to increased shipping capacity, it said in a report.

Title: Stock of the Day: BlackRock rises after Trump shouts out firm's deal for Panama Canal ports

The move: BlackRock rose 1% at the start of trading on Wednesday, reaching $961 per share. The stock has struggled this year, and is still down about 7% year-to-date. Why: The world's largest asset manager is leading a consortium to buy a majority stake in the two ports from CK Hutchison, a Hong Kong conglomerate. The deal is valued at $22.8 billion. In his address to Congress on Tuesday, US President Donald Trump acknowledged the deal, which involves BlackRock's acquisition of two Panama Canal ports. "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal," Trump said during his address. CK Hutchison expects to receive over $19 billion in cash proceeds for the sale — worth as much as its valuation, according to Bloomberg. Its stock rose as much as 25% in Hong Kong on Wednesday. The consortium, made up of BlackRock's Global Infrastructures Partners and Terminal Investment Limited, will acquire 90% of the Panama Ports company. The firm operates the Balboa and Cristobal terminals. What it means: The deal hands a political win to Trump, who has said Chinese interests have taken control of the pivotal trade route. The White House has gone as far as suggesting that the canal be returned return to US hands. "The Panama Canal was built by Americans, for Americans, not for others, but others could use it," Trump said. If the ports change hands, this might relieve US pressure on Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino. However, he pushed back on Trump's Tuesday notion that Washington was "reclaiming" the canal. For BlackRock, it marks the largest infrastructure deal in its history. The ports have made up a large part of CK Hutchinson's port division, which was the firm's third-biggest business in the first half of last year, Bloomberg reports. Jump to

Title: US Firm Is Buying Up Panama Canal Ports

"My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," Trump told Congress on Tuesday, alluding to a deal that would see an investment group led by US asset manager BlackRock buy up two ports at either end of the canal. In total, the consortium will buy 43 ports comprised of 199 berths in 23 countries from Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison for a cost of $19 billion, Reuters reports. CK Hutchison and Panama President José Raúl Mulino claimed the deal was not political, though it comes after Trump demanded "the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question" and complained about high shipping fees and Chinese influence. Mulino said this was "a global transaction, between private companies, motivated by mutual interests," per the New York Times. Frank Sixt, a co-managing director at CK Hutchison, said it was "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama ports." However, the wealthy Hong Kong-based Li family that owns CK Hutchison believed it was under pressure to sell off its ports business, and particularly its Panama Canal ports of Cristobal and Balboa, and "specifically sought an American buyer," the Times reports. Executives at BlackRock then briefed Trump and other members of the administration on the deal, receiving their support. The consortium also includes Terminal Investment and Global Infrastructure Partners. CK Hutchison is set to receive $19 billion for its 80% stake in the Hutchison Ports group. The stake was valued around $13 billion, meaning "the disposal would be significantly value enhancing," Citigroup analysts said, per Reuters. CK Hutchison's stock closed up 22% on Wednesday for its highest price since August 1, 2023. Trump claimed the deal would "further enhance our national security," per CBS News. "China is operating the Panama Canal," he claimed without evidence, per the Wall Street Journal. Last month, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested China could block US traffic. (More Panama Canal stories.)

Title: DAVID BLACKMON: Trump Homes In On American Energy In Congressional Speech

Time Published: 2025-03-05T13:22:14Z

Unlike his predecessors, President Donald Trump always seems to have energy and its impacts to the lives of all Americans at the top of his mind. Following his stemwinding acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last August, I was able to highlight the more than 1,000 words specific to energy included in it. The president’s high prioritization of energy and energy policy came into sharp focus again Tuesday night in his speech to a joint session of congress. None of what he said about energy received applause from the Democrats present in the House Chamber, but that was no surprise. Trump noted early in the speech there was literally nothing he could say to evoke such a response from minority party. But ordinary Americans struggling to make ends meet after years of Biden/Harris-era inflation likely had a different reaction given that Trump’s focus on energy policy both in the speech and in action across the first six weeks of his second presidency has been focused on reforms designed to cut energy costs for everyone. “Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations,” Trump said early on. “I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying … We ended all of Biden’s environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration’s insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction.” Mr. Trump concluded that portion of the speech by pointing to his Day 1 executive order that all federal agencies must eliminate 10 old regulations for every new regulation they wish to implement. Again, this focused effort to tear down the entrenched bureaucratic state is designed boost the economy, create thousands of high paying jobs and lower prices by cutting the cost of regulatory overhead for which consumers inevitably pay. Congress is also doing its part, having already eliminated some of the costliest Biden regulations via the Congressional Review Act. Every action described there will, if made permanent, boost the economy and reduce the cost of energy for all Americans. Yes, even for the Democrats, some of whom audibly hissed during that portion of the speech. Amazing. Where energy minerals are concerned, President Trump reiterated his desire to establish a U.S. presence in or control of Greenland and its enormous known reserves of rare earth minerals and other critical energy minerals. “I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland,” Trump said. “We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.” Trump said Greenland is not just about energy, noting its control is also crucial for national security and even international security. “One way or the other, we’re going to get it,” he said, adding, “We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.” The president also spoke about his administration’s efforts to re-establish U.S. control over the Panama Canal, noting that “a large American company (which turns out to be a BlackRock-led consortium) announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.” Preserving the free flow of shipping through the Panama Canal during times of peace and potential war is critical to U.S. energy security given that crude oil is the most internationally traded commodity and LNG is rapidly rising on that list. The maintenance of strong energy security is among the most crucial aspects of ensuring strong national security and economic prosperity. In reference to the amazing progress his administration has made in securing the southern border without any help from congress, Trump mocked Biden-era claims by the “media and our friends in the Democrat Party that…we must have legislation to secure the border.” “But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president,” he concluded. It has become starkly obvious over the last 6 weeks that the same principle applies to energy policy. The whole world has changed since Jan. 20.

Title: A once-hot startup got a $1.5 billion loan. More than $500 million went to a high school dropout's 'sham' hedge fund, judge rules.

Call it the case of the vanishing half a billion dollars. During the pandemic-era startup funding boom, the education technology company Byju's raised money from some of the biggest names in global investing. At its peak, the Bengaluru-based company was valued at $22 billion, making it the most valuable startup in India. But last week, a US judge ruled that entities associated with Byju's had fraudulently transferred over $500 million to a group the judge deemed a "sham." The summary judgment in Delaware bankruptcy court, released on Thursday, advances the lenders' yearslong search for the missing money. Judge John T. Dorsey ruled against Riju Ravindran — a former Byju's board member and the founder's brother — and entities related to the company, including a hedge fund founded by a 23-year-old high school dropout. Dorsey found the $533 million was fraudulently transferred to what he called a "high-risk and unproven hedge fund." It had few other investors, a high fee structure, and, at one point, a Miami IHOP headquarters address with a non-working phone, per court documents. The ruling opens the door for damages — with a hearing about specifics still to be scheduled — and for the lenders to try to recover some of that money. In November 2021, after equity fundraising from BlackRock, the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, and other power players, Byju's set up a special financing vehicle with $1.2 billion from top private lenders, including Ares Management and HPS Investment Partners. Led by the media-hungry founder Byju Raveendran, Byju's expanded quickly by snapping up other companies. Months after the lenders' money came in and without their knowledge, Ravindran transferred $533 million to a tiny hedge fund called Camshaft Capital, per Thursday's summary judgement. The fund was run by a portfolio manager named William Morton, who the lenders said in a complaint had no investment experience. The lenders' complaint said last year that Morton had recently bought three luxury cars: a 2023 Ferrari Roma, a 2020 Lamborghini Huracán EVO, and a 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith. Ravindran's attorneys told the Delaware bankruptcy court that he moved the money to Camshaft because "Byju's felt the need to protect the cash." Ravindran said in sworn testimony that he had never heard of Camshaft before April 2022 and that he did no diligence prior to the transfers. Dorsey wrote in the summary judgment that Camshaft should have spotted "numerous red flags" pointing to the transactions' "fraudulent purpose." Camshaft then lent the money to a British company in a deal done without the lenders' approval, wrote Dorsey. The lenders have yet to trace the money, despite extensive efforts detailed in court documents. Last week's lawsuit is just one part of Byju's winding saga, which stretches across continents and involves more than a dozen lawsuits. While the level of funding Byju's commanded during its heyday sets it apart from the ed-tech competition, the company is part of a wave of global startups that picked up significant funding during the pandemic. At the time, investors scrambled to back companies amid record low interest rates. Now, lower valuations in a much different market threaten those good-times investments. After negotiations with Byju's fell apart over missed interest payments and other issues, the lenders put the special financing vehicle through involuntary bankruptcy. They appointed Timothy Pohl, a restructuring veteran, to manage the company and unravel the key mystery: the money's trail. But even after Pohl took over as the sole manager in March 2023, Ravindran continued to move money out, Dorsey wrote in Thursday's summary judgement. In May 2023, Raveendran told an advisor to the lenders that the money had gone "someplace the Lenders will never find it," the advisor later wrote in a declaration. So far, legal proceedings have offered few clues about the missing $533 million. Morton and his fund were held in contempt of court last year for failure to cooperate with discovery. He told The Wall Street Journal last spring that he had fled the US with no plans to return — and that Camshaft is not a sham. Raveendran and Ravindran are last known to be living in Dubai. Ravindran was also held in contempt of court last year. The lenders said in a statement on Friday that they see the ruling as a "significant step forward" in their recovery efforts. "We are gratified the Court unequivocally recognized that Riju Ravindran, Camshaft, and BYJU's together conducted a deliberate fraud on a global scale arising from the theft of $533 million," the lenders said in the statement. Byju's is still operating, but the company faces significant turmoil beyond the US bankruptcy case. BlackRock and at least one other equity investor have written off the value of their investments. BlackRock and the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative did not respond to Business Insider's requests for comment, nor did Byju's. Lawyers for Morton and Ravindran did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Morton or Raveendran. Ravindran could not be located for comment. Raveendran wrote on LinkedIn on Friday and again on Monday that he would rebuild the company. "I will keep on keeping on. Till the wrongs are righted, and the mistakes are corrected," he posted on Monday. Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at mmorris@businessinsider.com or Signal or Telegram at +1 646 768 1627.

Since invading Ukraine, Russia has likely sustained approximately 875,000 casualties in total.* The average daily Russian casualties during February 2025 was 1,255 according to Ukrainian General Staff reporting, the lowest daily average since August 2024. The total reported Russian casualties in February 2025 was 35,140, a decrease of around 13,000 from January's total which was the second highest monthly total of the conflict.* The decrease in the recorded rate of casualties, whilst remaining high, likely reflects a decrease in the tempo of Russian operations and assaults. Russia's casualty rate will likely continue to average above 1,000 a day in March 2025, with continued dismounted infantry attacks on multiple axes.[Fark user image 425x531]\|/ orcs delenda est Meatsim1: There is no way in hell China sends troops to help Russia, what even is this headline Oneiros: day after the orange shiatgoblin's verbal diarrhea to congress thread warning Call the Guy: The China thing has been retracted Tracianne: 🇩🇪👀 Germany examines options to prevent the Baltic Sea pipeline's 'Nord Stream 2' revival, amid secret U.S.-Russia talks about purchasing it, - BILD- MAKS 24 👀🇺🇦 (@maks23.bsky.social) March 5, 2025 at 3:56 AM seriousUh-Huh: I can't tell if China considering troops is because of tariffs or in retaliation of tariffs.

Title: BlackRock bought the ports of Hutchison Ports for $22.8 billion – Including the ports in the Panama Canal

An impressive deal has been announced as a consortium led by BlackRock has agreed with CK Hutchison to acquire its controlling stake in Hutchison Port Holdings (HPH). The acquisition includes ports in the Panama Canal, as well as dozens of other ports worldwide, with the deal valued at $22.8 billion! The agreement, which covers 80% of HPH, will include a range of ports in 23 countries, with 199 berths. Notably, the ports in Panama, located in the cities of Balboa and Cristobal, are among the most strategic aspects of the deal, while ports in Hong Kong and China are not included. TIL, a subsidiary of MSC, will participate in the acquisition through the consortium and has already expressed enthusiasm for the agreement. It is noteworthy that this deal comes at a time of intense geopolitical tensions, with the U.S. and China in ongoing confrontation. However, both CK Hutchison and its partners insist that this move is purely commercial and not related to political pressures, despite analysts linking the deal to political developments around the Panama Canal. “This transaction is the result of a competitive process and has nothing to do with political developments,” said Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison. The deal is pending legal and regulatory approvals, meaning investors should be cautious with CK Hutchison shares until its completion. Despite any political implications, the agreement is expected to have a positive impact on the global shipping industry, with many anticipating that the new owners will further enhance the business potential of the ports.

Title: ‘Our wealth management services are strengthened by the backing of the Mauritius IFC’ – Carrick Wealth

Carrick Wealth is an international financial advisory and wealth management business with five offices in Africa, three more planned to open in 2025, and more than $1 billion under management. The firm, in its 10th year of operating, counts BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Natixis among its partners, supporting them to access high-potential investments in Africa, a market that requires deep local knowledge and largely operates outside traditional Western risk-reward metrics.

Speaking on a webinar hosted by the Economic Development Board of Mauritius (EDB Mauritius), Beeharry explains that while tax neutrality is certainly one advantage of being domiciled in Mauritius – there is no capital gains, withholding tax or inheritance tax duties and the island has an extensive network of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements (DTAAs) – he says that the private banking and wealth management initiatives and guidelines driven by robust regulatory and institutional bodies such as EDB Mauritius, the Bank of Mauritius and the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the regulatory body for non-banking financial services – have played a much bigger role in supporting Carrick to flourish. Since 1990, when Mauritius established itself as an International Financial Centre (IFC), it has been relentless in its pursuit to build on a banking legacy established almost 200 years ago by French traders and create a name for itself in international high-end wealth management, leveraging its strategic location between Europe, Africa and high-growth markets in Asia and historic links with all three continents. Family Office licenses were introduced in 2016 under the country’s Financial Services Act and subsequently upgraded, which allow for the operations of Single and Multiple Family Offices that can offer a wide and flexible range of trusts, foundations and other structures with Switzerland-style asset protection and confidentiality. The Family Office license holder benefits from a 10-year tax holiday based on certain employment and expenditure criteria and must have assets of at least $5 million for each family member. In a boost to these services, the Mauritius IFC recently introduced an innovative fund structure called the Variable Capital Company (VCC), which allows multiple sub funds or Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) within a single legal entity – particularly attractive for investors in private equity and venture capital. The Mauritius VCC ringfences each sub-fund or SPV assets and so prevents cross-contamination of risk. This gives reassurance to the end investor as well as increasing operational flexibility and reducing costs. There is also the ability to pay dividends out of the capital of the VCC. These are not yet available in many other financial jurisdictions and Beeharry highlights these structures as a key influence in the firm in devising its business strategy for and through Mauritius, adding: “The VCC allows an ease of doing business for our clients, but beyond that, when we look at the compelling advantages for companies like ours running Family Offices through Mauritius for ultras, it’s the confidentiality, the data protection and the strength of Mauritius, based on aspects like its rule of law, which enables safe and smart access to internationally robust financial services.” Mauritius is known as one of Africa’s strongest and safest democracies, with a history of independent institutions and a commitment to the highest standards of operations. Mauritius meets all 40 requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), is deemed to have no Harmful Tax Practice as per the OECD’s FHTP peer review mechanism and is whitelisted by the EU. In relation to FACTA, Mauritius signed an Agreement for the Exchange of Information Relating to Taxes with the US and established the legal framework to enable exchange of tax information between the two countries, including the Inter-Governmental Agreement. This guarantees the automatic exchange of information under the Common Reporting Standards (CRS). Beeharry says these strong regulatory factors, which have underpinned the doubling of the island’s capital markets in three years and attracted an ecosystem of banks, law firms, corporate services and private equity funds, will continue to support Mauritius in its drive to grow its reputation in global wealth management at a time when wealth and the population of high-net worth individuals is on the rise after a difficult few years. In further evidence of Mauritius being focused on the future, the FSC has also recently enhanced its regulatory framework to recognise cryptocurrencies, like Ethereum and Bitcoin, as asset classes under the Virtual Asset and Initial Token Offerings Services Act 2021 in recognition of the rising interest in security tokens built on blockchain technology and crypto investments. Warwyck, a private bank and wealth management firm is the first financial services institution on the island to secure virtual asset licenses under these new laws. As a result, Warwyck is able to offer digital asset custodian, conversion, trading and investment services in Mauritius. Its digital asset exchange-traded fund (ETF), offered under the VCC entity joins leading global investment firms which have launched digital asset retail funds over the past few years, those offering exposure to a basket of cryptocurrencies or companies involved in blockchain technology. It is widely anticipated that a Donald Trump administration will push for regulatory changes in the US that will likely accelerate the institutional and retail adoption of crypto and tokenisation by integrating it into mainstream financial services. According to Henley & Partners, a high-net worth migration consultancy based in London, the total market value of crypto assets reached $2.3 trillion in 2024, an 89% increase on 2023. Warwyck CEO Devika Bhuwanee says: “Today, in wealth management we are seeing a growing number of investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies and we are seeing more wealth managers encouraging their clients to get exposure to crypto assets. The challenge they face is they typically must open a separate trading account with a crypto exchange to be able to buy, trade and hold these assets – an additional layer of complexity and risk. Here, at Warwyck, in one single trading account our clients get exposure to both traditional securities and to virtual assets. We can also facilitate the conversion of Bitcoin into fiat. “This is a service we can offer as a result of Mauritius pushing its regulatory framework to evolve in line with market demand.” EDB Mauritius Introduced the Regulatory Sandbox License (RSL) in 2016. This offers the possibility for an investor to conduct an innovative or disruptive business business activity for which there exists no legal framework, or adequate provisions under existing legislation in Mauritius. Under the RSL regime a temporary framework with guidelines is implemented allowing initial launch until the appropriate legal framework and adequate provisions are established. “We want to be a leading destination for structuring investments, particularly into the African and Asian markets and we will continue to be proactive in adapting to global wealth trends, regulatory compliance and investment opportunities,” says Vinay Guddye, director, financial services, EDB Mauritius.

Bitcoin has broken back above $90,000 per bitcoin, bouncing back after a roller coaster week that’s seen U.S. president Donald Trump trigger bitcoin and crypto price chaos. Unlock over $3,000 in NFT, web3 and crypto perks — Apply now! The bitcoin price has climbed around 10% over the last 24 hours, pushing the combined crypto market back over $3 trillion, helped by BlackRock revealing a market game-changer. Now, as Elon Musk issues a “foolish” crypto warning, Trump’s Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly confirmed Trump will unveil a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve during Friday’s White House crypto summit. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. President Donald Trump will announce a bitcoin strategic reserve on Friday, according to ... [+] Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, sending the bitcoin price sharply higher. “The President definitely thinks that there’s a bitcoin strategic reserve,” Lutnick, who has claimed to have millions of dollars worth of exposure to bitcoin, told independent news site The Pavlovic Today. “Now there will be the question of, how do we handle the other cryptocurrencies? And I think the model is going to be announced on Friday when we do that.” Lutnick added that bitcoin would receive a "unique status" under Trump's plans. “This is massive,” Pete Rizzo, the former Coindesk editor-in-chief who styles himself as a “bitcoin historian,” posted to X. On Friday, the first White House crypto summit will see influential crypto executives, founders and investors meet with representatives of the president’s working group on digital assets to hash out a regulatory road map for crypto as well as confirm details of Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve. “After a turbulent week of trading bitcoin has sharply rebounded to the $90,000 mark ahead of this Friday’s inaugural crypto summit," Petr Kozyakov, the chief executive of payment infrastructure platform Mercuryo, said in emailed comments. “Renewed optimism that U.S. president Donald Trump will make the announcement of a bitcoin reserve strategy is triggering a wave of buy orders for the king of crypto. A road map forward towards a crypto strategic reserve and a model for how it would be structured will be foremost in the minds of industry leaders attending the summit. The prospect of such a monumental move is bullish and may turn sentiment around in a digital token space still reeling from the recent hack of the Bybit exchange, the biggest of all time, and an implosion of the meme coin sector.” Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies Ripple’s XRP, solana and cardano all rocketed higher last weekend after Trump posted to his Truth Social account that he plans to create a U.S.-focused crypto reserve. “A U.S. crypto reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration, which is why my executive order on digital assets directed the presidential working group to move forward on a crypto strategic reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA," Trump posted to his Truth Social account, adding in a follow up post that bitcoin and ethereum would also be included. Smaller cryptocurrencies being named ahead of bitcoin in a potential reserve sparked a backlash from some bitcoin supporters and led to criticism of Trump’s advisors who are believed to be acting in their own interest. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has swung wildly after rocketing higher in the aftermath of Donald Trump's ... [+] election victory. In December, Trump confirmed he plans to establish a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. "We're gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead," Trump told CNBC. "Yes, I think so," Trump said in response to a question about whether the U.S. will create a bitcoin strategic reserve similar to its oil reserve. In July, then Republican candidate Donald Trump promised to create a "strategic national bitcoin reserve" and predicted bitcoin could eclipse gold’s near-$20 trillion market capitalization during an appearance at the Bitcoin 2024 conference.

Title: Ports sale offers Panama way out of Trump row: experts

Trump has been fixated on the question of who controls shipping in the Panama Canal, which was built by Washington over a century ago to link the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and later handed over to Panama. The Republican leader has repeatedly threatened the use of force to seize the canal, claiming that Hutchison's ownership of two ports, one at either entrance to the canal, gave China control over the strategic waterway which links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Panama rejected the claim that China had de facto control over the canal, which handles 40 percent of US container traffic, while taking various actions to appease Trump. Its campaign to dodge his fury received a major boost on Tuesday with Hutchison's announcement that it would offload its ports to a group led by giant US asset manager BlackRock. The sale offers Panama "a way out of the diplomatic crisis without needing to cancel (Hutchison's) concession, which would further damage the investment climate in Panama," Benjamin Gedan, director of the Latin America program at the Washington based Wilson Center think tank told AFP. Panama's government insisted that it had no hand in Hutchison's sale, insisting it was a deal "between private companies." Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, also argued that the deal was "purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports." But analysts said it came as a relief nonetheless for President Jose Raul Mulino, who had been under fierce pressure to reduce China's footprint in the country, without riling the second-largest user of the canal after the United States. In January, his government ordered an audit of Hutchison's Panamanian subsidiary, Panama Ports, in what was seen as a shot across the bow at the group owned by businessman Li Ka-shing, one of Asia's richest men. In the end, one of Hong Kong's largest conglomerates decided to bow to Trump's pressure. "In the Trump era, business is the new geopolitics," Sabrina Bacal, a Panamanian political scientist, told AFP. Natasha Lindstaedt, a political scientist at the University of Essex, called the situation "strange." "Possibly because the company was going to get audited by the Panamanian government and saw it more advantageous to sell than deal with the hassle," she said. - 'Taking back' the canal - In his inauguration speech on January 20, Trump declared the United States was "taking back" the Panama Canal, claiming China operated it. On a visit to Panama two weeks later, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued Mulino with an ultimatum to immediately reduce Chinese influence on the canal or face unspecified "measures." Panama sought desperately to appease the Trump administration by first pulling out of China's massive Belt and Road infrastructure program and then offering to act as a beachhead for Trump's mass migrant deportations. Panamanian authorities also began piling pressure on Hutchison, which handled 39 percent of the containers that passed through Panamanian docks in 2024, according to the Panamanian Maritime Authority. The country's Supreme Court agreed to consider two requests to annul the ports concession granted to Hutchison, which Panama's attorney general claimed was unconstitutional. The concession was first awarded in 1997 and extended for 25 years in 2021. While Hutchison's sale of the ports is expected to silence Trump's criticism of Chinese involvement in the canal, he could however continue to complain that US vessels are being overcharged to use the waterway. Last month, the US State Department claimed that Panama had agreed to let US naval vessels through for free -- a claim denied by the Panama Canal Authority, the independent agency that runs the shipping route.

Title: Trump says U.S. is 'reclaiming' Panama Canal after BlackRock strikes deal to buy Chinese-backed ports

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — A Hong Kong-based conglomerate has agreed to sell its stake in two Panama Canal ports to U.S. and Swiss investors amid pressure from the Trump administration over the ports’ ties to China. CK Hutchison, a conglomerate founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, has agreed in principle to sell its controlling stake in a unit that operates the two ports to a consortium that includes the U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the companies said Tuesday. President Donald Trump had argued that the Chinese-backed ports, one each at the canal’s Pacific and Atlantic entrances, posed a national security threat because they gave the Chinese military potential control of the strategically vital canal. Though CK Hutchison said the proposed sale was unrelated to politics, Trump touted it as a victory in his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” he said. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal.” Nearly 15,000 ships from around the world transit each year through the Panama Canal, which was built primarily with U.S. funds and was completed in 1914. About two-thirds of them are headed to or from the U.S. In 1999, the U.S. relinquished control of the canal to Panama under a treaty negotiated by President Jimmy Carter and ratified by the Senate in 1978, with the U.S. retaining the permanent right to defend the canal against any threat to its neutrality. Trump has claimed without evidence that China controls the Panama Canal. He said he would consider using military force to seize it back from Panama, one of Washington’s closest allies in Latin America. “We didn’t give it to China,” Trump told Congress on Tuesday. “We gave it to Panama and we’re taking it back.” Both China and Panama deny there is any foreign interference in the 50-mile canal, whose neutrality is enshrined in Panama’s Constitution. “China supports Panama’s sovereignty over the canal and is committed to maintaining its status as a permanently neutral international waterway,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. “China has never been involved in the management or operation of the canal, nor has it interfered in its affairs,” he said. The Trump administration and members of Congress were briefed on the proposed $22.8 billion deal, a person familiar with the matter told NBC News. The consortium, which also includes the Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, would gain control of an 80% interest in CK Hutchison subsidiary Hutchison Ports, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. It would also receive 90% of Panama Ports, which operates the Balboa port on the Pacific side of the canal and the Cristóbal port on the Atlantic side. It does not affect the company’s ports in China. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a news release. The news sent CK Hutchison up almost 22% Wednesday on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index. Control over the Panama Canal has been a high-profile focus of the Trump administration, with Marco Rubio making Panama part of his first foreign trip as secretary of state. Hutchison Ports won the rights to manage the two Panama Canal ports in 1997 in a bidding process that was described as fair and nondiscriminatory by U.S. officials at the time. In 2021, its contract was extended until 2047. Though the two ports sit at opposite ends of the Panama Canal, ships do not have to pass through them to enter. Other ports along the canal are operated by companies from Taiwan, Singapore and the U.S. The ports serve mainly to handle cargo, while the canal itself is run by the Panama Canal Authority, an independent Panamanian government agency. Though CK Hutchison is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous Chinese territory, Trump administration officials had argued that it was subject to control by Beijing, which has been tightening its grip on the city. The potential sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Essential news coupled with the finest maritime content sourced from across the globe. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Panama Canal Authority Administrator Ricaurte Vasquez tour the Miraflores locks at the Panama Canal in Panama City Feb. 2, 2025. Mark Schiefelbein/Pool via REUTERS By Clare Jim and Scott Murdoch March 5 (Reuters) – U.S. President Donald Trump has hailed a deal led by U.S. firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8 billion ports business of Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison which includes assets along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the U.S. consortium control of key Panama Canal ports amid White House calls to remove them from what it claims is Chinese ownership. On the first trading day after the deal’s announcement, CK Hutchison stock soared nearly 25%. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the U.S. Congress. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” The deal with the BlackRock-led consortium includes 90% of Panama Ports Company, which has operated the Balboa and Cristobal ports at each end of the canal for over two decades, CK Hutchison said. In total, the consortium, which includes Terminal Investment and Global Infrastructure Partners, will control 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries, the conglomerate said. The conglomerate’s stock rose as much 24.7% on Wednesday, outpacing a 1.7% rise in Hong Kong’s broader Hang Seng Index .HSI. Its price is now the highest since August 1, 2023. The sale involves CK Hutchison’s 80% stake in Hutchison Ports with an equity value of $14.21 billion. However, the conglomerate will receive more than $19 billion following repayment of some shareholder loans. The size of the proceeds would be similar to CK Hutchison’s entire Hong Kong market value prior to Wednesday’s share rally. The remainder of Hutchison Ports is owned by Singapore’s PSA International. About 12,000 ships used the Panama Canal last year that connects 1,920 ports across 170 countries. Its position is strategic for the U.S. as more than three-quarters of vessels passing through originate in or are bound for the United States. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt in a statement. The conglomerate had been waiting for Panama Supreme Court to make a final ruling about the legal status of its contract to operate the ports after the local attorney general determined the contract “unconstitutional.” SURPRISE CK Hutchison, controlled by billionaire tycoon Li Ka-shing, has businesses in areas as varied as infrastructure, retail and telecom. It is also the world’s largest privately owned port operator. The sale of the ports unit does not include any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China, the conglomerate said in the statement. Sixt said the transaction was the result of “a rapid, discrete but competitive process” during which CK Hutchison received numerous bids and expressions of interest. JPMorgan in a report said while selling the Panama business is “understandable,” the deal is nevertheless a “surprise” given most of CK Hutchison’s other ports are not in regions directly exposed to Sino-U.S. geopolitical tension. It could be “an opportunistic deal,” JPMorgan said. “Based on our understanding of the management philosophy of CKH, any deal is possible as long as ‘the price is right’.” The brokerage said the deal would represent a significant strategy shift because ports would only account for 1% of the conglomerates earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, from 15%. The contribution of infrastructure, currently the largest segment, will rise to 33% from 28%. The $19 billion that CK Hutchison is set to receive from the sale is well above a $13 billion valuation on the ports assets estimated by analysts. “The disposal would be significantly value enhancing for CK Hutchison if it is completed on the preliminary essential terms,” Citigroup analysts said. CK Hutchison’s net debt level was HK$138 billion ($17.76 billion) in June and the sales proceeds could put the conglomerate into a net cash position, UBS analysts said.

The sale is "wholly unrelated to recent political news", a managing director said but was welcomed by President Donald Trump who said his administration "will be reclaiming" the Panama Canal. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Wednesday 5 March 2025 14:45, UK Two major Panama Canal ports have been sold from their Hong Kong owner to a consortium including American multinational investment company BlackRock. It comes after US President Donald Trump expressed a desire for America to "take back" the key shipping lane from alleged Chinese control. Hong Kong-based logistics giant CK Hutchison Holdings announced plans to sell a majority stake in the business that controls Balboa and Cristobal ports - which sit at each end of the shipping lane. The sale is of a 90% interest in Panama Ports Company, which is contracted to run the important ports until 2047. Money blog: Dollar sinks and market gains wiped out The Panamanian ports are being sold to a consortium including US financial behemoth BlackRock for nearly $23bn (£17.8bn). It comes after President Donald Trump applied pressure to end what he says is China's influence and control over the important shipping lane through which most goods pass. As part of wider comments, on taking control of other sovereign territories, Mr Trump threatened earlier this year to "take [the canal] back" having said, "China is running the Panama Canal". However, on Wednesday, CK Hutchinson Holdings insisted that the deal was "wholly unrelated to recent political news". Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player The deal was made a month after a visit to Panama City by US secretary of state Marco Rubio and was welcomed by Trump on Tuesday night. A happy Trump "My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," Mr Trump told Congress. "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals." The purchase is part of a wider deal for Hutchison Port's global business. In total, the consortium will control 43 ports in 23 countries, CK Hutchison Holdings said. The conglomerate pushed back against the idea the deal was impacted by politics. "I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports," CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt said.

A Hong Kong-based company has announced plans to sell a controlling stake in a business operating two major ports on the Panama Canal to a consortium of investors led by an American multinational. The deal comes amid mounting pressure from US President Donald Trump over alleged Chinese influence on the crucial waterway. Addressing a special joint session of the two chambers of the US Congress on Tuesday, the US president claimed he is making a successful diplomatic push to reclaim the Panama Canal, which he describes as a vital infrastructure project created by Americans for Americans. Asian logistics giant CK Hutchison Holdings will sell a 90% interest in Panama Ports Company to a consortium that includes US investment holding BlackRock, its subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners, and Geneva-based container terminals major Terminal Investment, according to a joint statement issued by CK Hutchison and BlackRock on Tuesday. Panama Ports Company holds the contract to run the ports of Balboa and Cristobal, located at the Pacific and Atlantic entrances of the canal respectively, until 2047. The deal also covers the sale of an 80% stake of CK Hutchison’s ports subsidiaries operating 43 ports across 23 countries, including in the UK, Germany, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, and South Korea. According to the statement, the agreement, valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt, does not have any interest in a trust that “operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China.” Shares of CK Hutchison, the market capitalization of which amounts to HK$148 billion ($19 billion) soared 22% in morning trading in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Trump has repeatedly threatened to take back control of the Panama Canal, citing “ridiculous fees” and concerns over China’s growing influence around the waterway, which was built by the US in the early 20th century and handed over to Panama in 1999. In February, Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino made a concession to Washington by refusing to renew the country’s 2017 agreements with China under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative.

Title: Reclaiming the Panama Canal, the end of wokism, flag on Mars: Highlights from Trump’s keynote speech to Congress

Time Published: 2025-03-05T08:51:42Z

US President Donald Trump reaffirmed key tenets of his ‘America First’ agenda during his speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening, and outlined the steps his administration has taken to make good on his campaign promises since he took office in January. The televised speech followed a largely anticipated trajectory and was largely directed at the president’s voter base. Although functionally analogous to a State of the Union address, it is not classified as such within American political tradition, as Trump delivered it in his inauguration year. As Trump entered the House chamber at the US Capitol, his supporters chanted “USA!” while detractors jeered, foreshadowing the turmoil that would unfold later. Heckling from Democratic Representative Al Green of Texas and others necessitated an interruption in Trump’s speech, prompting Speaker Mike Johnson to have the 77-year-old lawmaker escorted out. Throughout his address, the president criticized his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, accusing him of undermining the country’s interests through his policies. He also launched a personal attack against Senator Elizabeth Warren, referring to her as “Pocahontas,” a taunt referencing her disputed claims of Native American ancestry. Trump reiterated his commitment to ending the Ukraine conflict, asserting that Warren would prefer it to persist for another five years. He emphasized that hostilities between Kiev and Moscow have resulted in millions of unnecessary casualties, calling the violence “senseless.” The speech followed a recent quarrel in the White House that disrupted a US-Ukrainian minerals deal. A signing ceremony scheduled for last Friday was canceled after Vladimir Zelensky questioned Trump’s willingness to engage with Russia and reiterated Kiev’s demand for American security guarantees. The US president and Vice President J.D. Vance then chastised him for perceived ingratitude and inflexibility. In the Tuesday speech, however, Trump said that the minerals agreement was back on track, citing Zelensky’s recent commitment to peace and partnership with the US, and reiterated that fostering normal diplomatic relations with Russia serves American interests. Trump reaffirmed his foreign policy ambitions, particularly regarding Panama and Denmark. He declared that his administration is “reclaiming the Panama Canal” for the sake of US national security, seemingly referencing recent reports that US investment firm BlackRock will be purchasing the port infrastructure from its current Chinese owner. ”The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others,” Trump asserted, noting that while other nations may use this strategic link between the Atlantic and Pacific, “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back.” He further expressed support for the right of the people of Greenland to determine their future, suggesting they could break away from Denmark and join the US. Trump said Washington needs the island and will secure it “one way or the other,” despite Copenhagen’s rejection of Trump's previous offer to purchase the land. The speech primarily focused on domestic issues, with Trump spotlighting his administration’s achievements in crucial areas like border security. During his campaign, he promised a robust crackdown on illegal immigration, implementing measures such as deportations and intensified law enforcement. Among the guests Trump invited to Capitol Hill were individuals intimately connected to the debate: family members of crime victims allegedly targeted by undocumented immigrants, a US Border Patrol agent who was injured near the Rio Grande in the line of duty, and a teenage boy battling brain cancer, whose dream to become a cop earned him honorary membership in a Florida police department. Trump claimed credit for turning the tide on “woke policies” – left-wing initiatives at the center of America’s cultural wars. He declared a nationwide end to “the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion policies,” stating that “our country will be woke no longer.” He called on Congress to criminalize “sex changes on children,” denouncing the notion that a child can be “trapped in the wrong body” as “a big lie.” While LGBTQ activists argue that the Trump administration's stance marginalizes individuals grappling with their identity, his supporters view his policies as a long-overdue measure to protect impressionable teens from life-ruining hormone treatments and genital mutilation. Additionally, Trump defended his decision to reinstate the ban on transgender individuals serving in the military, proclaiming that American soldiers “won’t be activists and ideologues – they will be fighters and warriors.” Trump praised Elon Musk for his efforts to curb government waste and corruption through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), claiming that billions in fraud have been uncovered under the billionaire’s leadership. He warned federal employees opposing his goal of dismantling the “rule by unelected bureaucrats” that they would face termination. Celebrating the American spirit of pioneers and civilization builders, Trump vowed that his second term would yield significant accomplishments. He said: “We are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars and even far beyond.” Musk strongly advocates for the colonization of Mars.

While not an official State of the Union address, Trump's speech laid out his vision for a second term and promised "the golden age of America has only just begun." By Robert Farley, D'Angelo Gore, Ben Cohen, Alan Jaffe, Jessica McDonald, Catalina Jaramillo, Saranac Hale Spencer and Lori Robertson Posted on March 5, 2025 Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino. In his first address to a joint session of Congress in his second term, President Donald Trump distorted the facts on fraud, immigration, aid to Ukraine, the economy, autism and more. While this address, coming early in a new term, technically isn’t a State of the Union address, Trump’s March 4 speech was longer than any prior SOTU, clocking in at an hour and 39 minutes, as measured by the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Trump claimed that the Department of Government Efficiency, led by White House adviser Elon Musk, has “found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.” However, the most recent update on DOGE’s website from March 2 reports that the department has only created an estimated $105 billion in savings thus far. Although Trump ticked off several examples of what he called “appalling waste” found by DOGE, it’s unclear if any of the savings touted by DOGE are related to actual fraud. We also cannot verify DOGE’s savings figure, as the department has not yet uploaded evidence of each transaction it has conducted. The website includes a “Wall of Receipts” described as “a subset of contract, grant, and lease cancellations, representing ~30% of total savings.” However, the “subset” of transactions listed on the website does not meet this 30% threshold. In total, DOGE’s “Wall of Receipts” lists about $19.8 billion in estimated savings, which is less than 19% of the $105 billion in total savings claimed by the department. Of this $19.8 billion in savings, $8.9 billion comes from the cancellation of contracts, $10.3 billion comes from the termination of grants, and $660 million comes from the termination of government leases. DOGE has faced scrutiny for inflating and miscalculating the savings figures posted on its website. The New York Times reported that DOGE deleted hundreds of transactions previously posted to its “Wall of Receipts” and also found that DOGE incorrectly claimed credit for canceling government contracts that had already been terminated before Trump entered office. Other errors by DOGE identified in media reports include a typo mislabeling $8 million in savings as $8 billion and triple-counting the cancellation of a single contract. Speaking about DOGE’s efforts on Feb. 11, Musk said, “We will make mistakes, but we’ll act quickly to correct any mistakes.” Trump went on to cite a Government Accountability Office report that estimated annual fraud losses to the government of between $233 billion and $521 billion. But we could not verify how much, if any, of the DOGE savings identified to date includes instances of fraud. Rather, most of the savings appears to be related to spending that it deemed wasteful. In a Feb. 16 post on X, White House adviser Elon Musk shared a screenshot of a spreadsheet denoting that the Social Security database categorizes nearly 21 million people over the age of 99 as alive. Trump read the data from Musk’s post during his speech and misleadingly claimed that “money is being paid to many of” the centenarians still listed as alive. As we’ve written, internal audits conducted by the Office of Audit in the Social Security Administration’s Office of the Inspector General have identified that millions of deceased individuals were still listed as living in the Social Security database. However, the number of dead recipients still being sent benefits is likely in the thousands, not the millions. In total, the SSA distributed payments to 89,106 individuals aged 99 and older in December 2024. A July 2023 report published by the Office of Audit found that there were 18.9 million people with Social Security numbers born in 1920 or earlier with no record of their deaths. The vast majority of these records are clearly outdated, as the Pew Research Center estimated that there were only 101,000 Americans who were 100 and older in 2024. However, very few of these dead individuals incorrectly labeled as alive still receive Social Security benefits. Among this group of 18.9 million, the report found that only 44,000, or 0.2%, were still receiving Social Security benefits. The report did not specify how many of these benefit payments were believed to be improper. A portion of the 44,000 recipients were likely living Americans over the age of 103 who continued to receive payments in July 2023. The Office of Audit provided a more specific estimate of improper payments to deceased individuals in a November 2021 report. That report concluded that the “SSA issued approximately $298 million in payments to about 24,000 deceased beneficiaries in suspended payment status.” The report also noted that while the SSA did recover some of the funds, $214 million of the improper payments remained unaccounted for. In a statement published on Feb. 19, Lee Dudek, the newly appointed acting commissioner of the SSA, explained that the data posted by Musk does not reveal millions of dead individuals who continue to receive benefits. “I also want to acknowledge recent reporting about the number of people older than age 100 who may be receiving benefits from Social Security,” he said. “The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits.” In September 2015, the SSA began a process that automatically designates individuals aged 115 and older as deceased and ends payments to them. Trump repeated a claim he’s made frequently in recent weeks – telling the joint session of Congress that “we’ve spent perhaps $350 billion” to support Ukraine’s fight against the Russian invasion since 2022, while Europe has spent $100 billion. Those figures are wrong. As we’ve written before, the total amount that Congress has appropriated since 2022 is $174.2 billion. According to a report from the special inspector general who is overseeing the U.S. support for Ukraine, the U.S. has made a total of $182.75 billion available for the broader response. Figures from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, a German research organization that tracks funding for Ukraine, show that the U.S. has so far allocated about $121 billion compared with about $140 billion from Europe. Additionally, the institute shows that Europe has committed another $122 billion that hasn’t yet been allocated, while the U.S. has committed another $5 billion. The institute’s figures include direct, bilateral aid. We didn’t get an immediate response from the White House to an email asking where Trump had gotten his numbers. Trump exaggerated the state of the economy when he took office earlier this year, and he misleadingly placed the blame for higher consumer prices solely on the Biden administration. “As you know, we inherited, from the last administration, an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare,” Trump said. “Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up the cost of groceries, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions of Americans. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country — they’re not sure.” As we wrote in January, before Trump began his second presidential term, he inherited a “resilient economy that has grown by at least 2.5% every year since he left office in early 2021,” as well as a “post-pandemic jobs boom that has driven the unemployment rate well below the historical norm.” We also noted that inflation “has come down significantly” from the annual inflation rate of 9.1% in June 2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said that was “the largest 12-month change since the period ending November 1981” — not in history, as Trump said. Most recently, the Consumer Price Index increased 3% for the 12-month period ending in January. It’s also wrong to suggest that Biden administration policies alone increased prices on energy, food and other consumer goods. As we’ve also written, economists primarily blame the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply chain disruptions that followed and rising labor costs, among other reasons, for the dramatic price increases while Biden was president. Shortly after introducing DJ Daniel, a 13-year-old who was diagnosed six years ago with brain cancer, Trump cited two autism prevalence figures that need context. “Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong,” the president said. “As an example, not long ago — and you can’t even believe these numbers — 1 in 10,000 children had autism. 1 in 10,000. And now it’s 1 in 36. There’s something wrong. 1 in 36 — think of it. “So we’re going to find out what it is and there’s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you,” he continued, referring to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., “to figure out what is going on.” Trump made nearly identical remarks about the autism rate on Feb. 13 when swearing in Kennedy as the new health secretary. Trump’s higher figure of 1 in 36 is correct. That’s the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest estimate, in 2020, of the number of U.S. children who have been identified with autism. The 1 in 10,000 number, however, is decades old — and isn’t directly comparable to today’s figure. As we’ve explained before, some studies in the 1960s and ’70s estimated autism affected about 1 to 5 in 10,000 kids. But these studies used a much more stringent definition of autism. Awareness and recognition of autism has also dramatically improved since then. Much of “what is going on,” then, is actually a broader clinical definition of autism capturing more mild cases, along with better awareness. There may be a slight true increase in the condition, researchers say, in part due to known risk factors, including parents having children at older ages and more babies surviving birth complications. Autism is largely a genetic disease. Kennedy and others around him have previously used the same or similar statistics to falsely suggest that vaccines may be behind the surge in autism diagnoses. Numerous studies have failed to find any link between autism and vaccines. Trump said the Biden administration had “closed more than 100 power plants.” That’s misleading. The number of electric power plants went up by 2,187 since the last full year of Trump’s first administration to 2023, according to the latest data from the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration. The number of power plants fueled by coal did decrease by 57 plants, from 284 in 2020 to 227 in 2023. Plants powered by petroleum and other fossil gas also declined by 23 plants. But the number of other types of electric power plants, including natural gas and renewable energy, went up. In April 2024, a rule finalized by the Biden administration to limit the pollution from existing coal power plants required those plants, and any new natural gas-fired power plants, to capture 90% of their carbon emissions by 2032, if they intend to operate after 2039. The rule was contested by some Republican states and industry groups, but in October the Supreme Court decided that the rule could go into effect while legal cases work their way through the courts. During his campaign, Trump promised to kill Biden’s power plant rules. Energy Secretary Chris Wright recently advocated for the need for coal-fired power plants, Bloomberg reported. In February, the EIA reported that electricity generators plan to retire about 8 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity this year. During his address to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said, “We are opening up many of those power plants right now.” Trump said he is focused on “building the most powerful military of the future,” and one of the first steps will be building a “Golden Dome missile defense shield to protect our homeland.” “Ronald Reagan wanted to do it long ago,” Trump said, “but the technology just wasn’t there, not even close. But now we have the technology. It’s incredible, actually. And other places, they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it, and the United States should have it too, right?” But the technology for the U.S. isn’t there yet. Trump said repeatedly during his campaign that during his presidency the U.S. would develop a missile defense system similar to Israel’s Iron Dome. Israel has used that air defense system since 2011 to shoot down short-range rockets fired from neighboring Gaza. Israel’s Iron Dome, along with its Arrow 3 system — an air defense system that can intercept ballistic missiles — and with help from the U.S. and others, shot down nearly 300 drones and missiles launched at Israel by Iran in April 2024. Israel’s system, developed by an Israeli company and the U.S. weapons manufacturer Raytheon, can detect and intercept “a variety of shorter-range targets such as rockets, artillery and mortars,” Raytheon’s website explains. The system can target threats launched from 2.5 to 43.5 miles away. But “against the normal threats to U.S. security, the Iron Dome is not a useful system,” Stephen Biddle, adjunct senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, told us when we wrote about this issue last year. “Iron Dome is designed to deal with short-range threats, especially unguided rockets,” not long-range ballistic missiles that could be launched by China, Russia or North Korea. “If the North Koreans launched intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S., an Iron Dome would not be able to intercept reentry vehicles,” explained Biddle, referring to the parts of intercontinental ballistic missiles carrying warheads back into Earth’s atmosphere before hitting a target. The defense technology company Lockheed Martin is apparently working on a “Golden Dome” system that Trump referred to in his remarks to Congress, and the Pentagon is seeking proposals from other defense contractors. The Lockheed Martin website says, “[W]e will bring in the best and brightest of American innovation to rapidly develop game-changing tech – like space-based interceptors and hypersonic defenses – that will ensure America’s Golden Dome stays well ahead of adversary threats.” But the Golden Dome technology is still being developed, and defense experts are skeptical that a missile defense system will be able to protect the entire U.S. Trump made several misleading and unsupported claims about immigration. Trump began by boasting that after declaring a national emergency on the southern border and cracking down on illegal immigration, by February, his first full month in office, apprehensions of those crossing the border illegally “were by far the lowest ever recorded.” Although U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not yet released its official February apprehensions data, the agency reported via X on March 1 that February “saw just 8,326 encounters at the Southwest border—the lowest documented by U.S. Border Patrol.” That eclipses the figure of 11,127 in April 2017, Trump’s third full month in office during his first term — and previously the lowest month going back to at least 2000. However, it’s not the lowest “ever recorded.” Government data going back to 1925 shows entire years in the 1920s and 1930s that were close to the February figure. Trump went on to say that under Biden, “there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month.” Illegal immigration did soar through most of the years Biden was in office, with apprehensions by Border Patrol averaging about 150,000 per month. Apprehensions reached a monthly high of 251,178 in December 2023. But the numbers dropped dramatically after Biden enacted emergency measures in June 2024 to restrict asylum eligibility for those illegal border-crossers. Between July and December, the last full month under Biden, apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally averaged about 55,000 per month. That’s lower than the average during the last few months of Trump’s first term. We should note that after tough talk on immigration in the 2016 campaign, the number of apprehensions plummeted in the first few months of Trump’s first term as well, what some referred to as “the Trump Effect.” After that dip in the months immediately after he took office, apprehensions of illegal border-crossers steadily increased over the next two years, reaching a peak of 132,856 in May 2019. The figures then began to steadily decline again, going to 16,182 in April 2020 at the height of the pandemic. Trump also made his oft-repeated but unsupported claim that “people from mental institutions and insane asylums were released into our country.” As we have written, immigration experts in the U.S. and in countries in South America where Trump has alleged that kind of activity have told us they have seen no evidence of that. And finally, Trump claimed that “over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States.” As we have written, that’s double the total number of people caught trying to enter the country illegally (7.3 million, which includes repeat attempts), those who came to legal ports of entry without authorization to enter (1.2 million), and the estimated number who evaded capture (2 million). Comprehensive Department of Homeland Security data on the initial processing of these encounters show that 2.9 million were removed by CBP and 3.2 million were released with notices to appear in immigration court or report to Immigration and Customs Enforcement or given other classifications, such as parole. While talking about his reasons for putting new 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, Trump claimed that both countries have “allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.” But comparing Canada to Mexico is misleading. No one knows exactly how much illicit fentanyl comes into the U.S. each year because comprehensive data is not available. U.S. Customs and Border Protection does publish drug seizure statistics, which are often used as a proxy for how much gets into the country undetected. The 43 pounds of fentanyl seized by authorities at the northern border in fiscal year 2024 is more than the 2 pounds seized in fiscal 2023 and the 14 pounds seized in fiscal 2022. But that is significantly less than the 21,148 pounds of fentanyl seized by officials at the southwest border with Mexico during the 2024 fiscal cycle. As we’ve written, for at least the last three full fiscal years, the amount of fentanyl captured coming into the U.S. from Canada has made up less than 1% of the fentanyl seized nationwide by the Border Patrol and the Office of Field Operations. Trump repeated a false claim about the oil and natural gas reserves in the U.S. “As you’ve heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on earth, and by far,” Trump said. “And now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It’s called drill, baby, drill.” As we’ve written before, Trump is wrong. The Brookings Institution has noted that while “estimating reserves is an inexact science and methodologies differ,” the U.S. generally ranks between ninth and 11th in the world in the size of its crude oil reserves, and it ranks fourth or fifth in recoverable natural gas reserves. And although Trump would like oil and gas companies to do more drilling, it’s worth noting that oil and gas production in the U.S. already reached new record levels in 2024. Trump wrongly repeated his claims that 38,000 American lives were lost during construction of the Panama Canal and that Panama had ceded control of the canal to China. The canal was “built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure, 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snake bites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work,” Trump said. As we have written, Trump grossly overstates the number of American lives lost building the canal. About 7,600 people died during the more than decade-long American phase of the construction of the Panama Canal, which started in 1904, according to Noel Maurer, an associate professor of international affairs and international business at George Washington University, and co-author of the book, “The Big Ditch: How America Took, Built, Ran, and Ultimately Gave Away the Panama Canal.” Most of those deaths weren’t Americans, Maurer told us via email. “Rather, about two-thirds of them were either West Indian (mostly from Barbados), and a smaller unknown share of Spanish laborers who were hired at the start of construction.” In total, fewer than 1,000 Americans died due to accident or infectious disease during the canal’s construction phase, he said. Trump also continued to falsely suggest that China has been operating the canal. The canal “was given away by the Carter administration for $1 but that agreement has been violated very severely,” Trump said. “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” It’s not accurate to say the canal was given to China. A Hong Kong-based company managed ports at either end of the canal, which has raised concerns among some in the U.S., including the head of U.S. Southern Command, who last year warned Congress the ports could be used by the Chinese military as “points of future multi-domain access.” But canal experts and Panamanian officials have said China had no involvement in operation of the canal. And in any case, as Trump noted in his speech, an American investment group led by BlackRock has agreed to purchase both ports owned by the Hong Kong company.

Q: Is it true that under the SAVE Act married women will not be able to register to vote if their married name doesn’t match their birth certificate? A: The proposed SAVE Act instructs states to establish a process for people whose legal name doesn’t match their birth certificate to provide additional documents. But voting rights advocates say that married women and others who have changed their names may face difficulty when registering because of the ambiguity in the bill over what documents may be accepted.

Title: SGOV, STIP, TIP iShares ETFs: Claim Your State Income Tax Exemption (2024/2025)

My Money Blog As a follow-up to my posts for Vanguard and Fidelity money market funds, iShares ETFs (Blackrock) has also recently released their US GOI percentages for 2024 tax year. US Government Obligation Interest (US GOI) like Treasury bills and bonds are generally exempt from state and local income taxes. However, in order to claim this exemption, you’ll likely have to manually enter it on your tax return after digging up a few extra details. The tax document has a pretty good summary of the situation for all brokers: The Form 1099-DIV (or substitute form) you received from your financial advisor or brokerage firm may include income derived from U.S. Government and agency obligations. This income may be excluded from state income tax (although in many states, only the income from Treasury obligations is exempt from personal state income tax). The information below is provided to assist with the completion of shareholder state income tax returns. The amount in Box 1a of 2024 IRS Form 1099-DIV should be multiplied by the applicable percentages below to obtain the dollar amount of income derived from the sources categorized below. Because the qualifications for exclusion vary by state (some states have investment threshold requirements), please consult your tax advisor for details. It’s notable that even things like the iShares iBonds 20XX Term TIPS ETFs are not 100% US government obligations, so it’s important to reference this document and not assume. For iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) and iShares 0-5 Year TIPS Bond ETF (STIP) the USGOI percentage for 2024 was indeed at 100.00%. For iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV), the USGOI percentage for 2024 was 97.53%. This is pretty good and why SGOV is my default cash position at most brokers. The tax document also confirms that at least 50% of the assets of the fund were invested in Federal Obligations at the end of each quarter of the fiscal year. That means that SGOV met the minimum criteria for the dividend income to be exempt in the states of California, Connecticut, and New York.

Title: Li Ka-shing Escapes Trump’s Glare With $19 Billion Port Deal

After a lifetime of dealmaking, 96-year-old Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing may have just pulled off one of his boldest transactions yet. Under pressure from the Trump administration over two ports at the Panama canal controlled by CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd., Li’s company announced a plan to sell off the bulk of global ports business to a consortium led by BlackRock Inc. In return, the Hong Kong firm will receive cash proceeds of more than $19 billion. Investors, and even some of CK Hutchison’s closest advisers, were surprised that what began with two Panamanian ports has now evolved into a much larger deal. Under the agreement, the company will sell 43 ports in 23 countries, while keeping facilities in mainland China and Hong Kong. The group sees the sale as an opportunity to cash out at a time when global geopolitical tensions and trade barriers have weakened the outlook for the ports business, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity involved in the deal. Investors welcomed the news, with analysts saying CK Hutchison got a good price. The company’s shares surged as much as 25%, adding almost $5 billion to its market value. Before the announcement of the deal, the stock had fallen 6.9% since the beginning of the year. The sale “is a perfect example of turning geopolitical risks into opportunities,” said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis SA. “The firm has taken the chance to bundle and sell its port business at a premium, including the Panama Canal.” CK Hutchison didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In an earlier statement, a spokesman for the group declined to comment beyond the public announcement, which says the transaction “is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.” Before the deal was made public, CK Hutchison’s market capitalization was equivalent to the size of the sale at about $19 billion. That reveals “how grossly undervalued the group had been,” said Vincent Lam, chief investment officer at Hong Kong-based VL Asset Management. “CK Hutchison is sandwiched between China and the US and is unable to please anyone,” Lam said. “Some investors may consider that this deal could help reduce political risks and release value for the group.” Li, who began diversifying his business empire outside of China since the late 1980s when the country was enshrouded in political uncertainty, has over the next decades grown CK Hutchison into a conglomerate spanning retail, telecommunications, infrastructure and ports. It now counts half of its revenue from Europe and only 12% from mainland China and Hong Kong. Its global profile has helped the company steer through months of political unrest in Hong Kong in 2019, as well as China’s recent economic slowdown. The ports sale highlighted how Li’s son Victor, who now led the group, has to find ways forward for the business as his father once did, at a time when the group is facing increasing geopolitical risks escalated by tensions between the US and China. The sale gives the company considerable firepower to pursue acquisitions in safer areas. Deals have been one of the main drivers for CK Hutchison’s growth over the past decades. After a relatively quiet period during the 2019 protests in Hong Kong and the following three years of Covid closure, the group has accelerated global expansion efforts again. It’s been looking to expand overseas in recent months, most notably in the UK. CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. made a preliminary £7 billion bid last month to take a majority stake in Thames Water, the Financial Times reported. CK Hutchison is also considering a bid for UK waste management firm Viridor Ltd., which could value the business at as much as £7 billion including debt, Bloomberg News reported this month. Now led by Li’s son Victor, the company may hand back some of the port sale proceeds to shareholders in the form of a special dividend. “We believe the company could distribute most of this windfall to shareholders,” said Dan Baker, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. The sale “greatly exceeds our expectations.” The previous valuation for CK Hutchison’s ports business was only $10.5 billion, according to his estimates. The deal lifted the wealth of Li, who’s now a senior advisor to the business he founded. His fortune rose $1.3 billion to $30.6 billion in the wake of the deal’s announcement, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His stakes at CK Hutchison and CK Asset Holdings Ltd. represent just over 40% of his wealth, according to the data. While ports have for decades been one of CK Hutchison’s core businesses, bringing in recurrent, stable income, its contribution to the group’s profit has fallen behind other sectors. In the first half of 2024, ports accounted for 9% of the group’s revenue and 15% of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation. Li’s CK Hutchison had also been facing pressure from the EU as well as the US over its ports business, according to David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors who publishes on Smartkarma. “This is a great deal, both from a monetary standpoint and from a geopolitical one,” said Blennerhasset. “Li Ka-shing is a canny business person.” ©2025 Bloomberg L.P.

Title: Trump hails ‘reclaiming’ of Panama Canal after ports deal

US President Donald Trump has hailed a deal led by the US investment firm BlackRock to buy most of the $22.8-billion ports business of the Hong Kong conglomerate CK Hutchison which includes assets along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the US consortium control of key Panama Canal ports amid White House calls to remove them from what it claims is Chinese ownership. On the first trading day after the deal’s announcement, CK Hutchison shares soared nearly 25%. “My administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we’ve already started doing it,” Trump told the US Congress on Tuesday night. “Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals.” The deal with the BlackRock-led consortium includes 90% of Panama Ports Company, which has operated the Balboa and Cristobal ports at each end of the canal for over two decades, said CK Hutchison, controlled by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing. In total, the consortium, which includes Terminal Investment and Global Infrastructure Partners, will control 43 ports comprising 199 berths in 23 countries, the conglomerate said. The sale involves CK Hutchison’s 80% stake in Hutchison Ports with an equity value of $14.2 billion. However, the conglomerate will receive more than $19 billion following repayment of some shareholder loans. The size of the proceeds would be similar to the entire Hong Kong market value of CK Hutchison shares prior to Wednesday’s share rally. The remainder of Hutchison Ports is owned by Singapore’s PSA International. About 12,000 ships used the Panama Canal last year, which connects 1,920 ports across 170 countries. Its position is strategic for the US as more than three-quarters of vessels passing through the canal originate in or are bound for the United States. “I would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,” CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt said in a statement. The conglomerate had been waiting for the Panama Supreme Court to make a final ruling about the legal status of its contract to operate the ports after the local attorney-general determined the contract “unconstitutional”. CK Hutchison has businesses in areas as varied as infrastructure, retail and telecoms. It is also the world’s largest privately owned port operator. The sale of the ports unit does not include any interest in Hutchison Port Holdings HPH Trust, which operates ports in Hong Kong, Shenzhen and South China, or any other ports in China, the conglomerate said in the statement. Sixt said the transaction was the result of “a rapid, discreet but competitive process” during which CK Hutchison received numerous bids and expressions of interest. JPMorgan in a report said that while selling the Panama business is “understandable”, the deal is nevertheless a “surprise” given most of CK Hutchison’s other ports are not in regions directly exposed to Sino-US geopolitical tension. It could be “an opportunistic deal”, JPMorgan said. “Based on our understanding of the management philosophy of CKH, any deal is possible as long as ‘the price is right’.” The brokerage said the deal would represent a significant strategy shift because ports would only account for 1% of the conglomerate’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, down from 15%. The contribution of infrastructure, currently the largest segment, will rise to 33% from 28%. The $19 billion that CK Hutchison is set to receive from the sale is well above a $13-billion valuation on the ports assets estimated by analysts. “The disposal would be significantly value enhancing for CK Hutchison if it is completed on the preliminary essential terms,” Citigroup analysts said. CK Hutchison’s net debt level was HK$138 billion (US$17.7 billion) in June and the sales proceeds could put the conglomerate into a net cash position, UBS analysts said.

Title: Trump says US 'taking back' Panama Canal after ports deal

President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States had started to take back the Panama Canal after a deal by a Hong Kong firm to sell ports to a U.S.-led consortium. "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it," he said in a speech to Congress. "We're taking it back." Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has agreed to sell control of two ports near the Panama Canal to US-based investment company BlackRock, according to an announcement on Tuesday. Trump has repeatedly threatened the use of force to seize the canal, claiming that Hutchison's ownership of two ports, one at either entrance to the canal, gave China control over the strategic waterway that links the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The sale includes transferring 90 percent interests of the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama from CK Hutchison to a consortium that includes BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners, and Terminal Investment. The transaction also includes the consortium receiving units that hold 80 percent of the Hutchison Ports group, which operates 43 ports in 23 countries. The sale will generate cash proceeds of $19 billion for CK Hutchison, said Frank Sixt, the holding’s co-managing director. Sixt said the “transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports” on the Panama ports. But analysts said it came as a relief nonetheless for President Jose Raul Mulino, who had been under fierce pressure to reduce China's footprint in the country without riling the second-largest user of the canal after the United States. Hamas said on Thursday that Donald Trump's threats would encourage Israel to disregard the fragile ceasefire, after the U.S. president said that unless hostages are freed, the people of Gaza would be "DEAD.” Türkiye's leading drone producer Baykar Technologies and Italy's defense giant Leonardo signed a partnership agreement Thursday in unmanned technologies. Fenerbahçe football club head coach José Mourinho has ignited a heated debate following his comments after a Galatasaray-Fenerbahçe derby match on Feb. 24 in which he stated that “everyone on the opposing bench was jumping like monkeys.”

BlackRock acquires majority stakes in two Panama Canal ports in a $23 billion deal, reducing Chinese-linked influence over the critical trade route. The deal transfers control from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison to a U.S.-led consortium, aligning with Trumpâs efforts to counter Chinaâs global infrastructure influence. BlackRock gains control of Panamaâs Balboa and Cristobal ports, plus 43 other ports globally, through its subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners.

The acquisition marks a geopolitical shift, reinforcing U.S. dominance over the Panama Canal and safeguarding global trade routes. In a landmark $23 billion deal, BlackRock, the worldâs largest asset manager, has acquired majority stakes in two strategic ports at the Panama Canal, effectively pushing out Chinese-linked influence over one of the worldâs most vital trade routes. The transaction, which was announced on Tuesday, transfers control of the ports from Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings to a U.S.-led consortium spearheaded by BlackRock. This move aligns with President Trumpâs longstanding warnings about Chinaâs growing influence over global infrastructure and marks a significant shift in geopolitical control over the canal, which handles more than 70% of U.S.-bound shipping. The deal grants BlackRock control of Panamaâs Balboa and Cristobal ports, which are located at the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal, respectively, as well as 43 other ports across 23 countries. The acquisition, executed through BlackRockâs subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) in partnership with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), underscores the firmâs growing role in global infrastructure investments. A strategic win for U.S. interests The Panama Canal has long been a linchpin of global trade, with its operations critical to U.S. economic and military strategy. For years, U.S. officials have raised alarms about Chinaâs expanding presence in the region, warning that Beijing could exploit its control over ports for intelligence gathering, military positioning, or even disrupting shipping to harm the U.S. economy. âChina is getting kicked out of Panama, and America is winning. Thank you, President Trump. MAGA!â wrote the House Foreign Affairs Committee Majority in a post on X, celebrating the deal. Trump, who has repeatedly emphasized the canalâs importance to U.S. national security, hailed the acquisition as a step toward âreclaimingâ the waterway. âThe United States has a vested interest in the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of the Panama Canal,â Trump said in a Truth Social post. âWe would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!â A purely commercial deal? Although CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt insisted the transaction was âpurely commercial in nature,â the geopolitical implications are undeniable. The deal removes Chinese-linked entities from controlling critical infrastructure near the canal, a move that aligns with the Trump administrationâs broader efforts to counter Beijingâs influence in the Western Hemisphere. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized the dealâs economic significance, stating, âThese world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital.â A turning point in geopolitics The acquisition represents a significant shift in the balance of power over global trade routes. By placing control of the Panama Canal ports in American hands, the deal mitigates the risks associated with Chinese influence, such as potential surveillance, military pre-positioning, or economic leverage in geopolitical disputes. As the Trump administration continues to push for greater U.S. control over the canal, this deal marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle for dominance over critical global infrastructure. With BlackRock at the helm, the U.S. has taken a decisive step toward safeguarding one of the worldâs most strategic trade corridors.

This move aligns with President Trumpâs longstanding warnings about Chinaâs growing influence over global infrastructure and marks a significant shift in geopolitical control over the canal, which handles more than 70% of U.S.-bound shipping. The deal grants BlackRock control of Panamaâs Balboa and Cristobal ports, which are located at the Pacific and Atlantic ends of the canal, respectively, as well as 43 other ports across 23 countries. The acquisition, executed through BlackRockâs subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP) in partnership with Terminal Investment Limited (TiL), underscores the firmâs growing role in global infrastructure investments. A strategic win for U.S. interests The Panama Canal has long been a linchpin of global trade, with its operations critical to U.S. economic and military strategy. For years, U.S. officials have raised alarms about Chinaâs expanding presence in the region, warning that Beijing could exploit its control over ports for intelligence gathering, military positioning, or even disrupting shipping to harm the U.S. economy. âChina is getting kicked out of Panama, and America is winning. Thank you, President Trump. MAGA!â wrote the House Foreign Affairs Committee Majority in a post on X, celebrating the deal. Trump, who has repeatedly emphasized the canalâs importance to U.S. national security, hailed the acquisition as a step toward âreclaimingâ the waterway. âThe United States has a vested interest in the secure, efficient, and reliable operation of the Panama Canal,â Trump said in a Truth Social post. âWe would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!â A purely commercial deal? Although CK Hutchison co-managing director Frank Sixt insisted the transaction was âpurely commercial in nature,â the geopolitical implications are undeniable. The deal removes Chinese-linked entities from controlling critical infrastructure near the canal, a move that aligns with the Trump administrationâs broader efforts to counter Beijingâs influence in the Western Hemisphere. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink emphasized the dealâs economic significance, stating, âThese world-class ports facilitate global growth. Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital.â A turning point in geopolitics The acquisition represents a significant shift in the balance of power over global trade routes. By placing control of the Panama Canal ports in American hands, the deal mitigates the risks associated with Chinese influence, such as potential surveillance, military pre-positioning, or economic leverage in geopolitical disputes. As the Trump administration continues to push for greater U.S. control over the canal, this deal marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing struggle for dominance over critical global infrastructure.
