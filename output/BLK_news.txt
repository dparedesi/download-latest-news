The filing, dated November 21, 2025, seeks to raise the limit from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. It would place IBIT options in the same tier as major equities and ETFs such as Apple, NVIDIA, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF. “The proposed rule change seeks to dramatically increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 to 1,000,000 contracts,” the filing reads, adding the current cap is “restrictive and hampers legitimate trading and hedging strategies.” A higher limit would allow institutional traders and market makers to establish larger positions, thereby increasing market depth and liquidity for the product. "This will allow institutions to build more interesting structured products for IBIT, increasing the total possible amount of capital that can be allocated to the Bitcoin ETFs," Lai Yuen, investment analyst at Fisher8 Capital, told Decrypt. "This should be good for long-term IBIT flows." “This is already the second time Nasdaq has requested an increase in IBIT’s options position limits,” Tim Sun, Senior Researcher at HashKey Group, told Decrypt. The move showcases that institutional demand for Bitcoin derivatives continues to expand as larger players seek to increase their Bitcoin allocations, Sun added. The filing requests an exemption to eliminate limits entirely for customized 'FLEX' options that are physically delivered. This move would “align IBIT with other major commodity-based ETFs and help pull trading activity away from opaque over-the-counter markets,” per the filing. It also cites IBIT's market capitalization of $86.2 billion and an average daily volume of 44.6 million shares as of September 22, 2025, as key factors supporting the proposed change. The ISE proposal is subject to SEC approval, with a public comment period open until December 17, 2025. “IBIT is now the biggest bitcoin options market in the world by open interest,” Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, wrote in a Wednesday tweet. “At last, IBIT options is finally getting the treatment it deserves. Institutional vol is finally here,” Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest Advisors tweeted on Wednesday. The scale of this change is “more modest than most headlines suggest,” Derek Lim, head of research at crypto market-making firm Caladan, told Decrypt. With BlackRock holding over $71 billion in Bitcoin, the increased options limit would allow roughly $5.3 billion, representing about 8% of that total value, which is a standard, conservative practice for large ETFs," Lim added. While the changes have yet to take effect, the adjustment signals that Bitcoin trading is shifting from purely speculative to allocation-driven behavior, the HashKey analyst noted. Despite no immediate impact on Bitcoin’s short-term price, Sun explained it would allow institutions to build Bitcoin positions in a “lower-risk and more controlled manner.” From a volatility standpoint, Lim noted that realized volatility is likely to compress 50 to 100 basis points over the next six to 18 months, which “can translate to marginally higher prices through lower risk premia.” Bitcoin’s rally from $70,000 to $110,000 earlier this year occurred amid declining volatility. That negative correlation marks a fundamental shift, Lim noted, suggesting that if the Nasdaq’s proposed changes come into effect, Bitcoin will increasingly trade like a macro asset and would accelerate this transition. In a related development, BlackRock continues to accumulate Bitcoin exposure in its in-house funds. A separate Wednesday filing revealed its Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio increased its IBIT holdings by 14% in Q3 to $155.8 million. Bitcoin hit $91,500 on Wednesday and is up 5% over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

Title: Nasdaq seeks to ‘super-size’ option limits for BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/nasdaq-ibit-bitcoin-etf-options-1-million
Time Published: 2025-11-27T03:20:26Z
Full Content:
The push from the Nasdaq to increase option limits for the BlackRock Bitcoin fund shows Bitcoin markets are “breaking out of their training wheels.” The Nasdaq International Securities Exchange has filed a proposal with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to increase the position limits for options on BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) exchange-traded fund to 1 million. Position limits exist to prevent any one investor from controlling too many option contracts on the same stock, thereby reducing the risk of manipulative schemes that could affect prices, according to the notice and copy of the filing from the SEC on Wednesday. The Nasdaq has requested in its Nov. 13 filing to increase the BlackRock ETF limit from 250,000 contracts to 1 million, as the exchange has seen an ongoing increase in demand for IBIT. A lower limit would impede trading activity and the strategies of investors, such as the use of effective hedging vehicles or an income-generating strategy. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Vincent Liu, the chief investment officer at quantitative trading firm Kronos Research, said the SEC is likely to approve the proposal because “these adjustments are routine once an asset proves it can handle real volume. If approved, expect thicker order books, tighter spreads, and a more efficient options market.” Nasdaq previously filed to raise the limit from 25,000 to 250,000 in January because IBIT was well above the trading volume minimum of 100 million shares. Liu said this current push from the Nasdaq to “super-size IBIT option limits shows Bitcoin markets breaking out of their training wheels.” Related: S&P downgrades USDT’s dollar peg rating to lowest score “Bigger bands mean bigger players can finally hedge, size up, and sharpen price discovery. A clear sign that crypto derivatives are shifting from niche to necessary,” he said. Meanwhile, Adam Livingston, a Bitcoin (BTC) analyst and author, said in a series of X posts on Wednesday that the move by Nasdaq places BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF into the same category as the “largest, most liquid equities on Earth,” such as tech giants Apple and Microsoft. “They did it because the market has already decided Bitcoin is a mega-cap asset, whether Washington likes it or not. This is the moment every banker secretly feared,” he said.

Title: XRP Steps Into Its ETF Moment — Analyst Is Betting On A Rally Bigger Than Bitcoin’s

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures and evolves, a new narrative is gaining traction that positions XRP for an upcoming institutional-driven surge that could redefine market expectations. With momentum building around XRP exchange-traded funds, one prominent analyst now believes the asset could be on the verge of a rally so large it may outperform Bitcoin’s own ETF-driven surge. XRP is entering its ETF chapter, and the scale of what’s coming could make Bitcoin look small. Crypto analyst Xfinancebull mentioned on X that early players like Grayscale, Bitwise, Franklin, and Canary Funds are already live with their XRP products. Meanwhile, the real power players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and the other giants haven’t even filed for an XRP spot ETF yet, which shows this is just a warm-up. The heavyweights haven’t even stepped into the arena, and the initial institutional capital is already flowing. Spot ETFs were highly beneficial for BTC, which triggered a trillion-dollar shockwave that attracted Wall Street institutions and momentum traders who couldn’t ignore the access. According to Xfinancebull, XRP is a different beast, with functional utility, real-world adoption, and banking infrastructure already built out across Japan and Asia. The capital that will soon flood into XRP via ETFs won’t just speculate, but it will stay. When a fraction of over $80 billion in Assets Under Management (AUM) from these initial titans begins to rotate into XRP, the inflows could be significant. This is cold, hard math that is about to unlock high levels of liquidity and historically repeat the move on a larger scale. “The XRP spot ETF ignition is not coming, but it is already here. If you missed the Bitcoin momentum move, don’t miss this one,” Xfinancebull noted. An analyst known as RipBullWinkle has also highlighted that Bitcoin has leaked $151 million, while XRP led all inflows with $164 million. That’s not random, it’s institutions reallocating with intention into assets built for settlement and speed. When powerhouses like Franklin Templeton and Grayscale pull over $130 million into XRP on day one, it confirms where the institutional smart money is going. Bitcoin and altcoins are reacting sharply to momentary declines after the brief pullback. TerraHaberTr has stated that BTC has reclaimed the $87,000 level, and if momentum continues at this pace, BTC will target $90,000 and $100,000 levels. On the altcoin side, the recovery is happening even faster, and altcoins that have experienced deep dips may start to gain strength. Meanwhile, XRP is gaining traction as it pushes back above $2.20. If the move continues, XRP could reach the $3.00 region. Overall, opportunities have continued to emerge across major altcoins.

My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Title: Ethereum ETFs pull $175mln in two days, yet ETH stays weak — What’s wrong?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereum-etfs-pull-175mln-in-two-days-yet-eth-stays-weak-whats-wrong/

Is the market sleepwalking into a major surprise? On 24 November, ETH ETFs saw $96.6 million in inflows, with BlackRock contributing $92.6 million. On 25 November, ETH ETFs added another $78.6 million. RSI and MACD point to a short-term bearish trend, but these signals may be temporary noise rather than long-term weakness. At a time when the market is buzzing with new altcoin ETF launches, Ethereum’s quiet yet powerful momentum is being overlooked. The world’s largest altcoin ETF – the Ethereum Spot ETF – has been steadily gaining strength ever since it debuted in the same year as the historic Bitcoin [BTC] ETF rollout. And the latest numbers show that investor confidence in Ethereum [ETH] is far from fading. On the 24th of November, Ethereum Spot ETFs logged a strong $96.6 million in net inflows, with BlackRock alone accounting for $92.6 million, marking its first inflow in two weeks. Well, the momentum didn’t stop there. A day later, ETH ETFs attracted another $78.6 million, led by Fidelity’s FETH with $47.5 million, followed by BlackRock’s ETHA at $46.2 million, and Grayscale’s ETH adding $8.3 million. While most other issuers recorded zero activity, Grayscale’s ETHE continued to face pressure, witnessing $23.3 million in outflows, according to Farside Investors. However, despite the strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs, the asset itself continues to battle a difficult price environment. At the time the latest ETF inflows were recorded, Ethereum was trading around $2,913.41, still unable to reclaim the $3,000 mark after falling more than 30% in a month, according to CoinMarketCap. This weakness stood in sharp contrast to the asset’s price action when ETH ETFs first went live on the 23rd of July 2024, when Ethereum closed at $3,418.61. But the current struggle isn’t about Ethereum alone. The broader crypto market has been under pressure due to a mix of macro events, including a U.S. government shutdown, shifting expectations around Fed rate cuts, and overall risk-off sentiment. Technical indicators also reflect this short-term turbulence. In fact, the RSI and MACD point toward a bearish phase, though these signals could be temporary noise rather than signs of a deeper structural shift. Source: Trading View Interestingly, this period of weakness has actually pulled major Ethereum whales back into the market. After ETH rebounded nearly 9% from its recent low of $2,623, whales became noticeably active again, breaking a month-long downtrend. On-chain data showed dormant wallets suddenly moving large amounts of ETH. Now, while Ethereum battles its own volatility, the broader ETF race is heating up. In a fresh development, VanEck has filed for a Spot Binance [BNB] ETF. According to recent SEC filings, the VanEck BNB ETF (VBNB) will list on Nasdaq and hold BNB directly, tracking the MarketVector BNB Index. The fund will not enable staking at launch, though VanEck noted that any future staking features would be handled through third-party providers with prior notice. This announcement landed just as BNB traded at $857.52, posting a mild 0.57% gain in 24 hours but still down more than 25% over the past month, a pattern driven by the same macro pressures affecting Ethereum and the rest of the crypto market.

Title: Ethereum Steadies Near $2,900 as Fed Rate-Cut Odds Fuel $3,400 Rebound Hopes

Ethereum (ETH) is holding firm around the $2,900 level as improving macro sentiment, renewed whale accumulation, and rising ETF inflows strengthen expectations for a short-term rebound toward $3,400. Related Reading: Capriole Founder Not Bearish On Bitcoin Despite Headwinds—Here’s Why With Federal Reserve rate-cut odds now above 80%, traders are positioning for a potential shift in risk appetite that could benefit major cryptocurrencies, especially ETH. Ethereum has traded between $2,700 and $3,300 in recent weeks, but fresh catalysts are helping the asset stabilize above $2,900. The biggest driver is macroeconomic. CME FedWatch data shows the probability of a December interest-rate cut has surged from 30% to more than 80%. Lower interest rates typically encourage investment in risk-on assets such as crypto. Institutional flows reflect that shift. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $96.67 million in inflows on November 24, with BlackRock alone contributing $92.6 million, its first inflow in two weeks Treasury giant BitMine continues to accumulate aggressively, adding 69,822 ETH (over $200 million) last week and bringing its total holdings to 3.63 million ETH, around 3% of the circulating supply. At the same time, whale wallets holding 10,000–100,000 ETH amassed 440,000 ETH in one week, signaling renewed confidence despite broader market caution. Despite trading under the 20-day SMA at $3,132, Ethereum is showing early signs of bullish momentum. The MACD histogram has crossed into positive territory, and the RSI is sitting near the neutral 50 line, with room to move higher before hitting overbought levels. Other indicators strengthen the bullish case: The first major test remains $3,132. A clean breakout and two consecutive daily closes above this level would likely trigger algorithmic buying and push ETH toward the $3,400 target within 5–7 days. Beyond that, resistance at $3,658 becomes the next upside objective. While bullish momentum is building, Ethereum still trades in a broad descending channel, and market structure remains fragile. Failure to reclaim $3,132 soon could send ETH back toward $2,750, with deeper support at $2,623 and the cycle low of $2,659. Related Reading: The Bull And Bear Scenario For XRP That Could Play Out In November Broader crypto weakness, negative spot flows, or delays in network upgrades could delay a breakout. However, with rising institutional demand, whale accumulation, and rate-cut optimism, Ethereum’s probability of retesting $3,400 is steadily improving. Confidence Level medium is at Medium (65%), as ETH’s path to $3,400 remains viable but requires confirmation through key resistance levels.

Title: Nasdaq ISE proposes to raise BlackRock IBIT options trading limits from 250,000 to 1 million

Time Published: 2025-11-27T00:52:57Z

Share this article Nasdaq ISE, LLC (ISE) has proposed rule amendments to increase the position and exercise limits for options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) from 250,000 contracts to 1,000,000 contracts. The fund, managed by BlackRock, provides investors with exposure to Bitcoin through traditional brokerage accounts. IBIT was approved for options trading on the ISE last September. The exchange states that IBIT’s current 250,000-contract cap has become restrictive, given the rapid growth in options demand for IBIT during 2025. Increasing the limits would support greater hedging efficiency, facilitate income-generating option strategies, and allow market makers to provide deeper liquidity. The increased limits reflect surging institutional demand for Bitcoin ETF options as Wall Street expands its crypto trading operations. Nasdaq operates as a major stock exchange and has been adapting its infrastructure to accommodate growing institutional interest in crypto derivatives. Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Brad Lander has recommended three of the city’s five pension funds rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandates. New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, the trustee and fiduciary for the city’s five pension funds, recommended that three of the funds drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora Asset Management because the asset managers have “inadequate decarbonization plans.” BlackRock, which manages $42.3 billion worth of index funds for the pension funds, as well as Fidelity and PanAgora, were found to have “failed to meet the systems’ climate expectations,” Lander said in a statement. Lander, who is leaving office on January 1 at the end of his term, said Wednesday he has updated the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan for the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, the Teachers’ Retirement System of the City of New York and the New York City Board of Education Retirement System. In the update, Lander recommended that the three pension funds rebid BlackRock’s U.S. public equities index mandates and terminate those of active managers Fidelity and PanAgora. The comptroller made the recommendation after an evaluation of the pension funds’ 49 public-market managers. While 46 of the systems’ public-market managers submitted decarbonization plans that meet the requirements of the Net Zero Implementation Plans, the three asset managers failed to meet the pension funds’ climate expectations. Never miss a story — sign up for CIO newsletters to stay up-to-date on the latest institutional investment industry news.  The trustees of NYCERS, TRS and BERS adopted net zero implementation plans in 2023, in which they committed their funds to reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2040, according to Lander. This includes committing the funds to interim targets and to disclosing emissions; engaging asset managers and portfolio companies to adopt net-zero policies; investing in climate change solutions; and divesting to lower risk, according to information Lander released. According to the comptroller’s office, the pension funds collectively have reduced financed greenhouse gas emissions by 37% since 2019, divested from fossil fuel reserve owners, and grew their climate-related investments to $11.9 billion, while registering a 10.5% return for fiscal 2025 that beat its actuarial target by 350 basis points. “The systemic risk of the climate crisis threatens the long-term value of New York City’s pension funds,” Lander said in a statement. “I am calling on my fellow trustees to move our money away from the three asset managers—BlackRock, Fidelity, and PanAgora—who fail to address climate risk with the seriousness we expect.” Lander said that after the administration of President Donald Trump changed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s requirements that public companies must disclose climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions, BlackRock ended engaging with U.S. companies on proxy voting issues in situations when the manager owns at least a 5% share. Because of the disengagement, Lander said BlackRock “does not sufficiently encourage portfolio companies to take concrete decarbonization actions.” Although BlackRock expanded access to its climate and decarbonization stewardship policy, it still fails to meet the pension funds’ expectations, according to Lander. The comptroller’s office also alleged that Fidelity has taken an “overly restrictive” interpretation of SEC guidance for companies in the U.S. and abroad to prevent influencing them about decarbonization, “even when such action is financially material.” Due to this, Lander is recommending that TRS terminate Fidelity’s world ex-U.S. small-cap mandate and reallocate its $384 million in assets away from firm. Additionally, Lander said investment firm PanAgora’s climate-related engagement only concerns disclosing emissions and “fails to encourage companies to take decarbonization actions,” such as setting emissions targets or adopting transition plans. As a result, Lander recommended that NYCERS and TRS drop PanAgora’s U.S. small-cap equity mandate. BlackRock, in a response to Lander posted on social media, stated that the firm had met earlier in November with the New York City Bureau of Asset Management, which houses the pension funds’ investment team, and updated BAM on the firm’s climate and decarbonization stewardship program. BlackRock’s response also accused the outgoing Lander of “politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” BlackRock also noted that any changes to the pension funds’ investment mandates would require review by the funds’ boards, the BAM investment team and other stakeholders. “Should they take up your recommendation, we look forward to demonstrating the breadth and depth of our capabilities and the tremendous value we deliver,” wrote BlackRock’s Armando Senra, managing director and head of its Americas institutional business. Responses from Fidelity and PanAgora were not immediately available.

Title: Tokenized money market funds surge to $9B, BIS warns of new risks

Onchain money market funds have grown nearly 10-fold since 2023, but the Bank for International Settlements warns their adoption brings new liquidity and contagion risks. Tokenized money market funds are emerging as one of the most important yield-bearing assets on public blockchains, offering money-market returns and securities-level protections that stablecoins can’t provide, according to a new report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). According to the bulletin, tokenized money market funds now hold nearly $9 billion in assets, up from about $770 million at the end of 2023. The BIS warned that as these tokenized Treasury portfolios become a key source of collateral in the crypto ecosystem, they also bring new operational and liquidity risks. Tokenized money market funds are blockchain-based representations of traditional money market portfolios, providing investors with onchain access to short-term, interest-bearing assets, such as US Treasurys. The BIS noted that while these tokens offer the flexibility of stablecoins, they depend on permissioned wallets, offchain market plumbing and a small set of large holders; factors that could accelerate stress if redemptions spike or onchain liquidity thins out. Although the tokens move on public blockchains, the underlying portfolios, pricing and settlement still occur in traditional markets. BIS says that gap creates a structural mismatch: token transfers settle instantly, while the assets behind them do not. During periods of heavy withdrawals, this gap may make it more challenging for funds to meet redemptions without contributing to further volatility. Interlinkages with stablecoins create additional risk, as some tokenized money market funds also enable rapid conversions into stablecoins or are used for leveraged trades. The BIS warns that these feedback loops could allow market stress to spread much faster than in traditional money market funds. The analysis was released just a day after the institution appointed International Monetary Fund chief and CBDC backer Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli as the next head of its Innovation Hub. Related: Tokenized money market funds emerge as Wall Street’s answer to stablecoins The world’s top asset managers have been accelerating the expansion of tokenized money market funds across multiple blockchain networks. Franklin Templeton announced on Nov. 12 the integration of its Benji tokenization platform with the Canton Network, bringing tokenized assets — including its onchain US government money market fund — into a blockchain ecosystem designed for financial institutions. Asset manager BlackRock also recently announced the expansion of its tokenized money market fund, the USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), to Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism and Polygon, broadening beyond Ethereum. RWA.xyz data shows that BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) currently dominates the onchain money market landscape, with more than $2.5 billion in tokenized assets. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI fund has over $844 million in tokenized US government securities, according to the data.

Title: Grayscale files with SEC to list Zcash ETF

The fund, which could be listed on NYSE Arca, would be the first ETF tied to a privacy coin, following several other listings from Grayscale and asset managers. Grayscale is aiming to convert its Zcash Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund in a move that could mark one of the first investment vehicles linked to a privacy coin. In a Wednesday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Grayscale submitted a Form S-3 registration statement, signaling its intention to convert its fund tied to Zcash (ZEC) into a spot ETF. The move followed Grayscale’s launch of other spot ETFs linked to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE), and XRP (XRP). The simplified form with the regulator could allow Grayscale to list the Zcash ETF on the NYSE Arca. According to data from Nansen, the price of ZEC increased by more than 50% in the past 30 days and by 1,050% in the past 12 months, reaching $519.62 at the time of publication. Since the SEC initially approved the listing and trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, several asset management companies, including Grayscale, Bitwise, BlackRock, and others, have expanded their offerings to include exposure to other cryptocurrencies. Grayscale debuted the first spot DOGE ETF this week, which saw $1.4 million in volume on Monday. Related: NYSE approves Grayscale DOGE and XRP ETFs, clearing launch for Monday Earlier this month, Leap Therapeutics said it would use a $50 million investment from Winklevoss Capital, the venture capital firm founded by Gemini creators Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, to acquire ZEC tokens as part of its cryptocurrency treasury strategy. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas later argued on social media that the privacy coin could essentially pull support away from Bitcoin, though many users were skeptical of his claims.

Title: XRP 100x Rally To $225: Why The Only Place To Go Is Up

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP may be positioned for a major rally that reshapes its broader market outlook. In a detailed analysis shared on X, crypto strategist Chad Steingraber outlines calculations showing how expanding ETF activity could set the stage for a 100-fold move, pushing XRP toward $225 per token. His commentary consolidates a series of demand-and-supply assessments that map the structural forces he believes define XRP’s potential rally, signaling a market phase increasingly driven by institutional participation. According to Steingraber, XRP’s path to $225 follows a series of milestones. He projects a fivefold rise to $11.25, tenfold to $22.50, twentyfold to $45, fortyfold to $90, sixtyfold to $135, and ultimately a 100-fold increase to $225. Each step reflects the interaction between supply absorption and price adjustment: as ETFs acquire more XRP, price rises, moderating the rate of accumulation and maintaining balance in the market. In Steingraber’s view, the only outcome is a sharp rise in XRP’s price. While XRP’s current market performance shows a 1.8% decline over 24 hours and an 8.4% decline over two weeks, Steingraber emphasizes that these short-term fluctuations are minor compared to structural forces. ETF-driven demand and institutional acquisition are poised to create a supply-demand imbalance that pushes XRP far beyond its current trading range. Overall, his analysis frames XRP’s potential 100x rally to $225 as a structural outcome of institutional participation, ETF inflows, and supply scarcity. Price increases are essential to slow the rate at which asset managers acquire the token, making the rally a logical response to market mechanics rather than a speculative prediction. Steingraber’s series of projections illustrates how XRP could be absorbed at a pace capable of significantly reducing its circulating supply within a short period. Under conservative estimates of $33.6 billion in annual inflows, he believes that most of the available XRP could be acquired within a year. More aggressive scenarios involving major asset managers such as BlackRock could see the entire circulating supply absorbed in less than six months. To illustrate the scale of demand, he breaks down current acquisition rates: seven major funds are taking in an average of $20 million per day each, totaling $140 million daily, $700 million weekly, and $2.8 billion monthly, amounting to $33.6 billion annually. At XRP’s current price of $2.20, these inflows would allow institutions to accumulate massive quantities of the token, creating rapid scarcity. This dynamic makes a substantial price increase unavoidable, as higher prices slow accumulation under fixed allocations and prevent ETFs from depleting the market too quickly. XRP’s rising price is therefore not just a market reaction but a structural requirement to maintain balance amid large-scale institutional buy-ins.

Title: Why Texas is buying Bitcoin from BlackRock before building a real reserve

Operational challenges prompt Texas's strategic use of an ETF as a temporary measure while building sovereign-grade custody. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Texas has taken the first formal step toward becoming the first US state to hold Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. On Nov. 25, Lee Bratcher, president of the Texas Blockchain Council, reported that the world’s eighth-largest economy, valued at $2.7 trillion, purchased $5 million worth of BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT. He added that a second $5 million allocation is already lined up for direct Bitcoin acquisition once the state finalizes a custody and liquidity framework required under a new reserve law. The two tranches create a bridge between today’s institutional rails and a future in which governments do not just buy Bitcoin but hold it. The initial exposure did not go directly on-chain. Instead, Texas entered via IBIT, which has become the default wrapper for large allocators seeking Bitcoin access within familiar regulatory and operational infrastructure. This purchase was enabled by Senate Bill 21, a law signed by Governor Greg Abbott in June that established the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The framework allows the state Comptroller to accumulate Bitcoin so long as the asset maintains a 24-month average market capitalization above $500 billion. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that meets the threshold. The structure places the reserve outside the state treasury, sets governance channels for how the assets are held, and introduces an advisory committee to monitor risk and oversight. Meanwhile, the first $5 million is small relative to the scale of state finances, but the mechanics matter more than the number. Texas is testing whether Bitcoin can be formalized as a public reserve instrument within a state-level financial system that already manages hundreds of billions of dollars across different pools. Once the operational processes are in place, the second tranche will involve self-custodied Bitcoin, which introduces very different implications for liquidity, transparency, and audit practices. The state is designing procedures that resemble sovereign-grade custody rather than institutional brokerage. The reserve will require a qualified custodian, cold-storage capacity, key management protocols, independent audits, and reporting schedules. These are the building blocks of a repeatable template that other states could adopt without reinventing the governance architecture. The decision to enter through IBIT was not a signal of preference for ETFs over native Bitcoin. It was an operational workaround. IBIT is only in its second year, yet it has emerged as the most widely held Bitcoin ETF among major institutions. The fund is the largest Bitcoin ETF product, with cumulative net inflows of more than $62 billion. Moreover, the apparatus for public-sector self-custody does not exist in most jurisdictions, and creating that infrastructure requires procurement, security modeling, and political signoff. So, the state used IBIT as a placeholder, a temporary facility that allows it to express exposure while finalizing the permanent structure. This detour is instructive because it mirrors the trajectory of other large allocators. Harvard University disclosed that IBIT became one of its largest US equity holdings in the third quarter. Abu Dhabi Investment Council tripled its IBIT exposure over the same period, reaching roughly eight million shares. Wisconsin’s pension system disclosed more than $160 million across spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, also routed through IBIT. The pattern is clear. Large institutions with different mandates, geographies, and risk frameworks are gravitating toward the same instrument. IBIT offers custody through a known intermediary, simplified reporting lines, and a clean accounting presentation under the new fair-value rules that took effect in 2025. These conveniences have turned the ETF into a de facto entry point for public and quasi-public entities. Texas is unique only in the fact that its IBIT exposure is meant to be temporary. The broader question is whether Texas becomes an anomaly or a blueprint. Bitcoin analyst Shanaka Anslem Perera said: “The cascade is mathematical. Four to eight states are positioned to follow within eighteen months, collectively commanding over $1.2 trillion in reserves. Institutional inflows projected between $300 million to $1.5 billion in near-term mimicry. This is not speculation. This is game theory in motion.” Already, politically aligned states like New Hampshire and Arizona also have Bitcoin reserve laws because they view the top crypto as a strategic hedge to the global financial system. More states could follow, as they could use their structural surpluses to allocate to Bitcoin for diversification, especially under the new accounting standards that neutralize earlier mark-to-market penalties. Moreover, the implications of state-level involvement extend beyond symbolism. ETF purchases do not alter the circulating supply because the trust structure issues and redeems shares without removing coins from liquid markets. Self-custody does the opposite. Once coins are purchased for cold storage, they leave the tradable float, reducing the supply available to exchanges and market makers. This distinction matters if Texas scales the reserve beyond its initial $10 million. Even modest state-level demand introduces a new type of buy-side participant, one that behaves countercyclically to noise traders and does not churn positions. The effect resembles a stabilizing anchor rather than a source of volatility. If other states adopt similar policies, the Bitcoin supply curve becomes more inelastic, increasing price sensitivity.

Title: Crypto Investors Watch Closely as Kevin Hassett Becomes Frontrunner to Replace Jerome Powell

Time Published: 2025-11-26T18:00:36Z
Full Content:
Kevin Hassett has surged ahead in the race to become the next Federal Reserve Chair, as the crypto market watches closely. Hasset emerged as President Donald Trump’s preferred candidate while the administration accelerates its search ahead of a planned Christmas announcement. With Jerome Powell’s term ending in May 2026, the stakes for markets, especially crypto, are enormous. Multiple reports from Bloomberg, Reuters, and other outlets confirm that Hassett, the current director of the White House National Economic Council, has become the clear frontrunner among five finalists vetted by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Others still in contention include Kevin Warsh, Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. But it is Hassett’s alignment with Trump’s preference for faster and deeper interest-rate cuts that has put him in pole position. In recent interviews, Hassett said he would cut rates “right now” based on current economic data, a sharp contrast to Powell’s more cautious approach. Prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket now show Hassett with roughly 55%–57% odds of being nominated, well ahead of his rivals. Hassett’s candidacy is drawing extraordinary attention from the digital asset world. Earlier this year, he disclosed holding more than $1 million in Coinbase stock, along with receiving over $50,000 for serving on Coinbase’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council. He also chaired the White House’s digital asset working group, crafting key crypto-policy recommendations, including stablecoin regulation, taxation guidelines and elements of the administration’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal. These ties have sparked questions about potential conflicts of interest, given the Fed’s oversight of banking exposure to crypto and stablecoin frameworks. Yet many industry analysts view his ascent as a major bullish catalyst. Bitwise strategist Juan Leon said a Hassett-led Fed would be “strongly supportive of digital assets,” citing his dovish monetary stance and direct industry experience. Trump’s dissatisfaction with Powell, combined with internal divisions over inflation, labor data and the pace of easing, has only intensified speculation. The Fed has already delivered two cuts this fall, with markets widely expecting a third in December. If nominated and confirmed, Hassett would usher in one of the most crypto-friendly and pro-growth Federal Reserve leaderships in modern history. With the announcement expected before Christmas, both Wall Street and the crypto markets are watching closely for what could be a defining moment for monetary policy and digital asset regulation.

Title: Bitcoin Hyper Boosts as Texas Is First US State to Buy Bitcoin
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/texas-bitcoin-etf-vs-bitcoin-hyper-layer-2/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T17:46:18Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Texas just became the first US state to buy bitcoin, doing it not through a cold wallet but via BlackRock’s spot $BTC ETF. For institutions and treasuries, that’s a historic green light: clean regulatory rails, audited custody, and Bitcoin exposure that fits neatly into a traditional portfolio. For you as a retail investor, though, ETFs cap the upside. You get price tracking, not yield, leverage, or early-stage asymmetry. That’s why early-stage Bitcoin infrastructure plays are suddenly back in focus. Instead of just holding ‘paper BTC’ via an ETF, some are rotating into projects trying to fix Bitcoin’s biggest pain points: slow confirmation times, rising on-chain fees, and a scripting model that makes complex DeFi almost impossible. That’s the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is aiming to fill. As more headlines frame Texas’s move as the start of state-level Bitcoin adoption and another win for institutional adoption, a parallel conversation is happening in crypto-native circles. If institutions are content with ETF exposure, can agile investors position one layer closer to the innovation stack, into Bitcoin Layer 2s like Bitcoin Hyper, where the risk is higher but so is the potential upside? Texas opting for a BlackRock ETF underscores a simple reality: institutions want Bitcoin exposure without on-chain friction. However, the Bitcoin base layer still processes around 7 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes and fees often spiking to several dollars when mempools become congested. That performance gap is exactly where Bitcoin Layer 2 projects are racing to compete. You’re already seeing multiple design paths emerge: pure payments, sidechains targeting EVM developers, and newer rollup-style architectures trying to anchor security on Bitcoin while offloading execution. In that mix, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM)-powered option, aimed at high-frequency, Solana-style workloads, but has settled back on Bitcoin. Where many Bitcoin L2 designs bolt on EVM, Bitcoin Hyper takes a different route: integrating the Solana Virtual Machine so developers can deploy high-throughput Rust smart contracts on a Bitcoin-secured stack. Under the hood, Bitcoin Hyper uses a modular approach: Bitcoin L1 acts as the settlement and security anchor, while a single trusted sequencer orders and executes transactions off-chain before periodically anchoring state to Bitcoin. That design enables sub-second finality, low-cost swaps, lending, gaming, and NFT trades in wrapped $BTC, while still inheriting Bitcoin’s base-layer trust assumptions. This is where investors start running the ETF-versus-early-stage math.

Title: Lefty NYC Comptroller Brad Lander tells top pension funds to cut ties with BlackRock over climate stance

Full Content:
New York City’s far-left outgoing Comptroller Brad Lander wants three of the city’s top pension funds to cut ties with BlackRock over allegations that the world’s largest money manager is not doing enough to fight climate change. The pol, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor this year, blasted the Larry Fink-led firm on Wednesday for allegedly buckling to pressure from the White House and Republicans and U-turning on green investments. “Climate risk is financial risk. You can see it all around you in an increased number of flash floods and wildfires,” Lander, whose term ends Dec. 31, told Bloomberg. The left-winger — who recently admitted he’s mulling a congressional run — accused BlackRock of scaling back “climate engagement in ways that put our investments at risk needlessly.” Lander urged the New York City Employees’ Retirement System, Teachers’ Retirement System and Board of Education Retirement System to shift their investments to rivals with a “more robust approach” to combating global warming. BlackRock Managing Director Armando Senra slammed the comptroller’s remarks as “another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers,” according to a letter posted on the firm’s website. The Post has sought comment from BlackRock. Lander also wants some of the funds to cut ties with Fidelity Investments and PanAgora Asset Management, claiming that they, too, are not doing enough to help the environment. Neither has publicly commented. Lander cannot actually force the pension funds to take his suggestions — trustees of each one make the final decision. Socialist Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and his appointees will get some say over the Big Apple’s $300 billion pension system, Bloomberg noted. After losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, Lander became a strong backer of the capitalism-hating mayor-elect, who takes office Jan. 1.

Its assets under management worldwide hit a company record $13.46 trillion on Sept. 30, boosted by a rally in global markets and dealmaking income. The money manager, like many other Wall Street firms during the Biden administration, was a lightning rod for GOP lawmakers over its stance on DEI programs and Environmental Social Governance investing, known by its acronym ESG. The Securities and Exchange Commission, under President Trump-picked chair Paul Atkins, backed off on enforcing Biden-era ESG disclosure rules as part of a White House-led crackdown on ‘woke’ capitalism At the start of the year, just before Trump took office for a second time, BlackRock withdrew from a United Nations-backed Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative that aimed to pressure major corporations to reduce their carbon footprint. Then in June, the company was removed from Texas’ investment “blacklist” after it scaled back its climate commitments. Lander will be succeeded by current Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine, who also endorsed Mamdani. Levine’s role will be to act as an independent spending watchdog and ensure New Yorkers get the most bang for their buck while Mamdani pursues his aggressive socialist agenda, which includes rent freezes, free public buses, expanded free childcare and more. Levine did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Landers’ BlackRock stance. Advertisement

Title: Who’s Kevin Hassett, Trump’s reported crypto-friendly pick for the Fed?
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/kevin-hassett-trump-crypto-pick-fed
Time Published: 2025-11-26T15:37:30Z
Full Content:
Kevin Hassett, a White House economic adviser, has reportedly emerged as a leader among the Trump administration’s short list to replace Jerome Powell. US President Donald Trump is slated to choose a new Federal Reserve chair by Christmas, and the frontrunner, Kevin Hassett, could be a boon for the crypto industry. Hassett is a White House economic adviser who has reportedly emerged as a strong candidate for the Fed chair position. He is the director of the National Economic Council and oversaw the digital asset working group directed by the White House earlier this year. Trump has been trying to increase his administration’s control over the Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, thereby expanding the White House’s influence over monetary policy. The nomination process has not yet begun, but observers are already speculating about what a Hassett chairmanship could mean for US monetary policy and crypto. Hassett was an assistant professor of economics at the Columbia Business School in the 1990s. While there, he also served as an economist in the Division of Research and Statistics at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. He was also a policy consultant with the Department of the Treasury under the administrations of former presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Hassett briefly sat on the White House Council of Economic Advisors during the first Trump administration. During the president’s second term, Hassett served as director of the National Economic Council (NEC), a part of the executive branch that the president uses for setting domestic and international economic policy. Despite a lack of clear public statements, Hassett is widely regarded as pro-crypto. In June, he revealed a stake of at least $1 million in Coinbase and that he was compensated at least $50,001 for his role on the exchange’s Academic and Regulatory Advisory Council. The NEC, where he serves as director, oversaw the development of the White House’s digital asset working group, which published a paper earlier this year outlining the administration’s policy on crypto. The Fed doesn’t oversee securities or commodities, so its policy changes can’t affect crypto regulation. But a crypto-friendly Fed could still have a positive impact on the industry in several ways. Related: Bitcoiners perk up as odds of a December Fed rate cut almost double Firstly, lower interest rates generally mean better crypto prices. Juan Leon, a senior investment strategist at Bitwise, said that the implications for markets are “strongly bullish.” He called Hassett an “aggressive ‘dove’ who has publicly criticized current rates for being too high and advocated for deeper, faster cuts.” Zach Pandl, head of research at digital asset investment platform Grayscale, said, “On the margin Hassett should be considered positive for crypto => supports rate cuts, past Coinbase advisor, NEC director during White House crypto policy push.” The Fed also regulates banks, namely bank holding companies, payment system access, reserve requirements and liquidity and risk rules. Tightening or loosening these rules could affect crypto companies’ access to a number of services, including: Crypto custody Lending against crypto collateral Access to payment rails Stablecoin issuer requirements vis-à-vis banking regulations Settlement rules. Still, the White House has yet to make a clear nomination. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced in late October that Hassett was on a short list of five nominees to replace Jerome Powell. These included former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock executive Rick Rieder. A nomination is expected by Christmas. Trump has been attempting to assert more control over the Federal Reserve as a means to exert greater influence over his preferred monetary policies. Earlier this year, he attempted to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Her refusal to step down sent the case to the Supreme Court, which, for the time being, has allowed her to stay on. In a court filing, Cook’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, called the attempt a “broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System.” The Council of Foreign Relations has lauded the independence of this system, stating that it “shields the Federal Reserve from undue political influence, such as pressure from the White House to lower interest rates ahead of an election, which could offer short-term political gains but cause long-term economic harm.” An independent Fed also “enhances the Fed’s credibility” and makes the market more confident in its decisions. “Crucially, it also empowers the Federal Reserve to take difficult but necessary actions, even when they are unpopular.” John Authers, a senior editor for markets and Bloomberg Opinion columnist, wrote that choosing Hassett “appears to be about loyalty.” George Pollack, a senior US policy analyst at Signum Global Advisors, reportedly said that Trump will nominate Hassett “because of his confidence that Hassett will be the candidate most likely to support the administration’s priorities.” Were the Fed to become another arm of the administration, the results could be good for crypto markets in the short term but disastrous elsewhere. Lower-than-needed interest rates could score cheap political points but lead to increased inflation. The Center for American Progress explained, “Knowing that the rates will be based on well-researched data, and not political whims, assures the world that the U.S. economy will remain relatively stable and its markets will remain rational.” Magazine: Getting scammed for 100 Bitcoin led Sunny Lu to create VeChain Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: Texas Drops $10 Million On Bitcoin, Officially Buying The Dip First

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Texas has moved public money into Bitcoin exposure, buying $5 million worth of shares in a regulated Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to reports, the state’s purchase was made on November 20, 2025, and it used the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) to gain price exposure without immediately holding the cryptocurrency itself. The state set aside a total allocation of $10 million for its new Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lee Bratcher, who leads the Texas Blockchain Council, confirmed the state’s crypto purchase on X. Reports have disclosed that officials chose the ETF route as a temporary measure while the state puts custody plans in place. The IBIT shares give Texas a stake that tracks Bitcoin’s market moves. Based on reports, the entry price equated to roughly $87,000 per BTC at the time of the buy. The buy represents half of the total allocation, leaving $5 million still available for future moves. TEXAS BOUGHT THE DIP! Texas becomes the FIRST state to purchase Bitcoin with a $10M investment on Nov. 20th at an approximately $87k basis! Congratulations to Comptroller @KHancock4TX and the dedicated investments team at Texas Treasury who have been watching this market… pic.twitter.com/wsMqI9HrPD — Lee ₿ratcher (@lee_bratcher) November 25, 2025 The move follows legislation passed earlier in the year. According to public records, the reserve program was created by Senate Bill 21, signed in June 2025. The law authorizes a capped budget for the reserve and sets conditions for what assets qualify. Reports have disclosed that Bitcoin met the criteria laid out in the measure, prompting the initial allocation. According to state officials, the purchase is meant as a hedge and a way to diversify long-term holdings. An RFP process is expected to pick a custodian, with officials planning to transfer from ETF positions to direct custody once systems are ready. The request for proposals is slated for early 2026, based on public statements. Analysts noted the distinction between ETF shares and direct ownership. ETF holdings provide price exposure; they do not give the state direct control over on-chain Bitcoin wallets. That control would come only after the state completes its custody procurement and shifts assets into cold storage or similar solutions. Market observers say the purchase is notable because it marks one of the first instances of a US state formally placing public funds into Bitcoin exposure. The amount is small relative to broader markets, yet symbolic. It may prompt other states to consider similar reserve strategies, especially where lawmakers favor diversification. According to public filings, the state will publish details of the holdings and any custody plan updates. Oversight mechanisms built into the law require regular reporting, and the remaining $5 million allocation must follow the same rules before it is used. That reporting will be watched closely by lawmakers, taxpayers, and market watchers. The buying decision was made amid wide debate over how government bodies should handle crypto assets. Texas plans to move carefully, using regulated products first and then moving toward self-custody when the proper safeguards and vendors are chosen.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Next week could decide whether SEC lets your Apple shares live on-chain — with the same protections

The Investor Advisory Committee will probe how issuance, trading, and settlement could work under existing rules. Here’s the practical path and the roadblocks. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The Dec. 4 meeting of the SEC’s Investor Advisory Committee opens with a question the agency has spent years avoiding: “What does it actually look like when publicly traded equities live on a blockchain?” Not as wrapped derivatives on offshore exchanges, not as speculative tokens detached from shareholder rights, but as registered securities trading inside the same regulatory framework that governs Apple shares today. The two-hour panel, titled “Tokenization of Equities: How Issuance, Trading, and Settlement Would Work with Existing Regulation,” assembles market-structure architects from Nasdaq, BlackRock, Coinbase, Citadel Securities, Robinhood, and Galaxy Digital to sketch that path in public for the first time. The timing reflects pressure the SEC can no longer deflect. Nasdaq recently filed a formal proposal to trade tokenized versions of listed stocks alongside traditional shares on the same order book, arguing that blockchain settlement requires no carve-outs from the national market system. Commissioner Hester Peirce made clear in July that tokenization “does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset.” Additionally, tokenized securities remain securities and are subject to the full federal regime. What Dec. 4 tests is whether that framing can survive contact with implementation details: Who holds the keys? How does the NBBO work when trades settle in seconds instead of two days? Can you short a token the same way you short a share? Nasdaq’s blueprint offers the clearest view of what “inside the system” tokenization looks like. The exchange proposes allowing listed equities to trade in either traditional digital form or as tokens, with both versions sharing the same CUSIP, execution priority, and economic rights. The token lives at the settlement layer. Issuers still register under the Securities Act, exchanges still operate under the Exchange Act, broker-dealers still route orders through consolidated feeds, and the Depository Trust Company (DTC) still guarantees delivery. Blockchain replaces the back-end ledger, not the front-end rulebook. That structure keeps tokenized equities inside Regulation NMS, which means trades still contribute to the national best bid and offer, market makers still face quote obligations, and surveillance still flags wash trades and spoofing. Nasdaq warns that parallel venues outside NMS would fragment liquidity, undermine price discovery, and leave issuers blind to where their stock actually trades. The filing explicitly rejects exemptions: tokenization is a settlement technology, not a new asset class that warrants lighter-touch oversight. On settlement, Nasdaq points to DTC building blockchain infrastructure so token trades can clear on-chain while the exchange’s matching engine and data feeds remain unchanged. If that plumbing arrives on schedule, live trading could start as early as the third quarter of next year. The model assumes that transfer agents maintain tokenized registers the same way they maintain book-entry registers today, with the same custody standards and financial responsibility rules, just with a different database underlying them. The Dec. 4 agenda flags a distinction the crypto press often collapses: natively issued tokenized shares versus wrapper structures. Native tokens mean the issuer itself places equity on-chain or directs its transfer agent to maintain a blockchain register, conveying full voting rights, dividend claims, and liquidation preferences. Wrapper tokens, common on offshore platforms, offer only economic exposure: price goes up, investors profit, but they can’t vote the shares or sue in a derivative action. Nasdaq’s filing uses European venues as a cautionary tale. Tokens tracking Apple and Amazon traded there at prices wildly divergent from the underlying stock, required no issuer consent, and granted holders neither voting rights nor liquidation rights. When those tokens crashed, buyers discovered they owned synthetic derivatives, not shares. The exchange argues that letting such products proliferate without registration would gut investor protections and create a shadow equity market that regulators can’t see. The panel will probe how ownership rights flow through tokenized structures, not because the SEC is confused about what a share is, but because wrapping introduces intermediaries who may or may not pass through governance and economic rights. If a token only tracks price, it can start to resemble a security-based swap, triggering different disclosure and margining rules. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) commentary explicitly stated that investors must retain the same legal and beneficial ownership in tokenized form, or the product morphs into something entirely different. The Dec. 4 agenda spans a spectrum of regulatory friction. At the low-friction end are issuers registering tokenized shares, listing them on national securities exchanges, and trading them interchangeably with traditional digital shares, as Nasdaq proposes. Existing statutes already permit that if tokenization is treated as a settlement method rather than a product innovation. Blockchain as record-keeping technology also fits, provided registered clearing agencies and transfer agents meet current custody and books-and-records standards. Earlier SEC staff statements on digital asset custody frame this as compliance engineering, not boundary-pushing. At the high-friction end, there is actual 24/7 trading of listed equities, which collides with Reg NMS assumptions about market hours and consolidated data. Regulators float 24/7 markets in the crypto context, but applying that to tokenized Apple shares means rewriting how best execution works when New York sleeps and Tokyo trades. Models where tokenized equities trade only on non-NMS blockchain venues, unregistered as exchanges or alternative trading systems, also clash with existing rules. Nasdaq and SIFMA both argue that allowing equity volume to migrate to unconnected platforms would shred the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) and leave retail investors with stale quotes. Senate work on the Responsible Financial Innovation Act points in the opposite direction, explicitly classifying tokenized stocks and bonds as securities and cementing SEC oversight. That suggests any attempt to treat tokenized shares as outside the agency’s remit will hit legislative headwinds, not tailwinds. The Investor Advisory Committee can submit findings and recommendations, but it does not write rules. The panel is a stress test to see if Coinbase, Citadel Securities, and Nasdaq can agree on what compliant tokenization looks like when they’re forced to reconcile custody models, interoperability standards, and short-selling mechanics in the same room. If they can, the SEC gains a reference architecture for evaluating filings like Nasdaq’s. If they can’t, the agency learns where the technical or incentive mismatches sit before approving anything. What the panel won’t do is approve Nasdaq’s proposal, rewrite the definition of a security, or bless offshore stock tokens that skip issuer consent. It also won’t resolve whether 24/7 trading or cross-chain interoperability requires new exemptive relief, as those questions depend on engineering details the advisory body isn’t equipped to answer. At most, Dec. 4 yields a menu of options the Commission can reference when deciding whether tokenized equities belong in the national market system or require a parallel structure that current law doesn’t yet contemplate. The meeting matters because it forces the question into the open. The answer still depends on whether the market wants to retrofit blockchain into existing rails or build new ones, and the SEC has to authorize it from scratch.

Title: NYC comptroller urges city pensions to drop BlackRock, other managers over climate concerns

Let ESG Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. New York City outgoing Comptroller Brad Lander recommended the city’s pension plans drop BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora as asset managers. Lander, whose term as comptroller ends at the end of the calendar year, said all 49 of the asset managers for the city’s pension plans submitted their decarbonization plans to measure their alignment with the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan. However, following an evaluation of those plans, BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora’s plans did not meet climate expectations, Lander said. BlackRock is the pension system’s largest asset manager and currently manages $42.3 billion for all three pension plans, according to Lander’s letter to trustees. Fidelity manages $384 million for the TRS plan, and PanAgora manages $358 million for the TRS and NYCERS plans, according to the letter to the plans’ trustees. Lander said in the Nov. 26 release that the three asset managers “fail to address climate risk with the seriousness [the pension plans] expect.” “The systemic risk of the climate crisis threatens the long-term value of New York City’s pension funds,” Lander said. “Our Net Zero plan is a core part of our fiduciary duty to protect these assets. I am pleased to report that 46 of our 49 public markets managers are aligned with our expectations for decarbonization; unfortunately, three are not.” The NYC comptroller said he has “significant concerns regarding BlackRock’s restrictive approach” to engaging with public companies it owns more than 5% of the equities. The asset manager said it will not proactively reach out to on proxy voting issues to align with a “conservative interpretation” of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s updated engagement guidelines. BlackRock also recently began allowing clients it doesn’t vote proxies for to opt into its Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship strategy, which Lander recommended the trustees’ formally vote to approve for the system’s non-U.S. equity index funds that BlackRock manages. For the public equity index funds BlackRock manages for the system, Lander recommended issuing a search notice to find “appropriate managers for BlackRock’s U.S. public equity index mandates to address the Systems’ climate expectations consistent with fiduciary duties.” “While BlackRock has a global [Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship] focus list of 900 companies, it says it will not proactively reach out to U.S. companies nor set agendas for engagement; consequently, it cannot meet the Systems’ expectations set forth in the Plans,” Lander told the system’s trustees. “BlackRock also says it cannot seek to influence these companies’ actions, which means it cannot meet the Systems’ expectations set forth in the Plans with respect to their U.S. portfolios.” In a follow-up statement issued Wednesday, BlackRock said it had responded to a direct request from the New York City Bureau of Asset Management — which oversees the investments for the city's five public pension funds — and met with its investment team earlier in the month to provide an update on its Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship program. The asset manager said it informed NYC BAM that a version of the program was now available to all five pension plans. “Today, you recommended that three pension plans take certain actions after your departure, including terminating BlackRock’s index equity mandate. In doing so, you accused BlackRock of abdicating its financial duty and putting New York City’s pensions at risk,” BlackRock said in the Nov. 26 statement addressing Lander. “These statements are another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.” Lander also suggested terminating the mandates for Fidelity and PanAgora, which both actively manage U.S. small cap equity mandates for the system. In their place, Lander said the system should seek recommendations for how to re-allocate those assets, according to the letter to trustees. Lander recommended moving on from Fidelity, as the asset manager has “taken a restrictive approach to engaging companies outside of the U.S.,” and is voluntarily applying the SEC’s engagement guidance to both U.S. and non-U.S. companies. The comptroller said other asset managers of non-U.S. strategies have not taken the same approach, which “precludes Fidelity from meeting the Systems’ expectations and prudently addressing climate risk and opportunity in their engagement of companies.” Lander said PanAgora does not engage companies beyond the topic of emissions disclosures. As such, “they do not engage companies to take any decarbonization actions to improve carbon efficiency such as setting emissions reduction targets or adopting decarbonization plans even when such actions may be beneficial to a company.” Get the free daily newsletter read by industry experts “I don't think we're going to ever capture the opportunities of AI if we don't think about it in a responsible way,” Cisco Chief Sustainability Officer Mary de Wysocki told ESG Dive.

Title: Vanguard Climbs the Bond Ladder With Latest Launch

Time Published: 2025-11-26T11:10:00Z

The bond ladder ETFs come with a target date and can help advisors build income for clients’ major life events. Sean Allocca sean@thedailyupside.com Vanguard’s finally climbing its way up the ladder. The world’s second-largest issuer filed this week to launch 10 corporate bond ladder ETFs, years after products from top competition like BlackRock and Invesco. The new defined-maturity funds package bonds with similar face values and end dates into a single product and give advisors a way to plan for major life events, like paying for college or funding retirement. The Vanguard funds have maturity dates between 2027 and 2036 and will look to undercut the competition on price at just 8 basis points, according to a filing with the SEC. It’s the latest addition in a flurry of new products launched this year under new-ish CEO Salim Ramji, and will enter a busy space where competitors have already planted flags, billboards and possibly lawn furniture. “Vanguard pioneered the index fund, but they have rarely been first movers on ETFs,” said Jeff De Maso, editor of the Independent Vanguard Adviser. “Generally, they’ve been late to the game, and ultimately won through lower fees and their reputation.” Bond ladders have advantages over traditional funds because they provide a consistent cash flow over time. They can also give clients the “peace of mind” that comes with seeing them as a holding in their brokerage account, and knowing they’re going to mature at par, even if interest rates rise and bond prices dip, De Maso said. Scott Van Den Berg, CFP, of Century Management said the real joy is lining them up with future cash needs. For example, Van Den Berg built ladders to help clients bridge the gap between retirement and the start of Social Security. “Investors aren’t familiar with how individual bonds trade or how they behave, so the simplicity of a laddered ETF will be appealing,” he said. “They give us the precision, flexibility, and confidence that each rung of the ladder is doing exactly what the client needs it to do.” With Vanguard entering the fray, costs will almost surely come down and help investors avoid the sometimes opaque pricing found in the individual-bond market, said Mike Casey of AE Advisors. Vanguard will face entrenched competition: Step by Step. Bond ladders are also practical ways to manage interest-rate risk and bring structure to the fixed-income side of a portfolio, said Casey. But building them using an individual-bond approach requires a lot of time and attention to maintain spreads and rebalance or reinvest proceeds. That’s why the new wave of ETFs could be game-changing. “The emerging competition, now including Vanguard, should further compress expense ratios and improve liquidity, which ultimately benefits everyone,” Casey said. The ETF issuer is among the first in line for dual share classes, and it plans to use mutual-fund shares to access 401(k) plans. Buffered ETFs are surging in popularity, particularly among retirees, and that bodes well for their future. More than half of RIAs increased the number of strategies in which they invested. ETF investors can feel the magic between A and I. It’s why they say they’re loading up on funds. Investors pulled more than half a billion dollars out of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust in just one day last week. So-called copycat filings are picking up, but whether they’re a problem remains up for debate. This week’s SEC decision may be one of the most significant since the ETF Rule in 2019. Janus Henderson and Reckoner Capital Management both filed to launch new collateralized debt obligations strategies this month. Trading fractional shares for whole shares will require some communication and help, according to one firm that offers shareholder services. More people are planning to buy ETFs, and their biggest demands are exposure to stocks and digital assets, per BlackRock. No state income taxes and pro-business policies have attracted hundreds of companies to the Lone Star State. Some of the biggest companies in the ETF business haven’t been in the game for very long but are quickly gathering assets. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: Texas Allocates $5M into BlackRock’s $BTC ETF as Bitcoin Hyper Raises Over $28.5M
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/texas-bitcoin-etf-bet-boosts-bitcoin-hyper-interest/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T10:26:03Z

Quick Facts: When a US state buys the dip, people pay attention. Texas just allocated $5M into BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ($BTC) ETF while $BTC trades well below its all-time high. This signals that state-level capital still sees asymmetric upside in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. If you’re a crypto investor, that’s a strongly bullish message. That’s because when public institutions step in during a pullback, they’re effectively saying volatility is a feature, not a deal-breaker. But simply holding $BTC on a centralized ETF rail isn’t where the real innovation is happening. The next leg of the cycle is increasingly about what can be built on top of Bitcoin: scaling, programmability, and yield-generating infrastructure. That’s where projects like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) become appealing to more aggressive risk-takers looking to ride institutional narratives. Bitcoin Hyper pitches itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, attempting to blend Bitcoin’s settlement finality with Solana-style performance. If you’re watching Texas buy the ETF dip, the thesis is straightforward: if state treasuries are comfortable with base-layer $BTC, the upside may shift toward infrastructure that unlocks high-speed payments, DeFi, and dApps on top of that base. Texas’s spot Bitcoin ETF allocation strengthens $BTC’s role as a long-term store-of-value rather than just a speculative trade. The catch is that Bitcoin’s base layer still processes 7-10 transactions per second, with confirmation times measured in minutes. Meanwhile, its fees regularly spike into several dollars during congestion. For everyday payments, on-chain DeFi, and gaming, that user experience can’t compete with newer high-throughput chains like Solana that finalize in seconds for fractions of a cent. That gap has triggered a flood of Bitcoin scaling plays: Lightning for peer-to-peer payments, sidechains like Rootstock and Liquid for smart contracts, and emerging rollup-style or L2 concepts to add programmability anchored in Bitcoin-level secure settlement. As more institutional money holds passive $BTC exposure via ETFs, the opportunity space shifts to these L2 projects attempting to make Bitcoin usable, not just investable. Within that landscape, Bitcoin Hyper sits alongside other Bitcoin L2 contenders but takes a more aggressive approach by importing SVM semantics and Solana-style tooling onto a Bitcoin-secured execution layer. Where Bitcoin Hyper tries to stand out is in raw performance. The project positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, aiming to deliver Solana-fast transaction throughput and low-latency execution while still anchoring finality back to Bitcoin Layer 1. In practice, that means sub-second block times, rapid confirmation, and fees targeted in the sub-cent range for routine transfers. Under the hood, the architecture is modular: Bitcoin L1 handles settlement and periodic state anchoring, while a high-speed SVM-based Layer 2 processes execution in real time. A single sequencer orders transactions and commits them back to Bitcoin, while a decentralized canonical bridge allows $BTC holders to move value onto the L2 as wrapped assets. SPL-compatible token standards are adapted for this environment, giving Rust developers a familiar model to build swaps, lending protocols, and NFT or gaming primitives. From an adoption standpoint, the team is leaning on tokenonomics and early traction to draw capital. The presale has already raised over $28.5M, with tokens at $0.013335, indicating that a growing number of investors is already investing in SVM-on-Bitcoin narratives. Whales are particularly interested in the project. Less than two weeks ago, one purchased a little over $500K worth of $HYPER tokens, which is the strongest signal of support yet on Bitcoin Hyper. Long-term, $HYPER token could explode, and according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, it could reach a high of $0.20 by the end of 2026. That’s about a 1,399% increase from its current price. Bitcoin Hyper’s value proposition is simple: if states like Texas are bullish on Bitcoin, then an L2 that builds upon $BTC’s infrastructure can only soar in popularity. But with a price increase coming up a day from now, it’s best to act quickly and lock in $HYPER at a discounted price. Join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.

© 2025 Coinspeaker LTD. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. The PLUME token shot up more than 55% in one hour after leading South Korean exchange Upbit announced its listing. Plume Network’s native token PLUME surged roughly 55% within an hour after South Korean exchange Upbit confirmed that it will list the asset on its KRW market on Nov. 26. Trading volume shot up, with 24-hour volume rising nearly 600% to $187 million. According to CoinMarketCap, at press time, PLUME trades near $0.039 and its market cap has risen 56% to $111 million and it is now among the top 250 cryptocurrencies. In August 2025, the token was chosen for Binance listing following a 150 million-token airdrop. Trading pairs included USDT, USDC, FDUSD, TRY, and Binance’s BNB. The fast rally began shortly after Upbit revealed that PLUME would be listed on its Korean won-denominated market. Over 10 million users of the South Korean exchange will now be able to actively trade the token. PLUME is now live in the KRW market on @Official_Upbit. Korean users can access PLUME directly with Korean Won, expanding our reach across one of the world’s most active retail trading markets. Full announcement: https://t.co/HYb9nG1xxI pic.twitter.com/bOpo4PHZZn — Plume Foundation (@plumefndn) November 26, 2025 To guard against early volatility, Upbit has introduced temporary limits. Buyout orders will be blocked for about five minutes after launch, sell orders priced more than 10% below the previous day’s close will be restricted for the same period, and only limit orders will be allowed for roughly two hours. Upbit has followed a similar standard approach for new listings that attract rapid speculative interest. As reported earlier, in October, Upbit listed INFINIT (IN), which saw a similar increase in price and volume. Plume’s token distribution is split among four groups (20% for core contributors, 21% for early backers, 13% for the treasury, and 46% for community and ecosystem programs). According to the latest schedule, around 32% of the supply, equal to 3.23 billion tokens, is already unlocked, while roughly 68% remains locked. Tokens will be released into the market until early 2028, with gradual increases across all four categories. The community and ecosystem pool will be the largest source of circulating supply over time, followed by early backers and contributor allocations. The unlock plan targets a slow, steady pace rather than large, sudden releases. Plume Network has 279,692 RWA holders, accounting for half of all holders across the broader RWA sector. Last week, Plume disclosed that Securitize, backed by BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, will deploy institutional-grade assets on Plume’s Nest staking system. Nest allows users to trade and earn yield on tokenized assets. Institutional assets meet composable yield.@Securitize, the tokenization leader behind products from @apolloglobal , @hamilton_lane , @vaneck_us, and @BlackRock, is bringing institutional-grade assets to Plume’s @NestCredit staking protocol. pic.twitter.com/g9mQT1WErF — Plume – RWAfi Chain (@plumenetwork) November 20, 2025 The first assets set to arrive will be Hamilton Lane funds, followed by additional issuers in 2026. Meanwhile, the global RWA sector is also getting popular, as by Q3 2025, total tokenized assets reached roughly $30 billion.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he is wrapping up the second round of interviews for the next Federal Reserve Chair. He added that there is a strong possibility President Donald Trump will reveal his choice before Christmas. (Source: Reuters) White House adviser Kevin Hassett is widely viewed as the leading contender, according to a Bloomberg report. Hassett, like Trump, believes interest rates should be lower than they are under current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent explained that the selection has been narrowed from eleven names to five strong candidates. He said the final interviews focused on how each candidate would manage what has become a very complicated institution. The White House dismissed the Bloomberg scoop, calling any discussion about the Fed nomination speculative until the president makes an official announcement. Along with Hassett, the shortlist includes former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, Governor Michelle Bowman, who also serves as vice chair for supervision, and Rick Rieder, the global fixed-income chief at BlackRock. Betting platforms Kalshi and Polymarket showed a neck-and-neck contest between Hassett and Waller. Waller’s odds improved sharply after he said he had a strong second interview with Bessent. After the Bloomberg report, bets began shifting heavily towards Hassett across both platforms. Each market assigned him around a 50% probability of being chosen. The Federal Reserve has already cut interest rates at its last two meetings, and markets expect another cut in December. The benchmark rate is currently in the 3.75% to 4.00% range. Waller and Bowman, both appointed during Trump’s first term, have argued since the summer that the greater risk lies in a weakening job market rather than rising inflation. They both dissented at the July meeting in favour of a rate cut.

Title: Bitcoin Recovery From Worst Of Selloff Holds, Buoying Traders

The intense selling pressure that has weighed on Bitcoin in recent weeks looks to be easing, raising hopes that the token’s brutal slide is nearing an end. The original cryptocurrency was little changed at around $88,000 on Tuesday, well above last week’s slump that consigned it to a seven-month low, triggering massive liquidations and erasing more than $1 trillion in value from the broader digital-asset market. The mood among traders remains cautious, highlighting the market’s fragile state. Bitcoin remains on track for its worst month since 2022, and exchange-traded funds investing in the token look likely to record their heaviest monthly outflows since launching. But after Bitcoin’s modest rebound, some see cause for optimism. In the Bitcoin options market, the cost of purchasing downside protection has fallen sharply, with the premium for one-week puts over calls sliding to around 4.5% from a 2025 high of 11% reached on Friday, according to Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets. “This indicates the level of stress has come down significantly, and investors expect we’ve seen the bottom for now,” she said. Another metric drawing attention is Bitcoin’s 14-day relative strength index, now at 32 after a steep decline from early October. A reading of 30 or below typically signals an oversold asset while 70 or above indicates the opposite. Meanwhile, implied volatility on Bitcoin options — a gauge of expected future price movement — has returned to April levels, when tariff news induced a wave of selling. “This suggests traders are positioning for a breakout, which could of course be in either direction,” said Noelle Acheson, author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter. “But options skew shows that the bets on further drops are softening relative to those on a price increase from here.” Global crypto exchange-traded products have seen more than $6 billion in outflows so far in November, the largest monthly withdrawal on record going back to 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Even so, investors are largely staying put. The US Bitcoin ETFs’ combined redemptions of $3.7 billion in November represent about 3% of their $110 billion in assets. For BlackRock Inc.’s Bitcoin fund (IBIT), short interest — measured by the dollar value of shares sold short — has plummeted, according to a report published by S3 Partners LLC. BTC Markets Analyst Rachael Lucas noted that Bitcoin’s muted trading on Monday could also indicate that selling pressure is subsiding. She sees $80,000 as the near-term floor, with $90,000 to $95,000 forming the resistance band to any meaningful rebound. US stocks climbed after the tech sector trimmed the sharp decline it suffered earlier in the session as traders contended with the AI chip rivalry between Nvidia Corp. and Alphabet Inc. Investors have put the chances of a rate cut at the upcoming December meeting of the Federal Reserve at about 80%, up from 42% a week ago, according to futures contracts. Fed officials appear deeply divided over whether another reduction would be appropriate, following cuts in September and October. “The market is going to be in wait-and-see mode until the Fed’s decision,” Orbit’s Mauron said. “Long-term holders who were exiting their position over $100,000 are seeing current levels as too low to sell and are back in holding mode, while those looking to accumulate new positions may try to wait for another dip below $85,000.” As investors contend with a mix of concerns from a cooling US labor market to surging artificial-intelligence capital spending by major corporations, a risk appetite gauge maintained by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has fallen to zero. The reading signals mounting pressure on speculative assets, including Bitcoin. A drop of this magnitude reflects fading risk enthusiasm and, at extreme levels, may even suggest that markets have overshot to the downside. “Elevated equity valuations and bullish positioning increased vulnerability to shocks, especially within more retail-driven segments such as Unprofitable Tech,” wrote strategists at the bank including Christian Mueller-Glissmann.

The Company also received commitments from its bank group to increase its existing revolving credit facility to $900 million and its existing letter of credit facility to $1.1 billion. These actions further support the impact of the acquisitions on the financial operations of the business. “Our team is prepared to successfully integrate both assets into our portfolio, and we thank Caithness Energy and the plants’ operator, Ethos Energy, for their cooperation and support over the past few months,” said Talen Chief Fossil Officer Dale Lebsack. “We expect the Freedom and Guernsey teams to continue their impressive track record of safe, compliant, and efficient operations as part of the Talen fleet.

Title: ONDO adds $25M in yield assets amid EU approval – Details here!

Tokenized yield-bearing real-world assets could be the next financial revolution, and Ondo Finance has a big role to play. The Figure Technology YLDS addition strengthens and diversifies the OUSG yield sources, whose portfolio already includes funds from trusted asset managers. News of the BNB Chain expansion and the EU regulatory approval did little to stem the selling pressure behind the Ondo ecosystem token. Ondo Finance [ONDO] announced the purchase of $25 million of YLDS, a yield-bearing stablecoin issued by Figure Technology Solutions. Terming it a strategic investment, the addition will enhance and diversify the yield source supporting OUSG. OUSG (Ondo Short-Term U.S. Government Treasuries) is the flagship product of Ondo Finance. OUSG has more than $780 million in total value locked (TVL) and gives investors exposure to U.S. Treasuries. It offers 24/7 redemption with an estimated annual return of 3.68%. In addition, its multi-chain support expands accessibility for a wider range of users. The recent purchase adds to the reserve portfolio, which already has tokenized Treasury products from well-known asset managers, such as BlackRock and Fidelity. In October, Ondo Finance expanded its tokenized asset offerings to the BNB Chain. An announcement from the network read that over 100 tokenized stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) went live. On the 18th of November, the company stated that it had received regulatory approval to bring its products to the European Union (EU) and the broader European Economic Area (EEA). Ondo Finance had obtained authorization from the Lichtenstein Financial Market Authority, a well-established European regulator. This development meant the company’s tokenized stocks and ETFs were available to European investors and ensured it operated within the EU regulatory framework, adding to safety and appeal. Tokenized yield-bearing real-world assets could be the next global financial revolution. If this prediction comes true, the Ondo Finance brand would likely keep growing in the coming years. Source: ONDO/USDT on TradingView Despite the bullish developments behind Ondo Finance, the token faced steady selling pressure. The CMF showed that capital flow has been outwards for most of November. The MFI agreed, and has sunk below 20 in recent days. This showed seller dominance, something the price action confirms. The 1-day timeframe’s ONDO structure was firmly bearish, and has been since the second half of September. The $0.5-$0.55 area was a long-term support zone from August to September 2024, but was breached and now acts as resistance.

Title: Custody shuffle continues as 87,464 more Bitcoin leaves institution-tagged wallets in 24 hours

Data flagged by Timechainindex shows large transfers from ETF and custodian addresses, likely re-custody rather than sell pressure. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Timechain Index founder Sani reported 87,464 BTC flowing out of institution-tagged wallets between Nov. 21 and Nov. 22, adding that he hadn’t seen such movement in months. The raw data showed over 15,000 BTC leaving tracked cohorts on Nov. 21 alone, the largest single-day outflow since June 26. Yet, as Sani clarified in a note, the headline figure overstates actual selling pressure. Most of the movement represents internal reshuffling rather than institutions exiting Bitcoin positions. Sani explained that pre-processed data can show extreme volatility when large holders move coins between custodians or wallets, but after reconciliation, the net flows often land near zero. Strategy accounted for 49,907 BTC of the tracked outflows, but CEO Michael Saylor confirmed the company sold no Bitcoin that week. In fact, Strategy added 8,178 BTC last week, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data. Sani’s assessment indicates that Strategy transferred holdings to new custodians to diversify risk, with some coins appearing in addresses linked to Fidelity Custody. Additionally, that’s the second time the firm has performed such a movement. This is not unique to Strategy. Sani shared that BlackRock moved Bitcoins out of their known addresses twice as well. The first time happened last year, and the second occurred a few weeks ago, when they moved nearly 800,000 BTC to new addresses. Additionally, Coinbase also reshuffled a similar amount this weekend in a UTXO consolidation exercise. Back to the over 15,000 BTC in outflows, Bitcoin ETFs bore the brunt on Nov. 21, shedding 10,426 BTC as issuers processed redemptions tied to $903 million in net withdrawals reported Nov. 20. ETF outflows translate directly to liquidations, as fund managers must sell the underlying Bitcoin to meet shareholder exit requests. Still, the scale fell within normal bounds given the prior day’s redemption activity. Timechain Index tracks 16 entity categories, including centralized exchanges, miners, ETFs, publicly traded companies, custodians, governments, OTC desks, and payment processors. The platform aggregates known addresses for each cohort and monitors balance changes in real time. Sani’s “LiveChangesSummary” data showed Strategy’s 49,907 BTC outflow, Coinbase’s 11,762 BTC outflow, and ETC Group’s 6,973 BTC outflow as the largest movements, with smaller flows across custodians, exchanges, and miners. The distinction matters because Bitcoin’s on-chain transparency makes wallet movements visible before context arrives. When 87,464 BTC appears to leave institution-tracked addresses in a 24-hour window, the immediate read can suggest panic selling or a coordinated retreat from crypto exposure. The post-processing showed the opposite: net institutional holdings remained stable after accounting for internal transfers and standard ETF mechanics. Strategy’s custody diversification aligns with treasury management best practices for large holders. Concentrating nearly 650,000 BTC with a single custodian creates operational risk, and spreading holdings across multiple qualified custodians reduces exposure to any single point of failure. Bitcoin ETFs operate under different constraints. When investors redeem shares, authorized participants return creation units to the issuer and receive the underlying Bitcoin, which they then sell on the market to close out arbitrage positions. The Nov. 20 outflow figure of $903 million corresponded to roughly 10,400 BTC at prevailing prices, matching the ETF-cohort outflow Timechain Index recorded the following day. The lag reflects settlement timing rather than discretionary selling. Gino Matos is a law school graduate and a seasoned journalist with six years of experience in the crypto industry.

Title: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says there’s ‘very good chance’ Trump names new Fed chair by Christmas

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/25/2025 9:34:18 AM PST by DFG There is “a very good chance” that President Trump names a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. Bessent, who has been leading search efforts for a new Fed leader, told CNBC he still has one interview left and is not ready to speculate on who might succeed Powell, whom Trump has said he’d “love” to fire. “I think there’s a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas,” said the Treasury secretary. “But it’s [Trump’s] prerogative, whether it’s before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well.” Finalists for the role reportedly include National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. Trump has been eager to replace Powell – whose term expires in May 2026 – after months of blasting the Fed chairman for not slashing rates quickly enough. Last week at the US-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, DC, Trump said Powell has “mental problems” and he would love to “fire his ass,” but Bessent is holding him back. As the audience of investors, tech bros and foreign leaders laughed, Trump urged Bessent – who was in the crowd – to “work on this guy,” adding: “The rates are too high, Scott. And if you don’t get it fixed fast, I’m going to fire your ass, okay?” “If you were in the room, he was joking,” Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday. “We’ve gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it’s more than just cutting rates.” (Excerpt) Read more at nypost.com ...

High rates lower inflation and promote savings. Low rates raise inflation and encourage borrow & spend. Low rates raise inflation and encourage borrow & spend. I'm certainly no expert, but I see the entire global economic system as a complete house of cards. It's all debt. There is no way out. We just limp and limp and limp forward. It's going to come crashing down at some point. They will try to force us to a cashless CBDC system as a way to magically make debt go away, but I don't think that's going to work. It's all "gotten very complicated". Jerome Powell cut interest rates to help Biden before the election. President Trump knows hes a corrupt tool of the ‘blob’ deep state. I hope the new Fed-Head looks forward instead of backward. I see two rate cuts coming anyway. It’s a shame he didn’t know when he appointed him in the first place! That’s not how Art-of-the-Deal Trump works. He puts in places of power people for various reasons, including bad guys, to test them and force them to reveal themselves. Just because he names a replacement doesn’t mean it take effect immediately. “Powell – whose term expires in May 2026” That little weasel Powell can do a lot of damage between now and then. Unfortunately President Trump was not supposed to defeat the ‘mainstream’ globalists pre-chosen installment to the Presidency, the wicked Moloch worshiping Madame. He then took far too much advice from Bush family tools, many who were much worse than even what the Obama holdovers would’ve contrived to sabotage his presidency.

Title: Trump could make a decision on a new Fed chair 'before Christmas.' See who's on the short list

Every time Brent D. Griffiths publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump is checking his list of potential Federal Reserve chairs twice. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been leading the search, said that Trump could name his nominee to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell by Christmas. "I think there's a very good chance that the president will make an announcement before Christmas," Bessent told CNBC in late November. "But it's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well." No matter who Trump selects, Bessent said he wants a less prominent central bank. "I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background, like, it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people," Bessent said. Powell's term expires next May, but hasn't stopped the White House from aggressively searching for his replacement. Here are the five finalists. Before joining Trump's orbit, Kevin Hassett advised a succession of Republican presidential nominees on economic policy, including George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. Just before Thanksgiving, Hassett briefly lost his lead among the contenders on leading prediction markets. After a Bloomberg News report said he was the frontrunner, Hassett shot back up into first on Kalshi and Polymarket. As of November 25th, he has a double-digit advantage on both platforms. During Trump's first term, Hassett served as director of the president's Council of Economic Advisors. He returned to the White House during the COVID-19 pandemic and was severely criticized for publishing a model showing coronavirus deaths hitting zero by May 15, 2020. In October 1999, Hassett cowrote with journalist Jason Glassman "Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market." Some economists have heavily criticized the book, largely because the index took more than 22 years to reach that threshold. Fed Gov. Christopher Waller told Fox News that he thought his most recent conversation with Bessent went well. "I talked to Scott about 10 days ago. We had a nice, a great, meeting," Waller told Fox Business in late November. Waller said that the White House is looking for someone with "experience." It's not clear what experience that entails, but of the reported finalists, only three have experience serving on the central bank. "I think they are looking for someone who has merit, experience, and knows what they are doing in the job, and I think I fit that," he said. Just before Thanksgiving, Waller briefly dethroned White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett as the favorite of leading prediction markets. Waller's lead was short-lived as Hassett quickly supplanted him. Waller, a longtime regional Fed official, was seen as a convention pick when Trump nominated him to the central bank in 2019. Simultaneously, Trump also nominated Judy Shelton, a former campaign advisor and a Fed critic. The fight over Shelton's nomination soon spilled over onto Waller's. In December 2020, the Senate confirmed Waller 48-47, the narrowest margin for any Fed governor since 1980, per The New York Times. In July, Waller joined Gov. Michelle Bowman (another Trump first-term pick) in opposing the Fed's decision not to cut interest rates, the first dual dissent in more than 30 years. Trump told reporters in September that Hassett, Waller, and Warsh were "the top three" to replace Powell. Back in his first term, Trump reportedly considered Warsh to lead the Fed before he chose to nominate Powell in 2017. Warsh spent his early years at Morgan Stanley, working as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions. President George W. Bush nominated him to the Fed in 2006 after Warsh served as an economic advisor in the Bush White House. Drawing on his Wall Street ties, Warsh played a pivotal role in the central bank's response to the 2008 global financial crisis. When he left the Fed in 2011, the Times called him the Fed's chief liaison to Wall Street. From the sidelines, Warsh has echoed Trump's criticism of Powell, calling for "regime change" at the Fed. "The specter of the miss they made on inflation, it has stuck with them," Warsh told CNBC in July. "So one of the reasons why the president, I think, is right to be pushing the Fed publicly is we need regime change in the conduct of policy." In 2018, Trump appointed Federal Reserve Gov. Michelle Bowman to the central bank. After confirmation, she was reappointed in 2020. In June, she was narrowly confirmed as the vice chair of supervision. Bowman started as an intern for Sen. Bob Dole. During the George W. Bush administration, she held posts at FEMA and the Homeland Security Department. She was vice president at Farmers and Drovers Bank in Kansas, her family's bank, before becoming the state's top banking official. In September 2024, Bowman became the first Fed governor to vote against an interest rate decision since 2005. In July, she again voted against holding rates steady, though this time Waller joined her dissent. There's also a big Wall Street name on Trump's shortlist. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock, has spent decades on Wall Street, dating back to his time at Lehman Brothers. Rieder is responsible for managing roughly $2.4 trillion in assets, per BlackRock. He's served as a member of the Fed's Investment Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. Trump's shortlist at one point reportedly had almost a dozen names. CNBC previously reported that the following are no longer under consideration: David Zervos, Managing Director and Chief Market Strategist at Jefferies; Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan; former St. Louis Fed President James "Jim" Bullard; Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson; and Marc Sumerlin, a former economic advisor to President George W. Bush. Former Fed Gov. Larry Lindsey told CNBC that he withdrew from contention. Jump to
