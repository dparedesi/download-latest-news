Do you remember Kodak brownies and the like? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much. This is also why I don’t really tell people about bitcoin too much if they don’t seem like they have a strong need for it; for example my uncle who’s worked in the jewelry business for like over 30 years, he wants to retire, and I’m kind of in the process of helping him Sell his gold and his other reserves and stuff, in order to buy bitcoin. Even he at the age of 64, being a gold jeweler for like over 30 years know that bitcoin is the future. But his issues that he cannot stomach the volatility, he says it is like drugs, “mah-yyak”– when I was with him last I just set him up with Coinbase, and just bought the daily maximum for his account which was $3500, I think we bought windows around $65,000 a coin, and already it’s like $99,000 a coin. But once again, I think the difficult thing with bitcoin is that like is probably the most addictive crack cocaine on the planet, because it is being traded 24 7, it is extremely volatile because volatility is vitality. Anything that is allowed to trade every single waking moment, on weekends as well as the evenings, and also bank holidays, is going to have more volatility because people are just bored at home, they cannot play the traditional market so they’re going to just try to buy and sell bitcoin, do some sort of weird options trading to try to squeeze a few bucks here and there.￼ I was randomly think about Peter Thiel and his zero to one book; I think if you thought about bitcoin like a year or two ago, you might’ve seen that are artificial intelligence in AI was the right bet. But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem. This is actually a very very big opportunity for Apple; the head of security, on the planet and privacy… If Apple were able to provide security to your bitcoin or your keys or whatever, Wooden apple being in some way is the best custodian? Even better yet… We already have our bank of counseling to Apple Pay. Wouldn’t it just makes sense for you to buy bitcoin directly on an iPhone using Apple Pay, and store it on your iPhone and or iCloud Apple ID account? For people who don’t trust the cloud I get it, but still… For all practical purposes I think the cloud is like 1 trillion times safer than cold storage options. For example even me, all my photos are backed up to dropbox, Google Drive and Apple photos. Even worst case scenario all my photos get deleted, it’s OK I could start again! I think especially with Apple Apple ID Face ID touch print thumb ID, it’s almost the most logical way to feel secure with your bitcoin.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber "If these people had to be honest, it would all be over." -- Mike Benz. “Now that our cheques are bouncing and we are starting to default on our debts, our entire civilization appears to be manifesting suicidal behavior in an effort to control the firing squad.” — Luke Dodson. “Joe Biden” is feeling blue. Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump. . . . It’s such a chewy name: Chrump, a fricative fiesta! The tongue briefly presses against the alveolar ridge before releasing, then curls back, and the jaw opens slightly to form this vowel sound, the lips close to let the sound resonate nasally before releasing air. Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying! The outgoing Party of Chaos can’t stop chanting it on the cable news networks, as if trying to invoke the ancient furies, ghastly, terrifying figures with snakes for hair, dogs' heads, blood-red eyes, and bat-wings, brandishing torches and scourges to mortify their enemy. Otherwise, fantasy aside, they are in paralysis as this enemy, Mr. Trump, marshals his pieces on the gameboard: Musk, Vivek, Bobby Jr, Tulsi, Bondi, Hegseth . . . . Ay-yeeeeee! They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

Not a joke. In the lurid sunset of his dwindling term-in-office, the long shadow of his legacy points toward a gigantic glowing cinder where North America used to be. Such are the grievances of the outgoing president. I pass unto you and your legions of white supremacist slobs the ashtray that was once our mighty nation. Fix that! But, as Sir Mick Jagger observed some time ago: you can’t always get what you want. “Joe Biden,” in despair, sinks deeper into his McTeer power recliner and slips back into the bitter dream of his nemesis, a beast named Chrump. . . .

Chrump Chrump Chrump. Like, what your mouth would feel like working through a bowl of Froot Loops. So satisfying! The outgoing Party of Chaos can’t stop chanting it on the cable news networks, as if trying to invoke the ancient furies, ghastly, terrifying figures with snakes for hair, dogs' heads, blood-red eyes, and bat-wings, brandishing torches and scourges to mortify their enemy.

They are coming to get us. . . . Somebody. . . do something. . . ! Okay, then, who, exactly, in the shadows behind the half-conscious ghoul in the White House, thinks that now is a great time to commence an ATACMS (Attack’ems) missile barrage on Russia as the very thing to salvage our Ukraine project? You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO. Hence, many of us are a little concerned that the Thanksgiving birds might not make it to table this year, or ever again, if “Joe Biden” and company keep it up. One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP. Russia, no longer under communism, had interests in common with Western Civ — hell, it was part of Western Civ, really, its literature, music, science, manners....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: biden; bidenbois4ww3; hahasubstack; jhk; trump Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you. 1 posted on 11/25/2024 6:45:04 AM PST by MtnClimber [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: MtnClimber It sure looks like Biden is trying to leave the Donald a little gift of WWIII to deal with so that he won’t have any time to make America great again or any of that nonsense. 2 posted on 11/25/2024 6:46:16 AM PST by MtnClimber (For photos of scenery, wildlife and climbing, click on my screen name for my FR home page.)

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary. Russia, we keep insisting, wants to take over the world! Is it news to you that this does not comport with reality. (By now you know that news in the USA does not comport with reality.) Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP.

The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

You’d naturally turn first to Blinken and Jake Sullivan, those gold-dust twins of overseas jiggery-pokery. Or, is it the geniuses at Spook Central, worried about the fumigating operation incoming with Mr. Ratcliffe? Or perhaps it’s the men-in-skirts over in the Pentagon, seeking to punish humanity because of the clerical error inflicted on them by the desk up-yonder that handles sexual assignments at birth. Blow it all up! The psychopathic wrath of this gang is really getting out-of-hand. Can Mr. Putin make it any clearer? FA and FO.

One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. What’s your next move, “Joe”? ICBMs? I think we all know what that means. Let me tell you a few things about this Russia Russia Russia business. It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary.

Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores. BlackRock, Haliburton, and many other companies lined up to benefit from this scheme, which is now a smoldering wreck. Mr. Trump, wants to terminate that stupid, wicked project. Going back even further, to 2016, he proposed to try making friends with Russia. The benefits were obvious, principally, keeping them on our side against the rising power of the CCP.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

It’s been thirty years since the fall of the Soviet Union. It was a bold political experiment running a society by means contrary to human nature, and after an impressively long run, seven decades, if finally flopped, bankrupt in every sense of the word. It took a while for the dazed Russians to get their minds right after that long misadventure, but they have come around to embrace the idea of being a normal European nation. That is, a country whose citizens are at liberty to do business, travel freely, enjoy a rule-of-law (rather than a rule of despotic personalities). That is, much like we are supposed to be. Surely, Russia under Mr. Putin has its imperfections, at least as viewed through lens of America’s Woke-cryptoMarxist-Neocon/psychopath lens. Mainly, it won’t do what we tell it to do: roll over and die! But as often is the case with illnesses of the mind, the American cabal projects its own perverse thoughts on its adversary.

Rather, America acts like we want to take over the world. Hegemony: power over everyone and everything, an increasingly sick notion, given how things are going in this world. Sorry to tell you: that dream is over. Since 1990, Russia has tried like hell to establish normal relations with western Europe and the USA. Our blob wouldn’t allow that. Russia even asked to join NATO some years ago. Russia wanted to trade with Germany, France, Italy, and the rest. Our blob had to stop that. Finally, the blob geniuses decided that they could put Russia out of business altogether, bust it up to make it helpless, and then own all its mineral and energy resources. Ukraine would be the means to accomplish that — plus we’d end up with all the goodies in Ukraine, too: the breadbasket lands, the ores.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 9 | View Replies] To: MtnClimber My conversation with Microsoft's Co-Pilot AI, starts with a quote from this article (my questions in Bold):One more sortie of ATACMS or British Storm Shadows and the satellite targeting and navigation installations for these missiles will get vaporized, along with the NATO member technicians on duty there. The situation with ATACMS and British Storm Shadow missiles is indeed tense. Ukraine has recently used both types of missiles in their conflict with Russia. The ATACMS missiles, provided by the U.S., have been used to strike targets deep within Russian territory. Similarly, British Storm Shadow missiles have also been deployed by Ukraine, causing significant damage. The use of these advanced missiles has escalated the conflict, and there are concerns about potential retaliatory actions. It's a complex and dangerous situation, with high stakes for all involved.Are NATO member technicians on the ground in Ukraine firing them? There have been reports and discussions about NATO personnel being present in Ukraine for various roles, including arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these personnel are not typically involved in direct combat roles or operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles2. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for support and advisory purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles.Well, certain web sites are making that claim, and Putin has also. What hard evidence, if any, is there? There have been various claims and reports about NATO personnel being involved in Ukraine, but the evidence for direct involvement in firing missiles like ATACMS or Storm Shadows is not clear. NATO personnel are known to be in Ukraine for roles such as arms control, intelligence operations, and military training. However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!Well, the reason I ask is if there was, but that was being hidden from the public, wouldn't that mean NATO has already gone to war with Russia? If NATO personnel were directly involved in operating weapons systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadow missiles in Ukraine, it could indeed be seen as a significant escalation and potentially an act of war. However, there is no verified evidence to support claims that NATO technicians are directly involved in firing these missiles. NATO's official stance is to provide support and advisory roles rather than direct combat involvement. The situation is complex, and there are many layers of information and misinformation. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.OK, but if the Russians believe it is true, how screwed are we? If Russia believes that NATO personnel are directly involved in operating these missiles, it could indeed escalate tensions significantly. Such a belief might lead to retaliatory actions, which could further complicate the already tense situation. However, it's important to note that there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO personnel are directly involved in firing these missiles. The situation remains complex and fluid, with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. It's crucial to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of the involvement.Are there any US or NATO spokesman saying that it is a lie? Yes, there have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's important to rely on verified sources and official statements to understand the true nature of NATO's involvement. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!So Putin is not a verified source or his words are not official statements? Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials. This helps to get a more balanced and comprehensive understanding of the situation. What are your thoughts on this?I wish Biden would unequivocally declare that no NATO troops are used to launch missiles or help get them to their targets. There have been statements from NATO and U.S. officials addressing these claims. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has not made any statements suggesting that NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to operate missiles. Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows. The official stance remains that NATO's role is to provide support, training, and equipment to Ukraine, rather than direct involvement in military operations. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating. If you have any specific concerns or need more details, feel free to ask!I think the ambiguity is not helping calm all sides into not escalating. You're right, ambiguity can often lead to misunderstandings and escalate tensions. Clear and unequivocal communication from all parties involved is crucial to avoid further escalation and to maintain stability. It's important for leaders to address these concerns directly and transparently to prevent any misinterpretations that could lead to conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask.This is like Japan and the USA in late 1941. The tension and uncertainty you're feeling are understandable. The situation between NATO and Russia is indeed complex and fraught with potential for escalation. Clear communication and diplomacy are crucial to avoid misunderstandings and prevent conflict. If you have any other questions or need more information, feel free to ask. 13 posted on 11/25/2024 9:48:35 AM PST by Alas Babylon!

Additionally, U.S. President Joe Biden has consistently stated that no U.S. troops would be deployed to Ukraine. These statements aim to clarify the misinformation and assure that NATO's involvement remains supportive and advisory rather than direct combat.I understand the “no troops”, but that could mean just no army or air force units. My worry is advisers woring directly to attack Russia. Has anyone disputed this directly? NATO and U.S. officials have consistently stated that their involvement in Ukraine is limited to support and advisory roles, rather than direct combat operations. For example, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and U.S. President Joe Biden have both emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine to engage in combat. While there have been claims and concerns about NATO advisers being directly involved in attacks, these have not been substantiated with verified evidence.

Putin's statements are indeed official and carry significant weight, especially in the context of international relations. He has made several public statements warning that NATO's involvement in Ukraine, particularly with long-range missile systems, would be seen as direct participation in the conflict. However, it's important to note that these statements are part of a broader narrative and should be considered alongside other verified sources and official statements from NATO and U.S. officials.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this situation?You keep saying that, HOWEVER, saying no troops are being sent is not the same as advisers on the ground helping Ukraine missile forces. You're right, and it's an important distinction. While official statements have emphasized that no NATO troops are being sent to Ukraine for combat roles, there have been concerns and claims about advisers and support personnel being involved in various capacities. However, there is no verified evidence to support the claim that NATO advisers are directly involved in operating or targeting missile systems like ATACMS or Storm Shadows.

However, these roles are generally supportive and not directly involved in combat operations. The claims about NATO technicians operating these missiles have been made by some sources, including Russian officials, but there is no verified evidence to support these claims. The presence of NATO personnel is primarily for advisory and support purposes, rather than direct involvement in firing missiles. It's a complex situation with a lot of information and misinformation circulating.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 8 Best Beverage Dividend Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against best beverage stocks that pay dividends. Retail sales rebounded significantly in October as the economy remained stable and consumers overcame worries about a port strike and other challenges that had dampened sales in September, according to the CNBC/NRF Retail Monitor. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay noted that consumer spending picked up again in October, supported by job growth and increased wages throughout the year. He observed that inflation remained largely confined to services, with prices for some retail goods even declining. Shay indicated that October’s sales performance had laid a solid foundation for the holiday shopping season to begin on a positive note. When we examine specific sectors, we see that grocery and beverage stores experienced a 0.87% increase on a seasonally adjusted month-over-month basis and a 3.76% rise year-over-year without seasonal adjustments. The food and beverage industry faced significant challenges during the pandemic. While in-home consumption surged, out-of-home dining virtually ceased, leading to a substantial decline in business and severely impacting the sector. Since then, the industry has undergone numerous transformations and is now in a recovery phase. According to a Market Research report, the global food and beverages market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% between 2022 and 2027. The market's growth is being driven by shifting consumer habits, out-of-town retail parks, and retail stores.

In 2023, spending on out-of-home cold coffee, such as iced coffee, cold brew, and frozen coffee drinks, reached $17.7 billion—more than double the $8.5 billion spent in 2016, according to the food service research firm Technomic. Additionally, the National Coffee Association (NCA) reported that coffee consumption outside the home has returned to pre-pandemic levels as people resume visiting coffee shops and workplaces. Over a third of consumers who drank coffee on a given day did so away from home, marking the highest rate since January 2020, as highlighted in the NCA's National Coffee Data Trends report. Consumer behavior plays a critical role in shaping any industry, and the beverage sector is no exception. This industry is adapting to evolving preferences, with more Americans seeking alternatives to alcohol. Beverage companies emphasizing the health benefits of their products are striving to tap into this trend. According to data insights firm NCSolutions, over 40% of Americans aim to reduce their alcohol consumption in 2024, an increase from 34% the previous year. Among Generation Z, this figure rises to 61%, compared to 40% in 2023 who expressed similar intentions. Technology stocks have been the standout performers this year, with gains of nearly 29%. While food and beverage stocks haven't seen exceptional growth, the Food & Beverage index, which represents companies across various sub-industries in the sector, has still delivered a modest year-to-date return of 7.5%. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen by approximately 14%. Pixabay/Public Domain To select the best beverage stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900 hedge funds as of Q3 2024 and picked companies that are primarily involved in the production and distribution of a wide variety of liquid refreshments, including soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, coffee, tea, bottled water, energy drinks, fruit juices, sports and nutritional drinks, and dairy-based beverages. From that list, we selected 10 companies that pay dividends to shareholders and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds having stakes in them as of Q3 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast, another extra special guest, Corey Hoffstein, is one of these really fascinating quants who has just a really interesting background. Not only did he stand up a research shop from a dorm room in college and started selling model portfolios to fund managers, but eventually created a suite of first mutual funds. And then ETFs really pioneering the concept of return stacking. People have described that in the past as portable alpha. He, he does some really, really interesting research and gets deep into the weeds on things like market structure, liquidity cascades, what really drives returns, how much should you be focused on alpha versus beta. But most fascinating of all, he is one of those rare quants who has the ability to take complex, sophisticated, quantitative topics and make them very understandable for the average investor. I, if you are at all interested in concepts of things like portable alpha or return stacking, or just want to know how a quant looks at the world of investing and tries to decide where there are opportunities. I found this conversation to be fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, newfound research and returned, stacked etf suites. Corey Hoffstein. Welcome to Bloomberg. Corey Hoffstein: Barry, thank you for having me. Very excited to be here. Barry Ritholtz: I’m excited to chat with you about things besides watches and cars and real estate. Let’s talk a little bit about your background. You get a, a BS in computer science from Cornell, a master’s in computational finance from Carnegie Mellon. Quantitative investing was, was that the plan from the beginning? Corey Hoffstein: Absolutely not really. It was not. No, I grew up in the Super Nintendo generation, so I thought as a young man that I was gonna make video games for a living Barry Ritholtz: Get out. Really? Corey Hoffstein: I did. And I taught myself to program when I was 12 and all throughout late middle school and high school, I was programming games for my Game boy and developing game engines for the computer. I, I wrote my own programming language. I really thought I was on a path to go make video games for a living. What, Barry Ritholtz: What was your game of choice as a kid? Corey Hoffstein: I was a big Zelda fan. Okay. I really was. And it was, it’s funny, I, I haven’t played video games in probably over a decade. Barry Ritholtz: Same. And the really funny thing is, so here’s the age difference. I remember sneaking out of high school during lunch with a buddy to go to the mall to first start playing Space Invaders, then Galaxa, then Missile Command, like these are all retro games. And then when I started as a trader, Tuesday nights, the quote server would be taken offline and it would become a quake server. Ah. And we spent, and you just get lost in it, and suddenly it’s 11 o’clock, and oh my God, I missed dinner. But that’s really fascinating. Why didn’t you become a game programmer? Corey Hoffstein: As, as you mentioned, I ended up at Cornell for computer science, and as much as I love the curriculum, I looked around at the people I was in my classes with and I said, oh, I don’t, I don’t know if this is whom I wanna spend with whom I wanna spend all of my time. Barry Ritholtz: That’s hilarious. Corey Hoffstein: In a cubicle, as it turns out, I like talking to people, I like interacting. And I just sort of grew and evolved from there. This was the era, 2005, 2006, all of my friends were looking to get banking roles. Everyone wanted to go work on Wall Street. And so I sort of caught the bug and saw, oh, there’s this really interesting thing I’m learning about called Quant. Right. And I, and I really like the application of math and statistics and computer science to markets. And I just caught the bug. And that’s where I said, okay, I think that’s where I wanna spend my career. And so graduating right into 2009, right out of the financial crisis, I said, I don’t think I’m gonna get a job. Let me see if I can go to grad school, continue this education. And that’s how I ended up at Carnegie Mellon. Barry Ritholtz: So let’s talk a little bit about the timing there. You’re Cornell oh six to oh nine, you’re Carnegie Mellon, oh nine to 11, but you start newfound research in oh eight. Were you, what was this a dorm room launch? Was this the next Dell computer? Corey Hoffstein: It was, it was very accidental. I never actually intended to still be running this business 16 years later. Truthfully, I named it newfound after a lake. My family used to visit in New Hampshire. It was truly a throwaway name. But in college I was working on some quantitative research models and happened stance. We were talking about luck earlier, got introduced to a local asset manager outside of Boston who saw what I was working on and said, this is really interesting. Would you license these models to me? I’m a broke college student who needs some beer money. Oh yeah, for sure. And and he said, I, I don’t have any cash to pay you with, but I’ll pay you in basis points. I did not know what a basis point was. I said, sure, man, whatever. I’m going to grad school. But Barry Ritholtz: By the way, most college kids pay for beer money through quantitative model development. That’s right. I mean, I think that’s a generational thing. And and why not?Not? Corey Hoffstein: I didn’t know what a basis point is. [That’s amazing.] I didn’t, I didn’t even know what a basis point was. And so we, we get this contract written and I go off to grad school assuming I would go work at a big bank doing sales and trading in some quant role. And he ended up running a strategy based on my research models that went from zero to several billion dollars, Barry Ritholtz: Get outta here. Even a couple of basis points on that. It’s a lot of beer money. Corey Hoffstein: It started to add up. Yeah. And, and it afforded me the opportunity. What was interesting is this was a big transition time in Wall Street where Yeah, a lot of the jobs I had been trained for when I, when I went through that graduate school program, who by the way, today looks nothing like the program I went through, it was all about pricing credit default swaps. Right? No one trades credit default swaps anymore. So I’m looking on the other side of this and I’m seeing all the jobs I wanted to apply for disappear. Right. And my father was an entrepreneur. I always had the idea that I would do something entrepreneurial. And I said, you know, young, naive, brash, 20-year-old. I said, well, I got a business that’s already paying me. Why don’t I just keep doing this? Right. And that’s where the journey began, Barry Ritholtz: Right Outta grad school. You just continue. You, did you even look at jobs? Did you apply places? I did not. You just said, ah, I could be my own boss. Corey Hoffstein: That’s what happens in your early twenties. You have that sort of brash arrogance that, Barry Ritholtz: That, that’s amazing. So, so you have this one set of models, it’s generating revenue. What was the next step? How did you turn this into a sort of quirky idea that is creating a little bit of revenue into an actual business? Corey Hoffstein: Yeah. So that was, that was a lot of stumbling in the dark, candidly. So on the other side of that contract is I got paid basis points, but it, I had a confidentiality agreement with this firm. And so as those assets grew, I’m now a young 20-year-old going out trying to go to other asset managers saying, Hey, I have this quantitative research. It helps power billions of dollars of decisions. And they’d say, well, who are your clients? Can’t. And I’d say, I can’t tell you. Barry Ritholtz: You gotta trust me on this Corey Hoffstein: And you gotta trust me. And as you know, again, a young 20-year-old, I’m sure I got laughed out of a lot of offices. And there’s a very long story here that’s better told over beers. But as it turns out, the reason that asset manager was able to raise so much money was because they had taken signals. I had sent them, turned them into ran, ran a back test, miscalculated that back test, and then ran around telling everyone it was a live strategy. Barry Ritholtz: That sounds like trouble. Corey Hoffstein: So throughout 2013, I was doing a lot of this research. I had sort of started to move into more sub advisory index provider roles, and all of a sudden SEC comes knocking. And by the way, at that point, that client was at $13 billion. Wait, Barry Ritholtz: So you are, you just provide the model. You have nothing whatsoever to do with how they market it, who the clients are, how they run it. It’s just a model. Corey Hoffstein: Yes. And by and by the agreement, I wasn’t, I wasn’t even supposed to be in the equation at all. Right. I’ve never been introduced. No one knew who I was. Somehow no one in due diligence ever asked them about any of this. Right. And so, $13 billion firm gets a knock from the SEC and the SEC says, okay, you’re calling us a live track record. Show us the auditing, Barry Ritholtz: Show us the trades track record, and, and it only goes back to oh nine. And Corey Hoffstein: You can imagine everything unraveled from there. And so in 2013, I’m staring down my largest client, all of a sudden it becomes obvious. This is fraud right now, by the way. 00:09:05 [Speaker Changed] How, how did the fund actually perform when it was live 00:09:09 [Speaker Changed] Quite well, right? I mean, that’s why it gathered so many assets. 00:09:12 [Speaker Changed] So, so that’s the crazy thing is what led the s ’cause normally the SEC gets called in when somebody’s losing money and they’re pissed. Not, Hey, we’re making money, but I’m not sure I love this marketing. 00:09:23 [Speaker Changed] Just a routine exam. You know, you run an RIA, the SEC just comes knocking every once in a while to say, Hey, just wanna make sure the compliance program’s all set up. It happens every once in a, every couple years. And, and at that point, they were due for their routine exam. They had gone from nothing to 12 billion. It was time for the SEC to come Right. Kick the tires with what should have been a very routine. Right. This is, you know, dot the i’s cross the T’s. Oh, no. Turns out you’ve got a fabricated track record that by the way, you miscalculated your back test and it’s an inflated, fabricated track record. 00:09:52 [Speaker Changed] Well, that’s really a problem. Isn’t that’s really a problem. Did they ever come knocking to you and said, Hey, we, 00:09:58 [Speaker Changed] It wasn’t just knocking. ’cause what happened is, 00:10:01 [Speaker Changed] Ooh, that subpoena is frightening, isn’t it? 00:10:03 [Speaker Changed] It was a subpoena. Yeah. And as a 20, I guess I must have been 23, 24 at the time, getting a subpoena from the SEC 00:10:09 [Speaker Changed] That’ll get put. That’ll wake you up. Yeah, 00:10:11 [Speaker Changed] That’ll, that’ll definitely wake, 00:10:12 [Speaker Changed] Wake you the ice you up coffee. Go right to the subpoena. 00:10:14 [Speaker Changed] And, and the gentleman who ran the firm that was my client was, was so convincing to the industry that he had done nothing wrong. Right. During the SEC investigation, he grew the business from 12 billion to 25 billion. 00:10:29 [Speaker Changed] Get it outta here. Yes. Wow. 00:10:31 [Speaker Changed] Yes. And so during that time, 00:10:32 [Speaker Changed] And that’s even more basis points. 00:10:34 [Speaker Changed] Oh, they stopped paying me at that point. Oh, they did. They stopped paying me, needless to say, the SEC ran a, a very aggressive investigation. I got subpoenaed, my life, got caught up in this SEC investigation. And I said, all, I’ve got two choices. I can leave this industry and go, go move to Silicon Valley. I got a computer science degree. Right. There’s some good stuff going on out there. Or I can plant my flag and prove to people I did nothing wrong. Right. There’s quality research here. And so that’s actually when I started blogging, I started kidding. Writing a weekly research, quantitative research report just to say, Hey, look, there’s, there’s something real here. Had a couple employees. We started publishing our research, getting out there more, and slowly used that to transition to be, you know, we were more active on social media. Started the podcast a few years later, just try to try to say there’s no, there’s nothing, there’s no fraud here. We were not the problem. 00:11:29 [Speaker Changed] Hey, it’s just the model. And we gave, we sold it to them. Exactly. The problem is what they did with it. How did the SEC investigation resolve with you guys? 00:11:38 [Speaker Changed] No issues. Right, right. So they, they, I mean, anyone who’s gone through this, so I suspect the vast majority of people have not. You eventually, the SEC never says you’re 00:11:46 [Speaker Changed] Coming. All right. You’re okay. They just stopped 00:11:48 [Speaker Changed] Calling. They, they stopped calling. And, and then you ask for a letter that says, Hey, can I get some resolution? And they say, we’ve determined we’re, you know, we’re not pursuing further inquiries into you. And so I’ve got a nice letter framed from the SEC that, that says precisely that. So 00:12:02 [Speaker Changed] Framed, framed on the wall. 00:12:03 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The, the other side did not end so well, as you can imagine. They were bankrupt a year later and $25 billion flew out to the wind. 00:12:12 [Speaker Changed] Wow. So that’s an amazing story. I had no idea about that. I wanna just go back a little bit to Carnegie Mellon. You graduate with this quantitative background. You went into your own shop. What did your classmates do? Where did they go? 00:12:31 [Speaker Changed] They went all over. A lot of them went to big banks. A lot of ’em went to buy side hedge funds. Some of them went to, to places like Citadel to trade. Right. Become options market makers. I mean, they really, when you, when you talk about what is quant, right? What you, what you learn, you learn everything from how to price structured products. You learn the math that can help you with, with market making operations. You learn the technology. It’s a really broad field. And so what ends up happening is people just sort of scatter to all parts of the industry. 00:13:05 [Speaker Changed] Huh. I know you are not especially keen on back testing. 00:13:10 [Speaker Changed] Well, now, now definitely not keen on it. 00:13:12 [Speaker Changed] So here’s the question. How much did this experience affect the way you look at back testing? Honest back testing, really looking at the numbers versus exaggerating returns and, and making up the claim that something’s live when it’s not. 00:13:29 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I think my view of this has changed over time. I, I’ve become, I’ve always been very skeptical of, of back tests for all the reasons quants normally are. I think quants perhaps did a disservice to this industry and making it easier to show people back tests. Right. I have a theory unfounded, no one’s ever confirmed this, but I always sit around and wonder why does BlackRock pay MSCI so much money in indexing, you know, when BlackRock could clearly run all these strategies themselves. You, you 00:13:58 [Speaker Changed] Have a historical track record. Well, and it’s, that’s life really. 00:14:01 [Speaker Changed] Finra, finra, one of the other regulators Right. Prohibits you from showing a back test for a mutual fund or an ETF. But if it’s an indexed etf, which is a regulatory term, if it’s truly an indexed ETF, you are allowed to show the index, presuming it’s a third party index provider. So what BlackRock can do is say, this is an indexed ETF, it’s indexed to this MSCI or s and p smart beta product. And by the way, here’s the 30 year back test. And of course, that back test outperforms the market. Right. And I think that helped fuel the smart beta boom of the 2000 tens. And, and so I don’t think there’s anything implicitly wrong with back test if done well, I think the problem is back test became a marketing tool. 00:14:40 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. No doubt about it. And the SEC rules on back tests have just changed to the point that when I show a chart of the s and p 500 or, or VTI, like, I have to be really circumspect in how I describe it. Here’s how the total market return has performed over the past 30 years. That’s about the most I can say. Versus, Hey, you know, if you have a portfolio with a B, C de, here’s what you can expect. Like the pushback we’ve gotten on some marketing materials kind of surprised me. I understand they’re trying to create like a big no fly zone to avoid the sort of problems that the guy who abused your model did. But it’s kind of like, aside from the fact that past performance isn’t necessarily relevant to what the world’s gonna look like in the future, that’s, that’s a very different thing than, wait, I can’t just show a chart. I don’t 00:15:38 [Speaker Changed] Understand. Well, and, and I’m sympathetic to the, to the point that a lot of clients, whether they’re advisory clients or or my clients who would be advisors and institutions will ask the question, okay, well how would this have performed during these different market stress scenarios? And that’s what a back test would, in theory show you. And not being able to tell them or show them makes it harder for them to do due diligence to understand how it may have behaved. Right. And so there are ways in which I think back tests can be used appropriately. I understand the blanket no from FINRA and, and I understand the SEC’s position on it because it can be used in such a manipulative fashion. Right. But I do think it makes it, 00:16:16 [Speaker Changed] It’s easy to abuse, 00:16:17 [Speaker Changed] It makes it hard to do thoughtful due diligence in certain cases. 00:16:21 [Speaker Changed] I’m trying to get a sense of how your investment philosophy developed. I recall reading that you were developing a stock screener and you were focused on value-based models and discovered that they would get just as shellac during downturns as the growth stocks did. Tell us a little bit about how screening led you to develop your philosophy and what your thoughts are on, on momentum and trend. 00:16:49 [Speaker Changed] So, very early on in my career, again, I was doing a lot of this on my own. I, I sort of self discovered factor investing and was basically using statistical screen screens to try to find cohorts of stocks that would behave in different ways. 00:17:06 [Speaker Changed] Now. And just to clarify, when you say factor investing, we’re really talking about pharma french factors, not necessarily smart beta type stuff or 00:17:14 [Speaker Changed] Both? All of the above. All, all of the above. I didn’t, I didn’t even know what it was at the time. I was just trying to say, Hey, if I find a basket of stocks and all the CEOs are bald, how does that behave? Right? Versus, oh, these all have positive momentum. 00:17:26 [Speaker Changed] I I got a great ticker for that ETS Yeah. 00:17:28 [Speaker Changed] Bald. I don’t think anyone’s used it yet. So I was looking at all sorts of things, which is sort of classical equity quant type work. And I’ve always sort of had a tilt just personality wise towards capital preservation. And there was one conversation very early in my career, this was actually 2007, where I was interviewing with an asset manager and I pre-meeting, asked them what they thought of the market. And he gave me the most bearish prognostication I had ever heard. And again, I was very early in my career, I didn’t live through the.com fallout from a career perspective. I said to him, well, what are you gonna do? And he was a small cap value manager. And he said, nothing, my job is to provide small cap value exposure. If it’s not appropriate for, for the client, the financial advisor should make that decision. 00:18:17 And so I said, well, I talked to some financial advisors and they said, well, how in the world should we know when to take our clients outta small cap value? That’s the manager’s job. And I said, well, in my opinion, no one’s protecting my capital here. And so I started really looking into statistical models that I thought could help preserve capital on. The downside value had worked incredibly well in the.com era. But my, my thought there was there was nothing inherent in value itself that was necessarily protective in terms of the type of crisis that could unfold. And so I ended up discovering trend following and following in love with trend following, which is the idea that, and it sounds naive, but as prices have historically gone up, they tend to persist in that direction. Or if prices start to fall, they tend to persist in that direction. And there’s a little bit of a statistical edge you can use there to try to really clip your downside risk. 00:19:11 [Speaker Changed] The, the challenge is always the transition from the uptrend to the downtrend, which is why you have portfolio managers and allocators arguing who’s responsible. The reality is nobody wants that job ’cause it’s thankless and practically impossible. Very few people seem to have come up with a formula that works from one cycle to the next. 00:19:33 [Speaker Changed] That’s absolutely right. There’s very few, I would argue probably no consistent predictors of, of any sort of economic or market cyclicality. What you have is maybe some statistical indicators that give you a slight bit of an edge. But when you talk about just a slight bit of an edge being played on, say a big position like the s and p 500 in your portfolio, right? And you’re only gonna play that edge realistically three or four times in your life. Right? That’s a very low breadth bet. That’s gonna have a really big impact. It’s just not smart on a math basis to do that. And it’s certainly not smart from a career risk perspective. 00:20:11 [Speaker Changed] I’m so happy you said that. ’cause I frequently find myself wanting to respond to these claims on Twitter, a sample set of three, who cares? You know how e every time you look at the history of recessions, hey, 20th century recessions, what is it? 12, 14 even that not a lot of numbers. And are you saying the recession in 2020 is similar to recession in the 1950s? It’s such a different world. The, you mentioned the.com implosion, the reason value held held up was that was such a, a sector collapse. What was the NASDAQ 100 down 81. 82% and the s and p 500 was down something like a fraction of that, I wanna say less than half. And then the Dow held up really well down 35%, something like that. 00:21:03 [Speaker Changed] Well, and if you go back to the history, it’s because most of those value stocks had already sold off 40 or 50% in 99. Right? Right. They were 00:21:10 [Speaker Changed] In the late nineties anyway. They did poorly while the money rolled into the big cap growth and, and technology media and telecom exploded. 00:21:21 [Speaker Changed] So this story came out that, oh, value is defensive because it has this valuation buffer to it 00:21:28 [Speaker Changed] In that one example. 00:21:30 [Speaker Changed] But people extrapolated that one example, right? They took a point and they drew a line. And then what happened in, in 2008? Well, most naive value portfolios are stuffed with financials. 00:21:42 [Speaker Changed] Right. 00:21:43 [Speaker Changed] And, and value just got destroyed. Right? 00:21:45 [Speaker Changed] So, so the obvious question to someone who makes that claim is, well, how did value do in the 1970s? Not especially, well look at the utilities, look at big oil companies. Well, but that was all about inflation. O okay. But you said this is so it’s a, it’s a hedge except when there’s inflation. What, what are the other exceptions that I always come back to the sample set of three sample set of five. I, I need a sample set of a, you know, let’s revisit this. In the year 3000 will have enough data Yeah. To be able to look at 00:22:15 [Speaker Changed] This. So, so I have sort of philosophical view on this, which is if I knew that value worked to protect my capital in every single recession, and I thought the market was efficient, then I shouldn’t be able to predict recessions. That’s right. Because if I can predict a recession and I know value works, then I’ve outperformed the market. So, you know, there’s, there’s an inherent limit here based on how efficient you think the market is. And I’ll tell you, I, I think the market’s pretty darn efficient, 00:22:42 [Speaker Changed] Mostly kind of sorta of eventually efficient. It gets there event, what’s the Benjamin Graham quote in the short run? It’s a voting machine, but in, in, in the long run it’s a wing machine. Yep. That’s the mostly efficient, eventually efficient market hypothesis. So, so given that, let, let’s talk a little bit about things like portable alpha. You, you’ve done a lot of work in this, a lot of research. First, give us a quick definition of isolating beta and alpha. What does portable alpha mean 00:23:14 [Speaker Changed] If you’re all right with it? I’m actually gonna answer this in a roundabout fashion. Go ahead. By, by saying what problem are we trying to solve here first and foremost, right? And, and the problem we’re trying to solve with terms like portable alpha or return stacking is what I would call the funding problem of diversification. It’s a bit of a mouthful. So what do I mean by that? Most clients, whether they’re individuals or institutions, have some sort of benchmark, a policy portfolio, some strategic asset allocation that they start with. They’re typically not starting with just a blank piece of paper. It’s Mr. And, and Mrs. Jones, you are 60, 40 investors, 60% stocks, 40% bonds. But we think that we want to go beyond that and introduce diversifying assets or diversifying strategies. It’s gonna use gold as an example. Well, to put gold in the portfolio, it’s not, it’s not just addition. Diversification is a problem of addition through subtraction. 00:24:11 [Speaker Changed] What are you selling? In order to buy the gold 00:24:12 [Speaker Changed] I need to make room. And that creates two problems. The first is it creates a return hurdle problem, whatever I’m selling. That gold in this example needs to outperform to have that portfolio or at least keep up with over the long run for that portfolio to not under underperform the benchmark. Right? So it creates a fer 00:24:32 [Speaker Changed] Rate. So if you do that, so if you do that, you’ve, even if you’ve gotten the same performance, you’ve reduced the risk ’cause through the addition of, of a diversifying asset. 00:24:41 [Speaker Changed] Right? But there’s a risk there. Let’s say I think gold is gonna keep up with stocks over the long run. So I sell my stocks to make room for gold and it doesn’t, turns out my forecast is wrong. Well, there’s a real opportunity cost there, right? So you’ve got, you’ve got a modeling hurdle rate that you need to figure out when you’re adding diversifiers. The second is behavioral. And this is where most people understand stocks and bonds better than they understand alternatives or alternative strategies. Alternatives and alternative strategies tend to be less tax efficient, more opaque. And so just like stocks can have their lost decades, alternatives often have their lost decades. And people are very unwilling to stick with those diversifying alternatives during lost decades. Which means that when the diversification benefits eventually come around their performance chasing. And so you see these huge, what are called behavior gaps in the returns of alternative investment strategy categories because investors aren’t sticking with them. So the return that they realize what’s called the investor return tends to be hundreds of basis points behind the actual investment return. So the question is, how do we solve this? Well, it turns out institutions have solved this problem for 40 years using this concept of portable alpha, which is to say, well, instead of making room in the portfolio, can we use some financial engineering to take that alternative and just layer it on top of our portfolio? 00:26:07 [Speaker Changed] In other words, you’re, you’re using the underlying 60 40 as a basis for borrowing in order to add a different asset class on top 00:26:17 [Speaker Changed] It. Yeah. I think that actually the easiest way for most people to understand this without getting into the, the world of derivatives like futures and swaps is, is to think about buying a house. Let’s save you a million dollars and you wanna buy a million dollar house. There’s really two ways you can do that. You can just go buy the house for cash and then over time your return is just equal to the return of the house. Or you can go to the bank and get a mortgage, put $200,000 down, get an $800,000 mortgage, you’re gonna get the return of the house minus whatever the cost of financing is. And then you’re gonna have $800,000 in cash with which you can do whatever. If you were to take that $800,000 in cash cash and invest it in say, mortgage backed securities, you’d probably offset your cost of financing and your return there would be equal to your return of just buying the house, ignoring taxes. 00:27:07 But if I were to take that $800,000 and invest it and say gold, well now my return is gonna be equal to the return of the house minus the mortgage plus gold. I’ve effectively stacked the return of gold on top of my house. Same con, we do the same concept in institutional portfolio management in portable alpha, but instead of using a mortgage, you use derivatives like futures and swaps. And instead of replacing a house, you’re replacing exposure like the s and p 500 or treasuries, where historically it’s been really hard to beat the market. And so it’s not worth putting capital at work there. 00:27:44 [Speaker Changed] So in other words, you’re not owning the s and p 500, you’re owning a derivative that gives you the right to purchase the s and p 500 at a specific price. That’s a fraction of what owning all 500 stocks would cost. And then you take that money, that capital and buy other diversifiers and theoretically other holdings that’ll generate above market returns. 00:28:05 [Speaker Changed] Exactly. So you could say instead of buying a million dollars of the s and p 500, I’m gonna take $50,000, use it as cash collateral to buy s and p 500 futures, a million dollars of s and p 500 futures, which will give me the total return. So 00:28:20 [Speaker Changed] That’ll be equivalent. You’ll get the same minus whatever the cost of the derivative 00:28:24 [Speaker Changed] Minus whatever the cost of the derivative is, the embedded cost of financing. And then I can take the rest of that capital and invest it wherever I want. Now you have to be careful here, right? This isn’t a free lunch. You need to think about the operational risks. You need to think about the diversification. This is implicitly leverage. Leverage is a tool that accentuates both the good and the bad. Right? We want to accentuate the benefits of diversification, not double down on the same risks. My 00:28:48 [Speaker Changed] Immediate, my immediate thought was, Hey, why can’t I take that derivative and go, all right, if I, if it’s gonna cost me 50 K, why can’t I go two x or three x or four x? 00:29:00 [Speaker Changed] And people do that, right? Right. And 00:29:02 [Speaker Changed] Which is great until it’s not, 00:29:04 [Speaker Changed] Which is great until it’s not. Right. And so for us, when we think about these concept of portable alpha and return stacking, we think there are incredibly efficient ways to get diversification into your portfolio to get alternative return streams that can both enhance returns and potentially reduce risk. But you need to be really careful about what you’re introducing, particularly because during a liquidity crisis, you tend to see correlations go to one. And you need to be aware of the leverage risk that’s embedded. 00:29:33 [Speaker Changed] So oh 8, 0 9, that sort of portable alpha probably didn’t do great. 00:29:38 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. So let’s talk about oh 8, 0 9, okay. And let’s talk about why we don’t call this portable alpha and why we’ve rebranded it as return stacking. Right? 00:29:45 This concept goes back to the 1980s with PIMCO and got really popular in the early two thousands. What institutions realized is they said, I mean, you know these stats, like the back of your hand, it is really hard to beat the s and p 500, right? If I have a, a bond benchmark and 40% of that is treasuries, how am I supposed to, what am I supposed to do with all that dead asset? Well, what I can do is I can use derivatives to get that exposure, either the s and p 500 or those treasuries, and then I’ll use my freed up cash and I’m gonna go invest in some hedge fund that I think is gonna give me uncorrelated alpha, right? Maybe the hedge fund does relative value volatility trading something with some sizzle, right? Right. And what’s interesting is, when you think about it, what the math does is I say, okay, I’m getting the s and p 500 beta and I’m stacking the return of this hedge fund on top. And now I can sort of, that’s why it’s called portable alpha. I can port the alpha of this hedge fund on top of the s and p 500 instead of fishing in the same pond as everyone else. But what happens during a crisis? 00:30:46 [Speaker Changed] Well, everybody has to raise capital. ’cause the, there’s anyone with leverage is starting to get margin calls, right? 00:30:52 [Speaker Changed] You have four big problems that happen in 2008. Your first problem is if you were stacking this stuff, porting it on top of the s and p 500 and the s and p 500, lost 50% from 2007 to the bottom in 2009 00:31:06 [Speaker Changed] 56 and change 00:31:07 [Speaker Changed] 56 and change, and you only posted 5%, 10% as collateral. See ya, you’re getting a margin call. So you did better if you stacked it on bonds, not so well if you stacked it on equity. So there, there’s one problem, folks who stacked it on equities were getting margin calls. Well, what do you do when you get a margin call? You rebalance your portfolio. Basically that’s, that’s what you have to do. So what they had, they went to, all the institutions went to the hedge funds and the hedge funds said, well, well, bad news, not only have we lost money too, but we’re gating redemptions, you can’t have your money back. So all of a sudden they try to rebalance to meet their margin calls. And what they had invested their cash in was not giving them their cash back. 00:31:48 [Speaker Changed] And nobody markets this as not portable alpha, 00:31:51 [Speaker Changed] Right? And so they can’t rebalance, they get the margin call, they lose the exposure to the beta. The last small wrinkle was a lot of this wasn’t done with exchange trade of futures. It was done with total return swaps with banks. And if your counterparty was Lehman Brothers, even if you handled things perfectly, where does your swap stand? Right? So as you can imagine, post 2008, this concept, which was I think if my, if I, if I’m correct, I think it was 25% of major US pensions and institutions were implementing portable alpha pre 2008. That, 00:32:23 [Speaker Changed] That large, that meant it 00:32:25 [Speaker Changed] Was a significant amount and at least 50% of it when surveyed were looking to implement portable alpha post 2008. I mean, I, I think it was called a synthetic risk grenade. I, it just, the reputation was destroyed. And 00:32:39 [Speaker Changed] Synthetic risk grenade that that’s a great band, a college club 00:32:43 [Speaker Changed] Band, absolutely rightly. Absolutely. And, and so like many things you lived through 2008, the language was right. No derivatives, no shorting, no leverage. I mean, that was on product brochures at that point, huh? People really didn’t want to talk about this stuff. And so it sort of disappeared except there are still institutions that are doing this and they figured out ways that are much better operationally or they figured out other ways to get the leverage. So for example, private equity, we’ve seen a huge increase in private equity. 00:33:19 [Speaker Changed] Trillions, literally trillions 00:33:20 [Speaker Changed] Private equity returns are basically just levered public equity returns. So instead of now me saying, let me get my leverage by getting a swap with a bank. I can take my public equity, get my leverage by taking my public equity, putting it in private equity. If I put 20 cents in, it looks like 30 cents of exposure and I can take some freed up capital and go invest in a hedge fund. Now I don’t ever get margin called anymore. Right? And PS on volatility laundering to steal a quote from Cliff Asness right? On the private side. And so people have figured out all these very clever ways, and I don’t mean clever in a bad way, but clever ways to keep portable alpha. ’cause it’s a great theoretical concept that just had implementation issues in 2008, right? To re-implement it very thoughtfully. And folks like Jonathan Glyden, who’s, who’s the CIO of Delta’s pension credits it for taking Delta’s pension from near bankruptcy to being overfunded Wow. In the last eight years. He, he gives full credit to portable alpha as being the reason why. 00:34:16 [Speaker Changed] No kidding. That that’s really, that’s really interesting. So you mentioned private equity, we’re not gonna talk about private credit or private debt, but it’s the same sort of continuum that cliff do I say complaints about volatility laundering? It’s like, hey, if you don’t get a daily mark or a tick by tick mark, volatility is irrelevant. It, we’ll, we’ll let you know what it’s worth sort of sort of thing. But you’ve talked about systematic alternatives. How do you define systematic alternatives and and is this the approach that anyone who wants exposures to alts should be using? 00:34:56 [Speaker Changed] So this is where I have my own strong personal view. So systematic alternatives to me are active investment strategies that are implemented in a non-discretionary manner, right? Probably the easiest way to describe systematic tends to be you’re using computer models to make the decisions and implement the decisions on an ongoing basis. These tend to be things like strategies that will trade futures contracts long and short based on different signals. Those signals might be trend signals, they might be carry signals, they might be value or momentum. And you’re going long and short things like oil or gold or Japanese yen, or you might be trading them as spreads against one another. And the idea of many of these sort of systematic macro strategies is to use these signals to capture a lot of the macro trends that are unfolding that, you know, your big sys, your big macro traders would try to capture in a more discretionary fund. What’s really, in my opinion, attractive and appealing about them is that they tend to be very uncorrelated to equities and bonds over the long run and particularly during a crisis because that’s where you often see the opportunities manifest for big strong moves, either positive and and flight to safety assets or the ability to short and profit from things that are crashing. 00:36:18 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Real really intriguing. The, this kind of ties in with a quote of yours that I, I want to ask later, but I might as well bring it back to this risk cannot be destroyed, only transforms explain. 00:36:34 [Speaker Changed] I don’t think I’m the only person who has said this. In fact, I once found a very similar quote in a, in an investment book from the 1980s. So this is not a quote that should be attributed to me. It’s a, it’s a general concept. And this is something I actually picked up in my graduate school studies when we were going through this education of pricing structured products. And what became apparent to me is in many ways the role of the financial industry is to identify risk, extract, risk, package it, price it, and transfer it to someone who’s willing to hold it. That is what we do when we raise a round of equity financing, right? You’re transferring some risk to someone else. So that risk is never really destroyed. Everything you do, whether it’s in your portfolio or investment decisions you make has a trade off. 00:37:23 And sometimes that, that trade off is just an opportunity cost. Sometimes it’s very explicitly higher volatility or lower downside. But everything we do has a trade off. There’s really no free launch, right? So when I look at something like portable alpha, I say, okay, the opportunity is I don’t have to try to beat the s and p 500 by picking stocks better, which has historically proven to be largely a, a fool’s errand, right? I can try to beat the s and p by saying, well, let me just get the s and p and I think gold is just gonna be positive over the, over my 30 year horizon. Lemme just stack some gold on top. Okay, that’s a win. Where’s the risk? Well, again, I’m introdu, I’m using leverage. Leverage isn’t inherently bad, but there are risks that I’ve now introduced for making this this trade off. And so yes, I get some diversification benefit, but there’s some liquidity risks and operational risks I really need to be aware of. And so it’s, to me, it’s, it’s trade-offs all the way down. 00:38:17 [Speaker Changed] And it’s worked out for places like Delta’s Pension Fund, 00:38:20 [Speaker Changed] Delta, there are a large number of public pensions as well that have used this Iers, Ohio Police and Fire Mosers. I mean, this is, I I wanna say like one of the, and what’s interesting is they don’t wanna talk about it. Oh really? Now the public pensions, it’s in all their public filings. You can go find this, right? But a lot of ’em don’t want to talk about it because either, Hey, this is our, this is what’s working for us and we need to beat our competitors. Right? Or again, it just portable Alpha has this bad label to it from 2008 and people don’t want to see it. And so they’re sort of finding ways to hide it. 00:38:59 [Speaker Changed] So, so we’ll talk about return stacking in a moment, but I wanna stay with some of the research that you did and let’s talk about liquidity Cascades whi which our mutual friend Dave Ick, has described a new lens on reality that I think people should be thinking about. I I, I love that, that description. Tell us what lis your liquidity cascade work found? 00:39:28 [Speaker Changed] So this was research I wrote in 2020 after coming out of the 2020 crisis. And it was born from the view that while there was a very real exogenous economic event that caused the market to sell off the day to day of what I was seeing happening in markets seemed to be endogenous. In other words, there was so much volatility and there was so much mispricing that didn’t seem to be a reaction to fundamental changes in the world. It just seemed to be, oh, there someone got liquidated and had to sell immediately, sell down a large levered position, and oh, there’s someone who couldn’t meet a collateral call. And so it made me take a step back and say, is there something about the market structure, the way market micro structure has evolved over time? That I don’t understand that there are some of these maybe lurking risks that we’ve implemented. And so there were three, I’m gonna call ’em conspiracy theories, for lack of a better word, that sure. That hang out there as to what has broken the market. 00:40:34 [Speaker Changed] Rationalizations rationalizations as 00:40:36 [Speaker Changed] Well as to Yeah. To be kind to the people that believe them, right? Right. And so the idea of the paper was, I was going to explore them as objectively as I could. The big three as I saw them, were fed intervention and a decade of zero interest rate policy causing people to take on too much risk, forcing them up the risk curve there was, and then obviously the, the concept of a fed put being tied in there. Then there was the rise of passive investing, right? Not just active versus passive in the type of price discovery that was happening, but, but truly how we trade indexed products at, at a market micro structural level was that changing stocks aren’t, you know, traded individually anymore. They’re traded as big baskets the way market makers are. There’s now really just a handful of big market makers rather than a large cohort. 00:41:23 Is that making markets more fragile and then the impact of derivatives, right? And I think we, we saw this as an example for people with, with GameStop where you had what I would call social gamma, this acceleration through Reddit of people buying outta the money call options to drive through, leverage the price higher because market makers were forced to hedge, right? Do you see that less specifically at GameStop? But do you see that at a grander scale when you have a huge amount of structured products being issued in, in Asia and Europe, or you have all these sort of uses of leverage among institutions? Have we gotten again, to a point of fragility and, and what liquidity cascades ultimately argued was anyone who thinks it, it was just their one thesis was probably wrong. 00:42:12 [Speaker Changed] It Now I want to just stop you for a second, interrupt you for a second and point out how often are big complicated situations? You know, Jacques, it’s that one thing. The world is much more complex than that. It’s, I remember looking at the causes of the financial crisis, I found dozens of ’em when the inflation surge took up in 21 and 22, like people wanted to point a finger, there were dozens of factors, including consumers who said, oh, that’s 50% more. Yeah, I don’t care. I’m gonna buy one. Consumers drove inflation as much as fiscal stimulus and all these other things. So how, how broad a conclusion did you reach that it’s never just one thing. 00:42:58 [Speaker Changed] I, to your point, I think people ha look into a world of incredibly complex non-linear relationships and they want a single linear explanation and it’s just not possible. All things, 00:43:10 [Speaker Changed] That’s the narrative fallacy, all of things. They want a clean little storyline in a bow, and that’s not how the universe works. 00:43:16 [Speaker Changed] All of these things interact. And so what I came outta the research piece with was not my view. I actually, the intro of the research piece, I said, I’m not gonna tell you what my view is. I’m gonna walk through this ob objectively as I can, and I’m gonna paint a picture at the end. It’s up to you as the reader to determine, for lack of a better phrase, how full a I am. Right. You know? 00:43:37 [Speaker Changed] So what did you find out with those three factors? So those three factors. So the fed, passive, and derivatives. 00:43:43 [Speaker Changed] So, so with those three factors, what I ultimately argued was that they operate in somewhat of a cycle, right? Fed zero interest rate policy is in many ways as explicitly stated by the Fed trying to move people up the risk curve, right? And as people moved up the risk curve, they were trying to find ways to, to harvest, yield, or save money, a move into things like passive a thing, a move into tax efficient vehicles like ETFs that were having a profound impact on the way things are traded in the market. You’re having a consolidation of market makers that leads to potentially increasing fragility or, or lack of liquidity. One of the things I thought was really interesting in, in March, 2020 is people always talk about market makers pull the plug, right? Right. Markets go crazy, they’re not running a charity, right? They’re gonna pull the plug when things aren’t going well. Right? 00:44:34 [Speaker Changed] Or at least lower their, their bid ass spread wide amounts of Yeah. They’re 00:44:37 [Speaker Changed] Gonna wide ’em out and they’re gonna thin, thin the order book volume. What I thought was interesting that people don’t often talk about is they’re actually capacity constrained. They have a balance sheet and there was, I think it was virtu during March, 2020 that actually was trying to raise $350 million just so they could keep making markets. Wow. Because they had run out of balance sheet. Wow. And you go, well actually, if these institutions are so important to the way our markets function, should they have a line to the Fed? 00:45:08 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that makes sense. Right? 00:45:10 [Speaker Changed] I’ve never heard anyone talk about it. Right. Right. But if you need them there, and there’s only three or four key market makers left, right? We need to make sure that they have healthy balance sheets. They’re, they’re systematically important institutions. They, 00:45:21 [Speaker Changed] They need a line somewhere. But the Fed’s mandate isn’t the smooth operation of the nice e the fed’s mandate is low inflation and full employment. 00:45:31 [Speaker Changed] So, so it’s a little, little struck, things like that. And, and again, I don’t think any of them are the cause, but you start to see some of this fragility creep up. And then as people right, are moving up the risk curve, they’re trying to find ways to also protect themselves. So they’re taking on more derivative strategies. We saw this massive boom in derivatives. We saw an adoption of things, a leverage strategies, risk parity and, and trend following and alternatives. And again, I don’t look at the boogeyman and say the market sells off and it’s risk parity’s fault. Right? But I look at it and I say, well, if risk parody and managed futures are selling off, and at the same time you have all these massively levered positions via puts that market makers are having to hedge all that can act in coordination to make a sell off more violent. And then sort of you go full circle to the fed stepping back in, lowering interest rates and, and kicking the whole cycle off. And so what I painted a picture of at the end, the reason I called it a liquidity cascade was I painted, it was this Mc Escher painting of, of sort 00:46:31 [Speaker Changed] Of famous, the waterfall. 00:46:33 [Speaker Changed] The waterfall, and then it magically climbs back up, right? And, and each part of this, it was the fed sort of is at the bottom of the waterfall and then flight to passive alternative sort of investment strategies. And the role of derivatives is at the top. And then some exogenous effect causes the market to crash. The crash becomes more violent fed steps in and the cycle kicks off again. 00:46:54 [Speaker Changed] So, so I, I have so many interesting questions for you. I’m kind of fascinated by your, the way you look at the market structure and what’s driving things. Because for me, the thing I’m looking at during those various processes is, and you referenced this earlier, are is all the individual decision making that takes place within the context of some financial stress, which as we’ve seen, tends to lead to cognitive challenges, behavioral problems, bad decision making. That human element in the middle tends to react, you know, it’s, it’s oversimplifying it, calling it fight or flight. But hey, that’s what your lizard brain is telling you. And it doesn’t matter if you’re running a billion dollar hedge fund or a pension fund, most people are gonna go through the same sort of panicky response. It’s really interesting that you’re focusing on the structure and how does the structure accommodate the bad behavior that we see 00:48:01 [Speaker Changed] You are right. That there is absolutely panic and lizard brain. And I don’t mean that in, in any sort of derogatory way. No. It’s, I think that their’s, theirs survival instincts, I actually don’t. It’s what it is. I don’t think they’re irrational. I think ity economics would argue you have to protect your capital to survive. What? So I’ll give an example here of where I think it’s a very specific example, sort of like the market maker’s example, but it’s something that happened in March, 2020 that is obviously wrong. And so Vanguard has their mutual funds and they offer ETFs as a share class of their mutual funds. So if you buy the mutual fund or the ETF, you are in theory getting the exact same return. ’cause it’s the same underlying pool of capital 00:48:43 [Speaker Changed] MI minus the tax advantage of the ETF. 00:48:46 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Yep. Their bond fund, during March, 2020, there was a two day period where the ETF traded, I believe it was up to a six or 7% discount to the mutual fund. That’s a little weird because it’s the exact same pool of capital, 00:49:02 [Speaker Changed] Right? So, so difference being, you can only trade mutual funds. At the end of the day you have to make a specific phone call to buy or sell or just reach out to whoever your custodian is. Yep. Whereas the ETFs are quoted 00:49:16 [Speaker Changed] Intraday. But even at the end of day, that discrepancy existed. It wasn’t just intraday. That was, that was the nav of the mutual fund versus the price of the ETF, 00:49:25 [Speaker Changed] Which had a higher trading volume. I’m gonna guess the ETF. 00:49:28 [Speaker Changed] The ETF certainly had a higher trading volume, but the, the underlying problem is that the bonds weren’t pricing. 00:49:37 [Speaker Changed] Oh, 00:49:37 [Speaker Changed] Okay. The bond market froze up. So when the mutual fund struck nab, at the end of the day, the nav was based on illiquid quotes of bonds that hadn’t traded. The ETF was basically saying, we don’t believe those quotes. We think the quotes should be much lower and we’re gonna price much lower. That’s right. There’s an interesting free option here. If you are a vanguard, 00:49:58 [Speaker Changed] Buy the ETF sell the mutual fund. 00:50:01 [Speaker Changed] Well, so it, because you can’t short a mutual fund, the way it would work is you would just always hold the mutual fund, wait for a crisis to come around and then jump from the mutual fund to the ET TF. Right? And you basically pick up this free spread based on the fact that the mutual fund is priced incorrectly. Stuff like that shouldn’t happen. 00:50:21 [Speaker Changed] Why do you say that? I, I always go back and forth with this. It’s not like computers and algorithms are running this, it’s irrational primates who are pushing the sell or buy button. 00:50:35 [Speaker Changed] Let me rephrase that. Things like that don’t happen except within a crisis. 00:50:38 [Speaker Changed] Okay. 00:50:39 [Speaker Changed] And they represent opportunity in a crisis because it is definitively mispriced. And if markets are efficient, there shouldn’t be mispricings like that. That’s a ver you shouldn’t have two things that are literally the exact same basket attached to the same underlying trading. 6% apart unless there’s true limits to arbitrage. And here you could argue you can’t short the mutual fund and buy the ETF. It’s hard to, it’s hard to arve that spread. But again, anyone trading any bond mutual fund could have jumped to Vanguard’s ETF, waited for the price appreciation and benefited. And again, in a crisis, there’s so much information coming at you, you might not have seen the opportunity. Right. But I look at a lot of little things like that and I go, markets mostly function correctly the vast majority of the time. But when you see that fragility pop up in a crisis, just is it pause for concern about how things are currently structured? Just a question. 00:51:32 [Speaker Changed] So two, 00:51:32 [Speaker Changed] I’m not saying it’s broken, 00:51:33 [Speaker Changed] So, so two responses to that. First, hey, give the Nobel Prize Committee props for offering a prize to Fama and Schiller the same year. It’s like, yeah, markets are mostly efficient Fama’s, right. Except when they’re not and schiller’s. Right? So that’s number one. Number two, I have a vivid recollection of sitting in a canoe with Jim Bianco in August of oh nine. And Bianca was the first person to describe the Fed response to the crisis as the first person I read. And this was really early, Hey, the Fed has made cash trash, they want you out of bonds, they want you into equities. Maybe it’s gonna take people a while to figure this out. But he was the first person to come up with Tina, right? And said, people are gonna have to stampede into equities. We’re gonna have a rally. And I said, it’s funny, I, I feel like the two of us are part of the six blind men describing the elephant. ’cause to your point about mispricing, I recall saying to him, I don’t know if you’re right, I like that theory, but my day job as a market historian is whenever stocks are cut in half in the United States, that’s a fantastic entry point. And if you bring up, well, what about 1929? Yeah. You didn’t get to the bottom till 32, but even down 50% on the way down to down 87% was still a great entry point. And that’s the exception. Every other time you’re cutting half the United States, you have to buy with both hands. 00:53:15 [Speaker Changed] Well, and what’s interesting to me there is you and Jim are discussing, I, I love your analogy with, with the blind men and the elephant. Jim is discussing a supply and demand concept, and you’re discussing a fundamental view. Right? 00:53:28 [Speaker Changed] I see the world through a behavioral lens. He’s seeing the world with, there’s the Fed is gonna cause a giant increase in demand for equities regardless of what the supply is. Right? And guess what happens to prices? 00:53:39 [Speaker Changed] And that’ll drive prices up. And it cau so many, many fundamental people, right? To say markets are overvalued missing the fact that you had another market structure change things like a 401k that was almost non-existent in the early two thousands, that several trillion dollars. Now you just have a stampede of buying every single month and people being forced into markets as a retirement vehicle, right? Right. That is their savings account, particularly when cash is returning nothing. And you have a, a dramatic shift in supply and demand. And by the way, over the same cycle you saw fewer IPOs, right? So you’re increasing demand into public equities with fewer, less supply. Right? 00:54:19 [Speaker Changed] At the same time, you have huge buybacks. Right? The, a lot of people don’t realize the Wilshire 5,000 is something like 3,400 stocks. It’s like totally misnamed. And the past 20 years have seen, yeah, there’s been a lot of stock issuance on in Silicon Valley, but overall the size of the share float that’s out there ha has shrunk another big, and I, I don’t know how where, what the end game of that is. Can you do that perpetually? 00:54:46 [Speaker Changed] So I don’t know what the end 00:54:46 [Speaker Changed] Deep, deep public eyes, public markets, 00:54:50 [Speaker Changed] I don’t know what the end game of, of any of this is, candidly. But I know you’ve had folks like Mike Green on, I think he was on even recently, who have strong views about what passive is view. I don’t have particularly strong views in any direction. I just like asking the questions. Maybe I lobb out a little grenade and let other people fight over it. But I think they’re fascinating and worthwhile questions because I think in many cases we just accept we have some of the most wonderfully functioning liquid markets in the world. We are truly privileged in the US to have what we have. I don’t think it hurts us to ask, are we overlooking anything? Right? Is is there any way in which we are unintentionally designing ourself into a state of fragility? It, 00:55:32 [Speaker Changed] It was pretty clear that people should have been asking that question in the mid two thousands and just had no idea the sort of misaligned incentives and, and really complex structures that along with some, the really, we, we got used to zero. But when Greenspan post nine 11 took rates down to under 2% for three years and under 1% for a year, that was really, we hadn’t seen anything like that for, for decades and decades and zero. No one knew how to deal with that. And then once we started seeing negative, you know, bonds, like, well, you lend us money and you pay us to hold it. Like, wait, what? And I, I think that caused all sorts of problems around the world and people just didn’t know how to contextualize. 00:56:24 [Speaker Changed] And to your point on behavior, I think something we talked about earlier where, where the sample size here is small. I think if you took the market to where it was a decade ago and and said, feds bringing rates back down, the world’s bringing rates back down, people would look backwards with the playbook and say, we’re gonna just do all that again. Right? And markets would not respond the same way. They would probably do everything in an accelerated fashion, but you wouldn’t get the same result because people’s behavior would adapt to that previous sample. And so it’s, it’s very complex of how these things work. 00:56:55 [Speaker Changed] Well, a little reflexivity in that, although you can make the argument that in March, 2020 down 34% and it felt like six weeks people looked back to oh nine and said, oh, I gotta be a buyer. ’cause the last time we saw a big crash, the Fed rescued the markets, or the Fed did this and ultimately led to that. Maybe rescue is too over simple. But isn’t this why everything eventually gets arbitraged away? Don’t the playback from the last cycle, the playbook not work in the next cycle? ’cause hey, we’ve kind of figured this out. 00:57:33 [Speaker Changed] I’m not sure we’ve ever figured it out. But again, I think a lot of this does get, does get priced in the whole idea of markets are, they’re supposed to be efficient information discovery machines, and they have proven to be tremendously powerful and efficient allocators of capital over the long run. It’s the, it’s the best machine we’ve gotten, so I certainly wouldn’t bet against that machine. Let, 00:57:53 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk a little bit about your ETFs and, and return stacking. Starting with first question is why pivot from pure research to managing assets and, and why, if you’re managing assets, did you go into the ETF side of it? 00:58:11 [Speaker Changed] The shift from pure research to managing assets, I think is one that a lot of people ultimately make. When you’re just providing research, you really don’t have any control over distribution messaging. Often you don’t have control over how your research is being used. And if you’re the one doing the research, you often have the best idea of how it should be implemented, or at least you believe you do. It’s not quite like selling data or raw data. You’re, you’re selling a manipulated form of data that you think potentially has some edge or, or some utility and you wanna make sure that gets expressed correctly. And then frankly, there’s probably a little bit of ego in there going, okay, I wanna get closer to the action. I actually want to implement the portfolios that I want to implement. I think I’ve got some good ideas for bringing some, some strategies to market. And so over time we went from, we’ll provide research to we’ll be an index provider to we’ll be a sub-advisor to we’ll launch our own funds. And I will say to my discredit, I originally launched a suite of mutual funds, right? Which was for someone who grew up in the world of ETFs and was helping run ETF model portfolios, talk about a dumb business move, 00:59:22 [Speaker Changed] What what motivated you to go mutual funds over ETFs? 00:59:26 [Speaker Changed] So it was 2013. And what concerned me about standing up ETFs is at the time we didn’t have firms like ET TF architect of our friend West Gray or or title that we’re helping with the administration. My concern of setting up my own ETF was that I was gonna have to handle all the intraday trading of the creation of redemption baskets. It was gonna require me to hire a whole ops staff that I candidly didn’t have the experience or know how to manage. And I said, versus the mutual fund, 01:00:00 [Speaker Changed] Which is a little simpler, a little cleaner, 01:00:02 [Speaker Changed] Which is a little simpler, a little cleaner. And there was a well trodden path of bringing mutual funds to market. So that was 2013. And, and again, I just didn’t feel like being the one who was going bush whacking to figure out how to do this, I should have, how, 01:00:14 [Speaker Changed] How long did it take you to realize, hey, ETFs are a more efficient, especially if there’s any sort of turnover, ETFs are a more efficient model and I can make this work at, at a similar price. 01:00:27 [Speaker Changed] So I absolutely knew from day one ETFs were a more efficient model. I think it probably took me two or three years to say I’ve chosen the wrong vehicle. Not just from a tax efficiency perspective, but from an appetite perspective. 2013 people really started to go, I don’t even want to talk about mutual funds anymore. Right? If it’s not an ETF, don’t talk to me. By 20 17, 20 18, we were having conversations with firms that said we only invest in ETFs, ETF model portfolios only. And by the way, I’ve got a whole spiel on this that I, I think that’s just as misguided strategy and structure need to be aligned. And there are some strategies for which the ETFI think is definitively the wrong structure. It’s a whole different conversation, but I ultimately said, I am, you look at the flows, you can just look at a map of the flows and say, I am selling into a dying industry. Right? Right. I am in the wrong product wrapper. And so I ultimately made the decision to shut down every fund and, and restart the whole company. 01:01:32 [Speaker Changed] So as opposed to just converting them, you, you went that way. The exit and the relaunch. Yeah. Because part of, and by 2017 Wes was doing a number of ETFs, a number of other people and other organizations made it, I don’t wanna say painless, but less painful to stand up in etf. 01:01:48 [Speaker Changed] Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. I ultimately said, I think there are decisions I made wrong from a, from a structure perspective. And I think there are decisions I made wrong from an actual product perspective. And this is where I think things can sometimes get a little weird in this industry where a guy like me who’s a quant wants to always talk about investment strategy. But I was listening to a podcast the other day, an old podcast from Patrick O’Shaughnessy actually. And he, he said this quote that was basically an investment product is more than the sum of its returns. And what he meant by that is when people buy an investment product, a fund, yes they’re often talking about the investment strategy and the returns, but there’s also a utility that they, that often we don’t talk about in this industry. So why are high dividend yield products so popular? 01:02:36 All the math tells us we should not buy high dividend yield stocks. They are typically an underperforming style of value. And yet there are billions, tens of billions if not hundreds of billions of dollars in high dividend yield ETFs because people are expressing a utility that they just like getting that dividend paid to them every month. Could they synthetically create that own their own dividend? Absolutely. But they’re lazy for back of a lack of a letter word. And they like the consistency. And there’s utility in that, even though it’s from a return perspective suboptimal. And that’s hard for people like me sometimes to, to look at and say, no, I need to teach you to do a better way. Let me, let me educate you as to why you’re wrong. Instead of saying no, that actually has really good product market fit for what the end buyer wants. And so I think I had made some poor product design decisions. 01:03:34 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about what return stacking is, how it’s similar and different to portable alpha. Let’s start out, you wrote a really well received white paper on the entire concept of return stacking. Give us the simple explanation of, of what this is. 01:03:52 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so all credit goes to my colleague Rodrigo Gordillo, for coming up with the phrase return stacking because I think it’s, it’s a more generalized form, but I think it’s much more approachable than portable alpha, right? Portable alpha. You need to understand what alpha is. What does porting do? If I say I’m stacking returns, I’m stacking the returns of gold on top of the s and p, you can probably guess that one plus one equals two, right? It sort of sounds like math and that’s effectively what we’re trying to do. It goes back to the problem we were talking about earlier of, of trying to solve this addition through subtraction issue with diversification. How do I get an industry that disagrees on everything except for diversification is good to add more diversification to their portfolio, right? You talk to anyone and they’ll say, yeah, all else held equal, we want more diversification. 01:04:43 And then you go look at their portfolio and it’s basically the s and p 500 in bonds and there’s nothing necessarily wrong with that. But the question is, can we go further to introduce diversifiers that can improve both the consistency with which we can achieve our outcomes and and the return potential. And so return stacking at its core is trying to take the institutional concept of portable alpha and bring it downstream because institutions to implement that concept have to buy futures and swaps and manage all these separate accounts. What we’ve tried to do is prepackage that concept into a suite of ETFs. 01:05:21 [Speaker Changed] So, so you, the white paper comes out, WisdomTree launches a product related to this. Did you have anything to do 01:05:27 [Speaker Changed] With that? So back in 2017, you and I, I dunno if you remember this, you and I were on a Baron’s round table called What’s Next for ETFs. And at that round table I said, 01:05:39 [Speaker Changed] Uhoh, 01:05:40 [Speaker Changed] I said, I think what’s next for ETF are capital efficient ETFs. And the example I gave was buy the s you know, instead of having a stock and bond fund, this fund could buy the s and p and overlay with treasury futures. And so if you give it a dollar, it’s gonna give you say 90 cents of the s and p and 60 cents of Treasury Futures giving you a a 90 60 a 1.5 times levered 60 40. And the idea there is, okay, you can put two thirds of your money in that fund, get a 60 40 exposure, and then you can take that one third of your cash and, and do whatever. You could leave it in cash if you just like sitting on cash or you can invest it in alternatives implementing portable Alpha. Jeremy Schwartz is, who’s a good friend of both of ours showed that article around internally it was, we had a whole bunch of Twitter conversations about it. Next thing you know, he says, Hey Cory, I’m I’m launching a product on this. And, and the Wisdom Tree NTSX fund was born. 01:06:36 [Speaker Changed] I recall, I recall Jeremy subsequently launching that. I I I hope they at least tossed you a bone and and consulting something. Nothing. 01:06:44 [Speaker Changed] Jeremy had me on a couple of podcasts talk about it. All right, 01:06:47 [Speaker Changed] There you go. I hope I didn’t say anything too stupid at that round table. I can remember that. Up on sixth Avenue. Yeah. Right. Got by their offices. 01:06:55 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. It was, and I, I actually have been using my headshot from that article since then, which at this point I 01:07:02 [Speaker Changed] Got a couple of great photos from that. So 01:07:03 [Speaker Changed] I didn’t realize this is like Pulitzer Prize winning photographer who Yeah. Took our photos. They’re the best headshot I’ve ever had. Same, same. And finally, I said, it’s seven years later, I’m, I’m officially catfishing people with this photo. I don’t look anything like this anymore. Every 01:07:18 [Speaker Changed] Now and then I will see something show up on, on a bio at some event for me. And I’m like, dude, that’s 20 years old. I I’m not only grayer and, and 20 pounds lighter than then, but like, I look nothing like that anymore. It’s like, well we found that online, so yeah, I know exactly what you’re, what you’re talking 01:07:38 [Speaker Changed] About. So I had to, I had to get rid of that one. So yeah, so that was the, the birth of the NTSX fund and, and I was super happy to see WisdomTree do that. ’cause I I really do believe that this is a whole category of products that has not existed really before. There’s a couple of select examples, but really should be a whole part of the industry because again, institutions have used this concept for 40 years and use it very effectively to be able to say to an investor, Hey, I think a strategy like managed futures trend following adds a lot of value to your portfolio. And no longer do I have to sell some stocks and bonds to make room, right? I can let you keep your stocks and bonds and I’m gonna add a 10% allocation on top. When managed futures go through a lost decade like they did in the 2000 tens, the investor will barely notice it. Right? And they’ll be able to stay in it for when managed futures does well in a year like 25. 01:08:30 [Speaker Changed] So there’s a, that’s the behavioral component of this. How, how does this differ just from straight up leverage? It, it sounds like return stacking has a big leverage component. 01:08:40 [Speaker Changed] It is, it is absolutely leverage. I think the idea here is, again, leverage is a tool that accentuates the good and the bad, right? We wanna be very thoughtful about what we’re stacking on top. So if you’re a 60 40 investor, I certainly would not say use this concept to stack more equities, you’re probably just gonna get in trouble. But if you can use this concept to stack diversifiers like commodities and gold, historically that hasn’t been an issue. And in fact, I would point to the Bridgewater all weather fund, right? Who takes 01:09:10 [Speaker Changed] This, which is 25% gold and 01:09:12 [Speaker Changed] Takes this concept to the extreme and runs with significant amount of notional leverage with the idea they’re trying to risk balance all the variety of asset classes. And it held up incredibly well during 2008 despite having so much leverage. And it’s because they’re using leverage to unlock the benefits of diversification rather than using leverage to amplify returns. 01:09:34 [Speaker Changed] Gotcha. That makes a lot of sense. So you currently are running five different return stacked ETFs. Do they each have a different goal? How do different combinations work and what do we 700, $800 million? Yeah, just, 01:09:47 [Speaker Changed] Just clipped over $800 million launched I guess 18, 20 months ago. So we’re very happy and pleased with the growth. And, and I think it speaks to people understanding what we’re trying to do and, and this new form of diversification we’re trying to build, talking about getting a little bit smarter on the product side. 01:10:05 One of the things I think I underappreciated earlier in my career is that advisors and allocators want control in their portfolio. And so with this new suite, what we’ve tried to come out with is what I would call very much a, a Lego or building block approach where each product is very narrowly focused so that allocators can use them how they want. So I’ll just give two really quick examples. We have one fund that for every dollar you invest with us, we’ll give you what is effectively a dollar of passive large cap US equities plus a dollar of a managed futures trend following strategy. We have another fund that for every dollar you invest with us, we’ll give you a dollar of core US fixed income plus a dollar of managed futures trend following same managed futures trend following on top. But one gives you the s and p one gives you bonds as the, as the bottom layer. 01:10:55 [Speaker Changed] So, so that would allow someone to say, I wanna own both managed futures and either I’m bullish and I want equity, or I’m conservative and, and I’m bearish and I want bonds. 01:11:05 [Speaker Changed] I would go the other way, which is you’re a very aggressive investor. You’re let’s say a growth client 80 20, you just have more equities around, it’s easier to potentially overlay your equities than it is on bonds or you’re a very conservative investor, you just have more bonds around or you have a strong view that you can add alpha in your bond managers, but you’re never gonna beat the s and p 500. So take that passive s and p 500 and by our fund you get the s and p back with the managed futures on top because you don’t wanna do it with bonds. ’cause you think your bond manager’s gonna add value. So again, I’m being non-prescriptive and the products I’m bringing to market, I’m letting people say I like the concept of adding an overlay, how I want to express and where I want to express and the size with which I want to express. That’s a conversation and a dialogue we have when we consult with our 01:11:57 [Speaker Changed] Clients. So, so a couple of questions on that. First, who are the typical clients? Are these institutions, are they iass who wants this sort of return stacking in their, their either their core portfolio or any of their satellite holdings? 01:12:12 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, it’s really funny. So you would think potentially with institutions, and we have lots of calls with institutions and they all say the same thing, which is we love this and we also do it ourselves. We don’t need to buy an ETF. Really 01:12:24 They’re, they’re doing it the way they’ve historically done it, which is they have banking relationships and they manage the futures and the swaps and so they don’t need a product like an ETF. So where, where we tend to see and have seen all the flows is independent RIAs who are saying, I’m trying to figure out how to get diversification. I like alternatives, but man, it is hard to say to my client for the fifth time when they point to that managed futures fund as a line item and they say, why in the world do we have this? Right? And you’re saying, well, because diversification and the 01:13:00 [Speaker Changed] Next cycle, 01:13:01 [Speaker Changed] Right? Brian Portnoy says, diversification means always having to say you’re sorry. Right? That’s right. And if you are an advisor running a business and you’re saying sorry to your clients too much, that’s a great way to get fired, right? There’s, there’s just real business risk there. And so what we’re finding is not only I think do we make a compelling value proposition of, hey, this is an interesting way of trying to add returns to your portfolio in the portable alpha sense. If you think managed futures generates 200, 300 basis points of excess returns over time, why are you picking stocks? Just buy the s and p 500 and add managed futures on top. But for the diversifiers they’re going, this is a great way to introduce my alternatives without giving up all the beta, right? And having that return hurdle issue and having that behavioral friction issue. 01:13:44 [Speaker Changed] All right, so, so you have US equity with managed futures, you have US bonds with managed futures, what are the other ETFs? 01:13:53 [Speaker Changed] We have a US equity plus what we would call a multi-asset carry strategy, which, so this is, so managed futures is typically done with trend following signals. It can also be done with what’s called a carry signal, which is you can sort of think of carry as your yield, what’s the return you’re gonna get if the world doesn’t change. And so carry signals can be powerful predictors of total returns. So it’s a just a different quant signal. It behaves differently. Trades a similar universe of currencies and commodities and, and equities and rates around the world. So it’s long short, just a different quant signal. So we have a US plus that we have a Bonds plus that multi-asset carry. And then the final piece is what I consider to be our most flexible portfolio, which is just you give us a dollar, we’ll give you a dollar of as passively allocated as we can. 01:14:39 Global stocks plus a ladder of US treasuries. And the idea there is not to say let’s stack bonds on top of equities in your portfolio. The idea there is to say that is an incredibly powerful capital efficiency tool that allows you to stack whatever you want. So lemme give you a really quick example. Let’s say you’ve got a 60 40 portfolio, 60% stocks, 40% bonds. If you sell 10% of your stocks and 10% of your bonds and by 10% of that fund, that 10% of that fund gives you both the stocks and bonds back. And now you have 10% leftover in cash with which you can do whatever you want. You could have it sit in cash and in sit in T bills and the return of that portfolio would be sort of the same as your 60 40. But hey, now you’ve got more cash on hand. 01:15:28 You can do some interesting things about self financing actually. ’cause you’re technically borrowing from yourself. You can use that cash and you’ve actually just taken a loan based on, and it’s very attractive financing rates. The embedded rate of financing in these futures is like T-bills. So instead of borrowing from a bank, you can actually borrow from yourself or you can take that cash and invest in something hopefully for provide diversification or return. But as long as whatever you’re investing in outperforms cash, you will have added value to your portfolio. So let’s say you love Managed Futures as a strategy, but you don’t like the way I implement Managed Futures. You’ll love Cliff Asness at a QR. You love their fund. Well you can buy my Global Stocks and Bonds fund to free up the cash to then invest in his managed futures fund. And what you have effectively done is kept your 60 40 whole and stacked his fund on top. And so you can now stack whatever alternative asset class or investment strategy you want with our tool. 01:16:28 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really fascinating. The name of the company is the Return Stacked ETF suite. There are five different ETFs on it. I have a couple of questions I’ve been saving before we get to our favorite questions. And let’s start with something that I think is really kind of interesting. During the pandemic, you did a video with Jason Buck where you were discussing like deep in the weeds research into NFTs and crypto and degenerate trading. Like I I, in fact, it might have come from nodding said, oh, you gotta watch this. This is hilarious. In a good way, not a sarcastic way. What was going on with crypto and NFT trading during the Covid Lockdowns? 01:17:15 [Speaker Changed] So Jason Buck is a good friend of mine. He runs Mutiny Funds and we started this podcast as, as you 01:17:20 [Speaker Changed] Do, mutiny funds, 01:17:21 [Speaker Changed] Mutiny funds. 01:17:22 [Speaker Changed] What? Wasn’t there another pod? Maybe it was he who was hosting it was Pirate Capital or 01:17:29 [Speaker Changed] What? Pirates of Finance. Pirates 01:17:31 [Speaker Changed] Of Finance. 01:17:31 [Speaker Changed] That’s, so that was Jason and I started that during the pandemic where okay, we weren’t allowed out of our houses anymore. 01:17:36 [Speaker Changed] I love that. I love that title of that podcast. 01:17:38 [Speaker Changed] So that was a fun one for us where we just said, you know, that was the era of, all right, on a Friday afternoon, let’s grab a beer, right? Chop it up, see what’s going on in markets. And for folks who weren’t paying attention to the crypto markets at that time, it was an absolutely Cambrian explosion of activity, right? You had all these retail traders who started trading crypto and the available functionality of what you could build in crypto really exploded. So you not only had NFTs, but you had all these were called protocols or applications that were doing all this interesting stuff. And it was a fascinating world to explore, not only from the what does this mean for the future, but there were some incredible trading opportunities for people who operated in traditional markets that you would see things and say that that shouldn’t be like that. Right? That’s wildly mispriced. And in any traditional market that wouldn’t exist. But okay, I’ll, I’ll put my money where my mouth is. And so there was a fun trading opportunity. I I certainly wouldn’t say I maximized it. Yeah, but 01:18:40 [Speaker Changed] You’re a computer science market structure guy. This is your sweet spot. 01:18:45 [Speaker Changed] And it’s just fun because it was almost by definition because of regulatory reasons, lots of parties couldn’t get involved. You had a market that was being dominated by retail. I don’t wanna say I lower information flow. Right? Right. More momentum driven 01:19:02 [Speaker Changed] Low information voters. It 01:19:04 [Speaker Changed] Just, the systems weren’t set up. There were limits to arbitrage. And so you had these situations where you said, oh, you can make a good deal of money here. And I had friends who dropped their careers in finance and said, I used to be a market maker for treasury futures and I’m now a market maker for crypto. And oh, now I’m retired two years later because the market’s that inefficient. Wow. And all I had to do was port the exact same skillset that was a bloodbath in traditional markets, right. Eking for every bip and it’s just, you’re just printing money and, and it was a very limited window that does not exist anymore. Right? Right. But there was this really fascinating window of, of both investor behavior and opportunity in what was developing and what it all could become. 01:19:46 [Speaker Changed] So, so I’m assuming you made a couple of shekels trading. 01:19:50 [Speaker Changed] We had, there were some fun trades, right? There were some fun trades. 01:19:54 [Speaker Changed] How, how quickly did you realize that window was closing and I’m assuming that was pre FTX and SBF and sand bankman freed and that that mayhem 01:20:05 [Speaker Changed] It was probably during the Luna collapse. Okay. And again, I apologize for folks who didn’t track the, 01:20:11 [Speaker Changed] So Luna is a stable coin that was supposed to just trade at a dollar, what’s his name very famously got a tattoo Yes. Of it. Novogratz Novogratz. And, and then suddenly the rug was pulled out and it turned out to not be all it was. 01:20:30 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You had these reported to be right, these stable coins, which are a way for people to transact in what are effectively dollars on the blockchain, some of which are actually backed by dollars and others of which are fractionally backed or backed by a variety of assets. And then you had what was called algorithmically backed stable coins. And I don’t think there’s any success stories there. They all no blew up. Right. Mark 01:20:54 [Speaker Changed] Cuban, 01:20:54 [Speaker Changed] It’s almost Mark Cuban famously lost a bunch of money in one of those. Oh, did he? I didn’t know that. What it was called, I believe it was called Iron Finances was what the, it was called. And that, you know, again, when you have nothing backing a coin other than a systematic strategy that’s gonna try to buy and sell the coin to keep it within a peg, it just, 01:21:12 [Speaker Changed] Doesn’t that sound like portfolio insurance from the 87 crash is nothing new old again? Is it? It just, it’s just amazing that Oh yeah, we’ll find a way to just hedge it as, as the market starts rolling 01:21:24 [Speaker Changed] Off. So you had all this abundance of hot capital in this market that suddenly evaporated. You had very loud players like three arrows capital that was massively overlevered start to fall apart. And as that liquidity disappears, so with it do the abundant trading opportunities. And so that’s where it started to become clear to me. It just, the game was over. Right. It was a game of musical chairs. Right. And the music had stopped playing and I was like, I’m just gonna get outta the room. Right. Because I’m, I, you know, you can overtrade these things. No 01:21:55 [Speaker Changed] Say to say the very least. 01:21:56 [Speaker Changed] And also, it’s not my job. I actually do have a day job. 01:21:59 [Speaker Changed] Right. So, so that was kind of interesting. You’re, you’re also located in Florida, in South Florida. What’s it been like being a new dad in the midst of the west coast of Florida that really got shellacked by three consecutive heart? Everybody’s talking about Helene, but what was it, Debbie over the summer really did some big damage and then the middle one. So so it was like a triple hit. 01:22:29 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. I mean I live in the Tampa area and I, I moved there two years ago and I should have known something was wrong when I, I originally from Boston, it was moving from Boston, driving down and, and it was a hurricane showed up outta nowhere and I actually had to stop my drive halfway down and just hang out in North Carolina 01:22:46 [Speaker Changed] No more. Just, 01:22:47 [Speaker Changed] Well, well it’s one of those, they show up four or five days and you go, right, okay, I’m watching the path. And it became clear, I, you know, all my furniture is getting delivered right the day before the hurricane’s supposed to hit. I’ve got a pregnant wife who is accepting the delivery as I’m driving, you know, the car down. And, and it just, I was like, I should have left at that point. But most importantly, my family is, is safe. Our first floor of our house got completely destroyed. My car got totaled. It’s all overshadowed by how amazing being a father is. I, it is just, it’s hard to complain about any of that. Right. In the grand scheme of life. Of just, you know, I got a new kid and it’s amazing. 01:23:26 [Speaker Changed] What, what’s the rest of the neighborhood look like? 01:23:30 [Speaker Changed] It honestly is pretty devastating. Really. So down near the water, every single restaurant is just gone, 01:23:37 [Speaker Changed] Just gone, just gone. Like wiped off from 01:23:40 [Speaker Changed] The face of the air wipe wiped off. We had Wow. We had an eight or nine foot storm surge. Yeah. So 01:23:45 [Speaker Changed] Not quite sandy, but pretty close. 01:23:47 [Speaker Changed] Pretty close. So you can imagine all these beachfront tiki bars. Yeah. You know, under nine feet of water and then the tide goes out. It’s just, there’s 01:23:54 [Speaker Changed] Nothing left in anyway. 01:23:55 [Speaker Changed] It’s gone. You know, if you had a two story house in our neighborhood, your first floor was gone. And the second floor is what remains for those who had single story houses, which is the majority. Yeah. You know, everything ends up on the curb. Right. And so driving down our neighborhood for the last, I guess two months now, it’s just people’s lives Yeah. Are on the curb. And what people don’t tell you until you live this is that sea water is also mixed with sewage water. Yes. And so the whole place 01:24:28 [Speaker Changed] Wreaks. 01:24:29 [Speaker Changed] Right. And all the plants die ’cause they become so everyone’s garden. So you’re just driving around this place that looks like a trash hump dump as all the plants are dying and it smells awful. 01:24:41 [Speaker Changed] Right. I mean, but aside from that 01:24:43 [Speaker Changed] Wonderful place to live 01:24:44 [Speaker Changed] Are, are you going to, so you were, you were renting, right? Yes. So are you gonna stay there? Are you gonna relocate? What’s the thinking? You 01:24:51 [Speaker Changed] I, well you’re asking the wrong person. You should ask my wife. I don’t, I don’t have executive power here. Right. I think we will stay in the area. We really love where we live. St. Pete is a, is a wonderful area for us. We love raising our son there for the moment. We’ll see how it plays out. 01:25:08 [Speaker Changed] Alright. That’s really interesting. All right. My last two curve ball questions for you At Cornell, you played rugby. Tell us about that. 01:25:17 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, so I, I grew up as a lacrosse player. Got to Cornell and I mean the lacrosse program there is phenomenal. Right. That’s, I was never gonna make the team. I was, 01:25:27 [Speaker Changed] I knew that’s a serious, serious program. Yeah. And 01:25:29 [Speaker Changed] I’ve always enjoyed being athletic. So I was looking around what to do and 01:25:33 [Speaker Changed] Where else can I break bones besides lacrosse. 01:25:36 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Well this is particularly dumb because in high school I actually played lacrosse and, and got a skull fracture. Nice. So all the doctors said stop playing sports. Right. They wouldn’t let me play soccer anymore ’cause I couldn’t head the ball. Really? 01:25:47 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Oh, so that’s the serious skull fracture. Oh yeah. Yeah. I broke my nose playing soccer Yeah. In a collision. And just remember waking up flat on my back. But nobody ever said you should stop. 01:25:59 [Speaker Changed] Oh yeah. No. I had to get a spinal tap. I had Oh, really serious damage. I had brain fluid leaking out my ear. Right. This, this was a serious one. So anyway, so I wasn’t really supposed to play sports. And as I got to college, I thought about not playing anything and there was a club rugby team and I just said, you know, for how this sounds bad, but you’re like, you’re at an Ivy League school, it’s kind of like an a, it’s feels like an Ivy League ish sport. I was like, that would just be fun to go play rugby. Right. And it was a ton of fun and it was incredibly stupid of me. Right, 01:26:29 [Speaker Changed] Right. Broken fingers and ribs. 01:26:31 [Speaker Changed] No, I survived pretty well. Well, so I was, what’s what’s, you’ve only known me as, I’ve been older. I used to probably weigh 40 pounds less. Oh really? I was, yeah. In, in college I was a very thin guy. Yes. All of us were. And so they put me way out in the winger position where I just ran right up and down the field. And so I wasn’t really massively in the scrums, in the ru 01:26:51 [Speaker Changed] I gotcha. That, that’s interesting. And, and, and our final curve ball question, favorite Dungeons and Dragons monster and why? Oh, this. And you could guess where that question is. Yeah, 01:27:04 [Speaker Changed] I can guess where that one, well this one actually, 01:27:05 [Speaker Changed] So, so wait, let me give a little color. You are in a financial d and d game that’s been going on for years. 01:27:11 [Speaker Changed] So this is funny actually, if you’ll allow me Go ahead. Can I, can I bring this into the first, your last five questions? Sure. Because you’re, I believe the first of your last five questions you ask every guest is what content are you consuming? Right. 01:27:23 [Speaker Changed] Podcast and Netflix, what are you watching? What are you listening to? 01:27:25 [Speaker Changed] And the problem is, with a rapidly expanding business and a young kid at home, I don’t have time to watch anything. But what I have carved time out in my life for has been this Dungeons Dragons game. It’s hard to say with a serious face. Right. But there are seven of us in the industry who started five years ago, and we play weekly and it’s three hours. And that sounds incredibly nerdy, but for those who have never played Dungeons and Dragons is really a collaborative storytelling Right. Game. We have an unbelievable guy who runs the game who is just this imaginative world builder. So imagine, you know, if you like fantasy or sci-fi, you can run it however you want. He builds these unbelievably complex worlds that we get to explore as characters. And he has a big narrative arc, but he’s constantly adapting to how we interact with the world. 01:28:17 And then there’s the randomness, which is when you try to do something, you’re rolling dice and your success or failure is based on the dice. So the, the dice play a role in the story. And so for me, that’s been a really big outlet of not only fun with the guys, but that’s a lot of content consumption in the sense of the stories playing out in front of me, but also I get to collaborate and be a creative part of the story creation. So that’s, that’s been a really special part of my life for the last five years. 01:28:41 [Speaker Changed] So, so that’ll be our first question because you’re not really watching or or streaming much. Let’s talk about mentors who helped shape your career. 01:28:51 [Speaker Changed] So there, I I will say, and this ties to some of the latter questions. I think one of the mistakes I made earlier in my career is not appreciating how much of an apprenticeship industry this is. Especially the, the more niche you go into markets, there’s just wisdom and experience that it’s hard to learn for yourself. And it’s very easy if you don’t have that wisdom to knock yourself outta the business. Right. From a performance perspective. And so I didn’t, I didn’t understand that I wish I had had more mentors. What I’ll say is on the business side, my father and my business partner are both phenomenal entrepreneurs. And I learned a ton on the business side from them. I will say I’ve been very fortunate reading and interacting with folks like Cliff Asness and Auntie Elman and who have been, you know, huge idols of mine and what they’ve contributed to the industry and just been very open to communicating with me. I would say from a, from an actual practitioner perspective, have been, have been big mentors. Huh. 01:29:47 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. Both of them at a QR, right? Yes. What about books? What are some of your favorites? What are you reading right now? 01:29:55 [Speaker Changed] So, again, not a lot of time to read. I just got done listening to All Lord of the Rings on audio. Huh? I do to a lot of audio books. And 01:30:05 [Speaker Changed] How was that on audio as opposed to reading 01:30:07 [Speaker Changed] It? So Andy Cir, who played Gollum, who’s a phenomenal voice actor, read all the books and he’s so good at like, when he did Gandalf, it sounded like Ian McKellen, like really 01:30:19 [Speaker Changed] You could, he’s doing voices. 01:30:21 [Speaker Changed] He’s doing voices. And it’s just, you know, again, if you’re not into that type of book, you’re not gonna enjoy it. But he brings it to life with such vibrancy that it’s not someone just reading the book. It’s like he is, he’s singing the songs, he’s playing the characters, he’s giving it to you like a play. It was just really, I mean, I got through all three books very quickly and I, I wish I had, I had more. So that’s one I I did just recently. And I tend to do audio books ’cause it’s easier for me when I go out for a walk or run to listen to that than it is for me at the end of a day to say, I’m gonna get through 10 pages of a book and then fall asleep drooling on it. 01:30:58 [Speaker Changed] I know what that experience is like. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interested in a career in quantitative investing? 01:31:10 [Speaker Changed] That, so I’ll, I’ll go back to what I just said, which was, and I, it was interesting. I was just at a symposium at the College of Charleston, which is put on for their students. And I said the same thing to their students, which is, I’m lo to give advice, but my experience was, I wish I had had a mentor. I wish I had understood that for where I was trying to go, I would’ve gotten there a lot faster if I had found a hands-on mentor and understood that this is an apprenticeship industry. Whether you are looking to do deep quant research or looking to build product or run an RIA every side of it has so many complicated facets that you have to navigate from the regulatory side to understanding the behavior of your clients, to understanding the, the markets and the microstructure and who’s operating in them. That trying to discover that all on your own, there’s a great chance you don’t survive it. And so to me, I wish I, I take that back. I’ve had a phenomenal career. I’m very lucky I wouldn’t change a thing, but I, if I was doing it another path, I would’ve said, man, maybe I should have just gone to work at a QR for a while. That might have jumped me forward, you know, instead of stumbling in the dark for so long. 01:32:22 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. Except you would still be at a qr. Yeah. If you weren’t at a QR. The, you know what, I’m, I’m 01:32:27 [Speaker Changed] Kind. They, first of all, they wouldn’t have hired me. Well, they have a lot smarter people than me. I, 01:32:31 [Speaker Changed] I’m kind of sad about the demise of Twitter because, because it was this, at least in finance and Finw, there was this ability to have conversations with people, whether it was in public or just slipping into someone’s DM and, and chatting. That seems to have kind of faded away. But like the 2010s was a golden era of, I don’t even know what else to call it. Networking, mentorship, connections. Just, Hey, you’re right. Working on this. I did some research on this. You might want to take a look at it. Oh, thanks. That’s really like, there was a, a very level playing field of, of not even mentorship, just encouragement from people. I, I kind of feel a little bit of a loss that that’s gone away. I don’t know how you, like you were right in the thick of this Yeah. As well as, as so many other people we know in common. 01:33:33 [Speaker Changed] I’m still very active on Twitter, but it’s a very curated thing for me. I, what I find is I, like, I’m in, I’m in groups for example of 40, 50 like quants who can’t disclose who they are. Right. And they don’t wanna share a lot publicly, but you’ve built up this trust with them that you can ask these questions of things you’re working on and get feedback from people all across the industry in a way that I, I’m still not sure I could find anywhere else. Right. One of the things I’ve noticed is back in the mid 2000 tens, early 2000 tens, the community was just smaller. And so you could have a lot of conversations in public as Twitter grew and grew and grew, just the request for your time became more and more right. It used to be, I might have one, some young person reaching out to ask me a question. Now it might be 20 times the volume. And it’s just, it’s hard to be as responsive and have the intimate connections I think you had when it was a smaller community. So I know a lot of people who there are, Twitter has its problems, but a lot of people who, who bemoan the loss of that prior experience. I think it, it was a small community aspect that has disappeared. And it’s hard to rebuild that unless you build your own wall to curtain. 01:34:42 [Speaker Changed] No, there, there’s no doubt that that’s part of it. I I’ve also found that I spend much less time in like the main open channel and now everything is for me has been list driven. Yes. Whether it’s economics or markets or I even create a, create a separate list just for charts and put a bunch of, of guys who are technically oriented. And it, like a lot of the worst aspects of Twitter go away when you’re in a curated list of people who are like-minded, 01:35:15 [Speaker Changed] But you lose a bit of the serendipity discovery. 01:35:17 [Speaker Changed] Yes. Yes. Exactly 01:35:18 [Speaker Changed] Right. And so then, then you’re going, well I hope someone retweets something interesting so I can discover a new person. Right. And there are absolutely trade offs 01:35:25 [Speaker Changed] To it. I, I mean, so it was, it wasn’t summer of 24, it was summer of 23. I went out to dinner, I come back home and there was password requests made a change on Twitter that I didn’t make. And I go to say, this is a me. They’ve already given the account away to somebody else. Like they’re, they’re stupid, first of all making two factor authentication an option just so idiotic. And it took three months to get the account back. And I, I finally got it back and some of our mutual friends said, Hey, you’re not gonna recognize the place the, you missed. Like, it’s like when, at the last inning of a baseball game, when everybody files out and you’re in the, you’re you’re in the bathroom and you come back and where did everybody 01:36:14 [Speaker Changed] Go with? Well, I’ll tell you, during that period, I had some fantastic conversations with you over dm. So I, you know, I miss whoever that was. 01:36:22 [Speaker Changed] It, it’s really kind of, you know, it’s, it’s so weird to feel like I never felt a loss when Facebook changed the whole, to use Corey Rio’s phrase and ation of places like eBay and Amazon and Google. Like, it’s annoying. I’m, I I don’t love what’s happened to Apple, although they’re still functional useful for me, Twitter is the first one where it’s like, man, this was really special in our space. And then it’s just gone away. And you know, there, there are a lot of reasons to not be happy with Elon Musk. Not, not the least of which are the never ending promises for products that don’t seem to arrive with any sort of reasonable timeline. But man, firing 80% of the engineers and leaving a a, you know, a, a smoking hulk behind. It’s really kind of disappointing. I, I understand why people don’t love Twitter. I still have this like nostalgic feel for when it was good. It was so good. It’s all right. Alright. And our final question. What do you know about the world of investing that would’ve been useful to know when you were first launching in oh 8, 0 9? 01:37:45 [Speaker Changed] There’s a phrase I have been repeating a lot in the last year and a half at my own business, which is why are we playing the game on hard mode? Play the game on easy mode. And I mean that both in the investment strategies we choose to pursue and the products we wanna bring to market. I’m not gonna talk so much to the products here, though. I’m happy to go into that on the investment strategy side. I, I wish someone had just sat me down early in my career and said low breadth bets, you don’t get to repeat a lot. Don’t do those type of, don’t try to time the market. I mean, like every young person I spent a whole, of course I’m gonna be the one to crack the market and figure out to time it, it’s a dumb, low breadth bet. You don’t get to repeat a lot. 01:38:32 It’s like trying to flip the coin three times in your life and guess heads all three times. It’s just very unlikely. And when you’re wrong, there’s a lot of damage. Alright. So, so be smarter about the type of strategy you’re gonna pursue. By the way, the s and p 500 is the hardest universe to try to actively pick stocks in. Maybe don’t try to pick stocks there. Go play the game on easy mode where there’s a proven opportunity. Rather than saying, having the ego to say, no, I’m gonna be the one to figure it out. There are people who can beat the market, but even if I’m smart enough to figure it out or, or have can find that edge, why not find it somewhere where it’s easier? And so I think for me, I wish earlier in my career, someone had really beaten into me are, are you just playing the game on hard mode just because you want to? Or is there an easier way to do this? At the end of the day, you’re, you’re trying to meet this objective. What is the easiest way to meet it? 01:39:26 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really interesting.

Title: Putin Is Throwing Human Waves at Ukraine, But Can’t Do It Forever

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/25/2024 4:46:13 AM PST by Timber Rattler One of the bleakest places on Earth today is the central processing facility for the remains of dead soldiers in the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, the logistical hub of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Designed to process hundreds of corpses at a time, this sprawling mega-morgue has been hopelessly overwhelmed for many months. Footage from the inside, posted by witnesses on social media, shows hundreds of bodies in various stages of decomposition and limbs strewn across the corridor floors. In wooden boxes lining the walls from floor to ceiling, row after row after row, are the lucky ones: those whose bodies were recovered from the battlefield, identified, sealed in zinc-lined caskets, and prepared for dispatch to their grieving relatives in the farthest corners of Russia. Many more corpses have been abandoned to rot in Ukrainian fields because evacuating them is impractical under the constant barrage of the defenders’ artillery and drones. To be sure: These soldiers’ deaths are the necessary consequence of Ukraine’s right to defend itself against an illegal war of conquest. What’s more, many of these ordinary Russian soldiers likely committed despicable brutality and war crimes against Ukrainians, including defenseless civilians. But the horrific rate at which Russians are getting killed at the front—much higher than corresponding Ukrainian losses, although exact numbers are kept secret by both sides—points to two disturbing truths about the Russian way of waging war. First, a cruel disregard for human life extends to Russia’s own forces, which the Kremlin systematically deploys in so-called meat grinder and human-wave attacks. Second, mass death among Russian troops has become part of an increasingly explicit eugenics policy, by which the Kremlin seeks to rid Russia of undesirable elements and reconfigure the Russian population.

What’s more, many of these ordinary Russian soldiers likely committed despicable brutality and war crimes against Ukrainians, including defenseless civilians. But the horrific rate at which Russians are getting killed at the front—much higher than corresponding Ukrainian losses, although exact numbers are kept secret by both sides—points to two disturbing truths about the Russian way of waging war. First, a cruel disregard for human life extends to Russia’s own forces, which the Kremlin systematically deploys in so-called meat grinder and human-wave attacks. Second, mass death among Russian troops has become part of an increasingly explicit eugenics policy, by which the Kremlin seeks to rid Russia of undesirable elements and reconfigure the Russian population.

Title: Is Uber Technologies (UBER) the Best Stock to Invest in for the Next 3 Months?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Best Stocks to Invest in for the Next 3 Months. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) stands against other best stocks to invest in for the next 3 months. On November 13, Morgan Stanley published an analysis highlighting potential risks to the “Trump trade,” which refers to market optimism following Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The investors poured into small-cap stocks, financials, and cryptocurrencies, expecting lower taxes and deregulation. However, bond markets signaled caution, with 10-year Treasury yields rising sharply. Concerns about unfunded tax cuts and swelling U.S. debt weighed on sentiment in fixed-income markets, and the stronger U.S. dollar put pressure on emerging market currencies. Despite the current market momentum, the bank’s Global Investment Committee advises investors to approach these trends cautiously as 2025 approaches. They cite three primary risks to the sustainability of this rally. First, equity valuations are highly stretched. The report points out that higher interest rates are increasing borrowing costs and could weigh on corporate profitability. Inflation-adjusted 10-year Treasury yields have risen to about 2%, historically associated with lower stock price-to-earnings ratios. Currently, this multiple sits at 23x, far above historical norms. Second, corporate earnings targets for 2025 are ambitious and may be difficult to achieve. Forecasts project profit growth of 15%, which seems overly optimistic given current single-digit earnings growth and weak productivity improvements. While some sectors, such as traditional energy and financials, might benefit from regulatory clarity under Trump’s leadership, headwinds such as rising borrowing costs and the stronger dollar could challenge multinational corporations. Moreover, potential tariffs might increase production costs, putting additional pressure on manufacturers. Finally, policy timing poses significant risks. The Trump administration’s policy sequencing will be critical. While measures such as deregulation and tax cuts could stimulate growth, inflationary policies such as tariffs or immigration restrictions could offset these benefits. Such actions may raise consumer prices, slow labor-force growth, and disrupt key industries, including agribusiness and services. Given these risks, the bank advises investors to consider taking profits in high-performing stocks and offsetting tax liabilities by selling underperforming securities. They see potential opportunities in large-cap value, mid-cap growth, and emerging markets, where currency volatility has created attractive entry points.

In an interview with Bloomberg on November 20, Howard Marks, Co-Chair of Oaktree Capital Management, shared his insights on navigating the uncertainties of the global market and investment strategies amidst geopolitical and economic turmoil. Marks emphasized the inherent unpredictability of markets, cautioning against overreacting to short-term events such as geopolitical tensions, shifts in U.S. policy, or macroeconomic changes. Instead, he advocated for a disciplined, bottom-up approach to investing that focuses on intrinsic value and the fundamental performance of individual companies. Marks addressed the high valuations in U.S. equity markets, noting that while prices might be elevated relative to historical norms, he does not view them as prohibitively overpriced but rather highly priced. On geopolitical developments, including former President Trump’s rhetoric and potential policy impacts, Marks stressed the difficulty of predicting how events might unfold or how markets might respond. He highlighted the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective rather than attempting to time markets based on speculation. He pointed to historical instances where predictions of major global events could have led to costly investment mistakes. The financial landscape is currently being shaped by shifting policies, evolving market trends, and global uncertainties. Investors should proceed with caution, focus on long-term strategies, and adopt disciplined decision-making to navigate potential risks.

The company has revolutionized urban mobility, offering convenient and affordable solutions for millions of users. The company’s diversified revenue streams, including Uber Eats and Uber Freight, make it a key player in the future of transportation and delivery services. On October 31, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) announced financial results for the third quarter, which ended on September 30. The company’s revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $11.2 billion. Whereas, Gross Bookings increased 16% year-over-year to $41.0 billion, with trips during the quarter growing 17% year-over-year to 2.9 billion, or approximately 31 million trips per day on average. Looking ahead to Q4, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) has issued an optimistic outlook, reflecting strong growth prospects. The company projects Gross Bookings to range between $42.75 billion and $44.25 billion, representing a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 16% to 20%. This growth is expected to be fueled by sustained momentum in both its Mobility and Delivery segments, with trip growth anticipated to mirror the performance observed in Q3.

Title: Investing with a clear conscience: How should Catholics manage their money?
URL: https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/260641/investing-with-a-clear-conscience-how-should-catholics-manage-their-money
Time Published: 2024-11-25T11:00:00Z

By Jonah McKeown CNA Staff, Nov 25, 2024 / 06:00 am In today’s complex society, it takes effort to ensure that your hard-earned money, once invested and out in the financial ether, doesn’t fund the kinds of things that Catholics abhor — like abortion, pornography, or unethical labor practices. But surely the Church itself, with its significant invested assets, has this figured out already… right? Though the principles behind Catholic investing have been clearly articulated in recent years, sources told CNA that many Catholic entities still have a long way to go to make sure their investments actually align with those principles. Case in point: when Daniel Catone, founder of Arimathea Investing, and his team of financial experts started digging into the finances of Catholic entities who approached them, they discovered something extraordinary — and surprisingly pervasive. Nearly all of their Catholic clients, including many U.S. dioceses, were unwittingly funding — sometimes to the tune of millions of dollars — products and practices that directly contradict the faith. “We have to look at the reality of the choices that we’re making with our dollars, [because] just as Our Lord will call us to account for every careless word that comes from our mouths, so too will the Lord call us to account for every careless dollar that left our wallets,” Catone told CNA. Arimathea is just one of a growing number of Catholic firms seeking to help individuals, ministries, and dioceses align their investment portfolios with the teachings of the Catholic Church, all while seeking competitive financial returns. The Church has weighed in quite comprehensively — and quite recently — on the topic of investing, both at the level of the bishops of the United States in 2021 and at the worldwide level with the 2022 Vatican document Mensuram Bonam. Mensuram Bonam — the title of which means “a good measure” — casts a wide net, exhorting investors to consider the ethics and consequences of their actions, especially how their investment choices will affect the world’s most vulnerable. It emphasizes that Catholic investors should seek not only to avoid harm but also actively promote good. The document identifies a set of core principles for investors rooted in Catholic social teaching. The principles include the recognition of the dignity of every human being; promoting the common good; working in solidarity with the most vulnerable; caring for the environment; and subsidiarity — the idea that decision-making should be done at the most appropriate level. The guidelines also lay out specific exclusionary criteria that Catholic investors need to be aware of and screen for. These include the funding of abortion, armaments, nuclear weapons, contraceptives, embryonic stem cell research, pornography, addictive substances, human rights violations such as breaches of labor laws, corruption, and unfair business practices. The development of Mensuram Bonam was prompted, in part, by a controversy in recent years over the Vatican’s own investments. In April 2021, an Italian investigative news program accused the Vatican’s treasury of investing 20 million euros (then around $24 million) in several pharmaceutical companies involved in making emergency contraception, or the “morning-after pill.” A subsequent 2022 policy was drawn up mandating that the Holy See’s financial investments cannot contradict Catholic teaching. The U.S. Catholic bishops’ “Socially Responsible Investment Guidelines,” released in 2021, applies to the U.S. investment landscape many similar concepts found within the latter-written Mensuram Bonam. (Story continues below) The bishops urge the importance of discerning whether investments will protect human life, which means avoiding any company involved in abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide, embryonic stem cell research, human cloning, and other practices the Church teaches to be evil. At the same time, investors must endeavor to promote human dignity and the common good, the bishops wrote. This means Catholic investors should avoid companies known to persistently violate the human rights of their workers or who operate in countries with poor human rights records. Companies with ties to pornography, human trafficking, or a non-Catholic view of gender identity and expression should be avoided, the bishops noted. This also means eschewing investments in certain “harmful habitual behaviors” and “addictive materials” such as gambling, tobacco, and recreational drugs; also firearms, the bishops said, except for legitimate hunting, military, or law enforcement use. At the same time, the bishops urged investors to support positive things such as renewable energy sources; biodiversity and water resources; affordable housing; and, in the face of an often negative outlook from many Hollywood productions, virtuous media that strengthens families and contributes to a more positive and humane culture. After a successful two-decade career in finance overseeing billions of dollars in investments, Catone, who has a master’s degree in theology, went all-in on what he calls “faithful investing.” He founded Arimathea in 2023 as an asset management company that conducts in-depth, tech-forward research to ensure its clients’ portfolios — “dollars meant to be used for the people of God” — are truly Catholic-aligned. By trusting large secular firms like BlackRock or Morgan Stanley to manage their money, many Catholics are unknowingly funding organizations and practices that directly contradict the Church’s teachings, he reiterated, citing Arimathea’s own rigorous research. These include investments in companies like Microsoft, which not only pays for employees’ abortion travel but also has been known to violate workers’ rights in developing countries; other companies that directly cause abortions by distributing Plan B drugs; even companies such as hotel chains that directly profit off the sale of pornography, he said. “I came to the realization that the secular world was, in a way, pulling the wool over the eyes of the Catholic Church. And shocking as this may sound, most people do not become bishops because they’re really good at picking stocks, and so they rely upon the expertise of these secular organizations,” Catone said. He urged Catholics to examine their own investments, such as their 401(k), with a trusted financial adviser. “Step 1 is to stop treating our money as ‘out of sight, out of mind.’ Because the Lord is calling us to live a fully integrated life,” Catone said. “Our Lord Jesus Christ needs to be the Lord of every part of our life … and that also includes our 401(k) and our IRA. So in order to wake up, the first step is to open our eyes … because we can’t repent of what we don’t know.” On Arimathea’s website, Catholics can send their investment portfolio to the company, which will then screen it, for free, offering a kind of “report card” on the ethicality of each investment from a Catholic perspective, Catone noted. He added that Arimathea’s research is informed by a strong understanding of Catholic theology — a rarity among investment firms — as well as what he calls a “literal reading” of the 2021 USCCB document. Arimathea is also working to develop a network of accredited advisers who are trained in the principles of Catholic social teaching and can guide Catholic investors, he said. The goal is not merely to avoid “bad” companies but also actively seek out investments that promote human dignity and the common good, he emphasized. One way to do this is through proxy voting, a tool for influencing corporate behavior and promoting change from within that Catone said can be helpful in pushing companies to adopt more ethical practices. He said Catholics should be actively engaged in trying to improve the companies they invest in and have had some success at that in the past. Catone said the success Arimathea has had financially demonstrates that it is possible to invest in a way that is fully in line with the Catholic faith without sacrificing monetary returns. “What we’re trying to show at Arimathea is you can draw the line ... and say you know what? No abortion, no pornography, no drugs, no slave labor. And you know what? The returns are great,” he concluded. Shane Giblin, CEO of The Abbey Group, told CNA that the cultural milieu following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade exposed “a bit of a crisis in the area of Catholic investing.” The Abbey Group came about in the late 2010s after St. Michael’s Abbey in Orange County, California, under Giblin’s fundraising leadership, managed to raise $150 million to build a new abbey, far outpacing expectations. They started doing pro bono consulting to help other Catholic entities replicate their success, launching officially in 2020 with a goal to help worthy Catholic causes generate and grow the resources they need to fully live out their mission. The Abbey Group is selective in its projects, evaluating them based on alignment with Catholic teachings, the potential impact of their endeavors, and the strength of their leadership. Giblin said in the wake of Roe’s overturn, the “screens” that were being applied to many Catholic investment portfolios needed to be reevaluated; it wasn’t clear how effective they were, or what they were doing to potentially limit returns, he noted. The other thing that Giblin said he noticed was that many Catholic investors weren’t allocating much to private equity — the buying and selling of shares in privately-held businesses. “What we saw was a great deal of interest and encouragement in creating an alternative investment solution that is authentically Catholic, specifically something in the private equity space,” Giblin said. To address the need, Giblin said Abbey Group Capital has partnered with Carrick Capital Partners, a firm run by a faithful Catholic, to help its clients grow the money they raise — and do so in a way that aligns with the Church’s teachings. The partnership, which benefits from the spiritual guidance from the Norbertine priests at the abbey, ensures investments align with Catholic values, such as avoidance of abortion and positive support for mothers wishing to keep and raise their children, Giblin said. Giblin said he hopes their approach will inspire others in the Catholic community to adopt similar strategies, ultimately contributing to a more dynamic and competitive landscape in Catholic investing. “It seems all too often that the Catholic space has to make the decision between either being excellent or being authentically Catholic. I think that’s a problem that we need to really break ourselves out of, a dynamic we need to run away from, because they’re not mutually exclusive terms,” he said. “I’ve seen a resurgence of late that gives me a lot of hope. I think that people are starting to become far more rigorous and far more attentive to the necessity to steward these resources with a great deal of vigilance when it comes to what they’re investing in and what they’re not investing in.” Richard Todd, CEO of Innovest, a Catholic financial firm based in Colorado that manages about $50 billion, said there was little awareness of the possibility, or even the need, for Catholic-aligned investments back in 1996 when he founded his firm. But that landscape has changed significantly with the rise of large, secular investment firms “taking advantage” of trusting Catholics, he said. “The ‘other side’ has been taking advantage of Catholics for, I would say, probably the last 10 years, but very specifically in the last five,” Todd told CNA. “It used to be, as a Catholic investor, if you owned a company, you could trust management to do what’s right for the company. But it’s no longer the case because of this pressure that these large asset managers are putting on.” Todd said Innovest works with clients to develop customized investment guidelines that reflect their unique values, allowing organizations like dioceses and universities to articulate their specific ethical concerns and ensure that their investment portfolios are truly aligned with their mission. They then design diversified portfolios that include traditional stocks and bonds, along with alternative investments such as real estate, private debt, and private equity. Todd, echoing Catone, emphasized the importance of going beyond simply avoiding harmful investments, emphasizing the importance of seeking out companies that promote positive values. He said Innovest looks for companies that prioritize human flourishing and foster a strong company culture, and also reiterated the importance of Catholics with large investments using proxy voting to influence companies for the better. “Many organizations that are Catholic don’t pay any attention to proxy voting. They end up voting for things that are completely outside their values, outside Catholic values. We believe that understanding how proxies are voted is really crucial,” he said. He noted that a popular framework of values-based investing, environmental, social, and governance (ESG), also known as impact investing, can include elements that are “anti-Christian” or misaligned with Catholic values. He said he seeks to educate clients on the differences between secular investing, ESG, and Catholic investing. Like Giblin, Todd said he firmly believes that investors do not have to sacrifice financial returns to invest in alignment with Catholic values. He pointed to the rise of competent asset managers who are adept at managing Catholic-values portfolios while achieving market-competitive or even superior results compared with secular portfolios. “I think, though, that there are [still] very few in the Catholic world that think this way. I think we’re in the first inning,” Todd said. “There are some, I think, that are moving in this direction that are prominent and well known. Our hope is that their courage will help lead others to really take a serious look at the way they manage their money. But there’s a lot to be done.” Your monthly donation will help our team continue reporting the truth, with fairness, integrity, and fidelity to Jesus Christ and his Church.

We recently published a list of 15 AI News You Should Pay Attention To. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stands against other AI news you should pay attention to. AI themes have dominated stock markets around the world over the past few months. Investment titan Blackrock recently released an investor note on the subject, stressing that as the new year unfolds, AI advancements and diplomatic developments will continue to shape the top market trends. In the note, Jay Jacobs, the US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs at the firm, stated that these two themes stayed in the limelight for virtually all of 2024 and are likely to remain in primary focus for 2025. The note further detailed that 2025 could be a pivotal year for technological progress and adoption in AI tech, as GenAI advances and more sophisticated models were combining to drive meaningful growth in AI capabilities.

Title: Wall Street Embraces MBS’s Money Man

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access After the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, business leaders made a show of shunning Saudi Arabia, doing deals only behind closed doors. Now it’s all out in the open. On November 14, Wall Street feted Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the head of Saudi Arabia’s nearly $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund and a close confidante of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud (MBS). At Cipriani—a private members’ club at 55 Wall Street—bright flowers at the center of the tables matched the ruby-red drapes. This gala, thrown by the Business Council for International Understanding, was a mark of the massive volume of Saudi investment capital percolating through the American economy. That itself isn’t new, but in recent years it’s become clear that the shame associated with Saudi funding in the wake of the grisly 2018 murder and dismemberment of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has faded. Few seemed to even notice that the governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund—which a Senate subcommittee is currently investigating for undue foreign influence in the fund’s seemingly hostile takeover of the PGA golf Tour—was receiving an award in Manhattan. On stage in Cipriani’s Greek revival ballroom, the president of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, presented Al-Rumayyan with a large crystal paperweight. Sitting with them at the long head table was HuffPo founder Arianna Huffington, and among the hundreds of minglers making their way through the room were hedge-fund titan Ray Dalio, Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel, former Trump adviser Dina Powell McCormick, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi. The evening’s theme—“Champions of Change: Values in Practice”—couldn’t have been more incongruous for Al-Rumayyan, the billionaire lieutenant to one of the world’s most brutal rulers. (I had hoped to attend in person to investigate whether anyone there had qualms about honoring MBS’s money man. Sadly, I was told that the proceedings were closed to journalists.) But the whole event managed to avoid greater scrutiny because Saudi power in the United States, under successive presidents, has become so normalized. In 2023 alone, the Public Investment Fund spent $31.6 billion worldwide, and it currently holds about $20 billion worth of US stocks. Beyond its vanity projects like the futuristic city of Neom or its gifting of $2 billion to Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, PIF is planning a staggering $40 billion AI fund. Meanwhile, its venture capital arm has doled out about $3 billion a year to Wall Street stalwarts and the entire universe of private equity and venture capital firms powering Silicon Valley. “There’s no distinction between the [Saudi fund’s] money and the de facto ruler, who is Mohammed bin Salman,” Hala Aldosari, a Saudi activist living in exile in the US, told me. This is not just a Trump phenomenon. President Joe Biden’s about-face—capped by fist-bumping MBS on a visit to the kingdom in 2022 that broke with his campaign pledge to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah”—explicitly gave American business permission to go all in. Since Israel launched its war on Gaza, the Biden administration has further revived MBS’s global stature and tamped down its already muted human rights rhetoric. As Aldosari put it, “It’s going to get worse with Trump now, but in terms of US foreign policy in the Middle East, it’s very much problematic regardless of the political party.” In anticipation, many American and international companies are already expanding their dealings in Saudi Arabia. Even the consultancy founded by the late Madeleine Albright, which long held itself out as a values-driven firm, just opened a headquarters in Riyadh. In Saudi Arabia, basic freedoms have not improved since Khashoggi was lured inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and murdered. The regime’s crackdown on women’s rights activists has accelerated. “It’s the worst we’ve ever seen,” Aldosari says. Prison sentences are getting longer even for relatively low-profile cases, as part of what she calls the regime’s “systematic approach” to snuffing out dissent. She cited two women recently prosecuted for their tweets, notably Nourah al-Qahtani, who was jailed for 45 years and Salma al-Shehab, who received 34 years. Plus, earlier this year, a Saudi cartoonist named Al-Hazza was sentenced to 23 years. In a new report, Human Rights Watch documents how the Public Investment Fund has enabled internal clampdowns in Saudi Arabia. Drawing upon newly released court documents, Human Rights Watch notes that Al-Rumayyan was a key figure in the 2017 Ritz roundup in which 200 wealthy Saudi royals and businesspeople were detained and blackmailed in the luxury hotel in Riyadh. While it’s tough to get American business to care about issues of global human rights, the risks inherent in working in an autocracy might get their attention. Human Rights Watch details how the state has repeatedly expropriated the assets of people and companies, without due process. One Saudi entrepreneur based in the US (who would speak to me only on the condition of anonymity) emphasized that Western corporations that engage with the Saudi sovereign wealth fund are exposed to financial as well as reputational risks. “By associating with a fund connected to human rights abuses, they face increasing backlash from investors, consumers, and global stakeholders demanding ethical accountability,” he told me. “The absence of reliable dispute resolution mechanisms in Saudi Arabia leaves companies vulnerable to arbitrary practices, such as unjust expropriations, without any credible options for redress.” But investment capital apparently remains in short supply, and Al-Rummayan’s sovereign wealth purse holds $925 billion. (He also chairs the national oil company, Saudi Aramco.) In the months following Khashoggi’s assassination, business and finance leaders only quietly sealed deals with Saudi Arabia; now it’s out in the open. The Ritz Carlton, the site of MBS’s five-star detention facility, is once again home to big business. In late October, a think tank connected to Al-Rumayyan’s sovereign wealth fund hosted its annual summit in Riyadh, known as Davos in the Desert. In the room were billionaires Dalio, Larry Fink, Ken Griffin, Marc Rowan, Eric Schmidt, and Steve Schwarzman. Elon Musk, who has also benefited from Saudi financial largesse, took the time to appear by video. The public panels focused on innovation and financial trends while studiously avoiding politics, yet there were, as ever, moments that revealed why they had really gathered in Saudi Arabia. David Rubenstein, the Carlyle billionaire who as recently as last year played host to the Biden family for Thanksgiving at his Nantucket retreat, has become a regular of these Saudi events. Moderating a panel, Rubenstein began by flattering the host—or perhaps calling the event for what it is. “Let me ask Yasir,” Rubenstein began, “is the biggest problem with being the governor of the PIF fund that you don’t have enough requests for money?” Al-Rumayyan laughed, but the numbers are nothing to joke about. Attendees told The New York Times that just a small check from him could amount to $100 million. The Saudi fund’s venture arm notes on its website 143 startups, investment funds, and real estate companies that it’s currently backing. Among those listed: Rowan’s Apollo, Schmidt’s Innovation Endeavors, and Schwarzman’s Blackstone. Fink’s BlackRock received $5 billion from the PIF for a new investment platform. PIF says that $70 billion of agreements were inked at the October confab, including a partnership between the Saudi fund and Google Cloud to “advance AI research in Arabic-language models,” according to the company. Its president and chief investment officer, Ruth Porat, sat on the panel with Al-Rumayyan in Riyadh. A few weeks later, the Google executive presented him with the Eisenhower Award for Global Transformation in New York, for “values in practice.” But what values does Saudi investment represent beyond the value of money? Juan David Rojas John Nichols Elie Mystal Books & the Arts / Zoe Adams Expect to see more of the Saudi sovereign-wealth kingmaker. Days later at Madison Square Garden, Al-Rumayyan chatted with President-elect Trump at an Ultimate Fighting Championship match, with Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy nearby. It’s likely that in Trump’s second term there will be many more galas for Al-Rumayyan, with a full state visit for MBS on the horizon. We now confront a second Trump presidency. There’s not a moment to lose. We must harness our fears, our grief, and yes, our anger, to resist the dangerous policies Donald Trump will unleash on our country. We rededicate ourselves to our role as journalists and writers of principle and conscience. Today, we also steel ourselves for the fight ahead. It will demand a fearless spirit, an informed mind, wise analysis, and humane resistance. We face the enactment of Project 2025, a far-right supreme court, political authoritarianism, increasing inequality and record homelessness, a looming climate crisis, and conflicts abroad. The Nation will expose and propose, nurture investigative reporting, and stand together as a community to keep hope and possibility alive. The Nation’s work will continue—as it has in good and not-so-good times—to develop alternative ideas and visions, to deepen our mission of truth-telling and deep reporting, and to further solidarity in a nation divided. Armed with a remarkable 160 years of bold, independent journalism, our mandate today remains the same as when abolitionists first founded The Nation—to uphold the principles of democracy and freedom, serve as a beacon through the darkest days of resistance, and to envision and struggle for a brighter future. The day is dark, the forces arrayed are tenacious, but as the late Nation editorial board member Toni Morrison wrote “No! This is precisely the time when artists go to work. There is no time for despair, no place for self-pity, no need for silence, no room for fear. We speak, we write, we do language. That is how civilizations heal.” I urge you to stand with The Nation and donate today.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Phillip Securities downgraded the stock to Accumulate from Buy with a price target of $160, up from $155, following the Q3 report. The advisory cites the recent movement in the shares for the downgrade. It also lowered margin assumptions for fiscal 2026 to reflect management guidance of lower margins due to Blackwell products. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are trending on financial media. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock. READ NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock. Disclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey. The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Today, Millennium has over $70 billion in assets under management and is one of the world's largest hedge funds. Investors should understand that Millennium is a "pod shop," which means it allocates capital to different teams (or "pods") that all have their own strategies and a lot of autonomy. In the third quarter, Millennium sold large portions of its stakes in artificial intelligence (AI) companies Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Palantir (NYSE: PLTR) and bought a new stock that Wall Street thinks can soar. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. There are currently eight publicly traded companies with market caps of $1 trillion or more: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Berkshire Hathaway. Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the world's biggest retailer and the largest company in the world by revenue, has quietly blown away the rest of the retail sector in recent years as its commitment to omnichannel sales and reputation for everyday low prices have delivered steady growth. Walmart reported another round of strong quarterly results on Tuesday morning. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. Markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. Earnings from retailers and October inflation data will be the week's highlights. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) did it again. Shares pulled back slightly on the news as investors have gotten accustomed to the chip titan regularly besting expectations, and some analysts wanted to see stronger fourth-quarter guidance, which called for $37.5 billion in revenue -- a 70% increase from the quarter a year ago. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is now worth $3.5 trillion. One FAANG stock was unceremoniously left out of the "Magnificent Seven." That was a costly blunder.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Trending on Financial Media. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks that are trending on financial media. The AI revolution has disrupted the technology industry, propelling memory chip firms into the spotlight after decades spent in the shadows of semiconductors and software giants. In order to understand the importance of memory chips to AI, investors should reflect on the centrality of data storage to AI technology. Memory chips store data that is used by AI firms for training models and storing parameters. News agency Reuters recently reported that Kioxia, a Japanese memory chip firm, is set to debut on the stock market with an initial valuation of close to $5 billion. In October, the firm had postponed plans for an IPO at double this valuation. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Private equity firm Bain Capital is one of the most prominent backers of Kioxia. The latter is among the largest makers of NAND flash memory in the world. NAND quality directly affects the processing speed and overall performance of AI models. Bain led a consortium to acquire Kioxia from Toshiba for $18 billion in 2018. The private equity firm has tried twice to get the memory chipmaker listed on the stock exchange, once in 2018 and then again earlier this year.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stands against the other AI stocks that are on Wall Street's Radar. Latest reports from tech news platform TechCrunch indicate that MatX, a chip-design startup focused on supporting large language models, has raised $80 million in a funding round. This follows the $25 million seed round it held less than a year ago. The latest round, led by Spark Capital, values the company at a pre-money valuation in the mid-$200 million range and a post-money valuation in the low $300 million range, per TechCrunch.

Per the report, the chipmaker said it is also evaluating the future of its 50-acre Hawthorn Farm property and working to consolidate its footprint at its Silicon Valley headquarters.

Title: American Tower Corporation (AMT): Are Hedge Funds Bullish On This Real Estate and Realty Stock?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Real Estate and Realty Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) stands against the other real estate and realty stocks. As reported by Realtor, America’s newly elected president Trump has blamed illegal immigration for the country’s housing affordability crisis since these immigrants are in the race for an already short supply of homes and hence, plans to do the largest deportation operation in American history. It is important to consider that the recent post-pandemic surging home prices started off before the illegal immigration levels climbed. Furthermore, Realtor.com senior economist Ralph McLaughlin referred to this move as something that would create negative consequences for the housing market by stating: “In the short run, reducing immigration could severely hurt the labor supply needed for new homebuilding since up to a third of residential construction employment consists of foreign-born workers” Simultaneously, Trump wants to cut regulations and permit requirements that add unnecessary costs to new homes. Regarding this, economists believe that although reduced regulations might lower homebuilding costs, they would neither solve the entire housing crisis nor fulfill Trump’s dream of cutting the cost of a new home in half by eliminating regulations. Mortgage rates are directly tied to 10-year Treasury bond yields which tend to grow with investors forecasting stronger economic growth and higher inflation. According to Mortgage News Daily, the 30-year fixed mortgage rates briefly rose, settling at 6.98% following Trump’s victory. Despite two rate cuts by the Fed, the rate has surged by almost 1% since the month of September. Trump has also stated his enthusiasm related to somehow lowering mortgage rates, without a clear mechanism unveiled as of yet. Economists and analysts believe that the President’s economic agenda could potentially lead to a surge in mortgage rates. Trump has plans to reduce tax rates, impose tariffs on foreign goods, and ease regulations, policies that are going to lead to a rise in inflation and government debt, which is going to drive up the interest rates and mortgage rates. Before the elections, 16 Nobel Prize-winning economists agreed that Trump's policies would fuel inflation, calling Joe Biden's economic agenda vastly superior to Donald Trump's. Doug Bauer, CEO of Tri Pointe Homes, joined CNBC to discuss what’s next for the US housing market. He sees the lower corporate tax and the easing of regulations for banks as positives. With banks being encouraged to put dollars into all businesses especially the land and land development business to small and medium-sized builders, it is going to help the industry as a whole. Regarding the deportation, he believes the discussion is pretty early but his company, as a larger builder, has not faced any problems on the labor side of the equation. Finally, he mentioned that the core issue remains the supply. While a reduction in interest rates would unlock the resale market, the new homebuilding is a 'state and local issue' as there are a lot of regulations pulling back the land that could be utilized to build affordable housing. Ivy Zelman, Zelman and Associates CEO, also appeared on an interview with CNBC, to reiterate Bauer’s point about the issue regarding the new home market. In her opinion, the housing market weakness is at the entry level while the move-up market remains strong and resilient despite rates moving higher. While first-time homebuyers are facing extreme affordability issues, she thinks cities and municipalities could partner with local builders to utilize land that’s not out so far in the rural areas and that the solution lies at the local government level. Trump also plans to open up federal land for building. However, a limitation of this would be a lack of federal land located near the places where people wish to work and live. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we first use a stock screener to make an extended list of the relevant companies with the highest market caps. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide angled view of a high-rise office building, the windows reflecting a nearby cityscape. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 73 American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts founded in 1995 as an American Radio subsidiary. The firm offers services and solutions to deploy and support wireless networks in 24 countries across six continents. It has a portfolio of independently owned US and international tower real estate and a network of data centers in the US. AMT’s customers include mobile network operators, multinational telecommunications companies, media and broadband providers, and government agencies. The ongoing exponential growth in mobile data consumption has driven AMT’s performance in the US. The company’s performance is backed up by the strong underlying demand for its portfolio of communications assets. Its synergy revolves around having that global expertise and experience enabling it to navigate operational risks in new markets while simultaneously creating opportunities. With a resilient demand and strength of underlying fundamentals across the portfolio, AMT is well positioned. The company is pursuing long-term growth by managing its diverse markets. AMT has planned to reduce its exposure to emerging markets which are more vulnerable to the macro environment as the firm continues to focus on incremental investments in developed economies. In September, AMT closed the sale of operations in India to Data Infrastructure Trust, an Infrastructure Investment Trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management. For the third quarter of 2024, the firm’s total revenue grew by less than 0.1% to $2,522 million while net income and adjusted EBITDA declined. As emphasized by CEO Steven Vondran, the carrier rollouts of 5G coverage tend to support robust activity levels in the United States and Europe while demand for AMT’s global portfolio of communications infrastructure assets is evident. Hence, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a leading independent owner, operator, and developer of multi-tenant communications real estate, having a solid portfolio of over 148,000 communications sites and a highly interconnected footprint of US data center facilities. Overall AMT ranks 1st on our list of the best real estate and realty stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

AMT is likely to gain from the solid demand for wireless connectivity and capital allocation strategy despite customer concentration and consolidation. If you're an investor looking for high-yield investments with some solid upside potential, there is perhaps no better place to look than the energy midstream space. The sector has gone through a transformation in the past decade, with midstream companies reducing leverage and being more disciplined when it comes to funding growth projects. Against that backdrop, let's look a three great MLPs -- Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), and Western Midstream (NYSE: WES) -- investors might want to consider buying and holding forever. Englander has taken a contrarian approach by selling Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock in favor of a premier healthcare company that's more than 90% below its all-time high. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. Many of the world's largest technology companies are spending boatloads of money to fill their data centers with those chips as they jostle for leadership in the AI race. As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue generated triple-digit percentage growth in each of the last six quarters. Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management just raised the fund's position in foundry specialist Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. It remains to be seen if Super Micro can still take care of its paperwork in time to satisfy the Nasdaq. Vertiv and Target have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Consider, for example, that a study by Hartford Funds and Ned Davis Research found that between 1973 and 2023, companies that grew or initiated dividend payments delivered annualized returns of 10.2%, while dividend non-payers delivered only 4.3% (and an equal-weight S&P 500 fund averaged 7.7%). Healthy and growing dividend payers will tend to have stock prices that rise over time, while paying dividends that are also increased over time. Given that stock profile, you might think it's smart to snap up the fattest dividend yields you can find -- perhaps focusing on the biggest dividend yields in the S&P 500. The disconnect between policymakers’ housing aspirations and market realities continues widening, with October’s housing starts and permits dropping to recession-level figures despite widespread calls for increased construction.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Lightning Round: 9 Stocks in Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) stands against the other stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently discussed a market trend that's been generating impressive gains, especially when investors target heavily shorted stocks. He explained the phenomenon as he said that investors find success by betting that these companies are in better shape than short sellers expect. According to Cramer, this approach has led to some significant wins in recent times. He pointed out the behavior of short sellers, noting that when things go wrong for them, they panic. “The shorts always panic when their trades fall apart because, unlike longs, if you're a short seller, you can lose a lot more than a hundred percent of your investment if the stock goes up too much.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Nvidia Plus Other Stocks and Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 7 Stocks Cramer also highlighted that while short sellers can profit when a company fails, it’s a risky game with significant asymmetry. He explained that while a stock’s price can only fall to zero, it has the potential to rise indefinitely. Cramer cautioned that although short sellers might be hoping for a stock’s downfall, they are equally vulnerable to the nightmare scenario of infinite losses if the stock price continues to climb. In such situations, when short sellers run out of options, they are forced to buy back shares, which can send the stock price even higher. For shareholders, this scenario can be advantageous. While short sellers may be a threat when predicting a stock’s decline, their need to buy back shares can act like rocket fuel for the stock’s price when good news emerges. “If you're a shareholder, they're your worst enemy when they're talking about a stock going to zero. But once the stock starts soaring on any good news, the shorts are your best friend because their forced buying is like rocket fuel and they can't stop the propulsion while you just get to go along for the ride.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 9 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the recent episodes of Mad Money. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the third quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Oil derricks in the background with a few workers in the foreground, emphasizing the company’s oil and gas production activities. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71 When Cramer was asked about Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), he questioned why Buffett was a buyer of the stock. “I think it's okay… it's Warren Buffett's oil. I don't know why he anointed this one, but he’s anointed it, he got a very good preferred deal. Look, Coterra is the way I like to do this thing… And by the way, they are not climate deniers, all right. Coterra is run by Tom Jorden. The stock is really on a tear lately because people realize the last acquisition… brought… a lot more oil so that the portfolio between oil and natural gas is much more balanced. It's a buy.” Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is involved in the acquisition, exploration, and development of oil and gas properties, as well as the production of chemicals and the transportation and marketing of oil, gas, and related products. According to Insider Monkey’s data, Berkshire Hathaway owned 255.28 million shares of the company worth $13.157 billion in the third quarter. For the third quarter, it posted earnings of $0.98 per diluted share, significantly surpassing analysts' expectations, largely due to its effective cost management practices. In terms of cash flow, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) generated $3.8 billion in operating cash flow for the third quarter. The company’s production during the period averaged 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), surpassing the midpoint of its production guidance by 22,000 BOE/d. Overall OXY ranks 1st on our list of the stocks featured in Jim Cramer's Lightning Round. While we acknowledge the potential of OXY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25 Talking about MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), Cramer remarked: “I've gotta tell you, it's a Bitcoin play. I prefer to actually own Bitcoin. I know that Citron put some sort of short on it. All I can tell you is own Bitcoin. That's a winner.” MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) provides AI-powered enterprise analytics software and services. It is also known for its involvement in Bitcoin development. Recently, it faced a setback in its stock performance after Citron Research announced its decision to bet against the company. According to a post made by Citron on X, the company has transitioned into a Bitcoin investment fund, and its business operations are no longer closely tied to its software offerings. The post criticized the company's increasing focus on Bitcoin investment, stating that the company’s market volume had become detached from Bitcoin's underlying fundamentals. While Citron Research expressed continued confidence in Bitcoin's future, the firm revealed that it had hedged its position with a short position on the stock. On November 22, appearing on CNBC's 'Squawk Box', Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), described the company's approach to generating revenue by focusing on its role as a Bitcoin Treasury company. He explained that the company earns money by selling the volatility of Bitcoin and reinvesting the proceeds back into the cryptocurrency. He said that in addition, the company strips the volatility, risk, and performance from fixed-income securities, transferring those factors to common stocks. Saylor noted that critics who short the stock believe that if the premium on the equity disappears, the company won’t be able to make money. However, he argued that they overlook the strategy where, when borrowing money at 6% and investing it in Bitcoin, the company stands to gain significantly. For example, if Bitcoin appreciates by 30% or even 60%, MicroStrategy could realize a 90% spread on Bitcoin, compared to an 80% spread.

Title: ‘Housing? I have to admit to being comfortable and it’s not affecting me’: Polarised views in south and west Dublin

As voters do their ‘big shop’ on the final Saturday before going to the polls, concerns in divergent parts of Dublin are notably different. The housing crisis is mentioned in both south county and west Dublin, but it and the cost of living preoccupy more minds in the latter. “Getting our own house is not on the cards at all,” says Anna Raymond outside the main supermarket on Neilstown Road. The area, comprised mainly of local authority housing, is classified by the independent agency Pobal, drawing on Census 2022 data, as “very disadvantaged”. Ms Raymond, shopping with her partner Sean Kearney and their baby Leopold, explains they live with his parents in a three-bedroom council house. “Sean’s brother just moved out so the baby is going to have his own bedroom. The cost of living is so much – food, going out, everything.” The working couple are concerned about “the rise” of the far-right. “We will be voting left anyway. We know Gino Kenny [TD, People Before Profit]. He has been really good in the community for years,” says Ms Raymond. “And Sinn Féin. Mark Ward all the way,” adds Mr Kearney, referring to one of the party’s two TDs and candidates in this Dublin Mid West constituency. Housing, the cost of living and immigration concern Paddy Reilly, a truck driver in his 60s. “It seems the Government are looking after immigrants instead of their own first. I am feeling it and seeing it. “I am on a tight budget. Socialising is out the window. You can’t go out, so you lose out on friends. That is lonely of course. The only time I go out is to go to work. The price of groceries is very high, very. “I would have been Sinn Féin but not now,” he continues. “I am voting for the Irish Freedom Party.” Referencing the party’s candidate, councillor Glen Moore, Mr Reilly says: “He’s speaking for the people. He’s good and people are voting for him.” Rob, in his 40s, did not want to give a surname. He has had to move back in with his parents. “It’s virtually impossible for anyone of my age to get on the housing ladder. I don’t want to live in shared accommodation with strangers. My vote won’t be for any of the big parties. I love Gino [Kenny]. I think he’s great.” For Jacqueline Smith too, housing is the number one issue. Her five sons, the oldest in his 40s, live with her in a three-bedroom council house. “It is stressful. They were born in the area and can’t live in it – can’t get anywhere to rent. The cost of living? Don’t even go there. I’ll vote Sinn Féin. I want to see a change.” Thirty kilometres away in a part of South Dublin classified by Pobal as “affluent”, shoppers in Blackrock shopping centre are concerned with wasteful public spending, a lack of long-term planning and taxes. “The local issue for me is the swimming pool in Stillorgan,” says Bernie Collins, retired insurance worker. “It’s closed ten years and nobody is doing anything about it. Housing? I have to admit to being comfortable and it’s not affecting me. It’s a pity people can’t get on the housing [ladder] but people have to get out and work, get off the dole. Money is handed out too handy, in my opinion.” Scott Graham and Ally Mulrooney, both 21, say “mainly housing” is deciding their votes. “I live at home but eventually I will need to move out,” says Mr Graham. His girlfriend is renting a room in a house near Croke Park for €800 a month. “We don’t even have a sittingroom,” she says. “I have looked at rents,” says Mr Graham. “I couldn’t afford to pay more than €1,000 and there’s nothing. I work part-time. I like the policies of the Social Democrats. I feel like they have a chance, I want a different tack to be taken. Sinn Féin? I think my parents would disown me if I voted for them.” A woman in her 60s who did not give her name said: “I’d like to see a party with a plan instead of smarties being given out in the budget. I’d like to see a vision and I don’t see that.” Brendan Nicholson, in his 60s, is “okay financially”. He wants to see more “strategic thinking” and less “giving away money to buy votes . . . It’s coming back to the time of Bertie [Ahern] when they thought they were flush [with stamp duty returns].” Young couple Ger and Roisín Cronin, expecting a baby, “luckily” own their home. “Across the board things are getting more expensive and there doesn’t seem to be much coming back,” says Mr Cronin. “We get taxed quite a lot, the USC is still there, and we don’t really see much in return.” Gavin O’Leary, from Rathcoole owns a marketing business. He “fortunately” has a house and a mortgage he can sustain. “Our children are young – won’t need housing for a while. I work really hard, don’t get days off, so we have enough. Traditionally we’d be a Fine Gael household,” he continues. A Fianna Fáil candidate who helped with speed bumps on his road, however, will get his vote on Friday.

Title: Ukrainian woman (50s) arrested for allegedly trespassing former State-provided accommodation

A Ukrainian woman in her 50s who was evicted from State-provided accommodation for failing to pay a daily contribution fee has been arrested and remanded in custody for allegedly trespassing her former accommodation. Tetiana Kiselova was evicted from her accommodation in Dublin city on November 15th after failing to pay the €10 fee before then seeking shelter at a site she had lived in prior, in Blackrock, Co Dublin. At Dún Laoghaire District Court last week, Ms Kiselova was charged with trespassing the building in such a manner that caused or was likely to cause fear in another person. She was remanded in custody until November 25th. Since March, social welfare payments for Ukrainians living in State-provided accommodation were cut from €232 per week to €38.80, with the Blackrock Community Alliance believing the cut has resulted in Ukrainians failing to pay the fee. Ms Kiselova received a letter from the Department of Integration on November 12th advising that access to her room would be revoked and her room reallocated as she refused to pay the fee. She was told she would not receive any further offers of accommodation and would have to make her own arrangements. A spokesman for the Department of Integration said those residing in serviced accommodation are informed that failure to pay is considered a refusal of emergency accommodation. “In relation to the case referred to, following non-payment, the individual was supported to engage with their local Intreo office for financial support if required and provided an additional three weeks in which to make payment,” a spokesman said. “Despite this, the individual refused to pay the contribution.” The mandatory daily contribution fee of €10 was introduced in 2022 for those fleeing the war in Ukraine and applies to serviced accommodation such as hotels and B&Bs where self-catering options are not available. The spokesman said the department does not collate data on the number of accommodation refusals linked to non-payment of the charge. As the accommodation site in Blackrock where Ms Kiselova was found trespassing is no longer under contract with the Department of Integration, it said it could not comment on events following her eviction. The building was under contract until it was ended in October as part of the consolidation of the accommodation portfolio for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. Last month, buses arrived to the property in Blackrock to take 29 Ukrainians to alternative accommodation. The majority of the group, who had been living in the building since arriving to Ireland in 2022, refused to board the buses despite being told they would not receive subsequent offers of accommodation. The 20 Ukrainians who refused to board the buses, including six children attending local schools, have been hosted at the property by the owners while they try to seek a solution, according to Blackrock Community Alliance. However, applications for the accommodation recognition payment were refused this week, while rent supplement applications have also been rejected by the Department of Social Protection. A letter issued to local representatives and general election candidates by Blackrock Community Alliance said: “The owners offered in September to host the group for two months until November 28th, allowing three months to get clarity from the departments on how the group of 20 can be accommodated. This arrangement expires next week. The group is seeking support from local representatives to find solutions to the crisis.” Jack White is a reporter for The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Ireland hockey star Hannah McLoughlin leaves home comforts behind as she bids to realise her potential in Belgium

Dubliner hopes to reach great heights with lessons from the low countries Hannah McLoughlin poses with Irish team-mates Ellen Curran (right) and Sarah Torrans (left) after Gantoise's won 4-1 win against Waterloo Ducks last week Hannah McLoughlin's spot in the dressing room. Hannah McLoughlin is a Davy ambassador. Davy is proud to support young Irish athletes. In her continuing quest to improve, Ireland international hockey star Hannah McLoughlin upped sticks and moved to the professional hockey outfit Gantoise in Ghent, Belgium this past August. Her decision came off the back of a loss in Olympic qualifiers against Spain in a penalty shoot-out. “I went to answer the question, ‘how good can I be?’” McLoughlin says. She knew the infrastructure was world-class in Belgium having introduced equal pay for male and female players two years ago, which would offer the step up her game required. A massive moment for the centre-back was getting her name on the back of the jersey. “The jersey is mine; it has my name on it. In Ireland, I would get a kit for the season and would be expected to return it if I moved club,” she says. “In Gantoise, I have a permanent locker in the female changing rooms with all my stuff in it and that will be there for the two years that I am contracted to play.” Has homesickness affected McLoughlin? “Well, I’ve never been on a J1 as I chose to play hockey during the summers. I was away for six weeks in Bali two years ago but am an only child and very close to my parents. “I think between my parents they have missed two games in the last 12 years. I thought moving would be tougher, but I am quite an independent person, and I love being in control of my day” she said. The Dubliner began playing when she was 12 years old and was earmarked as a natural talent. Now playing centre-back, her skill is clearly on show but matched in equal part by a quiet professionalism. Belgium made it to the semi-finals of the Olympics this year, losing to China and are currently ranked No 3 in the world. The professional league means McLoughlin’s time is no longer divided between work and sport. After studying economics and finance in UCD she went straight on to the Davy internship and got a flexible working agreement. The centre-back noted balancing work and sport is a challenge Irish players face: “it’s hard to approach an employer when you are playing professionally”. For a 24-year-old it’s daunting to move country but the gains proved too tantalising. Club facilities at Gantoise include meeting rooms, performance rehabilitation on site and a water-based pitch (an international-standard pitch, most pitches in Ireland are not water-based). Hannah McLoughlin's spot in the dressing room. Her new club Gantoise have won the past four league titles, so expectations and standards are high. Part of moving country is acclimatising to the culture you land in, and in this regard the Belgians are very different. According to McLoughlin, “relative to Ireland they are a lot more laid-back”. The young hockey star says they express their feelings in a different manner. “They are incredibly direct, but there is no bad feeling about it.” In Ireland, there is a sense of, “God, if I give feedback to a fellow player, they will get upset with me”, she says. In her new club, McLoughlin is expected to speak up if she has an issue, to hold it in is seen as a negative. A new culture, location and team-mates also has its challenges. She moved in August and says: “I’ve settled in really well”. It is a one hour, 15-minute flight from her local airport to Dublin and having six Irish players on the team has made the transition easier. “The club set me up with a car, accommodation support and a salary, so I can focus solely on the game”. Adjusting to a fully professional set-up may be daunting in terms of workload but increased specialisation has advantages. “I do three trainings a week, one extra technical session, two strength sessions, a video session and maybe one individual mobility session,” she adds. Hannah McLoughlin is a Davy ambassador. Davy is proud to support young Irish athletes. The Blackrock native says that being fully pro means you can be more focused. “I have a lot more time to cook so my nutrition is a lot better.” Being on the pitch with world-class players means intense focus on the finer details, one of which is nutrition. “I am still in contact with the Sport Ireland nutritionist, and I have a lot more time to cook from scratch. In Ireland, I used to meal prep a lot more. When asked where she wants to be in five years, McLoughlin says: “I have been to a World Cup, an Olympics and I play week in, week out with some of the world’s best players. I just want to get better, faster, as these are absolutely necessary when I am called back for international duties.” McLoughlin’s overall sense of Belgians is: “people back their strengths a lot more here. In something as simple as fashion, no two people are wearing the same thing, they [Belgians]are less concerned with how they are being perceived”. Gantoise’s newest signing gives a window into how she spends her downtime. “I would often go out for meals on my own, read a book, I’m less self-conscious here about ‘are people looking at me?’ than in Ireland.” McLoughlin’s goal is clear to build skills and bring them back to the Irish team. She is contracted for Gantoise for the next two years, like Irish football players of old seeking tougher competition in the Premier League. Steel sharpens steel and no doubt this move will enrich Ireland’s hockey future.

The world’s largest digital asset is trading just below $98,000 after falling to a three-day low of $95,800, according to CoinGecko data. The dip sent long liquidations soaring to an 11-day high above $344 million while shorts coughed up around 136 million, CoinGlass data shows. Analysts expect much of the same witnessed over the last two weeks, with demand from retail and institutional investors likely unaffected by intraday swings. “As we continue to see strong demand for Bitcoin alongside further easing of monetary policy by global central banks, prices are likely to remain supported as we approach the end of the year,” QCP Capital wrote in a note last week. Investor sentiment continues to be bolstered by favorable tailwinds stemming from the incoming Donald Trump administration, with the President-elect having vowed to drive a crypto agenda. Wall Street’s top cop, the Securities and Exchange Commission, will also have a change of guard following Trump’s inauguration on January 20. Chair Gary Gensler announced his decision to resign from the post last week after years of backlash from the crypto community for what they termed as a heavy-handed approach to regulation through litigation. On the campaign trail, Trump promised to fire Gensler if elected to the Whitehouse, much to the applaud of a packed crowd during the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville in July. Now, Trump will get to choose a new agency head, which has spurned speculation of an industry-favorable pick, perceived by many to take a lighter touch on digital assets. That optimism has spread to other assets, including XRP, which lept to a three-year high at $1.59 on Friday as speculation grew that the SEC would withdraw its case against the asset's steward, Ripple Labs. There’s also soaring demand for U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, particularly from BlackRock, which continues to top the list among 11 other rivals in inflows and trading volume. Options trading on some of those products are also helping to drive price volatility, analysts previously told Decrypt, with much of the activity focused on further upside in coming months.

Title: Bitcoin’s rally stalls after nearing the historic $100k level

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin steadied after a rally toward $100,000 fizzled just shy of the historic level, as traders assess whether optimism stemming from President-elect Donald Trump’s support for crypto is becoming stretched. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Record NYC Thanksgiving Travel Signals Airport, Traffic Mess Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. The digital asset fell as low as $96,580 on Monday after coming within $300 of the six-figure milestone on Friday. It was changes hands at around $97,000 as of 9:44 a.m. Monday in New York, as Trump’s pick of hedge fund executive Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary helped sentiment in global markets. Investors are worried Bitcoin “will have to take a breather now that it has basically tested the $100,000 level,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co, adding that bullishness around Bitcoin “is getting extreme.” Trump’s incoming US administration is viewed as a crypto tailwind across Wall Street and beyond. The overall value of the digital-asset market has surged about $1 trillion since the Republican’s victory on Nov. 5. Trump’s Agenda Trump has promised friendlier regulations and pledged to set up a national Bitcoin stockpile, though the timeline for implementation and the feasibility of the Bitcoin reserve remain open questions. “I’m seeing an increasing skew to the sell side as we near the $100,000 mark,” said David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX. “This suggests we may experience consolidation around this level in the near term before a sustained breakthrough above it.” Traders had seized on the US crypto outlook to push Bitcoin to the verge of $100,000, a symbolic level that for crypto supporters repudiates skeptics who see little intrinsic value in digital assets. Cantor Talks The latest developments included a Bloomberg News report that Cantor Fitzgerald LP is in talks with Tether Holdings Ltd. about receiving support from the stablecoin issuer for Cantor’s planned lending program for clients who put up Bitcoin as collateral. Cantor’s Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick is co-chair of Trump’s transition team and the president-elect’s pick to run the Commerce Department. The transition team has also held discussions over whether to create the first-ever White House post dedicated to digital-asset policy. Cash has poured into US exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin since Trump’s win, and the products have now amassed $107 billion in assets. “Bitcoin was extremely overbought since the election, it was bound to stall out,” said Stephane Ouellette, chief executive officer at crypto investment firm FRNT Financial Inc. “That said, this is barely a pullback, we’re just back at levels from mid-last week.” --With assistance from Sidhartha Shukla.

Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Lightcoin have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. While digital currencies across the board have divided opinion between financial institutions, and now have a market cap of around 175 Billion USD, the crypto sector coninues to grow, as it sees wider mainstreem adoption. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images) Corporate buyers and headlines aside, state-based bitcoin acquisitions could play a critical role in the bitcoin market going forward. As bitcoin continues to flirt with the $100,000 level, the discussion and interest in bitcoin and other cryptoassets continues to increase. Building on the momentum built during the campaign of now President-Elect Trump, the buzz around the possibility of positive changes at the federal level for the bitcoin industry has continued to build both on social media and in policy circles. Specifically politicians such as Senator Lummis have continued to advocate for federal legislation that would – in addition to other actions – enable the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. In addition to policymakers continuing to discuss these issues, the financial market media has also been covering the idea, with media segments focusing on the potential for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund to purchase bitcoin as its primary asset. On top of these developments the TradFi investment into crypto continues to accelerate. Specifical examples include the approval of spot ETF options issued by Blackrock, following the accelerant provided to adoption and prices following the approval of the spot ETFs in January 2024. With these ETFs attracting nearly $34 billion in assets since launch, surpassing gold, these are not an asset class that can be ignored. Additionally, Microstrategy announced a $1.75 billion bond issuance to purchase more bitcoin (maturing in 2029), while using proceeds from a share sale to purchase $4 billion of bitcoin. All of these activities and fund flows are reason for optimism, but another trend could both send prices higher as well as increasing the legitimacy of the asset for more mainstream investment. Let’s take a look at how the possibility of a state-based bitcoin reserve fund might play an outsized role in the bitcoin market as 2025 approaches. Perhaps the most obvious effect of the positive momentum and conversations (at both the state and federal level) will be the positive effect on the price of bitcoin, and potentially other cryptoassets more broadly. In 2024 alone the price of bitcoin has jumped from approximately $43,000 from the beginning of January to the almost $100,000 level in November, reflecting both the increased buying powered by institutional acquisition as well as the positive sentiment in the space at large. If either the U.S. federal government or state governments begin purchasing bitcoin at any significant level this will only serve to push the price higher. This development is celebratory for investors and long-term holders of bitcoin, to be sure, but also solidifies another reality of the crypto space. Bitcoin increasingly does not, despite the original intent of the cryptocurrency, appear to be forming into the currency of the future in the near to medium term. Especially since the conversation around bitcoin continues to focus on its value as an investment, hedge against inflation, or as a strategic reserve tool, the likelihood of its adoption for currency purposes continues to decrease. Price increases might be celebrated, but increasingly shifts bitcoin to an asset class versus a currency option. The pressure that is being brought to bear at the federal level to construct a pro-crypto regulatory regime, including the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve, cannot be underestimated as the Trump regime prepares to return to Washington. The crypto sector spent approximately $200 million on the most recent election cycle, and with over 200 members of Congress having received funding and support from these lobbyists the likelihood of a pro-crypto Congress is relatively high. In addition to this President-Elect Trump, while on the campaign trail, made substantial overtures and promises to the industry to support and foster innovation and growth in the United States. While individuals such as Senator Lummis continuing to pursue policy objectives such as The BITCOIN Act, which would facilitate the creation of a reserve, and discussion of a strategic bitcoin reserve continuing to grow; advisors and policy wonks would be well served to watch these conversations as they develop. Positive momentum aside, politicizing crypto – which establishing a strategic reserve at the federal level would – also opens the door to crypto being yet another political football for policymakers to debate over moving forward. This could include tweaks and changes to the tax code that become subject to the whims of the executive branch, versus IRS section updates. While the likelihood of federal action might seem virtually guaranteed to crypto proponents the reality is that the crypto sector and investing community still remains small versus TradFi markets. This is both an acknowledgement of the still emerging and developing status of crypto markets and assets, as well as providing an insight into opportunities at the state level for crypto policy leadership. For example, Wyoming is in the midst of minting and issuing the first state-backed stable token in the form WYST. When viewed in conjunction with efforts underway in states like Pennsylvania to create strategic bitcoin reserves on the state level, it looks increasingly likely that crypto policy leadership might emerge from the states alongside – or perhaps before – policy at the federal level.

Posted on 11/24/2024 12:30:04 PM PST by McGruff The Kremlin is allegedly ready to discuss a ceasefire, Reuters reports, citing current and former representatives of the Russian government. According to a secret document of the Russian MOD, the Kremlin intends to divide Ukraine into three parts. 🔺The East of the country (Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhia and Kherson regions), as well as Crimea, should go to Russia. 🔺The second large part of the country (including the regions of Kiev, Sumy and Odessa) is planned to be turned into a "pro-Russian state entity." The power structures in this zone will be staffed with pro-Russian personnel, and Russian troops will be stationed on its territory to provide security. This means that "Ukraine will turn into a puppet state controlled from Moscow." 🔺The rest of the western part of Ukraine is called “disputed territories” in the document. What to do with them is supposed to be decided in the course of negotiations between Russia and neighboring countries — Hungary, Poland and Romania. (Excerpt) Read more at x.com ...

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Can’t Miss This Weekend. In this article, we are going to take a look at where GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) stands against other AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. The race to get ahead in artificial intelligence is compelling companies to intensify their efforts each day. In latest news, ChatGPT creator OpenAI has been considering developing its own web browser, according to a report by The Information. The report reveals that the company has spoken about the product with websites such as Redfin, Conde Nast, Priceline, and Eventbrite. Having already entered the market with SearchGPT, the move would be placing OpenAI head-to-head with Google, the company that holds the major share of the browser and search market. READ ALSO: 10 AI News Stories You Can’t Miss and 15 AI News Making Waves Right Now However, the company isn’t just delving into search and browsers. According to Tech Crunch, OpenAI is also researching algorithms that can predict human being’s moral judgments. OpenAI gave a grant to Duke University researchers for a project called “Research AI Morality.” When asked for more details, an OpenAI spokesperson referred to a press release stating that the grant is part of a larger $1 million, three-year funding effort for Duke Professors working on creating “moral AI.” As per the press release, the OpenAI-funded project aims to develop algorithms capable of “predicting human moral judgments” when moral conflicts arise in fields like medicine, law, and business. However, it isn’t clear yet whether such kind of an achievement is possible with the current levels of technology. In other news, AI firm Anthropic is getting another funding boost. Amazon is increasing its investment in Anthropic to $8 billion, strengthening its partnership in artificial intelligence, the companies announced Friday, the 22nd. “We’ll keep pushing the boundaries of what customers can achieve with generative AI technologies.” For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). lassedesignen/Shutterstock.com Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89 GE Vernova Inc. (NYSE:GEV) is a global energy company and a soaring AI stock driven by the demand for energy to power artificial intelligence technology. On November 21, Wells Fargo analyst Michael Blum initiated coverage of the power-generation technology company with an “Overweight” rating and a $385 price target. This is the second-highest price target listed by FactSet, as reported by Barrons. According to Blum, GE Vernova can help meet the massive energy demands from artificial intelligence through its power generation and grid products. Blum further states that GE Vernova’s transformers, HVDC, and grid software offerings are well-positioned to benefit from growing power demand. “As power demand grows and more distributed generation is added to the mix, aging grids will require significant investment to manage the increasingly complex and dynamic environment,” Blum said. “GEV’s transformers, HVDC [High-voltage direct current], and grid software offerings are well positioned to benefit from this growing demand”. Overall, GEV ranks 2nd on our list of AI news updates you can’t miss this weekend. While we acknowledge the potential of GEV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GEV but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are leaders of digital innovation that have created massive shareholder wealth over the past decade. Through distinct strategies and different areas of market focus, the core business for both tech giants is centered on online advertising. Let's discuss whether Alphabet or Meta Platforms is the better buy right now. The Observer made a profit of more than £3m last year, according to internal figures which raise questions over claims it must be offloaded to protect The Guardian. After flying high during the first half of the year, pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) has lost some momentum; the company's shares are down by 11% since June 1. Millennium Management's stake in Eli Lilly increased by 86% in the third quarter. Should you follow Englander's lead and increase your stake (or initiate a position) in Eli Lilly? The market rally is hot, but keep a cool head. Nvidia is the giant, but Astera Labs is the new AI chip leader. The hedge fund manager takes a piece of a popular consumer brand. Broadcom isn't the only way to tap the AI revolution. Both represent great long-term opportunities for buy-and-hold investors. Microsoft and Broadcom are more stable long-term AI plays. On the surface, Boeing (NYSE: BA) looks as though it has all the ingredients of a potential millionaire-maker investment. The aircraft market is growing, competition is minimal, and government contracts are plentiful. The phrase "economic moat" -- popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett -- refers to certain types of durable competitive advantages a company can possess that make it difficult for potential rivals to make inroads against it.

Title: Morgan Stanley joins US peers putting Mideast HQ in Riyadh
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/24/morgan-stanley-wall-street-banks-mideast-hq-riyadh-saudi-arabia/
Time Published: 2024-11-24T15:50:54Z

Morgan Stanley got regulatory approval to locate its Middle East headquarters in Saudi Arabia, joining Wall Street rivals including Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in expanding their presence in the kingdom. “Establishing a regional HQ in Riyadh reflects the growth and development of Saudi Arabia and is a natural progression of our long history in the region,” said Abdulaziz Alajaji, the chief executive officer for Saudi Arabia and the bank’s co-head of the Middle East and North Africa region said in a statement on Sunday. Under new rules that came into force this year, firms must have a regional base in Saudi Arabia with at least 15 employees, including executives overseeing other countries, or risk losing business with the kingdom’s vast network of government entities. The move is part of a plan by the Saudi government to cut down on what it calls “economic leakage,” a term it uses for state spending that can benefit firms in neighboring business hubs, most prominently Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Morgan Stanley has been present in Saudi Arabia since 2007, when it set up an equity trading business in Riyadh, and became one of the first international asset managers to launch a Saudi equity fund two years later. CEO Ted Pick was among a host of executives and investors to speak at Saudi Arabia’s flagship Future Investment Initiative last month. In recent months, BlackRock Inc. and Lazard Inc. have joined the ranks of firms granted HQ licenses in the kingdom, while State Street Corp has said it will apply for one. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Why photographers should understand bitcoin

Time Published: 2024-11-24T14:36:51Z

Do you remember Kodak brownies and the light? Obviously digital photograph absolutely crushed Kodak, even though ironically Kodak I think made the first digital camera? Also, the very foolish and shortsighted thing that conducted; she almost self sabotage herself by kind of trying to kill off her own digital camera, concerned that we would eat into the profits of her film business. A similar insight; Steve Jobs, upon unleashing the iPhone, obviously he knew that it was going to eat into the iPod iPod touch market, but obviously it was the right step forward. This is a book that apparently Steve Jobs recommended everyone to read. The general idea is that the paradox and difficulty that innovator’s face is that in order to innovate something new, you kind of need to kill your own business, even have the courage to self cannibalize if necessary. So for example, I think Ford has done a decent job at this semi trying to get into the electric car market, instead of just hoarding her gas guzzler cars. But the difficulty of a Ford or any other car company is that because they did not start off 100% carte blanche electric, they’re never going to catch up to Tesla, Do you remember in the early days of Tesla, in which the evaluation was far greater than that of any major car company and everyone thought that it was insanely overvalued? Who is laughing now? So a book that nobody knows about is the mobile wave by Michael Saylor; in which he accurately predicts that mobile phones, mobile technology, all the big magnificent seven companies to take over the world. He predicted the success of Amazon Facebook Twitter Google and Apple before anyone really took notice. In fact I recommend everyone to read them all way, because it shows the inside that Michael Saylor is not new to the game; he’s been in the game for a long time, over 30 years. Apparently he has seen his stock drop to an ALL TIME LOW of $.20, And now it is currently in the mid 400s. So I guess I was right all along about bitcoin, ever since I bought like 2.2 bitcoins or 2.4 bitcoins for about 20,000 or $25,000, back in 2018 when bitcoin was only around $6000-$7000 a coin. ￼ sing that we’re about to have the hundred K party, I’ve almost I guess like 12 or 13 X ‘d my initial prediction? Anyways, if you’re right about bitcoin and was right about bitcoin… And no no no bitcoin is not gonna drop down to like 60,000 or 30,000, that does not how engineering works. For people who think that bitcoin is risky, ask people… Is it risky to cross the bridge or go on a flight? No. Why? Things were engineered that way! With bitcoin, you’re not gonna have all these people who you’re trying to proselytize turn around and tell you that you were right, and shower you with good news. No no no, they might either feel low-key envious or jealous of you, and won’t probably really say much. This is also why I don’t really tell people about bitcoin too much if they don’t seem like they have a strong need for it; for example my uncle who’s worked in the jewelry business for like over 30 years, he wants to retire, and I’m kind of in the process of helping him Sell his gold and his other reserves and stuff, in order to buy bitcoin. Even he at the age of 64, being a gold jeweler for like over 30 years know that bitcoin is the future. But his issues that he cannot stomach the volatility, he says it is like drugs, “mah-yyak”– when I was with him last I just set him up with Coinbase, and just bought the daily maximum for his account which was $3500, I think we bought windows around $65,000 a coin, and already it’s like $99,000 a coin. But once again, I think the difficult thing with bitcoin is that like is probably the most addictive crack cocaine on the planet, because it is being traded 24 7, it is extremely volatile because volatility is vitality. Anything that is allowed to trade every single waking moment, on weekends as well as the evenings, and also bank holidays, is going to have more volatility because people are just bored at home, they cannot play the traditional market so they’re going to just try to buy and sell bitcoin, do some sort of weird options trading to try to squeeze a few bucks here and there.￼ I was randomly think about Peter Thiel and his zero to one book; I think if you thought about bitcoin like a year or two ago, you might’ve seen that are artificial intelligence in AI was the right bet. But no, it is most certainly bitcoin. Why? Assuming that the world runs on money, and bitcoin is perfect money, it is like maybe 80 to 90% the solution to the problems of humanity. For example, what are the greatest bad things that happened to humans? It mostly has to deal with financial distress. I almost wonder people who get addicted to gambling, drugs, cycles of poverty is because the money right now the fiat currency is toxic. You cannot blame somebody for remaining sick if they only have a sewer water to drink, and they have kids and are also forced to feed their kids sewer water. It doesn’t matter how smart hard-working or intelligent you are, as long as you’re drinking sore water, you’re going to perpetually be sick, throwing up, permanently infected with cholera. So you know you have all these Crusades on the Internet and charity is talking about providing clean water to like poor kids in Africa? I think the same thing with bitcoin– it is like the chance to give clean water to 8 billion people on the planet. Except instead of water, it is clean money. Nontoxic money. It matters if you’re at church a nonprofit a charity, mother Teresa Gandhi etc. Matters if you’re at school, a parent organization, if you have kids you’re single own a dog whatever. Ultimately you’re going to have to pay the rent, pay your mortgage, or pay property taxes. I don’t think there is anyone spot on the planet in which you cannot live or survive without money a banking account or Notes. Even all these weirdos who try to buy a $200,000 AMG sprinter van and live off the grid with star Link or whatever, you still need money, and sooner or later you’re going to have to need some sort of semi permanent address, ideally your mom‘s house or your wife’s family‘s house or something. Because for the most part if you’re American, at this point you cannot really survive without having a single address for doing taxes and stuff. And I also think that now, unfortunately you also need a cell phone number, or else you cannot even apply for basic stuff, because you’re going to have to get the one time password authentication code codes texted to your phone. Anyways, it’s gonna be a big deal once Apple integrate bitcoin into her iCloud ecosystem. This is actually a very very big opportunity for Apple; the head of security, on the planet and privacy… If Apple were able to provide security to your bitcoin or your keys or whatever, Wooden apple being in some way is the best custodian? Even better yet… We already have our bank of counseling to Apple Pay. Wouldn’t it just makes sense for you to buy bitcoin directly on an iPhone using Apple Pay, and store it on your iPhone and or iCloud Apple ID account? For people who don’t trust the cloud I get it, but still… For all practical purposes I think the cloud is like 1 trillion times safer than cold storage options. For example even me, all my photos are backed up to dropbox, Google Drive and Apple photos. Even worst case scenario all my photos get deleted, it’s OK I could start again! I think especially with Apple Apple ID Face ID touch print thumb ID, it’s almost the most logical way to feel secure with your bitcoin. Larry Fink, CEO Blackrock, even Michael Saylor. ￼ even Donald Trump!￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: Kraft Heinz (KHC): Navigating Challenges and Strategic Shifts in Warren Buffett’s Portfolio

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Warren Buffett’s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) stands against other Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks. Warren Buffett has cemented his legacy as Wall Street’s most successful investor. During the high-flying stock market of the 1960s, he leveraged his investment partnership to acquire Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling New England textile company at the time. Today, the firm is a vastly different entity, boasting a diverse range of businesses from Geico insurance to BNSF Railway, an equity portfolio exceeding $266 billion, and an enormous cash reserve of $325.2 billion. Decades of strong returns have built Buffett’s unmatched track record. Since he took over in 1965, the company’s shares have delivered an annualized gain of 19.8%. Buffett has famously stated that his ideal holding period for a stock is “forever”. True to his word, the Oracle of Omaha has held onto some of his favorite stocks for the long haul, allowing them to deliver steady share performance and generate passive income for his portfolio over time. Moreover, market analysts and investors alike have consistently praised Buffett’s disciplined, long-term approach to investing, more so now that his firm has become the latest non-tech firm to surpass a $1 trillion market cap, highlighting Buffett’s stock-picking abilities. However, despite strong market performance through much of 2024, Buffett seems to have adopted a more defensive stance. Concerned about inflated valuations amid high interest rates and worsening economic conditions, he has offloaded significant holdings in companies whose valuations have surged too high. Billionaire investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital echoed this in his hedge fund’s quarterly letter, noting Buffett’s cautious approach: “One could argue that sitting out bear markets has been the underappreciated reason for his outstanding long-term returns. It is therefore noteworthy to observe that Mr. Buffett is again selling large swaths of his stock portfolio and building enormous cash reserves.” Over the past two years, Buffett has been an active net seller of stocks. His firm offloaded a total of $36.1 billion in stocks during the third quarter, marking the eighth consecutive quarter in which Berkshire was a net seller of equities. At the company’s annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett mentioned the possibility of a future rise in the corporate tax rate. Moreover, in his 2023 letter, Buffett also addresses common questions about Berkshire, including whether the company can continue to achieve the same level of outperformance as in the past: “There remain only a handful of companies in this country capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire, and they have been endlessly picked over by us and by others. Some we can value; some we can’t. And, if we can, they have to be attractively priced. Outside the U.S., there are essentially no candidates that are meaningful options for capital deployment at Berkshire. All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance. Nevertheless, managing Berkshire is mostly fun and always interesting. On the positive side, after 59 years of assemblage, the company now owns either a portion or 100% of various businesses that, on a weighted basis, have somewhat better prospects than exist at most large American companies.” Our Methodology To create our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A closeup of an assembly line worker inspecting a newly produced jar of condiments and sauces. Warren Buffett’s First Major Purchase: 2015 Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in Q3 2024: $11.43 billion The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), a global food and beverage leader formed by the 2015 merger of Kraft Foods and Heinz, produces a wide range of products including condiments, dairy, meat, beverages, and other grocery items. On October 25, Stifel analysts downgraded The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) from Buy to Hold, pointing to sluggish volume recovery and increased reinvestment needs. Stifel also voiced caution about the overall food sector, keeping a Neutral weighting despite food stocks trading at a significant 30% discount to the S&P 500, putting the sector in the 6th relative percentile. Additionally, in its Q3 2024 earnings report, The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) revealed a larger-than-expected quarterly revenue decline, with net sales down 2.8% to $6.38 billion. The company also revised its 2024 earnings per share outlook to the lower end of its prior $3.01–$3.07 range. A Deutsche Bank report indicates that The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) may need to make deeper capability improvements to achieve its long-term financial goals, underscoring the challenges and operational complexities the company faces on its growth path. The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) has also strategically sold off its underperforming brands to raise capital, acquired brands with stronger growth potential, and strengthened its traditional brands through product innovation and marketing efforts. This approach also helped the company navigate inflationary pressures in 2022 and 2023 by gradually increasing its prices. Overall, KHC ranks 8th on our list of Warren Buffett’s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of KHC, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than KHC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(NASDAQ:VRSN) reported a 3.8% year-over-year revenue increase to $391 million. Despite this growth, the company saw a dip in its total domain name base and forecasted lower renewal rates. On the other hand, earnings per share rose by 13.1% to $2.07, and the company announced plans to launch new marketing programs aimed at boosting growth in its domain name base. VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSN) is also in discussions with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) about .com domain pricing and the overall ecosystem health, while preparing for the renewal of the .com registry and the introduction of the new Top-Level Domain (TLD) .web.

(NASDAQ:VRSN), a global provider of internet infrastructure and domain name registry services, manages the .com and .net domains. Shares of VeriSign declined because of continued weakness in new domain registrations, stemming largely from weaker demand in China. We believe that VeriSign maintains an exceptional competitive position and the contractual ability to raise prices. Longer term, we are encouraged by VeriSign’s opportunity to win the rights to administer the “.web” domain, produce substantial free cash flow, and generate attractive capital returns as it continues to prioritize share buybacks.

Title: Goldman Sachs: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Is A Top AI Growth Investor Stock
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-advanced-micro-devices-131333819.html
Time Published: 2024-11-24T13:13:33Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently made a list of Goldman Sachs’ Top Growth Investors: 34 Stocks With The Highest Investment For Growth. In this piece, we will look at where Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) ranks on the list. With the 2024 US Presidential Election having come to a close, Wall Street can now focus on the future of artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut cycle, and an economy with lower inflation. As was the case during the coronavirus pandemic when historically low interest rates propelled markets to new highs only to come crashing when rates were hiked in 2022, the shifts that are currently taking place should also affect investors for the next couple of years at the very least. Naturally, this merits a look at what professional analysts are projecting about the future. On this front, investment bank Goldman Sachs recently updated its long-term forecasts for the US stock market. In a research report titled ‘Global Strategy Paper No. 71, the bank outlined that the upgrade is necessary due to market concentration. This ‘concentration’ refers to roaring investor interest in large and mega-cap stocks primarily due to enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence. Since the biggest technology companies are also the heaviest investors in AI, market returns have also focused on them. As an illustration, consider the performance of the flagship S&P index which is up 30.64% over the past twelve months. Now, consider the performances of Wall Street’s top AI GPU stock, the software company behind Windows, the social networking giant that owns Facebook, Jeff Bezos’ eCommerce company, and the world’s leading search engine provider. Their shares have gained roughly 192.21%, 12.66%, 69.01%, 42.44%, and 27.63% over the same period. Consequently, most mega-cap stocks have driven the market in returns. As per Goldman, this bifurcation implies that the equal-weight flagship S&P index is likely to outperform the market cap-weighted index “by an annualized 200 bp-800 bp” over the next decade, or between 2024 and 2034. To build its argument, the bank cites historical data which also covers the dotcom boom of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This bubble is key in understanding today’s market, as it does share some characteristics with the surge in artificial intelligence stocks following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT and Jensen Huang’s prediction of a trillion dollars of compute capacity waiting for an upgrade. GS points out that the equal-weight S&P tends to underperform the market weight index sharply before the trend reverses. It cites the market’s performance of the two indexes before the bubble’s ‘pop’ to point out that “the trough in 10-year relative underperformance of the equal-weight vs. cap-weight index occurred during the lead-up to the Dot Com bubble (1990-2000).” This saw the equal weight index lag the market weight index by four percentage points (pp) at the trough or the bottom. After the bottom, the differential flipped and the equal weight index led its counterpart by close to seven points (pp). As per Goldman, the four-point shortfall “has been matched during the past decade (2014-2024E) as the aggregate index has been powered by a few mega-cap Tech stocks and AI euphoria.” Linking historical performance trends with investor concentration in mega caps and AI stocks, the bank shares that this “extreme level of market concentration (99th percentile) suggests the magnitude of equal-weight outperformance over the next decade should also be stronger than average.” Just how strong can this be? Well GS outlines that the equal weight index can outperform the market weighed index by 8 percentage points. On the flip side, since this is the most bullish forecast, the bank notes that if equal weight index performance reverts to its historical mean over the past 50 years, then “this would imply a less dramatic 2 pp of annualized outperformance.” While stock market math is all good, other factors also drive its performance. November has seen headlines talk about nothing else but the Presidential Election. Post-election stock performance saw some firms, like Elon Musk’s car company record stunning gains. Goldman’s Shawn Tuteja, who works with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and baskets, shared some insights about what sectors performed well after the election and whether this outperformance will continue. In a podcast, he outlined that “the biggest themes that we saw play out the day after the election on Wednesday were regional banks and banks getting bought.” He shared that “any sectors that were linked to de-regulation, benefited.” These include “energy, traditional energy versus renewables” with the former up by 4% while the latter losing roughly 10%. Tuteja added that “the resilience and strength of US tech over the past couple of days post the election” was a standout from the market’s post-election performance in 2016. As to what lies in the future, the Goldman analyst is optimistic. He believes that “what I would expect to come over the next couple of weeks is a continuation on the factor level of the themes that worked post the election.” This is because “it takes time for money to be deployed and for themes to play out.” According to him, in 2016, “regional banks and big banks rallied for months after the election and they outperformed all of the other sectors in the market.” Additionally, while the broader markets might have calmed at a surface level, Tuteja points out that “under the surface, those sector moves become a lot more violent as correlations in the market break, as people start picking winners and losers in the new government regime’s policies.” For some bank stocks, you can check out 10 Best Local Bank Stocks To Invest In Now and 10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy Now. Within this dynamic environment that will see the Fed continue to tailor its interest rate decisions to the economy and companies adjust to a looser monetary policy, firms might also increase their cash spending. In a note covering spending, Goldman shared that the benchmark S&P index firms can increase their spending to 11% next year from 2024’s 8%. This will be driven by rising profits, as the bank believes that earnings “growth alone can explain 40% of next quarter’s cash spending growth.” Just like it expects equities performance to broaden in the future, the bank also posits that the “typical stock should close the earnings growth gap with the mega-cap tech stocks.” Finally, on the topic of mergers and acquisitions, which slowed down in the wake of historic interest rates, GS is optimistic. It expects “cash M&A will rebound by 20% in 2025,” but cautions that “the potential for tariffs, regulatory changes, and corporate tax reform could meaningfully shift these forecasts.” Our Methodology To make our list of Goldman Sachs’ top growth investment stocks, we used the bank’s recent list of stocks and picked out those with a growth investment ratio of 70% or higher. This ratio is defined as the ratio of capital expenditure and R&D spending excluding depreciation over a firm’s cash flow from operations. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A financial analyst in their office, monitoring the daily performance of the stock market. Growth Investment Ratio: 92% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 108 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor designer that designs and sells CPUs and GPUs. Its products are used by consumers and businesses. In today’s AI era, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the few companies capable of offering both CPUs and GPUs for AI computing. This places it well to capitalize on any cost constraints that NVIDIA’s GPU customers might face or for firms looking to switch away from Intel’s CPUs. Yet, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s limited resources also mean that the firm struggles to compete at scale with its larger rivals. As a result, it is the perpetual underdog in an industry where high volumes often determine brand and pricing power. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s third-quarter results led to the firm’s Gaming business seeing a strong 90%+ operating income drop, and soon afterward, the firm announced that it would lay off 4% of its workforce. Sustained revenue from AI customers is key to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s hypothesis. During the Q3 2024 earnings call, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)’s management commented on its AI business: “Turning to our Data Center AI business, Data Center GPU revenue ramped as MI300X adoption expanded with cloud, OEM and AI customers. Microsoft and Meta expanded their use of MI 300X accelerators to power their internal workloads in the quarter. Microsoft is now using MI 300X broadly for multiple co-pilot services powered by the family of GPT 4 models. Overall, AMD ranks 22nd on our list of Goldman Sachs' top growth investors. While we acknowledge the potential of AMD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. Data centers are at the heart of the AI disruption sweeping markets across the world. However, the massive investment into these data centers has raised concerns about their impact on the environment. According to a report by news agency Reuters, the growing demand for electricity from data centers, fueled by advancements in AI and cloud computing, risks a near-term increase in fossil fuel reliance. Utility firms across the US, Europe, and Asia are turning to natural gas and even coal to meet the surging power needs due to the slow pace of renewable energy expansion, per the news agency. An example of this can be seen in Northern Virginia, which houses the largest concentration of data centers globally. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. The news agency contends that globally, the scenario is similarly challenging. Countries like Poland and Germany are partially relying on coal due to inadequate renewable capacity, with Poland's energy mix still dominated by over 60% coal as of 2023. In Ireland, where data centers now consume more than 20% of electricity, operators have postponed plant retirements and leaned on natural gas for grid stability. In Malaysia, less than 50% of auctioned green power is being utilized, as companies opt for cheaper fossil fuels. While hyperscalers have pledged renewable energy use, critics argue that these commitments often involve diverting clean energy already available to others, thereby not contributing additional renewable capacity. McKinsey projects that most of Europe’s data center power by 2030 will come from low-carbon sources, but this may include natural gas.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. On November 21, Mizuho raised the price target on the stock to $175 from $165 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after the company reported a strong October-end quarter sales result of $35.1 billion and guided January-end quarter revenue to $37.5 billion, which the advisory notes was in line with consensus at $37 billion, but below buy-side estimates of $39 billion-plus. The advisory, which says Nvidia remains a Mizuho 2024 Top Pick and is leading the AI accelerator market, recommends investors buy the pullback. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the AI stocks that are making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Merkel's former nemisis aims to become Germany's chancellor

Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany's leader. Friedrich Merz has a good chance of becoming Germany's next chancellor. As the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) and the conservative parliamentary group that includes Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), he will be the bloc's top candidate, taking on the Social Democrats (SPD) in the February 23 general election. Though Merz has never held government office, opinion polls suggest that he is the favorite in the race. At the age of 69, Merz would become the oldest person to take office as Germany's head of government since Konrad Adenauer, who was 73 years old when he was sworn in as the first chancellor of the Federal Republic in 1949. Merz has had two political lives: one before Angela Merkel came to power as chancellor in 2005 and the second after she exited in 2021. He had slowly withdrawn from politics after Merkel's initial election as German chancellor. Merkel, who is often referred to as Merz's "nemesis," was a pragmatist and moderate who did not see eye to eye with the staunch conservative Friedrich Merz. He then took a break from politics in 2009, returning to the Bundestag only in 2021 after Merkel had retired. Merz hails from the rural Sauerland area of Germany's most-populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. He is a wealthy corporate lawyer, a father of three and a Catholic. He started his political career as amember of the European Parliament for the CDU in 1989, at the age of 33. Five years later, in 1994, he switched to the German lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, where his sharp oratory skills drew attention. He became an influential member of the conservative parliamentary group (CDU/CSU). Merz's withdrawal from politics dovetailed with successes in the private sector: From 2005 to 2021, he was a member of the international law firm Mayer Brown LLP and held top positions on supervisory and administrative boards. From 2016 to 2020, Merz was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager. In 2022, on Merz's third attempt at the post, the CDU elected him as party leader. Merz had a reputation as an economically liberal representative of the conservative CDU wing. In 2008 he wrote a book entitled "Mehr Kapitalismus wagen" (Dare More Capitalism) championing a liberal economic policy, slashing bureaucracy, reducing social benefits and cutting taxes for companies. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video In the 1990s, Merz was in the minority even in the conservative CDU when he voted against liberalizing the abortion law and against preimplantation genetic diagnostics in the Bundestag. When parliament passed a bill to criminalize marital rape like any other rape in 1997, Merz voted against it. Merz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as "ugly" wind turbines. He drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner's wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine. Merz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees. On a TV talk show, he said female school teachers in Germany were experiencing a lack of respect from what he called "little pashas," apparently referring to sons of Muslim parents. That remark came only weeks after Merz referred to some displaced Ukrainians as "welfare tourists" — claiming that many of them had come to Germany seeking safety, only to then travel back and forth between both countries once they have secured social benefits. Merz later offered an apology of sorts: "I regret using the word 'welfare tourism.' It was an inaccurate description of a problem observed in individual cases." Merz previously complained about "problems with foreigners" and insisted on a German "Leitkultur" (dominant culture), a term dating back to the 1990s that many argue is a call for compulsory assimilation. He represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Shortly after Germany's center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz's coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming. Merz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government. This article was originally written in German.

Title: Balmoral shows ‘small’ investors the door

The Irish Stock Exchange, or Euronext Dublin as it is now known, spends a lot of time and lobbying muscle telling the Government it needs support to help make the stock market more attractive to small investors who traditionally are more likely to leave their savings on deposit than in shares. Balmoral International Land delisted from the exchange more than a decade ago, but given how the company has effectively moved to force small investors off its share register, it begs the question why the so-called “little guy” would want to invest in shares in general. At a gathering in Arthur Cox’s office this week some of Irish commerce’s blue bloods told thousands of small shareholders they were no longer welcome as investors in the listed business. The McCann family owns a majority stake in Balmoral International Land, formerly Blackrock International Land, the property business spun out of one of their previously listed businesses – fruit importer and distributor Fyffes. On Thursday, at a fractious extraordinary general meeting whose outcome was decided well in advance given the weight of shareholdings, company chairman Carl McCann forced through a motion taking the company fully private and, in the process, forcibly buying out “small” shareholders – those with fewer than 25,000 shares in the business, a group that owned more than a fifth of the business before Thursday, at €10.50 a share. Small is relative in McCann’s world. These ousted shareholders would have had holdings worth up to just shy of €262,500 at the takeout price which is hardly small change. The company argues that most had holdings of 500 or fewer shares but that’s still an investment of up to €5,250. Others, including AIB and PTSB, have offered similar buyouts of small investors but they have included an opt-out clause for anyone who was interested in sticking with their investment. The McCanns and their advisers tried to persuade the shareholders being ejected that they were doing them a favour but a vocal group of shareholders – almost all investors of many years’ standing – was not buying it. Why, they wanted to know, were they being forced out just as the business had returned to health and started making money from its property investments. And, more particularly, why at a substantial discount to the €18.72 net asset value of the portfolio and the €12 price at which a deal for shares was done on the grey market just the previous week.

The firm offers AI solutions to businesses that transform raw financial data into insightful summaries that are easy to understand. On November 22, JMP Securities raised the price target on the stock to $86 from $81 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares after attending the company's annual Beyond the Black user conference. While many of its initiatives will take time to have a visible impact on the model, the advisory continues to like BlackLine as an excellent opportunity for capital appreciation, as BlackLine offers a powerful suite of invoice-to-cash and record-to-report solutions that are now even easier for customers to access with Studio360, and it addresses a large market opportunity estimated at $45 billion, JMP told investors in a research note. Overall BL ranks 13th on our list of the stocks on Wall Street's radar.
