Title: Disturbing your silence is my job but I want to make a little room for peace

“Hello from somewhere in the sky over Brussels,” my phone flashes. The tingle from my friend’s message so many kilometres up in the sky gives me the tiniest sense of what those 1979 internet pioneers must have felt when they sent the word “Lo” across the world wide web. As the initial thrill of contact fades, it feels not like my friend and I had cracked a code of the modern era but that we’d broken a secret code. The inside of a giant metal box in the sky has become an unlikely sacred space. It is oddly one of the few truly disconnected places we have left. Disconnected with the outside world, connected with ourselves, where we are. Yes, sometimes my head gets unintentionally connected with my seat-neighbour’s pungent armpit. But I am present. In the discomfort of that noxious connection. (While I do know some airlines have had wifi for years, I am, like most Irish people, on the low-budget, short-haul end of the aviation world.) Another unlikely sanctuary is the rail line surrounding Seapoint Dart station. For years this Bermuda triangle of mobile phone signal would make me audibly gasp in frustration, as I’d hear the “beep, beep, beep” of my cut-off phone call or see “no internet connection” cross my screen over and over in the middle of adding Weetabix to my online supermarket order. Smartphones make the harried and frazzled life of a full-time working parent just-about possible. Fifteen years ago I’d have had to give my whole Saturday morning over to the weekly shop instead of simply adding milk and butter to my virtual basket on my journey to work. Or I’d have to stay in the office late instead of answering urgent emails at my kitchen table while discussing river erosion over a fourth class geography book. But mobile phones also leave us with few silent retreats. There are almost no gaps for the thoughts to creep in, to give us perspective. You could describe the five-minute journey between Salthill and Blackrock Dart stations, catching glimpses of the daily colour-changes of Dublin Bay, as unproductive. But it is in these slivers that there is room to stop and listen and hear what is inside. Whether it is good or bad. Joyful or painful. We are surrounded by ways to pull us out of our inner life. This always-on world is reliably at hand to offer us a distraction. And distraction is a broad church. From “being productive” in buying gifts, or proofreading a report on your phone before a deadline, to aimlessly watching videos we don’t even control, engrossed by the TikTok Chicken Dance challenge ... scroll, scroll, scrolling the algorithm. [ Pro tips from ancient thinkers: why are people in their teens and twenties suddenly so obsessed by the Stoics?Opens in new window ] If there is pain or grief to be felt or deep thinking to be had, there is the soothing flicker of the screen to help us keep it light, keep it in the shallow, to numb us. Emptiness lets things rise to the top. It lets reflection catch you unawares. I pass a familiar-looking house and feel a jolt inside. I don’t reach for my phone. I remember my recently-passed vibrant sister. I hear her lovely laugh and smile. I feel her warm welcome. I know I’ve an emptiness at missing her. But most importantly I feel this. Swimming also brings me to this reposeful place. For 30 minutes there is just me and my strokes and the water. Surprising ideas enter my head, as if randomly out of nowhere. But I wonder were they just in a queue, waiting for some room to bubble up. Going back to my locker at the pool always brings the same tightness in my chest. I pick up my phone with a twitch. What have I missed? Are my kids okay? The screen almost always tells the same story. At most there’s some breaking news push alert on a new twist in the big story of the day from one of the dozen news sites I’ve signed up to for work. My relief and disappointment are simultaneous. I am sharply aware of the irony of me writing on this topic. For disturbing the silence is my job. Daily I send Irish Times news notifications to people’s phones. I try to make enticing social media posts and catchy headlines, to pull readers out of their worlds, away from their own thoughts. Distracted by the dopamine hit of a breaking story. [ Dermot Whelan: ‘Mindfulness isn’t a cult. We don’t have to get naked and cover ourselves in hummus’Opens in new window ] But this merely reflects the hyperconnected world we all occupy. In so many ways the phone in my pocket gives me power, productivity, flexibility, in my attempt to “have it all”. So today I speak for making a little room for peace and silence. Let’s never fix the signal gap at Seapoint Dart station. And Ryanair and Aer Lingus, don’t even think about giving us wifi on board our short-haul flights. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘It’s a hilariously wonderful idea’: Coastal saunas a hot ticket amid icy Irish temperatures

Dublin swimming haven the Forty Foot provided the unlikely – and blustery – backdrop for a mobile sauna in the days before Christmas. Over the past 250 years, the much loved bathing spot, at a promontory in Sandycove beside the James Joyce Tower, has witnessed many a sight, most famously, perhaps, Buck Mulligan’s dip there in Ulysses. But one suspects that even Joyce couldn’t have imagined a wooden 10-person sauna on wheels perched there, overlooking the sea. It was as if an alien spaceship had landed, with hardy swimmers and walkers stopping to gawp as they rounded the concrete wind shelters of the Forty Foot, on a rocky outcrop reaching into Dublin Bay. The spot has become temporary home to the The Hot Box Sauna company, which has been awarded a licence by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The council became the first of Dublin’s local authorities to trial the use of mobile saunas as part of a pilot scheme over two months in December and January. Others are situated at Killiney beach and Dún Laoghaire Baths. Helen Smirnova, a civil engineer with the council’s Infrastructure and Climate Change division, said that for the previous year the council had been receiving requests for saunas to be installed. “We were asked if we would be interested in placing saunas in public grounds. There are a lot of saunas in private grounds but only one or two other local authorities around the country allow this scheme,” she said. [ Tailbacks from Forty Foot stretch for miles as Christmas swimmers descendOpens in new window ] Ms Smirnova said the council decided to begin the trial after it was approached by people involved in the business and by members of the public. “We can’t just allow someone to set up and we couldn’t prioritise one particular vendor over another,” she said. “We had to make it a fair competition for those applying for the licence. It’s a good opportunity to do a trial and what we viewed as the best service providers were given a licence.” Up to 15 applications were made to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council; five saunas are now based in the three locations and have the option to open from 7am to 7pm three days weekly. One of the key stipulations for operators is that they must provide their own insurance. Whether or not the saunas become permanent features hasn’t yet been decided. The council will consider factors such as what the atmosphere is like around the pop-ups, cleanliness, traffic and safety. [ Rediscovering Ireland’s sea sauna tradition: ‘It’s like a modern-day pub, except you leave feeling great’Opens in new window ] Ms Smirnova said the council “wanted to find out if the locals were okay with the set up”. She said there had not been “a major amount of complaints as of yet” but some concerns had been raised. The council will compile a report and make a decision within months on whether or not to continue the scheme, she added; the saunas would be run by private entities, with tenders for each location advertised. Meanwhile, Waterford City and County Council has licensed two outdoor saunas, or hot pods, which are operating at Kilmurrin Cove and Clonea Strand. A spokesperson said the “general reaction has been very positive” and that the local authority intends to extend the offering. Back at the Forty Foot, friends Kate Blaney, Jane Young and Caroline Somers, from Sandycove, Booterstown and Blackrock respectively, were full of praise for the concept of a local authority licensing saunas. Ms Somers said she loved it. “It’s great for this time of year to encourage people to use saunas while getting in and out of the sea,” she said. “The council should definitely try to keep it operating.” Ms Young was introduced to the pop-up by a friend. “They are a great addition,” she said. Ian McColl, from Dún Laoghaire, who happened upon the sauna while out walking his dog, said that if he had known about it before he “would have definitely used it”. “It’s a hilariously wonderful idea,” he said. Micheál Beirne (23) who works for The Hot Box Sauna company, which operates in five locations around Ireland, said the business takes all concerns from members of the public on board, including over whether a person’s body can cope with going from hot to cold temperatures so quickly. “In Finland and, indeed, other Scandinavian countries, the use of saunas outdoors is part of their culture. When using a sauna people should go at their own pace,” he said. The majority of people “love it”, Mr Beirne said of the concept. “I get great satisfaction from this job. I love hearing about how people found out about saunas,” he said. “Saunas are a good place for people to socialise. It gets them outdoors and in this day and age, with our fast pace of life and social media, individuals are feeling the burden of loneliness. In Finland 80 per cent of people who use such saunas are aged over 60.” Forty-five minute slots can be booked for €15; all users must be aged over 18. The trial ends on Friday, January 31st. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Turbulent Timeways returns for seven weeks of Timewalking dungeons, plus the new Timely Buzzbee mount!

NEXT | Khadgar's countdown is over, so here's how to earn the Witness of t... While we wait for The War Within patch 11.1, the WoW developers continue to give us a steady stream of content with the return of the Turbulent Timeways. For the next seven weeks we’ll have an active Timewalking event, encouraging us to revisit old dungeons and factions. In addition to the standard rewards from Timewalking, this Turbulent Timeways event will reward us with with the Timely Buzzbee mount for completing the Master of the Turbulent Timeways 2 achievement, which is a meta-achievement requiring you to run dungeons for five of the seven weeks. If you need another reason to jump in, there’s also increased gear rewards: the weekly quest to complete five Timewalking dungeons will reward a cache with Heroic Nerub-ar Palace gear (item level 610-619) instead of Normal difficulty loot. These pieces can also be upgraded with crests to increase their power.If you’re more concerned about the collectibles available with Timewalking Badges, the Turbulent Timeways event is a great time to stock up on them: you can get 500 a week on each character via the quest drop you get by running a single Timewalking dungeon, with additional Badges for every boss you kill. Those still looking to purchase mounts will be well on their way, and if there are any other items you are missing — or reputation you want to finish — now’s the perfect time to acquire them. Reputation gains for the week’s faction are boosted by 50% and you can buy tokens for bonus reputation at Timewalking vendors. You may even be lucky enough to acquire the Infinite Timereaver, which is what I keep telling myself every time I queue up.Since the most recent Timewalking event (ignoring the persistent Classic Timewalking during the 20th Anniversary) was for Cataclysm, the Turbulent Timeways will start with Mists of Pandaria Timewalking the week of January 7. Unlike last time the weeks will be in expansion order, and Warlords of Draenor will not be skipped.Here are the dates for each Timewalking week during Turbulent Timeways:Week of January 7: Mists of PandariaGate of the Setting Sun, Mogu’shan Palace, Scholomance, Shado-Pan Monastery, Stormstout Brewery, Temple of the Jade SerpentWeek of January 14: Warlords of DraenorAuchindoun, Bloodmaul Slag Mines, Everbloom, Grimrail Depot, Shadowmoon Burial Grounds, SkyreachWeek of January 21: LegionBlack Rook Hold, Court of Stars, Darkheart Thicket, Eye of Azshara, Neltharion’s Lair, Vault of the WardensWeek of January 28: ClassicDeadmines, Dire Maul East, Dire Maul West, Stratholme, Zul’FarrakWeek of February 4: Burning CrusadeDungeons: Blood Furnace, Botanica, Magisters’ Terrace, Mana-Tombs, Shattered Halls, UnderbogRaid: Black TempleWeek of February 11:Wrath of the Lich KingDungeons: Azjol-Nerub, Forge of Souls, Gundrak, Halls of Lightning, Nexus, Utgarde KeepRaid: UlduarWeek of September 18: CataclysmDungeons: Blackrock Caverns, End Time, Lost City of the Tol’vir, Stonecore, Throne of the Tides, Vortex PinnacleRaid: FirelandsWhile the Timewalking raids — Black Temple, Ulduar, and Firelands — will be available during their respective weeks, they do not have any additional rewards during the Turbulent Timeways event.

Title: Bitcoin’s Price Prediction For 2025: What To Watch For This Year
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/bitcoin-price-prediction-2025/
Time Published: 2025-01-07T21:12:48Z
Full Content:
As 2025 unfolds, bitcoin’s trajectory will be shaped by increased sovereign adoption, liquidity ... [+] dynamics and integration into corporate treasuries. Bitcoin’s remarkable journey in 2024 set the stage for a transformative year. With institutional adoption skyrocketing, regulatory clarity improving and technological advancements accelerating, the question on everyone’s mind is: where will bitcoin go in 2025? This article explores bitcoin’s current state, the factors shaping its price, expert predictions, opportunities and challenges for the coming year. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious observer, here’s what you need to know about bitcoin’s potential in 2025. Bitcoin’s evolution in 2024 cemented its status as a mainstream asset. With its price breaching the $100,000 mark, it drew unprecedented interest from institutional investors, retail traders and governments. The approval of multiple spot bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was a pivotal moment, ushering billions in new liquidity and normalizing bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle. Institutional adoption was another major milestone. Leading firms like BlackRock and BNY Mellon embraced bitcoin, offering custody and trading solutions to their clients. This institutional confidence supported a dramatic and sustained rise in bitcoin’s price in 2024. Now, we may see a virtuous cycle of increased inflows and reduced volatility. Bitcoin’s position on corporate balance sheets also looks set to grow, with corporations like MicroStrategy expanding their holdings to record levels and dozens of other companies following suit. With regulatory frameworks becoming clearer and adoption growing across industries, bitcoin entered 2025 with significant momentum. Its resilience and unmatched monetary properties make it a cornerstone of the emerging digital financial ecosystem. Several forces are shaping bitcoin’s price in 2025, ranging from institutional adoption and regulatory developments to technological innovation. Together, these factors will determine whether bitcoin continues its upward trajectory or faces hurdles in its mainstream acceptance. Institutional participation in bitcoin markets reached historic levels in 2024, with firms like BlackRock, BNY Mellon and Fidelity integrating bitcoin into their offerings. Spot bitcoin ETFs, hailed as a watershed moment, provided regulated avenues for large capital pools, such as pension funds and retirement accounts, to gain exposure. This wave of adoption not only brought new liquidity but also reduced market volatility, making bitcoin more attractive to risk-averse investors. In 2025, increased institutional participation could further stabilize bitcoin’s price and cement its role as a core portfolio asset for long-term wealth preservation. Regulation played a defining role in bitcoin’s 2024 success, with the SEC approving multiple spot ETFs and clarifying its stance on bitcoin as a commodity. These developments bolstered investor confidence and fostered broader acceptance. Looking ahead, regulation could either propel bitcoin to new heights or present obstacles. In the long term, bitcoin will overcome any roadblocks put in its way by regulators, lobbies or financial institutions, because capital naturally flows into the hardest form of money available. However, financial incumbents can slow the speed of adoption if they mount a strong resistance to bitcoin. Bitcoin’s technological ecosystem continues to evolve, enhancing its scalability, privacy, and utility. “Layer 2” (L2) innovations like the Lightning Network enables near-instant transactions at negligible cost. Newer L2 technologies like Ark and Fedimints will continue to mature, pushing forward bitcoin’s viability as a medium of exchange. Upcoming advancements, such as privacy-enhancing features like Silent Payments and improved self-custody solutions will make bitcoin even more secure and accessible. Additionally, bitcoin-backed lending protocols are poised to unlock liquidity without requiring holders to give up custody of their assets. These developments will reinforce bitcoin’s appeal as both a currency and a store of value. The events of 2024 have sparked a wide range of predictions for bitcoin’s price in 2025, reflecting varying levels of optimism and caution. Bullish predictions for bitcoin's price in 2025 from posts on X suggest a significant upward trend. CNBC analyst Tom Lee’s target number is $250,000. Matthew Sigel of VanEck forecasts $180,000. These forecasts reflect a strong belief in continued institutional adoption, the impact of bitcoin ETFs, and the cyclical nature of bitcoin's price movements post-halving. Of course, mega-bulls like Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor expect multi-million dollar bitcoin in the next few years, though not necessarily in 2025. Bearish analysts caution against over-exuberance, highlighting macroeconomic risks like tightening monetary policies and potential regulatory crackdowns. A historical correlation with M2 suggests that bitcoin may depreciate as monetary conditions tighten. Peter L. Brandt, a respected market analyst, warns that his technical analysis might indicate a crash to $78,000, but that the price could then either continue declining or rise precipitously. There are no indicators that we have another “crypto winter” on the horizon, but then again, there weren’t any clear indicators that one was going to come in 2022, either. The collapse of the politically-connected money laundering operation known as FTX, and the subsequent attempts to cover up ties between stolen money and donations to prominent political leaders, unexpectedly blew up what had been a favorable macroeconomic environment for continued bitcoin price appreciation. The thing about black swans is that they are, well, black swans – there’s always a chance that bitcoin adoption will be temporarily held back by another liquidity crisis in fiat-based finance. Some price targets for 2025 are more neutral in nature. As a typical example, this X user suggests bitcoin might start the year with a dip around $80,000 to $85,000 due to the January inauguration, then recover to make new all-time highs but face rejections before trending higher into a blowoff top by the end of the year. Some investors who believe quantum computing advancements threaten bitcoin have rated BTC a “hold.” Although these investors are correct to point out that quantum computing will necessitate changes to bitcoin’s protocol, there is no reason to single out bitcoin in this regard. Encryption is a key part of virtually all modern businesses, so by this logic, all stocks would also be rated a hold indefinitely until company leadership can present a credible plan for post-quantum transition. In 2025, developments in regulation, technology, and mainstream acceptance are set to significantly impact bitcoin’s exchange rate with the dollar. Below are key trends that could drive bitcoin’s continued growth. Global liquidity conditions in 2025 may create a favorable environment for Bitcoin’s appreciation. China’s bond market rally, with 10-year yields hitting multi-decade lows due to rate cut expectations, signals a broader shift in economic policy. Simultaneously, U.S. Treasury bills are maturing at unprecedented levels, and there is a strong possibility that the U.S. federal government will pivot toward tariffs as a revenue source, which could significantly raise the prices of consumer and capital goods in the short term. These factors point to an inflationary environment, with the Federal Reserve likely constrained in its ability to tighten monetary policy further. Historically, such inflationary pressures have resulted in asset price increases, which would mean bitcoin’s price could rise alongside stocks, real estate and other stores of value. Sovereign adoption of bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset remains a compelling possibility for 2025. In the U.S., the regulatory shift toward bitcoin-friendly policies, exemplified by pro-bitcoin voices within the Trump administration, could set a precedent for broader acceptance. This legitimacy, in turn, could prompt other nations to explore bitcoin as a reserve asset. Sovereign adoption also reduces circulating supply, as reserves are typically held long-term and removed from active market liquidity. As more nations accumulate bitcoin for strategic reserves, a combination of reduced supply and increased demand could lead to sustained price increases. Mainstream integration of bitcoin into business treasury operations could be a defining trend in 2025. MicroStrategy’s addition to the QQQ index signaled that markets are increasingly willing to embrace companies with substantial bitcoin holdings. Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule change now allows companies to report bitcoin holdings at fair market value rather than cost basis, making it more appealing for firms to hold bitcoin without distorting their balance sheets. An emerging ecosystem for collateralized lending, including bitcoin-backed debt instruments, is also taking shape. This development enables companies to secure liquidity without selling their bitcoin holdings, effectively integrating bitcoin-backed financing into standard business operations. As more firms adopt these practices, bitcoin’s role as a core asset for financial resilience and growth will become more prominent, driving further adoption and market demand. Despite bitcoin’s remarkable progress, several challenges could impact its growth in 2025. These include state-led attempts to control financial systems, speculative concerns around future technologies, and macroeconomic uncertainties. Understanding these potential hurdles is crucial for gauging bitcoin’s resilience and long-term outlook. As bitcoin adoption grows, state actors may attempt to assert control over financial sovereignty through regulatory measures and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), outlined ambitious plans for 2025, including launching the digital euro and reshaping euro banknotes. These initiatives are part of a broader strategy to maintain influence over monetary systems amid growing inflationary pressures. CBDCs could be used to limit bitcoin’s role by offering a state-backed alternative, potentially accompanied by stricter regulations on decentralized currencies. However, history shows that attempts to suppress bitcoin often have the opposite effect, driving adoption as users seek financial systems resistant to control and censorship. The geopolitical instability in regions like Europe, coupled with the ongoing U.S. embrace of bitcoin, could further highlight the contrast between permissionless money like bitcoin and state-issued digital assets. Fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) about quantum computing’s impact on bitcoin’s security has recently resurfaced in mainstream discourse. Critics claim that future quantum computers could break bitcoin’s cryptographic security, rendering the network vulnerable to attack. However, quantum computing will pose a problem for virtually all digital systems that modern life relies upon. Bitcoin’s encryption protocol can be upgraded to be quantum-safe. Upgrading thousands of other systems and protocols could be much more challenging. In reality, quantum computing is a problem for every single system that uses encryption, and will need to be addressed with a Y2K-style effort with all hands on deck. Quantum computing doesn’t pose a unique problem for bitcoin. Macroeconomic conditions remain a significant factor influencing bitcoin’s performance. Global economic uncertainty, driven by inflationary pressures, geopolitical conflicts and shifts in monetary policy, will continue to shape financial markets. In Europe, rising inflation rates and political instability — exacerbated by coalition collapses in major economies like Germany and France — add further complexity. In the U.S., fiscal challenges, including the potential shift to tariffs as a revenue stream, could influence both domestic and global financial dynamics. While bitcoin thrives in inflationary environments due to its scarcity, extreme economic instability can also deter adoption if liquidity becomes constrained. Conversely, prolonged economic turbulence could position bitcoin as a safe-haven asset for those seeking to preserve wealth outside traditional financial systems. Bitcoin’s trajectory in 2025 depends on a combination of factors, from institutional adoption and technological innovation to regulatory clarity. While short-term volatility remains likely, the long-term outlook for bitcoin is robust, with adoption trends and monetary properties driving its growth. However, nobody can predict the price of bitcoin. Investors should approach this asset class with a long-term perspective, understanding its potential as a tool for generational wealth creation, not a reliable source of short term trading profits. As bitcoin continues to mature as an asset, the strategies for investing in it are evolving. This section explores key strategies — diversifying your portfolio, staying informed on market trends, and leveraging dollar-cost averaging — to help navigate bitcoin investing in 2025 and beyond. Bitcoin remains a high-growth asset with significant upside. BlackRock now recommends an optimal allocation of about 2%. What this means is that one of the largest financial firms in the world sees bitcoin as playing a role in managing the risk and growth potential of a mainstream portfolio. In 2025 and beyond, when we talk about diversification across asset classes, bitcoin will be assumed to be part of the picture. The mantra to simply buy and HODL bitcoin is easy to understand and follow, and has provided substantial returns over the long term. However, if you are one of those investors that feels like something is missing unless you’re actively researching and investing in market movers, the thing to watch in 2025 is corporate adoption. Companies that incorporate bitcoin into their treasury strategy may perform differently than others, as we saw with MicroStrategy in 2024. Several new ETFs are awaiting approval that would provide exposure to companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheets. Dollar-cost averaging allows investors to build a bitcoin position over time, reducing the impact of short-term price fluctuations. This technique lets you set it and forget it, rather than trying to time the market. Modern bitcoin platforms make it easy to dollar-cost average into bitcoin. Bitcoin’s journey through 2024 cemented its position as a cornerstone of the global financial landscape. Institutional adoption surged with the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, while regulatory clarity and technological advancements strengthened its appeal as a long-term asset. Despite potential challenges, including macroeconomic uncertainty and state-level opposition, bitcoin’s unmatched monetary properties continue to drive global demand. As 2025 unfolds, bitcoin’s trajectory will be shaped by increased sovereign adoption, liquidity dynamics and integration into corporate treasuries. Whether bullish or cautious, one fact remains indisputable — bitcoin’s adoption curve only points upward. Investors should approach this asset with a long-term perspective, recognizing it as a tool for generational wealth in an era where financial innovation and sound money converge. While predictions vary, long-term adoption trends suggest upward momentum, despite potential short-term volatility. That said, it is impossible to predict bitcoin’s price. You should always do your own research and consult your financial advisor before investing. Yes, institutional participation is a key driver, providing liquidity and stabilizing markets. ETFs and other traditional financial instruments are providing bitcoin exposure to investment portfolios that could never access it before. While there is always the possibility that a government decides to attack bitcoin using environmental policy, the political winds in the U.S. have shifted in such a decisive way in favor of bitcoin that I believe a major environmental campaign against bitcoin is unlikely in 2025. Bitcoin tends to appreciate over long time scales but exhibits price volatility in the short term. That’s why it’s usually a good idea to only invest what you can afford to set aside and not touch for a long time. Rather than timing the market, use dollar-cost averaging techniques to buy small amounts consistently over time. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street's Radar. As reported by Reuters, Wall Street’s main indexes rose on Monday to more than one-week highs, driven by a rally in semiconductor stocks and news suggesting that the incoming Trump administration could adopt a less aggressive tariff stance than previously anticipated.

According to Citigroup, the company’s spending plan was a “modest positive” update as it removed the risk of a drop in capital expenditures. Ever since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022, investments in AI have surged drastically. Since AI requires drastic computing power, tech companies have been investing billions to enhance their AI infrastructures and broaden their data center networks. The race, however, isn’t just limited to the US. Efforts are being made to protect the country’s leadership in AI against the rest of the world, particularly China. China, in turn, has begun offering developing countries subsidized access to scarce chips, and it’s also promising to build local AI data centers. Moves like these could position the country as an AI leader in the future, something that the US is actively making efforts to avoid. However, regardless of the capital expenditures companies are making toward AI, one analyst says that these are no longer going to be enough in 2025. David Dietze of Peapack Private Wealth Management said that a major theme for 2025 is going to be “Show Me The Money”. Dietze said that even though major companies have been investing billions in AI partnerships and similar initiatives, investors are soon going to be demanding proof of returns. “Wall Street’s the type of place where it’s like, ‘Show me the money, like, yesterday…These investments and capital expenditures are great, but when does the cash flow start coming in? And right now many AI companies have gotten a pass on that, but I think increasingly Wall Street’s going to say, ‘No, we’ve seen the capital expenditures, you’ve got the AI label, but now we want to see the cash flows coming in from that. And that’s what we’re gonna be watching so carefully next year”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43 Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is a leading provider of artificial intelligence systems. Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR) has had a spectacular year fueled by artificial intelligence, but an analyst from Morgan Stanley has recently turned negative on the red-hot stock. On January 6th, analyst Sanjit Singh assumed company coverage with an “Underweight” rating and placed a $60 price target on the stock, an estimated 25% downside from Friday’s close. According to Singh, despite Palantir’s (PLTR) early AI strides, the potential risks seem to outweigh the potential rewards. The firm, which hadn’t previously rated the stock, acknowledged that the company has been performing well and has good momentum, but also contended that the stock price already reflects this success which is “more than priced in at the current multiple premium”. “The skills/capabilities of the enterprise with respect to building AI applications should likely improve, which may make it difficult for Palantir (PLTR) to sustain its current level of momentum, creating downside risk given the premium valuation of the shares”. Overall, PLTR ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks on Wall Street's Radar. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Why Wall Street Banks Are Suddenly Quitting A Global Climate Group
URL: https://observer.com/2025/01/banks-quite-climate-alliance/
Time Published: 2025-01-07T17:19:32Z

From Goldman Sachs (GS) to Morgan Stanley (MS), many of the largest banks in the U.S. are quitting an international climate group amid rising political pressure as the nation enters a second Trump presidency. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. First launched in April 2021, the United Nations’ Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) aims to make the financial sector more environmentally sustainable by converges banks, insurers and investors to set sustainability targets in line with the group’s standards. The NZBA has more than 140 bank members across 44 countries that manage $64 trillion in total assets. But in recent weeks, U.S. banks have been pulling out of the group en masse. Goldman Sachs was the first major Wall Street bank to pull out of the NZBA, announcing its departure on Dec. 6 without giving a reason. The move came just days after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued BlackRock (BLK), Vanguard and State Street—three of the largest asset managers in the world—for conspiring to manipulate energy markets. Paxton accused these institutional investors for pressuring coal companies in which they own large stakes into reducing production and deceiving investors into pursuing ESG (environmental, social and governance) strategies. On its website, Goldman Sachs still keeps its commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emission by 2030 across its operations and supply chain. The bank said it’s still “very focused on the increasingly elevated sustainability standards and reporting requirements imposed by regulators around the world.” Wells Fargo (WFC) announced its departure from the group on Dec. 20. Again, the bank did not provide a reason but maintains a sustainability page on its website, which includes a goal to reduce energy usage from 2019 levels by half before 2030. Four days before Wells Fargo’s withdrawal, a number of climate advocacy groups co-published a letter to the NZBA addressing “slipping standards” within the group. “The alliance must not seek to appease or accommodate potential defectors or remain complacent when its members dilute their targets, as doing so undermines the very purpose of the coalition and jeopardizes global climate goals,” the letter said. For instance, Morgan Stanley loosened its target to align with the Paris Agreement’s maximum warming goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius to 1.7 degrees Celsius—“a lower ambition scenario requiring less emissions reductions by the bank,” the letter said. Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) both quit the NZBA on the last day of 2024. Citi said it’s working towards its own goals outside of the group while Bank of America said it will continue working with clients on environmental issues and meeting their needs. Like their peers, Citi’s net-zero goals and Bank of America’s environmental sustainability commitments remain published on their respective websites. Both banks seek to achieve net-zero carbon emission across its financing activities, operations and supply chain by 2050. Morgan Stanley quit the NZBA on Jan. 2. The bank also gave no reason for its defection but maintains its internal climate goals. The bank says it reached carbon neutrality in 2022, but is still working on reaching net-zero financed emissions, with interim goals set for 2030. Some ESG experts see the exodus as more of an attempt to align with political pressure than a retreat from climate commitments. “Financing sustainable initiatives is increasingly linked to long-term profitability and market demand,” Sunil Kansal, head of consulting and valuation services at the ESG consulting firm Shasat, told Observer. “What matters is not the framework but the outcome. Banks will continue to drive the green transition, adapting their strategies to evolving circumstances.” “These exits are not a rejection of climate action. They reflect a reaction to multiple factors,” Chris Pyke, chief innovation officer at the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB), told Observer. He alluded to factors like reporting burdens, challenging targets and—perhaps most relevant for U.S. banks—antitrust scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. As the nation heads into a second Trump presidency, efforts to firm up environmental reporting regulations are likely to fall flat given his anti-regulation stance.

Title: Earthquakes and Blowouts Undermine Case for Carbon Storage in Texas
URL: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/southcentral/2025/01/07/807181.htm
Time Published: 2025-01-07T17:03:27Z

Texas has seen surging interest from companies hoping to bury carbon dioxide in its oilfields, putting the state at the vanguard of a government-subsidized program to fight climate change. But pumping CO2 into the ground could exacerbate earthquakes and well blowouts already happening in the Permian Basin as Texas struggles to manage wastewater disposal, potentially undermining public support. “Without legitimate oversight of underground injection in Texas, we expect more geyser-like well blowouts, sinkholes, leaks from plugged and unplugged wells, and injection-induced earthquakes,” said Virginia Palacios, executive director of Commission Shift, a Texas watchdog group pushing for tougher oversight of the oil and gas industry. Such consequences have rarely happened as a result of CO2 injection over the decades the technology has been deployed. The unprecedented vast volume of carbon now proposed for burial, however, worries activists and researchers. Carbon sequestration is vital to U.S. government goals to reduce emissions that cause global warming. The Biden administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, landmark climate-change legislation, includes billions of dollars worth of subsidies for CCS projects. While President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to gut the IRA, energy experts say CCS subsidies will likely survive due to bipartisan support. Trump’s transition team did not provide comment. Several companies, including Occidental Petroleum OXY.N, plan to take advantage of IRA subsidies. The projects are concentrated in Texas, where CCS proponents argue underground geology is ideal for storing liquid and gaseous waste. PERMIT APPLICATIONS JUMP Over the last 12 months, the number of applications filed with the Environmental Protection Agency for carbon injection permits in Texas has jumped by 63% to 43, according to the agency, making it a national leader. But Texas is dogged by problems linked to disposal of drilling wastewater underground. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) regulator has grappled with leaks and blowouts from orphan wells, as well as earthquakes, triggered by higher pressure underground from water injection. Reuters spoke with a dozen Texas landowners and researchers who said proposed CO2 projects need more oversight than the state can offer to avert environmental and safety risks. The RRC is seeking authority from the EPA to oversee its own permitting program for carbon sequestration to speed up approvals. The EPA, which is also reviewing Texas’ handling of wastewater permitting following the blowouts, said the request was being considered. The RRC said in a statement it is capable of effectively regulating CO2 injection wells, adding it has hired more staff. Trump’s victory increases the chances Texas will get this authority, experts say. North Dakota was the first state to receive oversight authority during Trump’s first term and its governor, Doug Burgum, is Trump’s pick for interior secretary, which includes responsibility for drilling permits on federal land. Burgum did not respond to requests for comment. REASON FOR CONCERN One of the biggest Texas projects is the Stratos direct air capture joint venture in Ector County between Occidental and asset manager BlackRock. It is expected to inject 8.5 million metric tons of CO2 starting next year. The county has numerous abandoned wells at risk of erupting if underground pressure rises and CO2 eats away at cement plugs, said oil and gas attorney Sarah Stogner, who represents landowners that have had blowouts. There have been 19,700 wells drilled in the county since 1993, according to data from state agencies. Nineteen are orphan wells, with no company legally responsible for ensuring they remain plugged, including three close to the Stratos site. Raymond Straub, a hydrogeologist who owns a Texas groundwater services firm, testified at an October EPA hearing that he was concerned Occidental did not devote enough attention to the unplugged or badly plugged orphan wells in the project area. Occidental spokesperson William Fitzgerald said the company had done extensive site surveys to ensure it would be safe. “This survey confirmed the location of three wells, which Occidental will address prior to beginning CO2 injection,” he said. “There is more than 3,000 feet of confining rock layers above the sequestration zone to securely contain the CO2.” A pilot project by agribusiness ADM ADM.N in Illinois, the first of its kind meant to demonstrate the technical feasibility of commercial carbon injection, has suffered leaks and other setbacks, underscoring worries. ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said the leaks have presented no risk to surface or groundwater or to public health, and that the company is confident in CCS technology. Dominic DiGiulio, an independent energy analyst and former EPA official who has studied CCS, said, however, that CO2 can corrode the cement casings of plugged wells. “These abandoned wells will in fact leak,” he said. A 2023 paper by Chinese researchers, published in Earth-Science Reviews, said CO2 injection could also boost the risk of earthquakes. The researchers did not respond to requests for comment. Large leaks could acidify groundwater, and suffocate people and animals if it displaces oxygen above ground, according to nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust. “This is supposed to be permanent storage,” said Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network. “If it can’t even contain it for 10 years, why do we think it can contain it forever?” she added, referring to ADM’s project.

With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is immune to inflation in a way that traditional currencies simply can’t match. The financial landscape is evolving, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of this transformation. What started as a niche experiment is now being embraced by major institutions like BlackRock, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and even nations like El Salvador as their required currency. For business owners, the question is no longer if Bitcoin will play a role in the future of finance but how it will benefit their businesses today. Why Bitcoin Matters for Business Owners Bitcoin’s unique appeal lies in its scarcity. With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, it’s immune to inflation in a way that traditional currencies simply can’t match. The US dollar has declined 98% in purchasing power since 1913 and will continue to decline long term. This makes Bitcoin a customer payment option and a strategic asset for businesses looking to meet customers where they’re at and store value. Forward-thinking business owners are already exploring how Bitcoin can: Adopting Bitcoin doesn’t have to be risky or complex. I’ve designed a five-week implementation project specifically for business owners. It starts small—just $100—and focuses on three actionable steps: The goal is simple: to make Bitcoin accessible and practical for businesses of all sizes. To explore this strategy further, watch my video, in which I explain the benefits of Bitcoin and outline the steps to get started. Watch the video here. Navigating the Bitcoin landscape is easier with the proper support. That’s why I’ve created a WhatsApp group exclusively for business owners interested in integrating Bitcoin into their operations.

We came across a bullish thesis on IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT) on Substack by LittleBarnSparrow. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on IDT. IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT)'s share was trading at $46.87 as of Jan 6th. IDT’s trailing P/E was 16.05 according to Yahoo Finance. A technician inserting a credit card into a point-of-sale machine for identity authentication. IDT Corporation, a diversified holding company, has emerged as a compelling investment opportunity, balancing legacy businesses with high-growth segments. Its portfolio includes three stagnating or declining legacy businesses and three rapidly expanding ventures with significant addressable markets. Recent results underscore IDT's strong operational performance, robust balance sheet, and strategic investments aimed at amplifying profitability through operating leverage. This positions IDT as a well-rounded company with promising near- and long-term growth prospects. The standout performer, National Retail Solutions (NRS), specializes in providing Point-of-Sale (PoS) systems and associated recurring services to small retailers. In the latest quarter, NRS reported a 26.5% revenue increase, with recurring revenues up 29%, driven by improved ARPU and expanding profitability margins. Despite cyclicality in advertising revenue, the company has strategically diversified its revenue streams, now relying more on payment processing and software solutions, which offer higher-quality, non-cyclical growth. NRS is actively broadening its total addressable market by targeting verticals like small restaurants, hotels, and gas stations. With adjusted EBITDA margins now at 25% and a trajectory toward $135 million in revenues by 2025, NRS is on track to deliver approximately $35 million in EBITDA, making it a cornerstone of IDT’s growth story. The Fintech segment, led by BOSS Money, IDT's money remittance business, has shown exceptional performance, with revenues surging 45% year-over-year. Management is prioritizing margin improvement, with adjusted EBITDA jumping to $4 million this quarter. Investments in working capital, particularly for disbursement funding, highlight a strategic commitment to sustaining strong growth in this high-potential area, supported by IDT's cash-rich position—a distinct competitive edge in a working capital-intensive industry. Net2Phone, IDT's cloud communications segment, reported 13% revenue growth despite currency headwinds, with ARPU improvements in premium services like Communication Center as a Service. While its performance is less dynamic than NRS or BOSS Money, it remains a steady contributor with strong growth prospects. Legacy businesses, which still account for a significant portion of revenue, provide a stable financial foundation, even as they lose share to the rapidly growing segments. With management's focus on building NRS into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise and leveraging the momentum of BOSS Money, IDT appears poised for substantial value creation. Despite the CEO's understated communication style, the company’s consistent results and strategic direction inspire confidence. At its current valuation, IDT offers a compelling investment case with significant upside potential fueled by its high-growth segments and operational excellence. IDT Corporation (NYSE:IDT) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 14 hedge fund portfolios held IDT at the end of the third quarter which was 15 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of IDT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Micron Technologies (MU) is climbing for a second straight day after Nvidia (NVDA) noted that it was using MU's chips in its new products. After advancing 10.5% yesterday, the shares are climbing 6% today. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reported yesterday that Micron's high-bandwidth-memory (HBM) chips were being incorporated into NVDA's new GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell gaming chips. 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors Considered a key component of AI, HBM has been an important growth engine for Micron. During the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings call, held on Dec. 18, Chief Business Officer Sumit Sadana noted that HBM, combined with SSD chips, had enabled the company's revenue from data centers to soar 400% versus the same period a year earlier during the quarter. Adding that HBM had become a multiple billion-dollar business, Sadana noted that more than half of the company's revenue was being generated by data centers. Foxconn's Strong Results and Micron's Presence on Evercore's List MU stock was also likely lifted yesterday by the slightly stronger-than-expected Q4 results reported by electronics maker Foxconn. The largest manufacturer of Apple's (AAPL) iPhones, Taiwan-based Foxconn reported Q4 sales of 2.13 trillion New Taiwan dollars or $65 billion. Analysts had expected the company’s revenue to come in at 2.1 trillion New Taiwan dollars, according to an average compiled by LSEG SmartEstimate. Micron sells chips to Apple. Also yesterday, Micron was included on a list of stocks called “AI Enablers, Adopters and Adapters.” Compiled by investment bank Evercore ISI, the list includes members of the Russell 3000 index whose market caps are above $3 billion and whose previous earnings calls include more references to AI than average for Russell 2000 members in the previous four quarters. Additionally, the stocks on the had to have had a positive reaction to their earnings, while their forward P/E ratios trade below their five-year average. Finally, Evercore ISI predicts that the earnings per share of all of the names on the list will increase by at least 9.6%. While we acknowledge the potential of MU, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Canadian Penny Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Galiano Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:GAU) stands against other best Canadian penny stocks to buy according to analysts. According to a report by the Government of Canada, released on December 16, the country’s economic outlook has been revised upward, as private-sector economists forecast moderate growth of around 2% in the second half of 2025. The report highlights the average of private sector forecasts are used as the basis for economic and fiscal planning in Canada to ensure objectivity and transparency. The Department of Finance surveyed a group of 11 private sector economists in September 2024, who expect the Canadian economy to benefit from robust growth in the US, driven by rising equity markets and increasing confidence among US households and businesses. The economists forecast that the unemployment rate will also stabilize to 6.6% by the end of 2025 compared to 6.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The report also states that the government is reducing the federal debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. The federal debt-to-GDP ratio in 2023-24 was 42.1% and is forecasted to decline to 41.9% in 2024-25.

In an interview with BNN Bloomberg on January 3, Gavin Graham, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager at Spire Wealth Management, discussed the investment landscape for 2025, particularly focusing on Canadian stocks. Graham acknowledged that Canada has been a market leader in cutting interest rates which provides them a much better position than their U.S. counterparts, specifically in sectors such as pipelines, utilities, REITs, telecom, and financials, which are interest-rate sensitive industries. In the energy sector, Graham expressed a preference for natural gas companies which have performed well due to low cost structure and the potential for increased demand due to the anticipation of colder weather in the US. Despite the local weather-related volatility in North America, he sees a positive outlook for the sector due to the impact of geopolitical events, such as Ukraine ending its gas imports from Russia, which could further influence natural gas prices. Graham also recommended that investors allocate 5 to 10% of their portfolios to gold, citing the robust performance of gold miners. He noted that while gold itself was up 27% last year, gold miners have underperformed relative to the metal and suggests that major gold miners have the potential to outperform. Gold mining stocks, being a leveraged play on the price of gold, could see significant gains if the gold price continues to rise and can offer attractive dividend yields and a hedge against economic uncertainty. Canada’s economic outlook for 2025 appears optimistic, with moderate growth expectations, a stabilizing unemployment rate, and a declining interest rate along with the favourable federal debt-to-GDP ratio. Investors seeking diversification and high-growth potential should look at opportunities in undervalued sectors within the Canadian market. An aerial view of Asanko Gold Mine in Ghana, West Africa.

(NYSEAMERICAN:GAU), headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, is a gold production and exploration company that operates and owns 90% of the Asanko Gold Mine located on the Asankrangwa Gold Belt in the Republic of Ghana, West Africa. Galiano Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:GAU) is focusing on optimizing its operations at the Asanko Gold Mine. The company has made significant progress in ramping up mining operations at the Abore pit, with a 32% increase in tons mined and a 13% increase in gold production in the third quarter of 2024. The company is also investing in new equipment and technology, including a mobile crushing unit at the Abore pit, which is expected to improve fragmentation and increase haul truckload volumes. Additionally, Galiano Gold Inc. (GAU) is progressing with the construction of a secondary crushing unit, which will enable the company to maintain above-nameplate levels even when processing harder fresh raw material. Galiano Gold Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN:GAU) is also advancing its exploration pipeline, with drilling focused on the Sky Gold B and Abore North targets. A follow-up drilling program at the Abore North target has been defined and is scheduled to commence in the upcoming months. The company is also updating its global mineral reserves and resources, which will provide a clear picture of the company’s resource base and inform its life of mine plan. The report will be released to the market in early 2025. Overall, GAU ranks 4th on our list of best Canadian penny stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of GAU to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Happy New Year, Bitcoin!

Bitcoin 2025 2024 was a big year for Bitcoin. It was the year of the spot Bitcoin ETF approvals, the beginnings of corporate adoption of Bitcoin, and the first crossing of the hundred-thousand-dollar milestone. Of these, the ETF did the most to bring mass adoption to Bitcoin. Now, any retirement account can have Bitcoin exposure at the click of a button. Though it does not provide true bitcoin ownership in the form of self-custody of private keys, it does act as a gateway drug to get normies interested in Bitcoin. Perhaps the most important person of the year for Bitcoin was Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock. Fink has a low-profile presence in the financial press, but enough clout that his endorsement was enough to give comfort to vast pools of capital to invest in Bitcoin. BlackRock’s stamp of approval was a big win for Bitcoin, and the ETF inflows are likely what led to crossing the $100k threshold. Speaking of which, my favorite Bitcoin video of the year was God Save The Coin by Michael Goldstein of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute. It runs through all the different criticisms Bitcoin faced since its inception. At the end of the day, Bitcoin doesn't care and marches on. The narratives and criticism around Bitcoin will constantly shift and evolve, yet there is nothing like the market test to prove its value. Looking ahead, 2025 will be the year of corporate adoption of Bitcoin. This is already happening, with MicroStrategy leading the pack and open-sourcing its playbook for companies to convert their cash holdings into bitcoin. Not only have most of the bitcoin miners decided to HODL bitcoin, but so too have over a dozen other assorted companies. I expect a Fortune 500 company to buy bitcoin on its balance sheet this year in 2025, and Michael Saylor to be the most famous/infamous figure for Bitcoin in 2025. I’ll write separately about MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury operations and assess its leverage/risk, but its most fascinating impact is on the corporate bond market, which can now have Bitcoin exposure through convertible debt. And it's not just MicroStrategy, as all the other miners are following suit, with Marathon and Riot leading the pack. The bond markets are larger than the equity markets, and providing this channel for the bond market to have Bitcoin exposure is probably the most unanticipated outcome in Bitcoin thus far, and may have the most significant consequences that no one expected. Finally, I'm optimistic that the new Trump Administration will adopt favorable regulation towards crypto in general, though I do not expect the US government to buy bitcoin the way it holds gold. The new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers is favorable to the idea of the US holding Bitcoin. But he has remarked that the US already holds so much bitcoin because of prior seizures (like the Silk Road). I expect the new administration to simply re-label those holdings as a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, without making any new purchases this year. As for corporate adoption, I expect small companies to continue to convert some of their cash to bitcoin. For the big companies, my Hail Mary bet is that the first major purchase will come from Tesla, Meta, or Dell. Tesla already has some bitcoin on its balance sheet from its purchase a few years ago, and Elon Musk is slowly learning about the problems of inflation while advising President Trump, evidenced by his posting of Milton Friedman videos on X. Mark Zuckerberg is pushing forward open-source AI; the next logical step is open-source money. So I’m optimistic about 2025 for Bitcoin, even though 2024 will be hard to beat! One Community.

Title: The Great Crypto Crash

Trump will usher in a speculative frenzy. Produced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. “The countdown clock on the next catastrophic crash has already started,” Dennis Kelleher, the president of the nonprofit Better Markets, told me. In the past few weeks, I have heard that sentiment or similar from economists, traders, Hill staffers, and government officials. The incoming Trump administration has promised to pass crypto-friendly regulations, and is likely to loosen strictures on Wall Street institutions as well. This will bring an unheralded era of American prosperity, it argues, maintaining the country’s position as the head of the global capital markets and the heart of the global investment ecosystem. “My vision is for an America that dominates the future,” Donald Trump told a bitcoin conference in July. “I’m laying out my plan to ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet and the bitcoin superpower of the world.” Annie Lowrey: The three pillars of the bro-economy Financial experts expect something different. First, a boom. A big boom, maybe, with the price of bitcoin, ether, and other cryptocurrencies climbing; financial firms raking in profits; and American investors awash in newfound wealth. Second, a bust. A big bust, maybe, with firms collapsing, the government being called in to steady the markets, and plenty of Americans suffering from foreclosures and bankruptcies. Having written about bitcoin for more than a decade—and having covered the last financial crisis and its long hangover—I have some sense of what might cause that boom and bust. Crypto assets tend to be exceedingly volatile, much more so than real estate, commodities, stocks, and bonds. Egged on by Washington, more Americans will invest in crypto. Prices will go up as cash floods in. Individuals and institutions will get wiped out when prices drop, as they inevitably will. The experts I spoke with did not counter that narrative. But if that’s all that happens, they told me, the United States and the world should count themselves lucky. The danger is not just that crypto-friendly regulation will expose millions of Americans to scams and volatility. The danger is that it will lead to an increase in leverage across the whole of the financial system. It will foster opacity, making it harder for investors to determine the riskiness of and assign prices to financial products. And it will do so at the same time as the Trump administration cuts regulations and regulators. Crypto will become more widespread. And the conventional financial markets will come to look more like the crypto markets—wilder, less transparent, and more unpredictable, with trillion-dollar consequences extending years into the future. “I have this worry that the next three or four years will look pretty good,” Eswar Prasad, an economist at Cornell and a former International Monetary Fund official, told me. “It’s what comes after, when we have to pick up the pieces from all the speculative frenzies that are going to be generated because of this administration’s actions.” For years, Washington has “waged a war on crypto and bitcoin like nobody’s ever seen,” Trump told crypto entrepreneurs this summer. “They target your banks. They choke off your financial services … They block ordinary Americans from transferring money to your exchanges. They slander you as criminals.” He added: “That happened to me too, because I said the election was rigged.” Trump is not wrong that crypto exists in its own parallel financial universe. Many crypto companies cannot or choose not to comply with American financial regulations, making it hard for kitchen-table investors to use their services. (The world’s biggest crypto exchange, Binance, declines even to name which jurisdiction it is based in; it directs American customers to a smallish U.S. offshoot.) Companies such as Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo tend to offer few, if any, crypto products, and tend to make minimal, if any, investments in crypto and crypto-related businesses. It’s not so much that banks haven’t wanted to get in on the fun. It’s that regulations have prevented them from doing so, and regulators have warned them not to. This situation has throttled the amount of money flowing into crypto. But the approach has been a wise one: It has prevented firm failures and crazy price swings from destabilizing the traditional financial system. Crypto lost $2 trillion of its $3 trillion in market capitalization in 2022, Kelleher noted. “If you had that big of a financial crash with any other asset, there would have been contagion. But there wasn’t, because you had parallel systems with almost no interconnection.” Forthcoming regulation will knit the systems together. Granted, nobody knows exactly what laws Congress will pass and Trump will sign. But the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, or FIT21, which passed the House before dying in the Senate last year, is a good guide. The law was the subject of intense lobbying by crypto advocates with billions on the line and cash to spend, including $170 million on the 2024 election. It amounts to an industry wish list. FIT21 makes the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, rather than the Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator of most crypto assets and firms and requires that the CFTC collect far less information from companies on the structure and trading of crypto products than securities firms give the SEC. Annie Lowrey: The Black investors who were burned by Bitcoin Beyond loose rules, financial experts anticipate loose enforcement. The CFTC predominantly oversees financial products used as hedges by businesses and traded among traders, not ones hawked to individual investors. It has roughly one-fifth the budget of the SEC, and one-seventh the staff. And in general, Washington is expected to loosen the strictures preventing traditional banks from keeping crypto on their books and preventing crypto companies from accessing the country’s financial infrastructure. According to Prasad, this regime would be a “dream” for crypto. Trump and his family are personally invested in crypto, and the president-elect has floated the idea of establishing a “strategic” bitcoin reserve, to preempt Chinese influence. (In reality, this would mean deploying billions of dollars of taxpayer money to soak up speculative assets with no strategic benefit to the United States.) How many Republicans will invest in crypto because Trump does? How many young people will pour money into bitcoin because his son Eric says its price is zooming toward $1 million, or because the secretary of commerce says it is the future? Nothing being considered by Congress or the White House will reduce the inherent risks. Crypto investors will remain vulnerable to hacking, ransomware, and theft. The research group Chainalysis tallied $24.2 billion in illicit transactions in 2023 alone. And if the U.S. government invests in crypto, the incentive for countries such as Iran and North Korea to interfere in the markets would go up exponentially. Imagine China engaging in a 51 percent attack on the bitcoin blockchain, taking it over and controlling each and every transaction. The situation is a security nightmare. Americans will be exposed to more prosaic scams and rip-offs too. The SEC has brought enforcement actions against dozens of Ponzi schemers, charlatans, and cheats, encompassing both the $32 billion sham-exchange FTX and ticky-tacky coin firms. Nobody expects the CFTC to have the muscle to do the same. And FIT21 leaves loopholes open for all kinds of scuzzy profiteering. A crypto firm might be able to run an exchange, buy and sell assets on its own behalf, and execute orders for clients—legally, at the same time, despite the conflicts of interest. Simple volatility is the biggest risk for retail investors. Crypto coins, tokens, and currencies are “purely speculative,” Prasad emphasized. “The only thing anchoring the value is investor sentiment.” At least gold has industrial uses. Or, if you’re betting on the price of tulip bulbs, at least you might end up with a flower. With crypto, you might end up with nothing, or less. A large share of crypto traders borrow money to make bets. When leveraged traders lose money on their investments, their lenders—generally the exchange on which the traders are trading—require them to put up collateral. To do that, investors might have to cash out their 401(k)s. They might have to dump their bitcoin, even in a down market. If they cannot come up with the cash, the firm holding their account might liquidate or seize their assets. A report released last month by the Office of Financial Research, a government think tank, makes clear just how dangerous this could be: Some low-income households are “using crypto gains to take out new mortgages.” When crypto prices go down, those families’ homes are going to be at risk. Many individual investors do not seem to understand these perils. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has had to warn the public that it does not protect crypto assets. The Financial Stability Oversight Council has raised the concern that people do not realize that crypto firms are not subject to the same oversight as banks. But if Trump is invested, how bad could it be? Regulators and economists are not worried primarily about the damage that this new era will do to individual households, however. They are worried about chaos in the crypto markets disrupting the traditional financial system—leading to a collapse in lending and the need for the government to step in, as it did in 2008. Where Wall Street once saw fool’s gold, it now sees a gold mine. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater called crypto a “bubble” a decade ago; now he thinks it is “one hell of an invention.” Larry Fink of BlackRock previously referred to bitcoin as an “index of money laundering”; today he sees it as a “legitimate financial instrument”—one his firm has already begun offering to clients, if indirectly. Early in 2024, the SEC began allowing fund managers to sell certain crypto investments. BlackRock launched a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in November; one public retirement fund has already staked its pensioners’ hard-earned cash. Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs are doing crypto deals too. Billions of traditional-finance money is flowing into the decentralized-finance markets, and billions more will as regulators allow. Charlie Warzel: Crypto’s legacy is finally clear What could go wrong? Nothing, provided that Wall Street firms are properly accounting for the risk of these risky assets. Everything, if they are not. Even the sturdiest-seeming instruments are dangerous. Stablecoins, for example, are crypto assets pegged to the dollar: One stablecoin is worth one dollar, making them useful as a medium of exchange, unlike bitcoin and ether. Stablecoin companies generally maintain their peg by holding one dollar’s worth of super-safe assets, such as cash and Treasury bills, for every stablecoin issued. Supposedly. In the spring of 2022, the widely used stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed, its price falling to just 23 cents. The company had been using an algorithm to keep TerraUSD’s price moored; all it took was enough people pulling their money out for the stablecoin to break the buck. Tether, the world’s most-traded crypto asset, claims to be fully backed by safe deposits. The U.S. government found that it was not, as of 2021; moreover, the Treasury Department is contemplating sanctioning the company behind tether for its role as a cash funnel for the “North Korean nuclear-weapons program, Mexican drug cartels, Russian arms companies, Middle Eastern terrorist groups and Chinese manufacturers of chemicals used to make fentanyl,” The Wall Street Journal has reported. (“To suggest that Tether is somehow involved in aiding criminal actors or sidestepping sanctions is outrageous,” the company responded.) Were tether or another big stablecoin to falter, financial chaos could instantly spread beyond the crypto markets. Worried investors would dump the stablecoin, instigating “a self-fulfilling panic run,” in the words of three academics who modeled this eventuality. The stablecoin issuer would dump Treasury bills and other safe assets to provide redemptions; the falling price of safe assets would affect thousands of non-crypto firms. The economists put the risk of a run on tether at 2.5 percent as of late 2021—not so stable! Other catastrophes are easy to imagine: bank failures, exchange collapses, giant Ponzi schemes faltering. Still, the biggest risk with crypto has little to do with crypto at all. If Congress passes FIT21 or a similar bill, it would invent a novel asset class called “digital commodities”—in essence, any financial asset managed on a decentralized blockchain. Digital commodities would be exempted from SEC oversight, as would “decentralized finance” firms. In the FIT21 bill, any firm or person can self-certify a financial product as a digital commodity, and the SEC would have only 60 days to object. This is a loophole big enough to fit an investment bank through. Already, Wall Street is talking up “tokenization,” meaning putting assets on a programmable digital ledger. The putative justification is capital efficiency: Tokenization could make it easier to move money around. Another justification is regulatory arbitrage: Investments on a blockchain would move out of the SEC’s purview, and likely be subject to fewer disclosure, reporting, accounting, tax, consumer-protection, anti-money-laundering, and capital requirements. Risk would build up in the system; the government would have fewer ways to rein firms in. Crypto regulation could end up undermining the “broader $100 trillion capital markets,” Gary Gensler, the soon-to-be-former head of the SEC and the crypto industry’s enemy No. 1, has argued. “It could encourage noncompliant entities to try to choose what regulatory regimes they wish to be subjected to.” Annie Lowrey: When the Bitcoin scammers came for me We have seen this movie before, not long ago. In 2000, shortly before leaving office, Bill Clinton signed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. The law put strictures on derivatives traded on an exchange, but left over-the-counter derivatives unregulated. So Wall Street ginned up trillions of dollars of financial products, many backed by the income streams from home loans, and traded them over the counter. It packaged subprime loans with prime loans, obscuring a given financial instrument’s real risk. Then consumers strained under rising interest rates, crummy wage growth, and climbing unemployment. The mortgage-default rate went up. Home prices fell, first in the Sun Belt and then nationwide. Investors panicked. Nobody even knew what was in all of those credit-default swaps and mortgage-backed securities. Nobody was sure what anything was worth. Uncertainty, opacity, leverage, and mispricing spurred the global financial crisis that caused the Great Recession. The crypto market today is primed to become the derivatives market of the future. Were Congress and the Trump administration to do nothing—to leave the SEC as crypto’s primary regulator, to require crypto companies to play by the existing rules—the chaos would remain walled off. There’s no sensible justification for digital assets to be treated differently than securities, anyway. By the simple test the government has used for a century, nearly all crypto assets are securities. But Washington is creating loopholes, not laws. As the crypto boosters like to say, hold on for dear life. “A lot of bankers, they’re dancing in the street,” Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase said at a conference in Peru last year. Maybe they should be. The bankers are never the ones left holding the bag. More Stories The Rise of the Union Right The Health-Care System Isn’t Hopeless

Title: Mainstreaming Of Blockchain: Digital Innovations Reshaping Finance

Decentralized Applications Concept - DApp - Autonomous Applications that Run on a Distributed Ledger ... [+] System such as a Blockchain Traditional finance isn't just adopting crypto - it's being rebuilt around it. JPMorgan is launching instant dollar-euro conversions on its rebranded Kinexys blockchain, where transaction volumes have grown tenfold to process over $2 billion daily. Visa's new Tokenized Asset Platform enables banks like BBVA to create and manage digital tokens, with pilot programs starting in 2025. Mastercard's Crypto Credential service operates across 13 countries in Europe and Latin America, simplifying transactions through partnerships with Bit2Me and Mercado Bitcoin. Morgan Stanley's E-Trade is exploring direct crypto trading services, while Goldman Sachs makes bold moves in the digital asset space - spinning off its Digital Assets Platform into a standalone entity, forging strategic partnerships with Tradeweb Markets, holding over $700 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, and exploring market making in Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF draws billions in institutional money. The story isn't about disruption anymore - it's about integration, as the world's largest financial institutions systematically blur the lines between traditional and digital finance. Our strategy is to create more utility for crypto holdings, enabling users to connect their balances to Visa credentials and spend in fiat at millions of merchant locations," explained Nikola Plecas. With over 60 crypto platforms now working with Visa, the company is unlocking new use cases beyond trading, including remittances and cross-border payments. This transformation extends beyond payments. Citi's Tony McLaughlin envisions: "In five years, we might have a blockchain or state-machine capability where financial institutions involved in a transaction can look at that common state and use it as a source of truth to update their own balance sheets." These developments signal a fundamental shift toward a more efficient and interconnected global financial infrastructure. The Foundation of Financial Innovation The technology underpinning this financial transformation isn't just an upgrade - it's a complete reimagining of how money moves. While blockchain started with Bitcoin, its impact now reaches far beyond cryptocurrencies. The technology's distributed ledger architecture, smart contracts, and tokenized incentives enable programmable automation while providing new ways to track, verify, and secure digital transactions, transforming sectors from supply chains to healthcare records. In the financial sector, however, its impact has been particularly profound. Traditional trades that once required days and multiple intermediaries can now be executed and settled instantly, marking the most significant upgrade to financial infrastructure in decades. The technology's ability to provide immutable records and transparent transactions has sparked innovation across the entire financial services spectrum. The maturation of crypto markets has spurred the development of sophisticated yet accessible investment infrastructure. ICONOMI exemplifies this trend, allowing users to copy established portfolios or manage their own crypto assets. The platform's Blockchain Index portfolio provides easy access to top crypto assets and simplifies crypto investing for beginners while also offering sophisticated tools for experienced traders. This evolution reflects the industry's movement toward more user-friendly, professional-grade services. ICONOMI's approach helps users navigate the complex crypto landscape with features like dollar-cost-averaging and automated profit-takin The Rise of Tokenization: Unlocking Value in Real-World Assets The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) represents one of finance's most transformative innovations. By converting ownership rights into digital tokens on a blockchain, this technology bridges traditional finance, real assets, and the decentralized world. Industry analysts project the RWA market could expand dramatically within the next decade, potentially reaching $10-15 trillion. Major institutions are accelerating this transformation. Goldman Sachs, for example, has launched three new tokenization products for institutional clients, focusing on money market funds and real estate assets while also creating marketplaces for these In this tectonic landscape, Liqvid exemplifies this evolution by developing infrastructure for single-transaction purchases of yield baskets comprising tokenized real estate, private credit, and bonds. The founding team's background from marquee institutions like BlackRock and Edge Capital brings extensive industry insight, technical expertise, risk management, and regulatory navigation crucial for innovations and adoption. The platform aims to democratize access to previously exclusive institutional-grade financial instruments, leveraging the transformative potential of the RWA market. AI/Blockchain AI and blockchain are forging a new digital frontier where razor-sharp insights meet unbreakable trust. As artificial intelligence decodes complex data patterns, blockchain anchors these revelations in an immutable ledger, transforming raw information into verifiable, tamper-proof intelligence. This symbiotic dance between predictive analytics and cryptographic security is rewriting the rules of data integrity, enabling a world where insights are not only discovered but permanently validated and transparently shared. VeraViews demonstrates this in digital advertising by integrating blockchain-based Proof of View (PoV) technology with AI-driven fraud detection. This approach helps verify ad impressions and increase transparency, addressing persistent issues like ad fraud and wasted budgets. By using real-time fraud detection and transparent data tracking, VeraViews showcases how emerging technologies can tackle industry-wide challenges, from preventing market manipulation to fostering accountability in digital ecosystems. DeFi -Decentralized Finance. blockchain, decentralized financial system DeFi and Stablecoins: The New Rails of Finance DeFi represents blockchain's most radical innovation yet—a financial system that runs purely on code. Traditional banks use people and paperwork to process loans and trades. DeFi replaces all of that with automated smart contracts. Flash loans, a uniquely DeFi invention, showcase this power—enabling complex borrowing and trading to happen in seconds, something impossible in traditional finance. What makes these innovations particularly significant is their ability to execute complex financial operations without traditional intermediaries - transforming processes that historically took days into near-instantaneous transactions. But it's stablecoins that serve as the critical bridge between DeFi and traditional finance. These digital dollars, maintaining stable value through fiat currency pegs, are becoming the universal adapter between old and new systems. Payment giants like Mastercard and Visa now use them to make cross-border transfers faster and cheaper. Banks are following suit, recognizing that stablecoins could reshape everything from treasury operations to international trade finance. Their ability to enable seamless interaction between conventional and decentralized finance is accelerating mainstream adoption. Cross-Border Payments and Technology Innovation Blockchain is rewiring how money moves across borders. The combination of blockchain networks and stablecoins has created new pathways for cross-border transactions that bypass traditional correspondent banking systems. Raj Dhamodharan, executive vice president of blockchain and digital assets at Mastercard, stated, "Blockchain technology, and public blockchains in particular, are opening up a number of new use cases, one of which is to transfer value — such as remittances — from one country to another." This evolution could have significant implications for the global remittance market, which the World Bank estimated at $630 billion in 2022. To power these cross-border transactions, the ecosystem also requires a robust exchange infrastructure. BestChange has emerged as part of this development, providing a cryptocurrency exchanger directory that aggregates real-time rate comparisons. Such services help users navigate the complex landscape of crypto exchanges and rates, contributing to market efficiency and accessibility. It offers features such as rate notifications, exchange history, and user reviews, catering to crypto enthusiasts, freelancers, and businesses seeking efficient fund transfers between different systems. The Path Forward: Regulation and Growth The regulatory environment has matured significantly, with major jurisdictions introducing comprehensive frameworks that balance innovation with consumer protection. This regulatory clarity has been crucial for institutional adoption, providing the certainty needed for larger financial institutions to invest in blockchain-based solutions. A New Era of Finance The numbers tell the story: $2 billion in daily transactions and $1.5 trillion in notional value since inception on JPMorgan's Kinexys blockchain, $10-15 trillion projected for tokenized real assets, and a $630 billion global remittance market transforming through digital networks. Beyond the statistics, we're seeing concrete infrastructure changes - Visa and Mastercard embedding crypto capabilities across continents, BlackRock moving institutional capital into digital assets, and JPMorgan's blockchain rewiring the fundamental architecture of global finance across five continents. The implications extend beyond the trading floor. Corporate treasurers who once tracked only fiat currencies must now navigate stablecoins and digital tokens. DeFi protocols are automating processes that previously required teams of bankers. Blockchain-AI integration is reshaping everything from fraud detection to market surveillance. This isn't a story of disruption anymore - it's one of integration. Traditional finance isn't fighting the digital revolution; it's actively building it. Those who recognize this shift aren't just adapting to change - they're positioning themselves to shape how value moves in a digital economy. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Analysis-Trump's SEC pick likely to give Wall Street easier enforcement ride
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/analysistrumps-sec-pick-likely-to-give-wall-street-easier-enforcement-ride-3799703
Time Published: 2025-01-07T11:22:11Z
Full Content:
By Douglas Gillison and Chris Prentice (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump's SEC pick voted several times against punishing big companies and was extremely critical of the agency's enforcement process when he was a top official there, according to public records and former SEC attorneys, in a possible glimpse of what is to come under his leadership. Paul Atkins voted against at least 10 enforcement actions punishing individuals and companies, including Citigroup (NYSE:C) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), according to a Reuters review of Securities and Exchange Commission records from the final years of his 2002-2008 stint as a commissioner. In doing so, he defied his fellow Republican agency chairs. Atkins was also fastidious, scrutinizing proposed enforcement actions word by word and frequently pushing back on SEC staff who recommended bringing charges, according to three former SEC enforcement staff. At the time, Atkins made no secret of his mistrust of much of the SEC's process for probing and disciplining rule-breakers, arguing that corporate fines unfairly penalize shareholders and that the SEC should focus on individual fraudsters. He became well-known for his industry-friendly views, even as the agency grappled with the fallout from the Enron and WorldCom accounting scandals. But his enforcement dissents, which have not been previously reported in detail, and Reuters' interviews with more than a dozen former SEC officials and academics, provide insight into how deep that skepticism was. They suggest Wall Street is set for a much easier ride after years of aggressive enforcement under Democratic Chair Gary Gensler, whose SEC levied over $20 billion in penalties and other charges. High-profile companies whose SEC cases could be affected by new leadership include electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), crypto exchanges Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN) and Binance, and investment firms BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Carlyle and TPG. Under Atkins, the SEC will likely focus on misconduct that causes direct investor losses, such as scams, rather than corporate malfeasance where the harm is not always immediately obvious, the sources said. Critics say such an approach is dangerous because big companies can pose systemic risks and are capable of large-scale harm to investors. "His nomination should bring down the stress levels and ambient heart rates for compliance ... staffers," said Tyler Gellasch, a former SEC official who now leads the Healthy Markets Association, which focuses on increasing capital markets transparency and reducing conflicts of interest. Its members include pension funds. Atkins did not respond to requests for comment. He has said little on enforcement in recent years but has continued to argue for light-touch oversight, and has represented companies in regulatory disputes via his consultancy, Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP). Trump transition spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment. 10 DISSENTS SEC leadership comprises five politically-appointed commissioners, including the chair, who vote on rules and enforcement actions. Typically, chairs bring a vote when they have enough support to pass a measure. During Atkins' tenure, commissioners sometimes revealed how they voted on regulatory matters, but neither they nor the agency routinely publicized the outcomes of enforcement votes, obscuring commissioners' overall records from public view. Reuters reviewed online voting records from Atkins' tenure, for which only 28 months during 2006 to 2008 are available. The records relate to administrative enforcement actions brought before the SEC's in-house court but not federal court litigation. With 10 dissents, Atkins disapproved of more than twice as many actions as Democratic commissioner Roel Campos, while Democrat Annette Nazareth and Atkins' fellow Republican Kathleen Casey did not dissent on enforcement matters at all during those months. Campos, Nazareth and Casey did not respond to requests for comment. Even in today's partisan climate where party-line SEC dissents are common, Atkins' willingness to oppose his fellow Republicans on enforcement matters is striking, underscoring how strongly he felt about the issues, said experts. "Atkins is an independent thinker with a clear view about how markets work," said Stanford professor Joseph Grundfest, who was a Democratic commissioner in the 1980s. Jay Clayton, SEC chair during Trump's first term, was similarly skeptical of big corporate fines and focused mostly on small-scale investor frauds. But the agency was still active, notching record penalties in 2020 and surprising some onlookers with landmark charges against Tesla and crypto firm Ripple. While Atkins' 10 dissents were among thousands of votes he would have made, former agency officials said they accurately reflect his exacting approach to enforcement issues. "He put us through our paces," said former SEC assistant enforcement director Gregory Faragasso, who praised Atkins' acumen and expertise. "He would want to get down into the weeds on certain issues ... you'd have to really know your stuff." Two other former officials shared similar observations. One said Atkins would negotiate corporate penalties with staff, often pushing for a focus on fines for individuals over companies. Atkins voted against a $7-million SEC settlement with IBM over accounting and other issues, and opposed a 2008 order against Citigroup over its financial statements. He also dissented on smaller matters, such as censuring unregistered accountants. The documents do not record Atkins' reasoning but, in contemporaneous remarks, he argued that corporate fines only hurt shareholders who had already suffered from the original misconduct. He also argued that enforcers often pursued minor infractions, suggesting in a 2008 speech that they did so to pad enforcement figures, and that enforcers were not transparent about the evidence they had on targets. "Where there are serious violations, enforcement action is necessary, but the goal should be to work with firms to build their internal compliance," he said.

We recently compiled a list of the 10 Firms Mirror Dow Jones Decline on Monday. In this article, we are going to take a look at where CNX Resources Corp. (NYSE:CNX) stands against the other stocks. Ten companies kicked off this week's trading mirroring a decline on Dow Jones with a series of catalysts dampening investor sentiment. In this article, let’s explore the reasons behind their decline. To come up with Monday's top losers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume. A long line of heavy-duty trucks transporting natural gas across a rural highway. Shares in CNX Resources dropped for a second day on Monday, losing 7.49 percent to finish at $30.64 each as investors continued to sell off shares following its lukewarm reception of the newly released hydrogen tax credits. While it acknowledges the environmental and economic benefits of Coal Mine Methane, CNX said last week that the final rules of Section 45V, the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, seem too restrictive and do not offer sufficient economic incentives to expand its CMM capture operations for hydrogen use. Despite reservations, the company said it was planning to leverage the validation and explore alternative incentive pathways for CMM, such as voluntary markets, other tax incentives, and compliance program commercial opportunities. Overall CNX ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks that crashed today. While we acknowledge the potential of CNX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Blackrock Clinic Blackrock Clinic has secured the planning green light for a new cardiology department, an eye centre and additional in-patient bedrooms at its south Dublin site. The planned new facilities are the first phase of a 16-year masterplan for the hospital, which will also include the construction of a second hospital building on site. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has given the first phase planning permission after concluding that the planned two-storey extension to the side of the main hospital building is acceptable. Planning documents lodged with the application reveal that the Larry Goodman Trust-owned hospital is proceeding with the masterplan “for the overall site following the acquisition of several neighbour sites adjoining the campus”. McGill Planning states that some of the main elements of the expansion “will include the provision of a dedicated cancer centre, a new specialised women’s health centre, additional theatre capacity, and additional high-tech interventional cardiology laboratories”. It says Blackrock Clinic admitted 52,185 in-patient and daycare patients in 2023 and this figure is expected to grow to 78,000 by 2033, which is around a 50pc increase over the next decade. “Blackrock Clinic is currently operating at full capacity,” it states. “In order to meet future growth in demand for medical services, the hospital will need to significantly expand its capacity and invest in the construction of major new medical facilities on the hospital campus.” The McGill Planning report lodged with the application states that the hospital’s capacity has doubled since 2008. The existing St Catherine’s site will host the second hospital building and deliver additional theatres; additional cath-lab capacity to meet growing demand in existing services; the development of a new cancer centre and the addition of new in-patient bed capacity. McGill Planning says Henry J Lyons Architects and Urban Designers were appointed in September 2023 to develop a masterplan following a competitive tender. It adds that this proposed two-storey extension application “is the first of several planning applications” that will be submitted to the council to enable the delivery of the plan. The two-floor extension will also provide 14 single-occupancy bedrooms. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Sierra Space CEO Tom Vice has left the company, CNBC confirmed Monday. In a statement, Sierra Space said Vice retired Dec. 31. Chairman Fatih Ozmen will serve as interim CEO, with Eren Ozmen as president. “After three and half years in the role, Tom Vice has retired as Sierra Space CEO as of the end of 2024 — we thank him for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement,” a Sierra Space spokesperson said in a statement. Spun out of aerospace contractor Sierra Nevada Corporation, or SNC, in 2021, Sierra is one of the most valuable private U.S. companies in the burgeoning space sector, most recently valued at more than $5 billion. But Sierra Space has struggled to launch the first mission of its reusable cargo space plane called Dream Chaser, which is key to the company establishing itself as a major player in the industry. Vice was named CEO of Sierra Space in 2021, a few months after SNC owners Fatih and Eren Ozmen spun out the company — with investors including General Atlantic, Coatue, BlackRock and AE Industrial Partners. Vice was previously the CEO of Aerion Supersonic, a startup that planned to build high-speed business jets and that shut down in April 2021. The first Dream Chaser vehicle was supposed to debut by 2021. But even in 2024, the space plane, named Tenacity, was not ready when United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket, its ride to space, needed to launch. Dream Chaser has won NASA contracts to fly seven cargo missions to and from the International Space Station. Sierra Space said Tenacity is targeting a launch no earlier than May. The company has continued to develop its inflatable space station technology, as well as expand into a product line of satellite buses after winning a high-profile $740 million Pentagon contract last year. Sierra Space saw layoffs during Vice’s tenure, as well as turnover in a number of senior executive roles. But in 2024, Vice spoke repeatedly of Sierra Space’s plan to go public, outlining a tentative path to IPO as soon as late 2025. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Why Is Geron Corporation (GERN) the Best Long-Term Penny Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Best Long-Term Penny Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) stands against the other best long-term penny stocks to buy. On December 3rd, Bob Kaynor, CFA, Head of US Small & Midcap Equities at Schroders, provided a comprehensive outlook for small-cap stocks in 2025, emphasizing their potential as a cost-effective investment in the robust US economy. He mentioned that the economy has shown resilience post-pandemic, bolstered by fiscal stimulus from the Biden Administration through significant legislation like the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This recovery is primarily driven by strong consumer spending and a favorable labor market. In this robust environment while large-cap equities may appear expensive and have likely priced in much of the anticipated growth, small and mid-cap stocks remain relatively undervalued. This presents an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to domestic economic strength without incurring high costs. Kaynor identified several trends, which he believes could enhance the performance of small and mid-cap stocks in 2025. He pointed out that following a downturn in 2022 and 2023 due to recession fears and high valuations, M&A activity is now rebounding. This resurgence is expected to benefit small-cap stocks as they often become acquisition targets. Additionally, increased IPO activity can generate interest and optimism in the small-cap sector. Moreover, the ongoing and anticipated decline in interest rates starting late 2024 is expected to reduce borrowing costs for small-cap companies, which typically rely on short-term financing. This environment is historically favorable for small caps, particularly when inflation stabilizes between 1% and 3%. Kaynor also noted that the service sector of the market is expanding. The services sector not only forms a significant portion of the GDP but also favors small-cap companies primarily those operating within this space. Moreover, trends like reshoring are enabling small firms to become reliable suppliers for larger corporations. He expects that increased CapEx driven by automation and government support in sectors like semiconductors will likely correlate with revenue growth for small caps, further enhancing their investment appeal next year. Kaynor noted that Wall Street analysts predict a substantial rebound in earnings for small caps beginning in late 2024, with expectations that their growth will outpace large caps throughout most of 2025.

To curate the list of the 12 best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener and Seeking Alpha. Using the screener we got an initial list of penny stocks (trading under $5) with more than 20% 5-year sales growth. Next, we cross-checked each stock for 5-year sales growth from Seeking Alpha. Lastly, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 hedge funds database. Please note that the stock prices were recorded on December 31, 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Stock Price: $3.54 5-Year Sales Growth: 113.54% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29 Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative treatments for blood cancers. Its flagship product, RYTELO, is a first-in-class telomerase inhibitor that has received FDA approval for treating certain adult patients suffering from lower-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (LR-MDS) with transfusion-dependent anemia. This approval marks it as the only company with an oligonucleotide telomerase inhibitor available in the United States. During the fiscal third quarter of 2024, Geron Corporation (NASDAQ:GERN) reported a net product revenue of $28.2 million from RYTELO, marking a successful first full quarter since its launch. As another important highlight for the quarter, management completed financing transactions to bolster its cash position. This included a synthetic royalty agreement with Royalty Pharma, providing $125 million in exchange for tiered royalty payments, and a 5-year senior term loan agreement with Pharmakon for up to $250 million. After its successful launch in the US, management is waiting for the review of RYTELO's MAA in lower-risk MDS by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). If the regulatory approval is granted it plans to launch RYTELO in select EU markets starting in 2026. Overall, GERN ranks first on our list of best long-term penny stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of GERN to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GERN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Is Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) the Best Travel Stock to Buy Right Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Travel Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)) stands against other best travel stocks to buy right now. According to a report by UN Tourism published on September 19, international tourism revived back 96% of the pre-pandemic levels during the first seven months of 2024. Around 790 million tourists were traveling around the globe during the said time, which is 11% greater than that in 2023 but still 4% less than in 2019. As per the report, the key drivers of this growth have been a strong demand for travel in Europe and also the re-opening of markets in the Asia Pacific region. The Secretary-General of UN Tourism, Zurab Pololikashvili noted that the growth in international tourism has been in line with the projections made by the department. He mentioned that the sector is on its way to achieving full recovery from the biggest crises in history and that too in an environment of economic and geopolitical challenges. Pololikashvili suggested that the recovery highlights the growing demand for international tourism planning and managing companies to cater to the revival in a way that benefits the communities through inclusive and sustainable policies. In addition, to an increase in tourism, the air connections have also improved along with an easing in visa restrictions. READ ALSO: 10 Best Entertainment Stocks To Buy According to Analysts and 11 Best Computer Hardware Stocks to Invest in Right Now. The report also highlighted that increased air connectivity and visa facilitation have supported the recovery. Data collected by the UN World Tourism Barometer showed that the Middle East remained the strongest region relative to others as it surpassed the 2019 levels by 26% during the first seven months of 2024. Moreover, Africa also remained strong and hosted 7% more tourists than in 2019. On the other hand, Europe and the Americas which host the most tourists combined recovered 99% and 97%, respectively. Despite the robust growth, certain challenges remain unaddressed including geopolitical challenges, extreme climate conditions, and high inflation in certain regions of the world. Regardless, the report anticipates continued recovery and expects strong revenue from international tourism to persist for a long period. To compile the list of the 10 best travel stocks to buy right now, we used the Finviz stock screener. Using the screener we aggregated a list of travel services stocks sorted by market capitalization. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the number of hedge fund holders as per Insider Monkey’s third-quarter 2024 database. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A vacation home luxury bedroom setup with stunning decor showing a desired getaway experience. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54 Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) is an international online platform that connects people looking for places to stay with those who have space to rent out. Guests can browse host listings and book a place to stay directly through the Airbnb website or app. Unlike traditional hotels, the company offers a wide variety of accommodations, catering to different preferences and budgets. This includes everything from private rooms in someone’s home to entire houses. The company has been actively upgrading its platform to streamline the process of listing and booking, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. Over the past three years, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) has launched more than 535 new features to improve user experience. Recent upgrades include personalized app features and enhanced listing quality, with over 300,000 low-quality listings removed to ensure better guest experiences. Moreover, the company has rolled out more than 50 upgrades in 2024 alone. These efforts have turned out to be fruitful as during the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the company witnessed an increase in bookings through the Airbnb app, which now accounts for 58% of total nights booked, up from 53% last year. The company generated $3.7 billion in revenue, marking a 10% increase compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was attributed to a steady rise in nights and experiences booked, which totaled 123 million for the quarter. Management noted that it is experiencing a rise in first-time bookers, particularly among young travelers. Looking ahead to Q4, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) anticipates continued growth in bookings despite potential challenges from tougher year-over-year comparisons. The company plans to introduce more features aimed at enhancing user experience and expanding its market presence globally. Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) declined in the period on concerns around a weaker demand outlook for the quarter as well as increasing marketing spend planned for the second half of 2024, pressuring near-term margins. Given the company’s exposure to the health of the consumer and related willingness to spend on leisure travel, we believe it’s important to take a step back to see the larger picture. Global accommodations have been and will likely continue to be a mid-single-digit growth market. Still, as private rentals become increasingly mainstream and the dependability of those private listings improves, we would expect private rentals to continue to gain market share. We continue to see Airbnb as a likely double-digit revenue grower over the next five years, and with modest margin expansion, we could expect mid-to-high-teens earnings growth.” Overall, ABNB ranks 3rd on our list of best travel stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of ABNB to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ABNB but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks Under $50 According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) stands against the other AI stocks under $50. Franklin Mutual's Katrina Dudley appeared on CNBC on December 31 to discuss whether the sectors that powered the market's gains in 2024 will continue to lead the way in 2025, particularly AI within the tech and communications sectors. Companies in these sectors, especially the MAG7 stocks, have experienced remarkable performance over the past year. She pointed out that alongside traditional tech stocks, companies providing essential infrastructure are crucial for supporting the rapid expansion of AI technologies. She expressed strong optimism about AI's continued influence, stating that it represents a secular theme likely to propel the tech sector forward in the coming year. When addressing concerns about market valuations, Dudley reiterated that high valuations, such as the S&P 500 trading at ~22 times earnings, should not deter investors. Instead, she argued that these valuations reflect robust earnings growth among technology companies, distinguishing this phase from past market bubbles. The network effects inherent in AI-driven companies contribute to their returns, suggesting that if these firms can exceed earnings expectations, their valuations could become more favorable over time. However, she cautioned that consistent performance is critical. Any failure to deliver on earnings growth could pose risks in a high-valuation environment. Turning her attention to lagging sectors, Dudley discussed healthcare as an area ripe for AI-driven transformation. She noted that while healthcare has significant upside potential due to demographic trends, some healthcare service providers faced challenges in 2024 due to rising costs and consumer pushback against high pricing. The increased focus on transparency in healthcare pricing may benefit consumers but could complicate profitability for companies. She suggested that advancements in AI technology are enhancing productivity within pharmaceutical research and development. Although immediate benefits may not be visible, she believes that AI's long-term impact on productivity will make healthcare an increasingly attractive sector for investment. Dudley's insights underscore the transformative potential of AI across both tech and healthcare sectors. Methodology We first sifted through internet lists to compile a list of the top AI stocks under $50. We then selected the 12 stocks with high analysts' upside potential and that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of analysts' upside potential (at least 10%), as of January 2. We've also added the hedge fund sentiment for each stock which was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Although Sinéad de Valera, who died 50 years ago on January 7th, is probably mainly remembered as the wife of Eamon de Valera, she was an Irish-language activist for many years, a highly respected teacher for the Gaelic League, and proved a prolific author of children’s books in later life. She was also an actor and even considered a career on the stage at one time. She was born Jane (usually called Jennie) Flanagan on June 1st, 1878, in Balbriggan, Co Dublin, one of four children of Laurence Flanagan, a carpenter, and Margaret Byrne. The family moved to Phibsborough in Dublin when she was seven as her father was made clerk of works for the building of St Peter’s Church there. Following local schooling, she attended Baggot Street Teacher Training College from where she graduated as a national-school teacher. Her teaching career began in Edenderry, Co Offaly, and continued at Francis Xavier School, Lower Dorset Street, which she had herself attended. She developed a great interest in the Irish language, joining the Gaelic League, adopting Sinéad Ní Fhlannagáin as her name and frequently visiting the Mayo Gaeltacht. As a member of the Gaelic League and of Maud Gonne’s Inghinidhe na hÉireann, she became involved in amateur dramatics. A play she performed in was The Tinker and the Fairy by Douglas Hyde. According to Frances Clarke, who wrote the entry on her in the Dictionary of Irish Biography, she asked George Moore, in whose garden on Ely Place the play had been performed, if she should consider a career in acting but he advised her against it. Becoming fluent in Irish, she gave language classes at the Gaelic League college on Parnell Square. One of her pupils was Eamon de Valera, then a teacher of maths. In the summer of 1909, they attended the Irish college at Tourmakeady, Co Mayo, and were married the following January in St Paul’s Church on Arran Quay; he was 28 and she 32. She gave up her career to look after their family of five sons and two daughters. In February 1936, their son Brian, then aged 20, was killed in a riding accident in the Phoenix Park. After the Easter Rising, with her husband jailed and with no financial income, she moved back to her family home with some of her children (the others were sent to her sister in Balbriggan) and cared for her invalid sister, who died in August, and her mother, who died the following January. When circumstances improved, the de Valera family settled in Greystones, Co Wicklow, but she saw little of her husband in the 1917-23 period as he was on the run, in prison or fundraising in America. Michael Collins frequently visited her in Greystones and provided money and support for her and her family. Although she wanted to avoid public life, she was persuaded by Harry Boland to join de Valera in America in 1920, travelling there on a false passport provided by Collins. She spent six weeks there but saw little of her husband because of his busy schedule and was relieved to return home. She was rumoured to be pro-Treaty, according to Frances Clarke, but never spoke publicly about political events. The break with Collins was said to have aggrieved her particularly, as he had been so good to her during her husband’s absences. When her family were reared, she turned to writing and produced no fewer than 31 books in Irish and in English. She adapted old stories and folktales from Irish, translated European fairytales into Irish and wrote plays and poems for children. Among her works were Coinneal na Nodlag agus Sgéalta Eile (1944), Áilleacht agus an Beithideach (1946), The Emerald Ring and Other Irish Fairy Stories (1951), The Stolen Child and Other Stories (1961), The Four-Leafed Shamrock (1964) and The Miser’s Gold (1970). She maintained her interest in Irish and attended Gaelic League functions and children’s drama competitions. A quiet, shy and retiring person, she shunned the limelight and during the years of her husband’s presidency (1959-73), she made few public appearances and her youngest son, Terry, who wrote a memoir, said she did not enjoy living in Áras an Uachtaráin. After the end of the presidency, they both moved into Linden Convalescent Home in Blackrock, where she died aged 96 on the day before what would have been their 65th wedding anniversary. Her husband died a little under eight months later and they are buried with their son Brian in Glasnevin Cemetery. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar In January 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on investors’ radar in January 2025. Drew Pettit, U.S. equity strategist at Citi Research, said in a latest program on CNBC that he believes the AI growth story is still intact moving ahead in 2025. However, the analyst believes a lot of positive news is already “priced in.” He also mentioned the key areas that can benefit this year. “I think the fundamental stories, at least for the pick-and-shovels names, continue. But where we think the trade is actually going to broaden out, and honestly, it has since mid-year, is into some of the users of AI. So, think about car companies that do autonomous driving or software companies putting that into their programs themselves, and even to some of the more cyclical names that, on the back end, can get some more productivity gains. So yes, the picks-and-shovels, the enablers of the trade, were attractive for the most part in 2024. We think AI continues to broaden out.” The analyst said he has done some “reverse DCF work” and believes there are many companies that are mispriced and many that have the good news around them already priced in. READ ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we picked 10 AI stocks that analysts are talking about this month. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers. Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 158 Andy Swan from LikeFolio‬ explained during a latest program on Schwab Network why he believes Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a strong holiday shopping season: “Once we saw the September keynote and the reaction that consumers had to that keynote event, we knew that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was setting up for a really good holiday season. And so far, you know, everything that we’re seeing points to that being true. Web visits for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are up year-over-year by a pretty decent margin, but when we break it down by product category and look, you know, at the overall demand for each of these types of products, you really get the sense that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), going into the Christmas holiday gift-giving season, just really has something for everyone on your list. If you want to spend $499, you can get an iPad Mini that is extraordinarily popular. The pencil looks like it’s getting added on at a tremendous clip, which is a high-margin item for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). You know, if you want to spend $129, you can get AirPods for your friend or for your niece or whatever it is, and people are doing so in droves. You know, iPad searches up 26%, AirPods and iPhone up 15-16%. The only real whiff we see on the list is the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Watch.” Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company’s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple’s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored. Investors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta’s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple’s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon’s and Google’s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market. Apple’s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform. While the company is projected to achieve 9.5% EPS growth this fiscal year and 12.3% growth in the next, much of this growth is already priced in, as the stock trades at nearly 30 times the expected EPS for the fiscal year ending September 2026. Parnassus Growth Equity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares rose during the quarter, making our underweight position a relative detractor. Investors reacted positively to the new iPhone 16 lineup and its advanced features, including generative artificial intelligence, greater durability and increased processing power.” Overall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks on investors’ radar in January 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Stock market data on a laptop screen. Photo by Alesia Kozik Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 60 Bryn Talkington from Requisite Capital Management explained on CNBC why she likes Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) stock. “Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), to me, as a story, is more the parts are greater than the sum. For next quarter earnings, which are February of 2025, the Street’s looking for 10% and 14% revenue and earnings growth. But underneath the hood, their infrastructure solutions group is where people are buying Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL)—that is their networking, their servers, and that’s where they’re getting data center growth. They had 38% growth. So, when I look at this company, you’re going to continue to see that ISG group be a larger and larger part of the earnings. Right now, it’s about 40%.” In the most recently reported quarter, Dell posted mixed results with revenue missing expectations. What stands out is Dell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which posted an impressive 34% year-over-year growth, reaching $11.4 billion in revenue. The server business rose a whopping 58% increase YoY to $7.4 billion. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) experienced a shift in AI server demand toward the next-generation Blackwell architecture. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s management highlighted that there was a dramatic shift in orders toward Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell-based systems during Q3, which impacted short-term shipments as these products ramp up production. This shift shows Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL)’s competitive position, as customers are willing to wait for the latest tech solutions. Dell secured $3.6 billion in AI server orders this quarter, an 11% increase from the previous quarter. Dell Tech Inc (NYSE:DELL) also signed over 2,000 enterprise customers for their AI solutions. Carillon Scout Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) was a top contributor despite reporting disappointing first-quarter earnings results, because investors looked through the near-term disappointment and expected strong growth from AI-related servers and personal computers. We expect Dell to participate in the growth of artificial intelligence hardware, especially as enterprises invest more aggressively. We like the company’s depth and breadth of products and services, as well as its focus on keeping costs low.” Overall, DELL ranks 9th on our list of AI stocks on investors’ radar in January 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of DELL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Farm Laws Reborn: “Dismantling Food Security”. Toxic Platter for India’s Farmers and Consumers
URL: https://www.globalresearch.ca/farm-laws-reborn-toxic-platter-india-farmers-consumers/5876540
Time Published: 2025-01-06T18:42:10Z
Full Content:
India could see an authoritarian central government with subordinate state governments under the control of corporate interests and international finance capital. So says the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), a coalition of 40+ farmers’ unions. It contends that the Union Government of India is proposing to undermine the federal rights of state governments by surrendering India’s food security and compromising its national sovereignty under the slogan ‘One Nation. One Market’. In a December 2024 press release, the All India Kisan Sabha (All India Farmers Union, AIKS) called for nationwide protests against attempts to bring back the three repealed farm laws. The AIKS said that the government has opted not to address any of the serious demands raised by the farmers’ movement, including legalising the minimum support price (MSP), increasing public investment in agriculture and boosting pro-farmer credit facilities. Like the SKM, the AIKS says there is an agenda to dismantle the power of the state governments. Proposed reforms to the agrifood sector seek to encroach upon the rights of state governments over agriculture, land, industry and markets — areas that fall under individual states as per the Constitution of India. Pivotal to this plan is the newly introduced draft National Policy Framework on Agriculture Marketing (NPFAM). The SKM states that the NPFAM, if implemented, will erode the federal rights of the state governments and ignore the interests of farmers, agricultural workers, petty producers and small traders since there is no provision to ensure an MSP and minimum wage to farmers and workers. The NPFAM essentially marks the return of the three farm laws that were repealed in late 2021 due to a year-long mass protest by farmers. The SKM states that the farmers’ movement sees through the plan to withdraw government support from agriculture and hand over farming and public food distribution to corporations led by Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer, Amazon and others. The main proposal of the NPFAM is a fundamental restructuring of the existing agricultural marketing system, proposing its transformation into a Unified National Market linked to a Value Chain Centric Infrastructure. The objective is the entry of corporate agribusiness and the conversion and integration (or eradication) of registered state-managed wholesale markets (mandis, overseen by state-regulated Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees, APMCs) and Grameen Haats (rural markets) with Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Reforms suggested in the NPFAM draft include the establishment of private wholesale markets, direct farm gate purchases by corporate processors and exporters, replacement of traditional market yards with corporate-controlled warehouses and silos and introducing a unified national market fee and trading license system. The draft proposes that big corporations can purchase produce directly from farmers, bypassing APMC market yards. Additionally, handing over storage infrastructure to private corporations eliminates a critical safety net for farmers during price volatility and may pave the way for corporate exploitation by denying farmers any space for bargaining prices. The NPFAM aims to integrate agricultural production and marketing in a way that prioritises corporate interests. It will integrate both the private and public sectors through advanced technologies, such as DPI and blockchain. NPFAM reforms propose deregulation, effectively allowing the private sector — specifically, corporate agribusinesses — to establish dominance over production, processing and marketing. We could see farmers produce raw materials that enter markets controlled by processing industries, trade houses and exporters, who in turn dictate the prices. The NPFAM fails to address provisions that would hold these corporate forces accountable. There is no mention of ensuring an MSP for farmers, which was a central recommendation of the National Commission on Farmers chaired by the late M S Swaminathan and currently a key issue in the national political discourse. That is no surprise because the corporate strategy is to procure produce at the cheapest rate and market it to ensure exorbitant profits. The stranglehold of big business houses is also evident in the suggestions for deepening financialisation via futures and option markets. This will also permit corporations and international finance capital to dominate and control the domestic food industry. The AIKS says that central government is creating a conducive atmosphere for the corporate loot of agriculture. It adds that it will fight tooth and nail the efforts by the government to hand Indian agriculture on a platter to transnational corporations. It demands that the government withdraw the NPFAM and engage in meaningful dialogue with farmers’ organisations and state governments. The three repealed farm laws would have facilitated neoliberal shock therapy to India’s agrifood sector. If it succeeds, the NPFAM will bring about what the laws intended to do. But first, state-supported infrastructure must be dismantled. As things currently stand, mandis are state-regulated marketplaces where farmers sell their produce, facilitating direct transactions with buyers and ensuring fair prices through auctions. Managed by the APMCs, mandis play a crucial role in connecting farmers to larger markets and providing essential infrastructure for agricultural trade. The Public Distribution System (PDS) is a government initiative aimed at ensuring food security for the underprivileged by distributing essential commodities at subsidised rates. Operated jointly by central and state governments, the PDS includes the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS), ensuring focused assistance for those in need. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) is responsible for implementing food policies, including the procurement, storage, transport and distribution of food grains. By procuring grains at an MSP and maintaining a vast network of depots and Fair Price Shops, the FCI plays a vital role in maintaining food security and nutritional support across the country. Together, mandis, the PDS and the FCI form a comprehensive state-backed framework for supporting India’s agricultural economy and addressing food insecurity. However, the aim is for the state to withdraw from these areas and to let private interests capture the space left open. Indian agriculture has witnessed gross underinvestment over the years, whereby it is now wrongly depicted as a basket case and underperforming and ripe for a sell off to those very interests who had a stake in its underinvestment. The aim is to restructure India’s agri-food sector for the needs of global supply chains and markets. As independent cultivators are bankrupted, the goal is that land will eventually be amalgamated to facilitate large-scale industrial cultivation. Those who remain in farming will be absorbed into corporate supply chains and squeezed as they work on contracts dictated by large agribusiness and chain retailers. The FCI has historically been a stabilising force in India’s food procurement and distribution system, ensuring that (some) farmers receive fair prices through MSP while maintaining strategic food stocks. Once its role is diminished, the Indian government may find itself purchasing essential commodities from volatile (manipulated) international markets using its foreign exchange reserves; food sourced from the very corporations that have replaced the FCI (see chapters 4–7 of Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order). Companies like Bayer attempt to depict these developments as ‘modernising’ Indian agriculture and portray the sector as ‘backward’. However, such corporations cynically exploit notions of backwardness and modernisation to promote their financially lucrative agricultural practices and technologies in a bid to secure control of the sector. Prominent agricultural scientist M S Swaminathan (referred to earlier) highlighted that farmers’ incomes are declining due to inadequate pricing mechanisms and market access, rather than a lack of technological advancements. He advocated for a an MSP that is at least 50% above the cost of production to ensure farmers can sustain their livelihoods. The failure to implement this has contributed significantly to the ongoing agrarian crisis. This situation has led to widespread farmer distress and suicides, which he attributed largely to economic pressures rather than technological shortcomings. And this failure is a deliberate policy decision. Instead of ensuring that all farmers have reliable access to markets where they can sell their produce at fair prices, improving access to timely and affordable credit to prevent farmers from falling into debt traps and strengthening procurement policies and expanding the mandi, MSP and public distribution systems, we are witnessing a reversal. Farmers are being displaced through policies that intentionally render farming financially unviable. We also see policies aimed at facilitating the sale and consolidation of land for industrial agriculture and the undermining of rural communities and traditional farming practices. Additionally, there is a concerning rise in health issues as traditional, nutritious diets are increasingly replaced by unhealthy, ultra-processed foods or less nutrient-dense alternatives. If consumers want to see what the future may bring, look no further than countries reliant on the Western agrifood model. From cultivation to retail, a disease-causing system promoted and protected by corporate lobby groups like the International Life Sciences Institute and CropLife embedded in decision-making processes (both are already firmly established in India). A system that sees international finance firms like BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity and Capital Group investing in the global food giants that sicken and also in the pharmaceuticals sector that supposedly ‘cure’. A system handed over to agricultural land speculators, toxic agrochemical manufacturers and their proprietary hybridised seeds, global commodity traders and purveyors of junk food. India is on course to be a subsidiary of global capital at the expense of its local agricultural communities and farmers, its ecosystems, its food security, its (limited) democracy and the overall wellbeing of the population. Alternatively, MSPs via state procurement of essential crops and commodities could be extended to the likes of maize, cotton, oilseed and pulses. This would not only boost the nation’s health but also increase farmers’ incomes. At the moment, only farmers in certain states who produce rice and wheat are the main beneficiaries of government procurement at MSP. Instead of rolling back the role of the public sector and surrendering the system to foreign corporations, there is a need to further expand official procurement and public distribution. That would cost around 20% of the handouts (‘incentives’) from the public purse received by corporations and their super-rich owners (based on 2020-21 figures). During the 2020-21 farmers protest, a video that appeared on social media showed Ayush Sinha, a top government official, encouraging officers to “smash the heads of farmers” if they broke through the barricades placed on a highway. Since the farmers renewed their protest in early 2024, tear gas and water cannons have been used against farmers to break up protests and prevent them marching to Delhi. The authorities must show international finance and agri-capital that they are being tough on farmers. They need to demonstrate that they remain steadfast in defeating the farmers movement in order to attract FDI (maintain ‘market confidence’) and pave the way for a corporate-financial takeover of the sector. In late 2021, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait stated that around 750 protesters had died during the year-long struggle. In summing up the situation, we may paraphrase renowned campaigner and environmentalist Aruna Rodrigues: It is a detailed horror tale in the making for India, handing over Indian sovereignty and food security to big business. There will come a time pretty soon — not something out there but imminent, unfolding even now — when we will pay the Cargills, Ambanis, Bill Gates, Walmarts (in the absence of national buffer food stocks) to send us food. We will finance borrowing from international markets to do it. A policy change to cash crops and the end to small-scale farmers, pushed aside by contract farming and GM crops. What is at stake is the integrity of India’s federal governance structure, its food security, the wellbeing of its farmers and farming communities and the overall health of the population. Meanwhile, the future remains uncertain for what has become a more fragmented farmers’ movement. Its capacity to regain momentum and draw in greater support from consumers and consumer groups against the neocolonial ambitions of global finance and foreign agricultural capital remains in question. * Click the share button below to email/forward this article.

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. THE BLACKROCK CLINIC has secured the planning green light for a new cardiology department, an eye centre and additional in-patient bedrooms at its south Dublin site. The planned new facilities are the first phase of a 16-year masterplan for the hospital which will also include the construction of a second hospital building on site. Dún-Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has given planning permission after concluding that the two-storey extension to the side of the main hospital is acceptable. Planning documents lodged with the application show that the private hospital is proceeding with the masterplan for the overall site following the acquisition of several neighbour sites adjoining the campus. Advertisement Documents also state that the main elements of the extension will include a new, dedicated cancer centre, a specialised women’s health centre, an additional therapy centre and a high-tech interventional cardiology labs. McGill Planning say that Blackrock Clinic admitted 52,185 inpatient and daycare patients in 2023 and this figure is expected to grow to 78,000 by 2033, which is around 50% increase over the next decade. It adds that the private clinic is currently operating at full capacity and the clinic will need to expand its capacity, significantly, in order to meet future growth. The application states that the hospital’s capacity has doubled since 2008. An existing site will host a second building, and deliver additional theatres and lab capacity to meet demand in its existing services. Henry J. Lyons Architects and Urban Designers were appointed in September 2023 to develop the plan, following competitive tender. The two-storey extension application is the first of several applications that will be submitted to the local authority.

Title: Warner Bros. Discovery the Big Loser in Disney?s Fubo Sports Move

Perhaps this was David Gandler’s plan all along. The CEO and co-founder of sports-centric streamer Fubo has executed a play that not only appears to consign proposed mega-rival Venu Sports permanently to the sidelines but gives his company a chance to grow with the almighty backing of Disney. The agreement to merge Disney's Hulu + Live TV with FuboTV will not only see Fubo dropping its anti-trust lawsuit against Venu but appears to cast Venu’s other main partner, Warner Bros Discovery, out in the cold. After the deal announced today receives shareholder confirmation, Disney will hold a 70% stake in Fubo with Gandler continuing to lead the company, offering consumers the existing services of both FuboTV and Hulu + Live TV as both combined and separate products. A combined service would unite FuboTV’s 1.6 million U.S customers with the 4.5 million of Hulu + Live TV to create the second largest live TV streaming service on the market, behind only YouTube TV which amassed over 8 million subscribers early in 2024. Significantly, the deal also includes a new carriage agreement which will enable Fubo to launch a Sports & Broadcast service featuring Disney's top sports and broadcast networks, reportedly to include ESPN+. Fubo already carries packages including MLB Network, NBA TV, NFL Network, NFL RedZone, NHL Network, and beIN Sports while Disney’s other premier sports and broadcast networks including ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SECN, and ESPNEWS. About the only missing major sport is NBA which until recently was a lock-in for WBD’s TNT Sports. However, the new 11-year $77bn deal signed by the league until 2035-36 locks-out WBD in favor of Amazon, Comcast’s Peacock, and Disney. With a new Disney-led Sports & Broadcast service and with NBA already covered, what need would Disney have now to ally with WBD to launch Venu? As part of the settlement, Disney, Fox, and WBD will collectively pay Fubo $220 million while Fubo agrees to end litigation that would have dragged on for months, and may well have resulted in a win for Fubo. When Venu was proposed last February, Fubo immediately slapped the venture with an antitrust suit which was upheld by a New York judge in August. At the time Gandler argued that Disney, WBD, and Fox aimed to “monopolize the market, stifle any form of competition, create higher pricing for subscribers and cheat consumers from deserved choice. Simply put, this sports cartel blocked our playbook for many years and now they are effectively stealing it for themselves,” he added. Now, in a joint release with Disney, Gandler says, “We are thrilled to collaborate with Disney to create a consumer-first streaming company that combines the strengths of the Fubo and Hulu + Live TV brands. This combination enables us to deliver on our promise to provide consumers with greater choice and flexibility. Additionally, this agreement allows us to scale effectively, strengthens Fubo’s balance sheet and positions us for positive cash flow. It’s a win for consumers, our shareholders, and the entire streaming industry.” For Disney, Justin Warbrooke, EVP and Head of Corporate Development, added, “We have confidence in the Fubo management team and their ability to grow the business, delivering high-quality offerings that serve subscribers with the content they want and offering great value.” Disney’s major move in sports is the fall launch of a standalone SVOD, informally called ESPN Flagship. The new DTC, with no publicly announced price, could mark a spinoff of the cable giant. The company laid the groundwork to lasso new viewers by offering ESPN content as part of larger Disney entertainment bundle. New York-based FuboTV was founded in January 2015 by Gandler, Alberto Horihuela, and Sung Ho Choi. The platform operates in the US, Canada, and Spain and aggregates over 300 live sports, news, and entertainment networks. Before the deal, FuboTV’s major shareholders included BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. Gandler owned 0.9%, according to a diligent report at Business Strategy Hub which also noted that the company is not yet profitable but posted a 28% year-over-year increase in revenue growth and a 9% surge in subscribers in 2023. FuboTV, the leading sports-first live TV streaming platform, announced the availability of four new interactive CTV ad formats to further drive audience ad engagement. The personalized and dynamic experiences, including transactional and gamified ad formats, are part of Fubo's ongoing commitment to ad innovation and overall strategy to connect, interact with and convert premium audiences. Warner Bros. Discovery is the latest media titan to consign linear to the bench. In a move reminiscent of Comcast's divisional spinoff last month, WBD will split its lucrative but declining cable networks business from its lucrative and growing streaming and studios businesses. Every few weeks we hear about the next extraordinary sum a streaming platform has paid for exclusive rights to stream a premium sports event. But as Media Universe Cartographer Evan Shapiro says, "Everybody has an NFL game now," so is it worth it? Are streamers really gaining or retaining enough subscriptions by licensing these events to justify what they're paying for them? Shapiro and Hub Entertainment Research Principal Jon Giegengack debate the value of sports vs. scripted content and other subscriber plays in this clip from Streaming Media Connect 2024. As the prices paid for top-tier sports streaming rights continue to reach astronomical levels, and the potential disruption created by the blockbuster ESPN/Fox/Warner Bros. joint venture (popularly termed "Spulu") teased in February, what sports licensing will look like as 2024 rolls on and who will be able to afford it is anybody's guess. Will it play out differently in the U.S. and Europe? And as costs are passed on to users, why wouldn't sports fans just stick with cable? Find out what top analysts like ESHAP's Evan Shapiro, Erickson's Paul Erickson, Dataxis' Ophelie Boucaud, and TVREV's Alan Wolk, say in this clip from Streaming Media Connect 2024. Ian Greenblatt of JD Power discusses the rise of ESPN, its entrenchment as a cable TV subscription must for any sports fan, and why it is now poised to unravel cable bundles with the launch of a possible full standalone streaming platform.

Title: Analysis-Exodus by Wall Street banks from climate group worries advocates

Full Content:
By Simon Jessop, Iain Withers and Saeed Azhar LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. lenders have been rushing in recent weeks to leave one of the world's top banking sector climate coalitions, drawing scorn from campaigners who worry the industry is losing resolve to take action on fossil fuels. Goldman Sachs broke ranks to announce on Dec. 6 it was leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) and was soon followed by Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Citi, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The exit of some of the world's biggest lenders means the NZBA, whose members aim to align their financing with the global climate fight, now includes just JPMorgan among the Big Six U.S. banks. The exodus ended unhappy marriages for most after Republican politicians warned that membership in the group, particularly if it led to reduced financing for fossil fuel companies, could breach antitrust rules. Banks that have pulled out may now reduce their commitments to climate-friendly policies, said Patrick McCully, senior analyst for energy transition at Reclaim Finance. "The key thing to watch will be weakening of their existing targets and policies," said McCully, noting some banks had ambitious targets for decreasing emissions. Still, he did not expect banks to announce publicly any such changes. While the NZBA had sought at various times to tailor its rules to keep the large and systemically important banks onboard, most recently last year, the efforts were ultimately not enough. Jeanne Martin, head of banking programme at advocacy group ShareAction, said those leaving were sending a signal to the market that climate change has become even less of a priority for them. "This is concerning when they are among the world's largest providers of financing to fossil fuels," she said. A spokesperson for JPMorgan, the last remaining major U.S. bank in the alliance, said it regularly evaluates its memberships of such groups, without commenting on whether it plans to join the exodus. The other U.S. members are smaller: Amalgamated Bank (NASDAQ:AMAL), Areti Bank and Climate First Bank (NASDAQ:FRBA). While none cited it as a factor, hanging over the exits was a two-year-long U.S. backlash against environment, social and governance investing. A group of Republican politicians, many of them state attorneys general, have accused members of potential breaches of antitrust rules. Such pressure stepped up after a Republican clean sweep in November's U.S. elections heralded the return of Donald Trump as president, with investors including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) recently facing legal challenges over their climate efforts. For their part, the banks largely avoided giving a direct reason for needing to leave the NZBA, instead saying they remained committed to helping clients transition to a low-carbon economy and disclosing their actions. Analysis of December syndication fee income from loan and bond issuance by financial think tank the Anthropocene Fixed Income Institute showed each of the U.S. leavers earned more from fossil fuel than green energy. "As a first cut, some of these banks ... can pretty easily say 'nothing has changed' as they are still in a make-more-money-from-fossil-fuel mode," said AFII Chief Executive Ulf Erlandsson. A study entitled 'Banking on Climate Chaos' from 2024 suggested the six biggest U.S. banks were all among the top-20 global lenders to fossil fuel companies. Despite the exits, the largest U.S. banks had all made "strong climate commitments" through the NZBA and investors would continue to push for more information about their efforts, said Mindy Lubber, chief executive of non-profit Ceres. "Ceres will continue supporting banks as they set and achieve targets and implement transition plans. Banks are key to supporting the global goal of net zero emissions and to the economic opportunities that are arising from the transition." Following the mass exit by U.S. lenders, the NZBA still has 142 members from 44 countries with $64 trillion in assets, with 80 European banks accounting for the largest share of the dollar figure. Banks remaining in the coalition include HSBC, Barclays (LON:BARC) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). A spokesperson for the NZBA was not immediately available for comment. Given previous tussles over where to set the bar for NZBA membership, the exit of the U.S. banks offered an opportunity for those who want to be more ambitious, McCully said. "European banks have complained that they'd love the NZBA guidelines to be stronger but the U.S. members just won't let it happen - so (it is) now time for the Europeans to step up and show that they weren't just using U.S. obstructionism as an excuse for foot-dragging," he said on LinkedIn.

Title: Blackrock Clinic gets go ahead for expansion plans
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/01/06/blackrock-clinic-gets-go-ahead-for-expansion-plans/
Time Published: 2025-01-06T16:33:01Z
Full Content:
The Blackrock Clinic has secured planning permission for a new cardiology department, so-called eye centre and additional inpatient bedrooms at its south Dublin site. The planned new facilities are the first phase of a 16-year master plan which will also includes a second hospital building on site. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council Council has given the first-phase planning permission after concluding that the planned two-storey extension to the side of the main hospital building is acceptable. Planning documents lodged with the application show the Larry Goodman Trust-owned hospital is proceeding with the master plan “for the overall site following the acquisition of several neighbour sites adjoining the campus”. McGill Planning states that some of the main elements of the expansion “will include the provision of a dedicated cancer centre, a new specialised women’s health centre, additional theatre capacity and additional high-tech interventional cardiology laboratories”. The clinic admitted 52,185 inpatient and day-care patients in 2023 and this figure is expected to grow to 78,000 by 2033, which is about a 50 per cent increase over the next decade, they add. “Blackrock Clinic is currently operating at full capacity. In order to meet future growth in demand for medical services, the hospital will need to significantly expand its capacity and invest in the construction of major new medical facilities on the hospital campus,” McGill said. [ Blackrock Clinic takes court challenge over BusConnects corridor and compulsory land purchaseOpens in new window ] McGill Planning revealed that the existing St Catherine’s site will host the second hospital building and deliver additional theatres; additional cath lab capacity to meet growing demand in existing services; the development of a new cancer centre; and the addition of new inpatient bed capacity. McGill Planning state that Henry J Lyons architects and urban designers were appointed in September 2023 to develop a master plan following competitive tender. McGill Planning points out that this proposed two-storey extension application “is the first of several planning applications that will be submitted to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to enable the delivery of the master plan”. On the need for the additional beds at Blackrock Clinic, McGill Planning states an increase in demand for emergency care “means the hospital’s inpatient beds are operating at full capacity. This two-floor extension will increase this capacity and provide 14 single-occupancy inpatient bedrooms to ensure acutely unwell patients can be admitted in a timely manner to receive emergency medical treatment”.

Title: Why Is Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) Among the Best FTSE Dividend Stocks to Buy Now?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best FTSE Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) stands against the other FTSE dividend stocks. Goldman Sachs Research predicts moderate growth for the UK economy in 2025, with GDP rising 1.2%. That is slightly below the Bank of England's (BoE) 1.5% projection and the 1.3% consensus among economists. Moreover, growth is expected to slow as the year goes on, driven by trade uncertainties, tighter budgets, and changes in housing policies. However, inflation is likely to ease through 2025, which could lead to bigger interest rate cuts than the market expects. While most think the BoE will stop cutting rates at 4%, Goldman Sachs sees rates dropping further to 3.25% by mid-2026. Building on this cautious economic outlook, fiscal policies are also expected to play a significant role in shaping growth. The UK’s autumn budget provided a near-term boost to demand but points to a consolidation in 2025, likely slowing growth later in the year. Inflationary pressures from public sector pay deals and higher taxes on services are expected to persist in the short term but should ease as wage growth slows and labor market tightness lessens. Amid these broader economic challenges, UK investors may find some optimism in corporate dividends. AJ Bell's latest Dividend Dashboard paints a positive picture for FTSE 100 dividends. Analysts expect payouts to grow by 1% in 2024 to £78.6 billion, followed by a 7% bump in 2025 to £83.9 billion, though still just shy of the 2018 record of £85.2 billion. This strong performance in dividends highlights a contrast to the broader economic challenges, offering a silver lining for investors. Share buybacks remain strong, with £49.9 billion already planned for 2024, on top of £52 billion last year. Combined with £11 billion in expected dividends from the FTSE 250 and £47.2 billion in takeovers, the FTSE 350 is set to deliver a whopping £189.7 billion in total cash returns. That works out to a cash yield of 7.7%, comfortably beating the Bank of England’s 5% base rate, the 3.92% 10-year gilt yield, and the 2.2% inflation rate. Nevertheless, domestic companies are still grappling with significant headwinds, such as rising costs like National Insurance and minimum wage, all while operating in a sluggish economy. Investors are still favoring the US market, but falling interest rates could nudge some back toward UK stocks. Meanwhile, rising bond yields and pension plans shifting to UK equities might help stocks but could drive up government borrowing costs by reducing demand for gilts. Our Methodology For this article, we used the iShares Core FTSE 100 UCITS ETF. The fund aims to replicate the performance of an index comprising the 100 largest companies in the UK. From this fund, we focused on picking prominent stocks with stable yields and strong dividend policies. The list below is ranked in the ascending order of dividend yield as of January 3. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here) A gas refinery lit up against the night sky, showing the scale of the company's petrochemical operations. Dividend Yield as of January 3: 4.27% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48 Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) ranks 1st on our list of the best FTSE dividend stocks. The London-based global energy and petrochemical giant has five business segments – Integrated Gas, Upstream, Marketing, Chemicals and Products, and Renewables and Energy Solutions. The company explores, extracts, and markets oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, while also producing fuels, petrochemicals, and low-carbon products. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is ramping up its investments in low-carbon energy, focusing on projects like expanding its e-mobility network across the EU, acquiring Nature Energy – Europe’s biggest biogas producer – and building two massive renewable hydrogen plants – a 100 MW facility in Germany and a 200 MW plant in the Netherlands. The company is also backing Northern Lights, the world’s first open-source carbon capture and storage (CCS) project under the North Sea. Between 2023 and 2025, Shell is planning to invest $10 to $15 billion in low-carbon solutions. On December 19, Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) distributed a quarterly dividend of $0.344 per share and $0.688 per American Depositary Share (ADS). The company intends to raise its annual dividend by about 4%, pending board approval and plans to allocate 30-40% of its cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase programs. Fisher Asset Management, Eagle Capital Management, and Orbis Investment Management are leading shareholders in the company. Insider Monkey’s database indicates that 48 hedge funds were bullish on Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), compared to 49 in the prior quarter. Overall SHEL ranks 1st on our list of the best FTSE dividend stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of SHEL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SHEL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Diabetes Stocks To Buy Under $10. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX) stands against the other diabetes stocks. About 422 million people worldwide have diabetes, according to the WHO, and most of them live in low- or middle-income nations. Every year, diabetes directly causes 1.5 million deaths on average. Both the number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have steadily increased during the last several decades. However, according to the International Diabetes Federation, there are currently 500 million people with diabetes globally, and that number is expected to rise by 25% by 2030 and 51% by 2045. The continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is one type of medical equipment used to help manage diabetes, including type 1 and type 2. It is now a rapidly growing segment of diabetic care devices, and the market has increased significantly in recent years. According to GlobalData, the demand for sophisticated diabetes care products, such as insulin pumps, pens, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, was projected to be valued at $21.8 billion in 2023. According to GlobalData's forecasts, the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.34% to reach revenues of $33.4 billion by 2030. There are now 97 goods in the CGM category, according to the GlobalData marketed products database. Only a small number of these devices are implantable sensors; the majority are conventional CGMs. The GlobalData pipeline products database indicates that 133 goods are either approved or in the development stage. According to the data, this market niche is growing rapidly and is a center for cutting-edge new technologies such as implantable CGMs. AI is now being included in CGM technology. For instance, Roche unveiled Accu-Chek SmartGuide, a revolutionary predictive AI-powered CGM device. Roche Diabetes Care Chief Medical Officer Julien Boisdron described it as “a solution more than a CGM” at the introduction. He explained how the system, which includes a sensor and two algorithms, helps with prediction and data visualization. The management of diabetes and its related complications has entered a new era of opportunity. The combined issues of diabetes and obesity can be effectively treated with these innovative approaches. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists are a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. The GLP-1 market, which is driven equally by diabetes and obesity, is predicted to reach $100 billion by 2030. By this time, there could be 30 million GLP-1 users or around 9% of the US population. According to the most recent KFF Health Tracking survey, 12% of adult Americans say they have used a GLP-1 medication at some point. In the past five years, 43% of GLP-1 prescription users had diabetes, and 22% of patients with obesity or overweight diagnoses also took the medication. Over the course of the past year, the percentage of adults who have heard "a little" or "a lot" about these medicines has climbed from 70% to 82%, while the percentage of adults who have heard "a lot" or "a lot" about them has increased from 19% to 32%. However, the rising demand for these weight-loss and diabetes drugs has created challenges. The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) warned of a possible "explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online." Semaglutides, marketed under the name Ozempic, assist people with type 2 diabetes in controlling their blood sugar levels. However, they are also frequently used to aid in weight loss in certain nations, such as the US, where they are marketed under the name Wegovy. NPA chairman Nick Kaye stated: “Pharmacists remain deeply concerned that the current medicine shortages crisis could lead to an explosion in the unlicensed sale of medication online.” Our methodology involved identifying healthcare companies focused on diabetes treatment using a stock screener. From the resultant dataset, we selected those with stock prices under $10 and ranked them based on their share price as of the close of December 26.

(NASDAQ:LXRX) is a biopharmaceutical company leveraging advanced genetic research to develop transformative medicines, particularly for diabetes and related conditions. Its flagship drug, INPEFA (sotagliflozin), is an oral therapy targeting heart failure, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular risks. In Q3 2024, Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX) reported $1.7 million in net sales for INPEFA (sotagliflozin), with year-to-date sales reaching $4.5 million. Growth was driven by increased prescribing, despite a reduced sales force. The company focuses on advancing ZYNQUISTA (sotagliflozin) for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). An FDA advisory committee recently reviewed its application, expressing significant support for its use in patients aged 60-90, with a PDUFA goal date of December 20, 2024. If approved, ZYNQUISTA would be the first adjunct to insulin for glycemic control in T1D. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:LXRX) has entered an exclusive licensing agreement with Viatris for sotagliflozin outside the U.S. and Europe, involving a $25 million upfront payment and up to $197 million in regulatory and sales milestones. The LX9211 program for diabetic neuropathic pain has completed enrollment screening for its Phase 2b PROGRESS study, with topline data expected in Q1 2025. Additionally, the corporation is advancing the SONATA HCM Phase 3 trial and developing LX9851 for obesity, diversifying its pipeline beyond INPEFA and addressing unmet medical needs in diabetes and related conditions. Analysts have given the stock a consensus rating of "Strong Buy," with an average price target of $4.30. Forecasts range from a low of $1.20 to a high of $10.00, reflecting a potential 501.65% increase from its most recent price of $0.78.

Crypto-related products recorded a remarkable $44.2 billion in inflows last year—almost four times higher than the previous all-time high of $10.5 billion set in 2021. According to CoinShares’ latest report, this record-breaking performance is attributed to the introduction of US spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which significantly influenced global investments. Bitcoin dominated the scene, drawing $38 billion in inflows and accounting for 29% of the total assets under management (AuM). This significant inflow also resulted in a notable increase in Bitcoin ETFs’ holdings, which surpassed one million BTC in less than a year of their launch. Leading products like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC attracted the most interest. Notably, IBIT became the most successful ETF launch in the past decade by outperforming nearly 3,000 other ETFs. On the other hand, Grayscale’s GBTC saw the most outflows last year as investors withdrew more than $21 billion from the fund for cheaper alternatives. Nevertheless, the ETF products’ positive flows resulted in the US leading global inflows, as it attracted almost all of the $44.4 billion, followed by Switzerland with $630 million. However, significant outflows from Canada and Sweden—totaling $707 million and $682 million, respectively—partially offset these gains. James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, pointed out that the outflows suggest a shift in investments from these regions to US-based products, underscoring the growing appeal of the American crypto market. He also noted that Bitcoin climb to a new all-time high of more than $100,000 last year resulted in short BTC products seeing inflows of $116 million. Ethereum also stood out for its performance, especially for its resurgence in the latter part of the year. The digital asset secured $4.8 billion in inflows as its ETH spot-based ETFs ended the year strongly. This inflow represented 26% of its AuM, which is 2.4 times higher than its 2021 total and vastly exceeds its 2023 performance. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s gains outpaced its eternal rival Solana, which managed $69 million in inflows, representing just 4% of its AuM. Other large-cap alternative coins, such as Polkadot, Cardano, XRP, and others, collectively attracted $813 million, accounting for 18% of their AuM. Meanwhile, this year has started on a positive note for Bitcoin investment products in the US, with inflows reaching $666 million in the first two trading days. However, according to Farside data, Jan. 3 saw a $908 million inflow in a single day, with Fidelity leading at $357 million, just ahead of BlackRock and Ark Invest at $253 million and $222 million, respectively.

Title: Microsoft doubles down on its AI efforts with a massive $80 billion investment in data centers — amid insider concerns most Copilot AI tools are seemingly "gimmicky"

Microsoft is set to invest up to $80 billion in building data centers to bolster its AI advances in 2025. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft is set to double down on its generative artificial intelligence efforts in 2025 following the company's Vice Chair and President, Brad Smith's, recent announcement of the tech giant's plans to invest up to $80 billion in building data centers. As you may know, data centers provide the infrastructure required by next-gen AI systems to learn, make decisions, and scale greater heights. According to Microsoft's President Brad Smith: "In FY 2025, Microsoft is on track to invest approximately $80 billion to build out AI-enabled datacenters to train AI models and deploy AI and cloud-based applications around the world. More than half of this total investment will be in the United States, reflecting our commitment to this country and our confidence in the American economy." For context, Microsoft reported $65.6 billion in revenue and $24.7 billion in net income during October's 2024 earnings call. As such, investing $80 billion in data centers affirms the company's commitment to win the AI arms race against rivals like Google, Anthropic, and Meta. “At Microsoft, we’ve seen this firsthand through our partnership with OpenAI, from rising firms such as Anthropic and xAI, and our own AI-enabled software platforms and applications,” added Microsoft President Brad Smith. Microsoft's recent announcement didn't disclose whether part of the resources will be used to address the power concerns potentially stunting the development of AI. Google and Microsoft consume more power than 100 countries. Billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk indicated the world might be on the brink of the most significant technological breakthrough with AI. Still, there won't be enough electricity to power its advances by 2025. Generative AI's electricity and cooling water demand are among the major challenges facing key places in the space. In September 2024, Microsoft and BlackRock partnered to raise $30 billion to satisfy their AI needs, including new data centers and sufficient power supply. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the initiative will expedite gathering resources to "build the infrastructure of the future and power it in a sustainable way." Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI (arguably the best bromance in tech) has raised eyebrows among employees, with some indicating that the tech giant has seemingly become "a glorified IT department for the hot startup." Interestingly, despite Microsoft's multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI's tech, a recent report revealed the company's struggles with Copilot and its next-gen AI tools. According to a Microsoft employee with knowledge about the matter: All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. "There's a gap between the ambitious vision and what users are actually experiencing. Internally, we're calling it growing pains. We are building the plane as we fly it." Perhaps more concerning, the damning report detailed that Microsoft outsources help from third-party vendors to get Microsoft 365 Copilot to fire on all cylinders. According to Microsoft, 70% of Fortune 500 employees leverage its AI services. A high-ranking executive at the company claimed most Copilot AI tools are seemingly gimmicky. Security and privacy concerns riddle users with the rapid prevalence of AI. A Microsoft employee indicated Microsoft 365 Copilot "works really darn well at sharing information that the customer doesn't want to share or didn't think it had made available to its employee, such as salary info." The employee claimed the issue wasn't an easy fix and could take years. Microsoft is reportedly moving away from OpenAI's products, including its GPT-4 model. The report indicated the model was too expensive and wasn't fast enough to meet enterprise customer needs. The report details how Microsoft is aggressively looking at ways to reduce costs for enterprise features, such as Github Copilot, with the goal of "passing on savings to customers."
