The leaders St Mary’s return to Tom Clifford Park for the first time in eight years with a side featuring both of their ex-Young Munster players, prolific fullback Conor Hayes and the former Munster centre Dan Goggin. The latter will be opposing his brother, Tom, who starts in the home side’s secondrow, as was the case when the sides met in round eight six weeks ago. St Mary’s prevailed that day by 26-24, with their ex-Munster centre scoring their fourth try and Hayes landing three conversions. This fixture has always had a certain resonance ever since Young Munster beat St Mary’s in a title decider at Lansdowne Road in 1993. The home side sit sixth but are only five points behind Mark McHugh’s side, who were blunted a week ago by Lansdowne. Young Munster recorded a fine derby win over Garryowen last week but Evan O’Connell and Ruadhán Quinn are travelling reserves for Munster’s Champions Cup game in Northampton, and outhalf Tony Butler is on the bench in Franklin’s Gardens. The 11th round comprises the return fixtures from the eighth round in early December, when four of the five top-flight games were decided by four points or less. The exception was Clontarf’s handsome win in Ballynahinch, and after their game in Armagh was postponed last week, they will be favourites to complete the double at Castle Avenue. As well as having the Leinster duo of Alex Soroka and Brian Deeney up front, the Clontarf team features Hugh Cooney, named this week as a development player in the Irish squad. With Jake Flannery on Ulster duty, James Humphreys reverts to outhalf for ‘Hinch, who welcome back influential centre George Pringle. Third-placed Terenure host UCD and welcome back Chris Cosgrave, who nailed the last-ditch penalty to beat the students in the corresponding clash at the Bowl. Aran Egan reverts to outhalf, while Leinster’s John McKee returns at hooker. Emmet MacMahon, forwards coach when Terenure won their maiden AIL two seasons ago, returns to Lakelands with a UCD team featuring six Leinster players, including Andrew Osborne on the wing. Fourth-placed Cork Con will look to continue their steady climb up the table when hosting Garryowen at Temple Hill, having been hard-pressed to beat the bottom-placed side 19-17 last time around. The champions have restored James Taylor at outhalf but while Garryowen welcome back loosehead George Hadden they are again without the stardust of Brian Gleeson and also fellow Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks. Lansdowne, who will be eyeing up a top four finish after last week’s win at St Mary’s put them within seven points of the playoffs, host City of Armagh on the Aviva back pitch on Sunday due to the Leinster-Bath game. Last May, Old Belvedere went to the Thomond Park back pitch and beat Shannon 46-8 in the promotion/relegation semi-final playoffs. Eight months on and the in-form Belvo return atop 1B against a Shannon side who have swiftly dropped to last in the second tier. Nenagh Ormond, just three points adrift, seek to maintain the pace in Naas, while Trinity host third-placed Old Wesley and Blackrock travel to UCC in a meeting of fourth and fifth. The free-scoring pacesetters in 2A, Corinthians and Instonians, are at home to Banbridge and Cashel, as are third and fourth placed Greystones and MU Barnhall against Ballymena and Old Crescent. Saturday Men Division 1A: Clontarf v Ballynahinch, Castle Avenue; Cork Constitution v Garryowen, Temple Hill; Terenure College v UCD, Lakelands; Young Munster v St Mary’s College, Tom Clifford Park.

Title: Irish rugby needs Munster remaining competitive at the elite end of European rugby

Munster are clinging on to second place in Pool 3 of the Champions Cup by the slenderest of margins ahead of Saracens, namely a points difference of +29 as against +28, with both teams on 10 match points. Clinging on somehow seems apt, much like their status as one of European rugby’s grandees. Realistically, therefore, Munster probably have to beat Northampton in Franklin’s Gardens on Saturday afternoon (kick-off 3.15pm) to ensure they finish above the Saints and thus ensure themselves of a home tie in the Round of 16 for the first time in three seasons. Otherwise the expectation must be that Saracens will better Munster’s result when they host Castres 24 hours later. Failure to progress beyond the Round of 16 would mean Munster going three successive campaigns without reaching the quarter-finals for the first time since the inaugural three seasons of the competition from 1995-96 to 1997-98, ie, back when the Irish provinces didn’t really count. Even as things stand Munster have only reached one quarter-final in the last five seasons, when losing to Toulouse in a goal-kicking competition after an epic stalemate over 100 minutes. Although it tells us much about the Munster’s hierarchy’s priorities that this match had to be played in the Aviva Stadium as, despite the quarter-final weekend being known in advance, they had leased out Thomond Park for Ed Sheeran concerts. There has been one Round of 16 tie behind closed doors and a first leg of a two-legged last 16 tie, but the last time Munster hosted a quarter-final at Thomond Park was in 2018, when Andrew Conway’s try manufactured a trademark Houdini-esque act of escapism against Toulon. For sure Munster have had some wonderful players in that time, and they are a well-coached squad. They couldn’t have won the URC title two seasons ago, or finished top of the regular 18-game campaign last season, without still being a good side. But a third successive season without a third Champions Cup tie at Thomond Park, and that invaluable source of revenue, would be revisiting those mid-90s years. And a seventh successive season without a quarter-final at Thomond Park would be a famine. Compare and contrast with the ensuing 20 seasons from 1998-99 to 2017-18, when Munster reached 17 quarter-finals, of which nine were in Limerick, and one in Lansdowne Road while Thomond Park was being redeveloped. The late, great Garrett Fitzgerald was CEO of Munster for those two decades, and maintained Munster’s achievements were a miracle given Leinster’s socio-economic advantages. Even so they seem to have become a comparatively mismanaged machine since those halcyon days, and they are producing increasingly less players for international rugby. True, the class of the Noughties was a golden generation. But this week’s two Irish squad announcements for the Six Nations and the Under-20 Six Nations are instructive. Simon Easterby’s 36-man squad contains only five Munster players, the same as Connacht, one more than Ulster, and 18 less than Leinster. Munster fans can argue all they want about individual cases such as Tom Ahern, Gavin Coombes and Alex Kendellen, while Oli Jager and Craig Casey are injured, and under David Nucifora the IRFU’s focus became too based on Leinster to the detriment of the other three provinces. But, however much you dress it up, Munster have inexorably become less productive. The Munster quintet contain two world-class players, Peter O’Mahony and Conor Murray – 34 and 35 respectively. Each still makes Munster a better team, but Murray this week admitted he is not even considering his future beyond this season, and this campaign may be a last dance for the pair of them in the wake of Keith Earls, Simon Zebo and others. Of the others Tadhg Beirne is a product of the Leinster system – although where Munster would have been without him for the last seven seasons doesn’t bear thinking about. Which leaves Jack Crowley, an outhalf from Bandon, and Calvin Nash, a winger from Limerick. While there is talent coming through in the considerable ability of Brian Gleeson, Ruadhán Quinn and others, there’s no sign of Munster suddenly yielding a richer harvest. Neil Doak’s 31-man under-20s squad has a similar and familiar breakdown, with 17 Leinster players, five apiece from Munster and Ulster, three from Connacht, and one from England. Of the Munster quintet the promising ex-CBC and Constitution prop Michael Foy, now with UCC, has had his progress delayed by injury. The lock Conor Kennelly is also a product of CBC and Con, and now with Highfield. Ironically, the under-20s captain and backrower Eanna McCarthy is also a product of CBC, but seemingly didn’t fit in the Munster academy, and having been chased by the other three, pitched up in Connacht and Galwegians. The 19-year-old Munster academy centre Gene O’Leary Kareem is a product of Highfield and PBC, whom he captained to the Munster Schools Senior Cup final win over CBC last season. Another is centre Eoghan Smyth, a 19-year-old product of Midleton College who doubtless owes his inclusion through his eye-catching performances as an ever-present in the All-Ireland League this season with Cork Constitution. And there should be a lesson in this. The stylish Munster academy outhalf Dylan Hicks, who has also been playing regularly in Division 1A of the AIL with Garryowen, is a product of Bantry. Admittedly, the Shannon prop Emmet Calvey and the flanker Luke Murphy, who hails from Cratloe in Clare and came through Shannon and Ardscoil Rís, were stars of last year’s under-20s team and are still eligible but currently injured. Yet there are no forwards from Limerick or its surrounding feeder area in either the Irish senior or under-20s squad, something that would have been unthinkable even 15 years ago. Back in Ireland’s 2009 Grand Slam campaign of the 40 players who were part of the Irish squad, 15 came from Munster, 12 from Leinster, eight from Ulster and five from across the water, with none from Connacht. Nine years later of the 36 players named in the original squad and four subsequent call-ups in that Grand Slam campaign, Leinster had become bulk suppliers with 19, but Munster still provided 12, with five from Ulster and four from Connacht. Talking to several well-placed people inside Munster rugby the primary problem appears to be the ongoing attempt to ape the Leinster system without having anything like similar resources and competitive standards. Thanks to the superior facilities and wages paid to coaches in Blackrock College, St Michael’s, Gonzaga et al, Leinster have a conveyor belt of ready-made talent for their academy system. Such are their numbers Leinster can afford some players slipping through the system. Some schools in Munster do put a focus on nurturing young rugby talent. For example, Johnny Holland the oversees the CBC programme and Duncan Williams is their head coach. But others depend on a perfect storm, ie Seán Skehan coaching a Glenstal team with Ben Healy, or can flit between focusing on rugby or hurling/Gaelic football. Individually the Munster clubs and schools cannot hope to emulate Leinster. Akin to Connacht, they should start working together rather than separately, and stop preventing players from continuing their playing ties with the clubs who introduced them to the game. In those vital development years of, say, 12 to 15, talented young players need specialist coaching and improved competition structures rather than being coached by voluntary teachers or PE teachers. Munster need to find a Munster way, and delve into their famed club game, where most are struggling to field second teams, or in some cases even under-20s teams. Limerick clubs won 13 of the first 19 AILs. They’ve not had one winner since Shannon in 2009. By all accounts the soap opera that is Munster is riven with divides among the clubs themselves, or the clubs and the schools. The decline in production lines from Limerick comes at a time when the squad, senior and academy, has been based exclusively in their High Performance Centre in the University of Limerick, and when Thomond Park has become Munster’s primary home more than ever. And this, of course, leads to the elephant in the room, namely the Limerick/Cork divide, and specifically the profound disenchantment and thorough disengagement within Cork. Granted, Thomond Park was being redeveloped in that 2008-09 season when Cork hosted nine Magners League matches, including the Leinster game. But the following season Cork hosted three Magners League games, against the Dragons, Edinburgh and Scarlets. Two seasons ago it was Zebre, Lions and Scarlets; last season the Dragons, Glasgow and Zebre, and this season the Ospreys’ visit for Munster’s rain-drenched 23-0 win in October will be followed by Edinburgh in February and Benetton in May. So disaffected have the Cork rugby fraternity become that many have ceased travelling to Thomond Park for games. Donal Lenihan has been banging this drum for years, and calling aloud for the festive Leinster game to be moved to Páirc Uí Chaoimh, where the games against the Crusaders and South Africa in the last two seasons drew 40,000-plus capacity crowds. This would be a significant gesture of goodwill toward Munster’s Cork following, yet apparently the excuse for not doing so was that hotel rooms were already booked for Leinster. Well, then, plan in advance. Leinster don’t have to be paid to pitch up in Cork or Limerick, whereas the Crusaders were reputedly paid €250,000 and the Springboks €280,000. Munster’s current CEO Ian Flanagan recently told the Irish Examiner that “the financials aren’t compelling” enough to switch an existing league fixture from Thomond Park to the home of Cork GAA. No doubt that went down like a lead balloon in Cork. If Leinster can move a derby to Croke Park and Connacht move one to MacHale Park then Munster can do likewise. Munster need to start thinking outside the box. The province needs a rethink and a revamp to find solutions within. They could do worse than find some overseeing role for Declan Kidney, who gets the Munster zeitgeist and the Cork-Limerick divide. In his last six seasons as head coach he took the province to their four Heineken Cup finals, and he is in Cork after his four years as director of rugby at London Irish. On this day all of this might seem ill-timed and negative. The fervent hope remains that Munster secure a home Round of 16 tie, that somehow they even earn an overdue Thomond Park quarter-final. No less than Ulster and Connacht, as Matt Williams argues elsewhere in this section, Irish rugby needs Munster remaining competitive at the elite end of European rugby. It needs a stronger Munster than its current version. The consequences of a continuing decline in how the province is run and managed would be disastrous. And not just for Munster. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: ‘There’s people below in Cork who don’t want to see Sarsfields win... it’s just a jealously’ – Ben O’Connor

Photo: Damien Eagers/Sportsfile ​Standing in Croke Park last July for the 25th anniversary of Cork’s 1999 All-Ireland hurling win, Ben O’Connor remembers looking around and finding it hard to absorb that it had actually been that long since that rain-soaked day in the same stadium that was in the middle of its redevelopment phase at the time. In beating Kilkenny, Cork had ended a famine, nine years long since their previous All-Ireland title. “I said where did that time go,” he recalled. “At the time in Cork that was considered a famine. Now we’re double that and another small bit with it. Even that 1999 or early 2000s team [which went on to win two subsequent All-Irelands in 2004 and 2005], there was a lot thought of them because they were the last team to win. It would be nice now if a new crop of fellas could be talked about.” That Liam MacCarthy Cup famine now runs parallel with the county’s All-Ireland club famine too. Look back at the history of the competition since its inception for the 1970/’71 season and you get a sense of just how dominant Cork club teams were in those early years. Tipperary’s Roscrea won the inaugural competition in 1971 but after that it was the preserve of three Cork city clubs, Glen Rovers, Blackrock and St Finbarr’s for seven of the next eight years, only interrupted by Kilkenny’s James Stephens. But since then the flow of the 1970s has become a trickle and just two All-Ireland title wins have been celebrated on Leeside, Midleton in 1988 and Newtownshandrum in 2004. In the meantime, Kilkenny and Galway have forged ahead with 14 titles each, five ahead of Cork’s collective nine. Cork clubs have struggled to make any mark at provincial level in recent years so Sarsfields’ progress to tomorrow’s All-Ireland final against Dublin’s Na Fianna is an outlier, even more pronounced because they lost to Ballygunner by 17 points in the 2023 Munster Championship. Sarsfields selector Diarmuid O'Sullivan celebrating after the All-Ireland club SHC semi-final win over Slaughtneil. Photo: Piaras Ó Mídheach/Sportsfile O’Connor and twin brother Jerry were chief architects behind Newtownshandrum’s 2004 win as they developed a possession game that wasn’t to everyone’s taste at the time, one which Cork modified to win those last two All-Ireland titles. Since then, the All-Ireland club championship has been a wasteland for Cork senior clubs with just Newtonshandrum returning to a final, which they lost to a Joe Canning-inspired Portumna, two years later. “It doesn’t happen too often,” acknowledged O’Connor, who is full of admiration for Sarsfields because of how they turned the 2023 result around against Ballygunner. He earnestly hopes there’ll be no more talk of Newtownshandrum as the last Cork champions after this weekend. “They could have downed tools, the same as they did last year,” he said. “They won the county last year and got that hiding off Ballygunner. They didn’t want that happening again and they got their bit of luck along the way. “I think they’ve got better every day they’ve played since. Hopefully on Sunday there’ll be no more talk of Newtown being the last team to win the All-Ireland club from Cork and they’ll be talking about someone else. It’s great for Cork hurling. After Watergrasshill [All-Ireland intermediate champions] and Russell Rovers [All-Ireland junior finalists] last weekend, it would be nice to finish the whole thing off with Sars lifting the trophy.” O’Connor would love to see it and so would many others in Cork but not everyone, he acknowledged, as the competitive fires burn intensely. “There are people below in Cork who don’t want to see Sars winning. There are people above in Tyrone who don’t want to see Errigal Ciarán winning. It’s just a jealousy, I suppose. I’m a Corkman so I want to see Cork teams winning everything, no matter what they’re at. Local rivalry has to be put aside at this stage. They’re representing Cork, they’re the Cork team at the weekend so everybody should be behind Sars.” O’Connor managed Cork to the All-Ireland U-20 title in 2023 and has stepped away from the role now. But some of those players that played under him are graduating and as the swell of talent in Cork rises, O’Connor is sure that a Sarsfields win tomorrow would be a further catalyst. “It shows that the team that has won your county title is the best in the country so why can’t every other team below there think the same? The draws for the club championship have been made in Cork and there are at least four teams saying, ‘We’re better than Sars’. Now, Sars are in an All-Ireland final yet they’re saying that they’re better than them, so it’s bound to drive things on a small bit. I just think it’s great that we have a team involved at this stage.” O’Connor has no immediate ambition to return to inter-county management and cautions about the time pressure being placed on the best players now because of the split season. “Take Jack O’Connor. He loses the All-Ireland final [as part of the Cork squad], he gets a week to drown his sorrows then he’s back in with the club, he’s going then until Sunday with Sars. He’ll probably get two weeks off and then he’s back in with Cork. “For a fella that got beaten in the semi-final of a Cork championship, he’s finished at the end of September, he’s probably back training two weeks after that. So the good fella gets no break whereas before, when you had seasons [running] together, you had some chance. The better fellas have no chance. It’s great for the club player because his year is done out for him, clubs aren’t playing championship until August.” Ben (right) and Jerry O'Connor with the Liam MacCarthy Cup in 2004. Photo: Damien Eagers/Sportsfile Ben and Jerry O’Connor feature in one of the Laochra Gael programmes that are being broadcast from next week on TG4 and Ben said it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. “Looking down the road, I have three small ones and Jerry has three small ones, so it’s nice for them to be able to see the few clips and be able to see what went on back in the day,” he said. “They [the children] haven’t a clue really. They know we played hurling and they’re made for hurling themselves, but they don’t know the full story of everything so it’s nice to be able to look back. And you get this done for you. You don’t have to go and do it yourself so I suppose that’s a nice side of it.” The telepathy between the twins is a feature of their programme but Ben is adamant their understanding never compromised a decision made on the field. “I got to know his game, he got to know mine,” said Ben of Jerry. “I still like to think in a game that if the right thing to do was pass the ball, whether it was Jerry there or someone else there, I’d make the right decision. I wouldn’t like to think ‘I’ll pass it because it is Jerry’. And I know I didn’t. If it was the right thing to do, it was the right thing to do.”​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

Title: Unusual Situation in Gold & Silver Market May Spark Big Price Moves

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/17/2025 4:16:40 PM PST by delta7 The monetary metals pulled back sharply yesterday but have entered Tuesday on stable footing. Silver is trading at $29.90 –and gold is $2,674. The ongoing volatility is a reflection of uncertainty in the gold and silver markets globally, including fears of import tariffs from the incoming Trump administration. If Trump slaps a tariff of, say, 10% on precious metals coming into the U.S., that would have a huge impact. 10% on silver would amount to $3 per ounce! As a result of this worry, the price of gold and silver – as traded on the New York futures market – has risen sharply above the prices for the same metals seen simultaneously in other markets across the globe. In silver, for example, the spread between London spot and New York futures has recently reached as high as $1 per ounce! This spread has also created a big incentive for parties all over the world to get their gold and silver into the U.S. before any tariffs are imposed. Traders are buying metal in London, simultaneously selling in the NY futures market (and pocketing a tidy profit), withdrawing the metal from London vaults, and transporting the metal to the U.S. to deliver onto the exchange to close out the futures position. Hot This dynamic is having the effect of draining London vaults of gold and silver at an unusually fast rate –and at some point, these lower levels of vaulted metal in London could create price dislocations in that major market too. Those who have short positions in the New York market are in the process of getting squeezed, especially if they are having trouble getting their hands on physical metal to deliver into their short positions. Or get it into the right form. This situation could lead to big price swings and even a major short squeeze event in gold and/or silver, so you can be confident we'll keep our customers updated at MoneyMetals.com.

If Trump slaps a tariff of, say, 10% on precious metals coming into the U.S., that would have a huge impact. 10% on silver would amount to $3 per ounce! As a result of this worry, the price of gold and silver – as traded on the New York futures market – has risen sharply above the prices for the same metals seen simultaneously in other markets across the globe. In silver, for example, the spread between London spot and New York futures has recently reached as high as $1 per ounce! This spread has also created a big incentive for parties all over the world to get their gold and silver into the U.S. before any tariffs are imposed. Traders are buying metal in London, simultaneously selling in the NY futures market (and pocketing a tidy profit), withdrawing the metal from London vaults, and transporting the metal to the U.S. to deliver onto the exchange to close out the futures position. Hot This dynamic is having the effect of draining London vaults of gold and silver at an unusually fast rate –and at some point, these lower levels of vaulted metal in London could create price dislocations in that major market too. Those who have short positions in the New York market are in the process of getting squeezed, especially if they are having trouble getting their hands on physical metal to deliver into their short positions. Or get it into the right form. This situation could lead to big price swings and even a major short squeeze event in gold and/or silver, so you can be confident we'll keep our customers updated at MoneyMetals.com.

This spread has also created a big incentive for parties all over the world to get their gold and silver into the U.S. before any tariffs are imposed. Traders are buying metal in London, simultaneously selling in the NY futures market (and pocketing a tidy profit), withdrawing the metal from London vaults, and transporting the metal to the U.S. to deliver onto the exchange to close out the futures position. Hot This dynamic is having the effect of draining London vaults of gold and silver at an unusually fast rate –and at some point, these lower levels of vaulted metal in London could create price dislocations in that major market too. Those who have short positions in the New York market are in the process of getting squeezed, especially if they are having trouble getting their hands on physical metal to deliver into their short positions.

Title: The Tennessee-BlackRock Settlement: A Win for Transparency and Investor Interests

Full Content:
The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change In a high-stakes showdown that captured the attention of investors nationwide, the State of Tennessee has reached a settlement with BlackRock, Inc. regarding its use of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors in the management of U.S. mutual funds. While skeptics might dismiss the agreement as symbolic, a closer inspection reveals an important victory for investor rights, transparency, and accountability in the financial sector. At the heart of this case was the assertion that BlackRock had violated Tennessee’s Trade Practices Act (TCPA) by failing to adequately disclose the role of ESG factors in its decision-making processes. ESG investing has been a polarizing topic, with proponents hailing it as a forward-thinking approach to sustainable finance and critics decrying it as a distraction from fiduciary duties. The lawsuit filed by Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti aimed to address these tensions, arguing that investors deserved clarity and honesty about the criteria shaping their portfolios. This agreement serves as a blueprint for restoring trust in financial institutions. By addressing the controversies surrounding ESG investing, the settlement strikes a balance between innovation and accountability. It neither demonizes ESG principles nor gives them free rein; instead, it holds fund managers to their core responsibility—maximizing shareholder value. Furthermore, the settlement demonstrates the power of state-level legal actions to influence corporate governance on a national scale. As more states scrutinize the practices of financial giants, the message is clear: investors deserve honesty, transparency, and accountability. Some critics may argue that the settlement lets BlackRock off the hook by dismissing the claims without prejudice. However, this overlooks the significant commitments BlackRock has made to reform its practices. The settlement includes clear mechanisms for reasserting the dismissed claims if BlackRock fails to comply, ensuring that the agreement has teeth. Moreover, by requiring BlackRock to implement these reforms over three years, the settlement allows for meaningful, lasting changes rather than short-term fixes. The inclusion of audits and public disclosures further bolsters its enforceability. In an era where ESG controversies dominate headlines, this settlement offers a refreshing approach. It empowers investors with the information they need to make informed decisions while holding financial institutions accountable for their actions. As other states consider similar measures, Tennessee has set a precedent that balances innovation with investor protection. While no settlement is perfect, this agreement represents a significant victory for transparency, accountability, and the integrity of financial markets. For Tennessee investors—and indeed, all investors across the country—it’s a step in the right direction. Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

Since forever, ESG has contravened bedrock fiduciary responsibilities very clearly and deeply established by both statutory and common law. Blackrock had no choice but to fold.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mitek Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:MITK) stands against other AI companies under $2 billion market cap. It’s clear that AI holds immense promise but it comes with significant risks. Some of the concerns that the market has include overreliance on a few key players, shifts in demand toward smaller competitors, and the broader impact of AI-driven market trends on earnings and valuations. While AI offers opportunities, managing risks such as customer concentration, economic headwinds, and market volatility will be crucial for its sustainable growth and integration. On CNBC ‘Fast Money,’ a discussion between traders highlighted concerns about elevated expectations for AI, especially in the chip market, with NVDA as a prime example. Past patterns in the semiconductor giant’s stock suggest potential declines, with customer concentration being a significant risk. Some believe demand for high-end chips could shift to smaller semiconductor companies. They also discussed that broader market performance might improve as other sectors gain traction, especially during earnings season, which is expected to influence investor sentiment more than AI and GLP-1 trends. They mentioned that the key risks for earnings include the strong U.S. dollar, rising rates, and policy uncertainties, which may impact large-cap companies. While recent PPI data offered some relief, the bond market remains firm, with 10-year yields approaching 5%. Expectations for CPI and PCE figures are mixed, with potential reacceleration seen as a headwind for markets in a higher rate environment. Earnings and economic data were considered critical factors to watch by the traders. For this article, we scoured our database as well as several ETFs and media reports to find all possible AI stocks under $2 billion. We then listed the stocks in ascending order of their market cap. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Its main products include Mobile Deposit for remote check deposits, Mobile Verify for identity checks, and Mobile Fill for simplified form completion.

Additional offerings include ID_CLOUD, IDLive Face, IDLive Doc, and IDVoice to combat fraud and better security. The company aims to strengthen its AI-powered solutions and upgrade fraud and identity detection to tackle rising digital fraud. The company not only has AI-driven solutions but is also focused on combating rising AI-driven threats and deepfakes. At its latest earnings call, the company CEO Ed West said: “Mitek (NASDAQ:MITK) is a trusted leader in computer vision and identity-related application of AI and fraud prevention. We revolutionized check processing with our mobile check deposit solution and we continue to push boundaries with innovations in identity verification, authentication and fraud management” He also added: “Customers are increasingly seeking integrated platforms, not just point solutions, to combat rising AI-driven threats and deepfakes. Our fraud platform stands out with proprietary capabilities with an established track record of leading in trusted third-party and U.S. government-led benchmarks. In December, Allen Klee of Maxim Group maintained a Buy rating on Mitek Systems (NASDAQ:MITK) with a $13 price target, emphasizing its strong financial performance and strategic focus. The company outperformed expectations in F4Q24, achieving significant revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and EPS growth, driven by strong results in its Identity and Deposits segments. Overall, MITK ranks 22nd on our list of the 59 AI companies under $2 billion market cap. While we acknowledge the potential of MITK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MITK but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Tennessee Attorney General settles ESG dispute with BlackRock
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tennessee-attorney-general-settles-esg-dispute-with-blackrock-3819332
Time Published: 2025-01-17T18:41:18Z

By Niket Nishant and Ross Kerber (Reuters) -Asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) agreed to new disclosure requirements about its use of sustainable-investment factors as part of a legal settlement with Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, his office said on Friday. The resolution is the latest step by New York-based BlackRock and by other firms to move away from environmental, social or governance measures. An anti-ESG backlash has gathered force among Skrmetti and other Republican politicians including incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Skrmetti sued BlackRock late in 2023, alleging it did not adequately disclose its use of ESG factors and that it overstated their financial benefits. Although BlackRock did not admit to wrongdoing or pay fines as part of the deal, Skrmetti told Reuters in an interview that the agreement was significant as a mark of the times. "BlackRock was at the heart of this, the biggest asset manager in the world, and their willingness to undertake this settlement speaks to the end of the ESG moment," he said. The company's steps like quitting an investor climate group on Jan. 9 "certainly helped solidify" the agreement, he said. BlackRock, with some $11.6 trillion under management, said it was pleased to resolve the dispute with Tennessee. "BlackRock has consistently acted in the best interests of our clients, and we welcome the opportunity to demonstrate that fact through even greater transparency about our practices," the company said in a statement sent by a representative. Among other things, BlackRock agreed to disclosure requirements such as giving quarterly, not annual, details about votes it cast, and to provide a rationale when its non-ESG funds cast proxy votes against management recommendations on environmental or social matters. BlackRock already provides many such details on its website. Skrmetti said the formalization of the disclosures creates a "comprehensive compliance regime" and that the lack of financial penalties helped speed the deal. ESG investing enjoyed a run as a hot area of finance but investors pulled back in recent years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine surged energy prices and hurt the relative performance of technology-heavy ESG funds that often avoid fossil fuel stocks. Meanwhile Republicans, often from energy-producing states, have increased pressure on BlackRock and rivals like Vanguard and State Street (NYSE:STT) over the issue. Fink said in 2023 that he had stopped using the term ESG as it had become too politicized.

Title: Vanguard fined more than $100 million by SEC over violations involving target date retirement funds

BREAKING: Israel says Gaza ceasefire delayed until Hamas provides list of first hostages to be freed. Hamas says it remains committed to the deal. Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Asset management giant Vanguard has been fined more than $100 million to settle charges related to disclosures around target date investment funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday. The alleged violations stem from a 2020 change where Vanguard lowered the minimum investment requirement for its institutional target date funds. The SEC order found that the change spurred redemptions as Vanguard customers moved from other target date funds into the institutional versions, creating taxable distributions for some of the remaining shareholders. The SEC said Vanguard failed to properly disclose the potential impact of the investment threshold changes on distributions. “The order finds that, as a result, retail investors of the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments,” the SEC said in a press release. The fine of $106.41 million will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Vanguard agreed to the fine without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings. Vanguard is one of the world’s largest asset managers, reporting more than $10 trillion of global assets as of last November. The firm was founded by Jack Bogle in the 1970s and has a reputation as a low-cost, investor friendly firm. “Vanguard is committed to supporting the more than 50 million everyday investors and retirement savers who entrust us with their savings. We’re pleased to have reached this settlement and look forward to continuing to serve our investors with world-class investment options,” Vanguard said in a statement. Target date funds are a popular retirement vehicle designed to slowly shift from a growth-oriented portfolio to a conservative portfolio as the listed year approaches. Typically, this is done by replacing riskier stocks with higher exposure to income-generating bonds as the retirement date nears. The fine highlights how investors can see large tax bills even when they themselves do not make any asset sales during a calendar year. When Vanguard dropped the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds to $5 million from $100 million in December 2020, it spurred retirement plan investors to cash out of the investor share class of these funds and swap into the institutional version, according to the SEC. Vanguard then had to sell the underlying assets in the investor share class of the funds to meet the redemptions from departing investors, the SEC found. As a result, shareholders who stayed in the investor share class were subject to a large capital gains distribution — and a tax liability if they held the fund in a taxable brokerage account, according to the order. Normally, target date funds remain in tax-deferred accounts like 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts — which would avoid a tax hit from a large capital gains distribution. The SEC’s order said Vanguard’s investor-series target funds saw $130 billion in redemptions from December 2020 to October 2021, up from $41 billion in the same period a year prior. Vanguard later merged the two series of funds together, which the SEC order said the company refrained from doing originally in part to preserve fee revenue. The fine announced Friday is in addition to the $40 million Vanguard had agreed to pay to investors as part of a class action suit. The timing of the target date fund changes is similar to another recent Vanguard legal run-in. In 2023, Vanguard was fined $800,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority related to problems with account statements for money market funds in 2019 and 2020. The alleged violations took place under former CEO Tim Buckley. The current CEO, Salim Ramji, joined Vanguard from BlackRock in 2024. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: T Stamp Inc. (IDAI): AI Identity Verification Under $2 Billion Market Cap

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Complete List of All AI Companies Under $2 Billion Market Cap. In this article, we are going to take a look at where T Stamp Inc. (NASDAQ:IDAI) stands against other AI companies under $2 billion market cap. It’s clear that AI holds immense promise but it comes with significant risks. Some of the concerns that the market has include overreliance on a few key players, shifts in demand toward smaller competitors, and the broader impact of AI-driven market trends on earnings and valuations. While AI offers opportunities, managing risks such as customer concentration, economic headwinds, and market volatility will be crucial for its sustainable growth and integration. On CNBC ‘Fast Money,’ a discussion between traders highlighted concerns about elevated expectations for AI, especially in the chip market, with NVDA as a prime example. Past patterns in the semiconductor giant’s stock suggest potential declines, with customer concentration being a significant risk. Some believe demand for high-end chips could shift to smaller semiconductor companies. They also discussed that broader market performance might improve as other sectors gain traction, especially during earnings season, which is expected to influence investor sentiment more than AI and GLP-1 trends. They mentioned that the key risks for earnings include the strong U.S. dollar, rising rates, and policy uncertainties, which may impact large-cap companies. While recent PPI data offered some relief, the bond market remains firm, with 10-year yields approaching 5%. Expectations for CPI and PCE figures are mixed, with potential reacceleration seen as a headwind for markets in a higher rate environment. Earnings and economic data were considered critical factors to watch by the traders. For this article, we scoured our database as well as several ETFs and media reports to find all possible AI stocks under $2 billion. We then listed the stocks in ascending order of their market cap. We also added the hedge fund sentiment around each stock which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

The company uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, biometrics, cryptography, and data mining to detect and prevent identity fraud, safeguard sensitive data, and improve digital service accessibility. Its technology combines Irreversibly Transformed Identity Token and various biometric or identifying data sources. On January 6, T Stamp (NASDAQ:IDAI) announced a strategic partnership with Qenta Inc. As part of the agreement, Qenta is spinning off its Goldstar KYC technology into a new subsidiary, QID Technologies LLC, with Trust Stamp holding a 10% stake in the new entity. Trust Stamp has also granted QID a non-exclusive license for its AI-powered identity technologies in exchange for a $1 million license fee, payable in three installments over Q1 2025. Additionally, QID will contract with Trust Stamp for business and product development services related to identity and privacy solutions, with monthly service fees starting January 1, 2025, capped at $3.6 million annually. As a 10% shareholder in QID, Trust Stamp expects to receive a net cash inflow of $3.3 million from the projected $3.6 million in billed revenue. Overall, IDAI ranks 58th on our list of AI companies under $2 billion market cap. While we acknowledge the potential of IDAI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: Traders Ditch Emerging Markets in Rocky Start of the Year

(Bloomberg) -- Investors are yanking money from emerging markets at the start of 2025 as they weigh how many of Donald Trump’s threats will become policy upon his return to the White House next week. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework? Money managers pulled $8.5 billion from funds dedicated to developing-world stocks and bonds so far this year, according a JPMorgan Chase & Co. report citing EPFR data. The selloff has hit assets across the globe from Chile’s peso to stocks in China and India to sovereign bonds from Romania and El Salvador. The outflows mark the continuation of a trend that has beset the asset class for the past three years. Traders have already been struggling to make a case for emerging markets while the US economy hums along, the outlook for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts dims and some of the biggest developing economies, from China to Brazil, struggle. Trump’s inauguration on Monday poses a fresh set of risks. The Republican president-elect has doubled down on his proposal to impose sweeping tariffs on the rest of the world, while adding threats to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland. “It’s hard for the market to take big bets in front of big events,” said Pablo Goldberg, a portfolio manager at BlackRock in New York. “Markets don’t like uncertainty, and right now we’re still in a very uncertain period.” The start of the year has been bumpy, with an index of emerging stocks sinking into a correction in early January and dollar bonds posting losses. Most emerging currencies are down versus the dollar this year, with some including the Indian rupee and the Brazilian real trading at or near record lows as changing bets on US rate cuts and Trump policies boost the dollar. Asian central banks, which have been shielding their currencies through interventions in the face of the greenback’s relentless rally, are beginning to rethink their strategy, considering rate cuts to boost their economies instead of focusing on currency management. ‘Highly Uncertain’ Carlos Legaspy, chief executive officer at Insight Securities, said investors are opting for safety, at least until they see how the early days of Trump’s second presidency plays out. “I’d rather buy a a two-year Treasury with a yield near 4%,” he said, “then to wait and give Trump 100 days to see if he starts delivering on his threats.” Arif Joshi, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management, said he’s expecting the changes in trade and tax policy to be significant during Trump’s second term. “The magnitude and timing of those changes are highly uncertain,” he said. “It’s not wise at this time to have duration or FX risk in emerging markets.” The Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and Korean won are particularly vulnerable and could weaken as much as 10% should Trump impose single-sector tariffs, according to Barclays strategists led by Lefteris Farmakis. During the campaign, Trump floated minimum tariffs from 10% to 20% on all imported goods, and 60% or higher on China, causing a selloff in EM assets. He also caused a rout in Panama bonds when he suggested the US should reassert control of the canal — one of the most important waterways in the world — if the nation didn’t cut transit fees for American vessels. The unpredictable nature of the announcements — assets have posted harsh swings several times in the past two weeks amid Trump social media comments, including this Friday — has prompted Michael Cirami to instruct his junior staff to shout any time Trump mentions a country for the first time. “He could wake up in the middle of the night and mention a country that you were not expecting him to, and all of a sudden, the situation’s changed,” said Cirami, who helps manage $3 billion in mostly fixed-income assets at Artisan Partners. “We need to be on our guard.” --With assistance from Andras Gergely, Carolina Wilson, Selcuk Gokoluk, Winnie Hsu and Catherine Bosley.

The SEC order found that the change spurred redemptions as Vanguard customers moved from other target date funds into the institutional versions, creating taxable distributions for some of the remaining shareholders. The SEC said Vanguard failed to properly disclose the potential impact of the investment threshold changes on distributions. "The order finds that, as a result, retail investors of the Investor TRFs who did not switch and continued to hold their fund shares in taxable accounts faced historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," the SEC said in a press release. The payment of $106.41 million will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Vanguard agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the SEC's findings.

The firm was founded by Jack Bogle in the 1970s and has a reputation as a low-cost, investor friendly firm. "Vanguard is committed to supporting the more than 50 million everyday investors and retirement savers who entrust us with their savings. We're pleased to have reached this settlement and look forward to continuing to serve our investors with world-class investment options," Vanguard said in a statement. Target date funds are a popular retirement vehicle designed to slowly shift from a growth-oriented portfolio to a conservative portfolio as the listed year approaches. Typically, this is done by replacing riskier stocks with higher exposure to income-generating bonds as the retirement date nears. The payment highlights how investors can see large tax bills even when they themselves do not make any asset sales during a calendar year. When Vanguard dropped the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds to $5 million from $100 million in December 2020, it spurred retirement plan investors to cash out of the investor share class of these funds and swap into the institutional version, according to the SEC. Vanguard then had to sell the underlying assets in the investor share class of the funds to meet the redemptions from departing investors, the SEC found. As a result, shareholders who stayed in the investor share class were subject to a large capital gains distribution — and a tax liability if they held the fund in a taxable brokerage account, according to the order.

The SEC's order said Vanguard's investor-series target funds saw $130 billion in redemptions from December 2020 to October 2021, up from $41 billion in the same period a year prior. Vanguard later merged the two series of funds together, which the SEC order said the company refrained from doing originally in part to preserve fee revenue. Jeff DeMaso, who specializes in tracking Vanguard at Independent Vanguard Adviser, said he believed the $106 million settlement was the largest ever regulatory payment imposed on the Pennsylvania-based asset manager. The settlement announced Friday is in addition to the $40 million Vanguard had agreed to pay to investors as part of a class action suit. The timing of the target date fund changes is similar to another recent Vanguard legal run-in.

Spread the infestation! Ethereal Oracle Dev Comment: Ethereal Oracle has been one of the strongest and most ubiquitous cards in the meta since the launch of The Great Dark Beyond. In hindsight, this is a card we probably should have addressed in the last balance patch. Unfortunately, the timing of that patch wasn't ideal because we try to avoid high-impact changes heading into an extended winter break where we wouldn't be able to react to unforeseen problems that might arise. Instead, we're adding the change into this major patch because we're already expecting a meta shakeup with the mini-set, and we have our usual built-in balance window a few weeks from now for any necessary follow-up adjustments.

The following sets will make up the format: The Wonderful Un'Goro format will end with the February season and then Twist will be on hiatus. We will have more information about future Twist seasons in a future update. Really looking forward to this mini set! SC2 was the 1st blizzard game I've ever played and holds a special place in my heart. D4 Season 7 is on Tuesday too so I'm gonna have a good night of gaming. The price of the mini set is 2500 gold. Is it worth buying? WTB an update for BG's instead of this BS we currently have. Honestly, might as well throw Wayward Probe into the main game too because why not. I agree completely! have they showed the Grunty card yet Believe it’s tomorrow at 9am EST I love how Twist is seemingly being shelved just as quickly as it was introduced. "Here's a repeat season followed by another hiatus. We'll update you all later." Just admit you killed Duels for no reason and your replacement failed because of no actual effort. The season with the prebuilt decks for Legendaries was so fun but we haven't seen anything like it since. But hey, at least we have 1 game board a year now and 2 ultra premium Ragnaros skins. Yeah I think with their current staffing level, it’s taking all of Hearthstones workforce to keep standard/battlegrounds/arena running. solo adventures, twist, duels, mercenaries, and game boards are all getting shelved. There are a lot of new skins and pack bundles in the shops, which is likely because blizzard is forcing the team to focus on content that instantly generates money. I don’t blame the devs, because they’re underpaid engineers who also play the game and try their best, but I hope the upper echelons of blizzard make sure to prioritize gameplay a bit more often I feel that there was a bunch of better changes you could do to Ethereal Oracle rather than increasing the Cost. Because the design philosophy of most nerf feels to be "Maybe they would play it less" instead of "Let's make the card more balanced" You want to play your cards, every Priest plays Creation Protocol because why wouldn't you, but the card is perfectly fair. I don't really know in what deck the card was problematic cause I don't play standard. But recently I only saw it on Meteor Shaman, and if that deck was the problem you could say "Draw 2 spells that started in your deck" or remove the Spell Damage, or even give it Spell Damage -1 , Why not after 10 years I think we are ready for a change like that, but only increasing the Mana is like meh. The decks when the card was fundamental are going to still being playing the card and the decks when the card wasn't that relevant are going to cut it off. The decks when the card was fundamental are going to still being playing the card and the decks when the card wasn't that relevant are going to cut it off. But... that was exactly the problem with the card - it was too efficient, so a lot of decks used it. You didn't even have to plan to use the spell damage. The goal is to make it a bigger investment so that decks that don't need it stop using it by default - expanding deck diversity in the meta, so the decks that want Ethereal Oracle look more different from every other deck. Fundamentally, I just read this statement and hear you saying "I think the nerf will work". I mean, the card is nerfed, that's not debatable. What I mean with that statement is that you are hurting more the decks where that card was just fine, than the decks when the card was problematic. And is a clear case when the just pay for the sinners. For example (this was reverted but works for the point) At some point Saronite Chain Gang was nerfed to "Summon another Saronite Chain Gang" because back on the day the interaction that it had with Shudderwock was problematic. But that actually damaged all the other decks when you wanted to use Saronite Chain Gang as a handbuff card. So instead of make an smart change that fix the issue without removing the utility that it had for other decks. As simple as said "Battlecry: Summon another Saronite Chain Gang with stats equal to this minion's", they just removed that. So yeah, it fixed the Shudderwock problem, but all the other decks that cared for the card for a different reason also lost a card unjustifiably. So yeah, the card is going to see less play, but is going to see less play in the decks where it was less problematic At 4-Mana, if I don't care about the Spell Damage that much, I might just play Carry-On Grub which has better stats and an effect that you can play on curve without worry about anything, and without needing external cards to trigger it. A shame that they are not adding Wayward Probe to constructed too, since this is the last time any Starship support will ever be printed. A card like that would have been a fun addition to the Starship mechanic and what I would have expected to see in a miniset. I would probably bought a Overmind mythic skin. Damn shame it's Kerrigan. "Awaken my child and embrace the glory that is your birthright. Know that I am the Overmind the eternal will of the Swarm and that you have been created to serve me." Expected some more changes after such a long time lol And 1 aena-specific card? Weird Usually when you have such a meta warping card nerfed the meta changes quite a bit. This card will slow down a lot of the decks that use it. Cards that seem very strong now may not be in a week, plus with a mini set coming out they’ll probably have a bigger one in a few weeks and rotation is soon so they’ll likely buff a few cards before they rotate.

Mason Hawkins is a prominent figure in the world of value investing, best known as the founder and chairman of Southeastern Asset Management, an investment firm established in 1975. The firm began with a modest pool of assets but grew to manage approximately $20 billion within a few years.

Title: Legend Biotech Corporation (LEGN): The Biotech Stock with Biggest Upside Potential

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of the 12 Biotech Stocks with the Biggest Upside Potential. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) stands against other biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While 2024 was a “challenging” year for biotech stocks, JPMorgan is of the view that some names in the industry may be poised for considerable upside in the coming months. On November 28, Johan Hueffer, senior partner and principal of investments at Novo Holdings, appeared on CNBC to discuss his macro perspective on investments in life sciences. He said that biotechs faced difficulty raising capital in the last couple of years. However, that trend has started to improve in the last quarter or two. Still, there have been impacts on companies that particularly service the pharmaceutical industry, such as contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), and companies that provide tools for research and development. Similar trends have been observed for companies that manufacture tools for production in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. While these sectors have had ups and downs in the past two years, the trends are starting to normalize now. Hueffer was of the view that the industry is now showing considerable opportunity. Similarly, Goldman Sachs shed light on biotech as an often overlooked sector in the investing space. In a note to clients, John Flood, Goldman’s Head of Americas Equities Sales Trading, said that biotech stocks posed an under-the-radar opportunity for investors looking to capitalize on the Fed’s recent rate cuts. Changes in interest rates uniquely affect biotech stocks as they are sensitive to them and often rely on projected future profits. These stocks are also heavily impacted by the cost of capital. Although there is little to no current profitability, these stocks have significant upside potential and pose an “option-like structure” if clinical trials succeed. This makes them especially responsive to changes and movements in interest rates. Since September, the Fed cut a full point off the funds rate. According to CNBC, the current market pricing is showing just one or two more moves lower in 2025. On January 8, CNBC reported that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members voted to reduce the central bank’s benchmark borrowing rate to the 4.25%-4.5% target range. However, they also slashed their outlook for expected rate cuts for 2025, bringing it down to two from four and assuming quarter-point increments. These changes are expected to affect biotech stocks. Flood’s note also highlighted that the biotech industry has recently shown improved fundamentals, attributed to a more favorable regulatory environment and positive clinical outcomes. Despite these tailwinds, Goldman’s data reflects that biotechnology remains under-owned by hedge funds. The sector ranked in the 13th percentile in hedge fund long/short positioning over the past year. Furthermore, it ranked in the 4th percentile over the past five years. We used the Finviz stock screener to compile a list of 40 biotech stocks. We then selected the top 12 stocks with the highest analyst upside potential as of January 15, 2025. We have also included the market capitalization of the stocks as of the same date. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts’ average upside potential. These stocks are also popular among elite hedge funds, as of fiscal Q3 2024. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small cap and large cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laboratory with workers in masks and lab coats focused on analyzing cell therapies. Analyst Upside: 161.86% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31 Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) is a clinical-stage company that develops, discovers, manufactures, and commercializes novel therapies for oncology and other indications. It develops advanced cell therapies across an elaborate range of technology platforms. The company operates in the US, China, and other geographical segments. It experienced solid sales growth for CARVYKTI® in fiscal Q3 2024. CARVYKTI treats multiple myeloma and is the first and only cell therapy that is clinically shown to significantly increase the overall survival in multiple myeloma patients. The company also increased its commercial capacity for the drug, delivering it to patients across the globe. It accounted for net trade sales of around $286 million in fiscal Q3 2024, reflecting operational growth of 87.6% year-over-year and 53.2% quarter-over-quarter. Due to the drug’s transformational nature, Legend Biotech Corp. (NASDAQ:LEGN) recently initiated commercial production at its facility in Belgium to fulfill the demand for CARVYKTI worldwide. It plans to expand its capacity further while simultaneously advancing its R&D programs as part of its long-term strategy to be a leader in cell therapy innovation. TimesSquare Capital U.S. Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter: “We began buying shares in Legend Biotech Corporation (NASDAQ:LEGN), a biotechnology developer of cell therapies to treat blood cancers such as multiple myeloma and leukemia. The European Union approved the use of Legend’s Carvykti treatment of multiple myeloma and later the FDA followed suit. Some investors may have been concerned about possible delays as Legend ramps up production, and its price declined. Though with a long-standing agreement with Johnson & Johnson and a new partnership with Novartis, we see a long runway of growth ahead, so we initiated a position.” Overall, LEGN ranks 2nd on our list of the 12 biotech stocks with the biggest upside potential. While we acknowledge the potential of biotech stocks, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/17/2025 7:50:29 AM PST by karpov As the smoke clears from devastating Los Angeles wildfires, efforts to clean up the affected areas are being complicated by burnt-out electric and hybrid vehicles and home-battery storage systems. Lithium batteries from Tesla Inc., along with those from other carmakers, have added to the mix of toxic materials requiring specialized removal in the wake of the fires, delaying the fire victims’ return to their properties. “A lot of the cars in the evacuation area were lithium batteries,” said Jacqui Irwin, a state assembly member representing the Pacific Palisades, one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the fires. “We’ve heard from firefighters that those lithium batteries burned fires near homes — like those with power walls — for much longer.” The L.A. wildfires, which began Jan. 7, have taken at least 27 lives and destroyed thousands of homes. While the dry, dangerous winds are forecast to end — a lack of rain and another possible round of winds next week has kept officials concerned that the danger is not over. Estimates for insurance losses from the fires have rapidly jumped to as high as $40 billion and BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink has warned it could take a decade to rebuild the city. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has already allocated $100 million to the cleanup effort. There were over 431,000 Teslas in operation in the Los Angeles area as of October 2024, according to data from S&P Global Mobility. Based on new registrations, their market share locally was three times that of the rest of the nation. The Tesla Model Y was the biggest-selling vehicle in the state through September, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

While the dry, dangerous winds are forecast to end — a lack of rain and another possible round of winds next week has kept officials concerned that the danger is not over.

Yes and no. The special blankets don't put the fire out, just cover the EV's while they keep burning. It's to prevent other things around the EV from catching fire. But if everything around the EV is already burning, there's no value added from the special EV fire blankets. 16 posted on 01/17/2025 8:08:34 AM PST by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

Title: Supreme Court Upholds TikTok Ban, App May Shut Down Jan. 19 in the U.S.
URL: https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/supreme-court-tiktok-ban-ruling-shutdown-1236274925/
Time Published: 2025-01-17T15:03:17Z
Full Content:
Trump says he needs 'time to review the situation' before deciding on next steps By Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor TikTok could fade to black in the U.S. in a matter of days after the Supreme Court rejected its appeal to halt a law that will ban the popular video app as of Jan. 19 unless Chinese parent ByteDance sells its stake. “There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,” the Supreme Court wrote in its unanimous opinion in the case issued Friday morning. “But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok’s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.” Related Stories VIP+ Why Synthetic Data Will Transform AI Data Licensing Cameron Diaz Trolls Trump by Saying 'Elon Musk Is Our President,' Shares New Rule for Acting Career: 'No More Rom-Coms, Only Mom-Coms' The court said that “we conclude that the challenged provisions do not violate petitioners’ First Amendment rights.” The Supreme Court affirmed the Dec. 6 judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which found that the national security risks presented by TikTok’s Chinese ownership justified the divest-or-ban law. Popular on Variety In response to the ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew thanked President-elect Donald Trump “for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States. This is a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship.” ByteDance has not publicly indicated any willingness to sell its TikTok stake. TikTok has told employees that they will still have jobs regardless of the Supreme Court ruling. In the event of an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling, TikTok has been planning to shut down the app in the U.S. on Sunday, Jan. 19. At that point, TikTok users will see a pop-up message linking to a site with information about the ban. TikTokers also will have the option to download their personal data. There still could be wiggle room for TikTok to avoid an immediate shutdown. The Biden administration is leaving the question of what to do about TikTok to Trump, set to be sworn into office Jan. 20. Trump, in a post Friday on Truth Social, wrote: “The Supreme Court decision was expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!” Trump is trying to position himself to be seen as TikTok’s savior: He is considering issuing an executive order to suspend enforcement of the law for 60-90 days while he tries to hammer out a resolution to keep TikTok available, as first reported by the Washington Post — although it’s questionable whether Trump has the legal authority to pause the divest-or-ban law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act. Trump may also instruct the government to not enforce the ban. But given that the law imposes fines of $5,000 per user on companies that distribute or host the TikTok app, tech companies like Apple, Google and Oracle (which has an agreement to host TikTok user data in the U.S.) may be reluctant to flout the ban. On Friday, Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he spoke with Chinese president Xi Jinping and “discussed balancing Trade, Fentanyl, TikTok, and many other subjects. President Xi and I will do everything possible to make the World more peaceful and safe!” Meanwhile, Trump has invited TikTok’s Chew to attend the incoming president’s Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington, D.C., and to “sit in a position of honor on the dais,” per the New York Times. The shutdown of the TikTok app in the United States would be a boon to rival platforms including Meta’s Instagram, Google’s YouTube and Snapchat. Amid the looming threat of the TikTok ban, Chinese-owned social app Xiaohongshu (aka Red Note) has soared in popularity this past week. In May 2024, TikTok and ByteDance sued the U.S. government over the divest-or-ban law, arguing the legislation violates the First Amendment rights of its U.S. users. In addition, two groups of TikTok users and creators filed petitions for review in the D. C. Circuit, challenging the constitutionality of the law. But the Supreme Court sided with the law’s backers, who have claimed TikTok represents a national security threat because Beijing-based ByteDance is subject to oversight by the Chinese Communist Party. ByteDance and TikTok have claimed the Chinese government has never requested access to TikTok user data — and that they would not turn it over if that were the case. The Supreme Court noted in its opinion that, according to the U.S. government, ByteDance “has previously declined to agree to stop collecting U.S. user data or sending that data to China to train the algorithm.” In addition, “The Government has further noted the difficulties associated with monitoring data sharing between ByteDance Ltd. and TikTok Inc. … Under these circumstances, we find the Government’s data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions.” “Data collection and analysis is a common practice in this digital age,” the Supreme Court said in its opinion. “But TikTok’s scale and susceptibility to foreign adversary control, together with the vast swaths of sensitive data the platform collects, justify differential treatment to address the Government’s national security concerns.” American lawmakers who backed the legislation have claimed it is not technically a ban because it offers ByteDance a choice: to divest TikTok’s U.S. business or to have the app shut down. TikTok and ByteDance, in their lawsuit, argued that “in reality, there is no choice,” saying the forced divestiture required by the law in order for TikTok to be allowed to continue operating in the country “is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.” Chinese officials reportedly have been exploring the potential for ByteDance to sell its stake to tech mogul Elon Musk. A TikTok spokesperson called that “pure fiction.” ByteDance has said 60% of its ownership is represented by “global institutional investors” including Blackrock, General Atlantic and Susquehanna International Group. Last year, the TikTok divest-or-ban legislation passed Congress with bipartisan support. It was signed into law by President Biden in April 2024. U.S. lawmakers have voiced concern about TikTok’s Chinese ownership, suggesting the Chinese communist regime could use the app to spy on Americans or use it to spread pro-China propaganda — despite providing no public evidence that the Chinese government has demand TikTok turn over user data or promote specific content. The law doesn’t mandate the shutdown of TikTok per se. Rather, it prohibits Apple and Google’s app stores and web hosting services from distributing TikTok in the U.S. (under penalty of monetary fines) unless ByteDance sells its ownership stake in the app to an entity based in a country that is not designated a “foreign adversary” of the United States.

Which one is more corrupt? The only different between Kalifornia and Ukeland is one is filled with commies and the other Nazis. The Neocons ‘bought Ukraine’ when they overthrew its elected government in 2014. So far the price is at $300B and climbing. At this point it’s best to cut our losses and let Europe deal with that failed country. We,(the west) already bought Ukraine and it is more useful for people to not know about it. Well, Russia knows about it. As you can see. LOL I prefer Greenland. It would make more sense to merge Ukraine and Poland. Not that that makes sense. Any outcome that puts NATO at Russia‘s doorstep does not work for Russia. Oh. We’ve already paid for Ukraine Your archaic thought is irrelevant in the present Bidenskyyyyyyyyyyy already bought it, about 12 times. Too late, Larry Fink has the exclusive rights already. “Your archaic thought is irrelevant in the present” You’re right, the REAL COST of the Neocon disaster in Ukraine will be far more relevant in the future as the US finds that their only ‘friends’ are the economic basket cases in Europe. Likely to be the DUMBEST MOVE in American history, and that’s saying a lot. My kids and grandkids will pay a HUGE PRICE for their f-up. Eff that. This is styupid on every level imaginable. You can’t buy when Putin isn’t selling especially not to the leading tool of the globohomp empire, Biden’s Amerka. It creates a huge geo-strategic vulnerability and locks us into an Asian forever land war rather then shore up our security. Can we just take care of the citizens of the US. +1000. All the friends we cannot afford. The US is in debt seven times its national income, our currency is failing, and Republicans (even) want to go on a spending spree and buy up parts of the world.

From the article: “And, maybe, trade them California as a lagniappe.” Lagniappe: An extra or unexpected gift or benefit. This is not prudent.

Title: Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV): A Bear Case Theory

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bearish thesis on Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV) on wallstreetbets Subreddit Page by SunderRei. In this article, we will summarize the bears’ thesis on SERV. Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV)'s share was trading at $18.88 as of Jan 16th. Logistics robots filling packages in a warehouse, preparing for delivery. Serve Robotics (SERV) has captured significant attention with its autonomous delivery robots, yet the company’s financials raise major red flags. Despite a market valuation exceeding $1 billion, SERV's history of unprofitability, negative gross margins, and high operational costs suggests an unsustainable business model. Each robot currently costs more to produce and operate than the revenue it generates, undermining the company's long-term viability. Alarmingly, SERV plans to mass-produce 2,000 third-generation robots in 2025, a 20-fold increase from its existing fleet of 100. With production costs per robot exceeding $32,000, this initiative will exert enormous financial pressure on a company already struggling to demonstrate profitability. The revenue potential per robot is concerningly low. Based on SEC filings, second-generation robots generate an average of $7,612 annually in delivery revenue, which pales in comparison to their production cost of $63,654. Even with the reduced production costs of third-generation robots and projected improvements in efficiency, it would still take six years for a robot to recoup its manufacturing cost—well beyond the likely operational lifespan. Operational expenses, including remote control staffing (required 20% of the time) and maintenance, further erode profitability, with annual costs per robot conservatively estimated at over $18,000. Advertisement revenue, a secondary income stream, offers limited relief. Even with an optimistic projection of $800 per robot per month, total revenues remain insufficient to offset the heavy expenses. SERV’s reliance on NVIDIA as a strategic investor has driven speculative interest, particularly following NVIDIA’s $12 million investment and 10% ownership stake. However, NVIDIA’s involvement appears more focused on showcasing its AI hardware capabilities than on SERV’s financial success. NVIDIA’s endorsement has inflated SERV’s valuation, which skyrocketed 2,000% in mid-2024, but it fails to address the fundamental flaws in SERV’s business model. Looking ahead, SERV's planned expansion is likely to exacerbate financial losses, with ballooning costs far outpacing revenues. Recent insider sales totaling $3 million further signal declining confidence among management. While SERV remains a speculative play for optimists betting on autonomous delivery technology, its current valuation is disconnected from its financial reality. For investors, SERV presents an overvalued stock with significant downside risk, making it a compelling short opportunity as its financial struggles become increasingly apparent in future reports. Serve Robotics Inc. (SERV) is not on our list of the 30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 5 hedge fund portfolios held SERV at the end of the third quarter which was 3 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of SERV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: 'Drill, Baby, Drill,' Yet Time To 'Chill, Baby, Chill' on Lower Prices
URL: https://www.realclearinvestigations.com/articles/2025/01/17/with_drill_baby_drill_you_may_need_to_chill_baby_chill_on_lower_prices_1085017.html
Time Published: 2025-01-17T12:21:57Z
Full Content:
The energy policy of the incoming Trump administration seems as concise as it is clear: Slash domestic energy costs under the mantra, popularized in 2008 by GOP vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, of “Drill, baby, drill!” While a RealClearInvestigations canvass of energy experts suggests many of them foresee long-term benefits in that approach, it’s less clear to them that consumers will see immediate change. In other words, Trump may not deliver in 2025 on his campaign pledge to “cut energy prices in half within 12 months.” On the other hand, given expected huge increases in energy demand, a more aggressive approach to exploiting domestic resources should help keep prices steady and buttress affordability in the long run. “‘Drill, baby, drill’ is a soundbite, really, that stands for increasing domestic energy production from reliable sources, meaning located in the United States and not subject to geopolitical shocks and other disruptions,” said H. Sterling Burnett, director of climate and environmental policy at the Heartland Institute, a free market think tank long supportive of the oil and gas industries. One thing everyone agrees on is that the Trump administration is likely to continue the whipsaw of 21st-century energy policies of the United States. From Bush to Obama to Trump to Biden, and now back to Trump, the U.S. has zigzagged between the conviction that global warming threatens the planet, requiring a wrenching and expensive shift from fossil fuels, and the belief that society is better off when energy is abundant and affordable. Despite his campaign warnings of insufficient energy supplies, Trump will take office with high domestic oil and gas production. Since the new year, the price of oil has hovered around $75 a barrel, roughly equivalent to what it was a year ago and down from the more than $130 a barrel price it hit at the midpoint of President Biden’s term. It’s true that Biden’s policies limited energy exploration on federal lands and banned some liquid national gas exports, but American energy companies have refined their techniques, allowing them to tap more from existing sources. Consequently, the Trump administration will be trying to goose production at a time when environmentalists insist it is unnecessary, and with inflation still percolating it may be difficult to deliver lower prices in the near term. Trump conceded last month that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up, you know, it’s very hard,” but added: “I think that they will. I think that energy is going to bring them down.” “I will declare a national emergency to allow us to dramatically increase energy production, generation and supply,” Trump stated on the campaign trail. “Starting on Day 1, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refiners, new power plants, new reactors, and we will slash the red tape.” All of that is doable, experts said, but energy markets are nothing if not unpredictable. Even as the U.S. enjoys a relatively ample supply of energy, new warnings have emerged about the ravenous energy demands of artificial intelligence and data centers that are at the forefront of technological innovation. Moves that put the U.S. on more solid production footing are expected to benefit consumers by stabilizing prices while also leaving the nation more secure in its energy future, according to supporters of Trump’s outlook. “There are levers he can pull that will remove the disincentives to drill,” said Mark Mills, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics (NCEA). “At current prices it might not be that attractive to drill, and of course Trump wants to bring down prices so there’s a natural tension between those objectives.” Still, optimism is high among energy mavens sympathetic to Trump’s approach. As analyst Alex Epstein told commentator Jordan Peterson in a conversation made public Tuesday, “I’ve been at this 17 years now, and it’s definitely at a peak in terms of enthusiasm and opportunity in this sphere.” Biden’s departure will leave an energy sphere shifted toward renewables by design rather than free market forces. While Trump’s victory last November would seem to indicate a majority of Americans agree with his design, the Biden administration is going down swinging on its position that global warming is an existential threat, and ramping up efforts to limit oil and gas production in the U.S. Through an executive order on Jan. 6, the administration banned exploration in 625 million acres of saltwater, covering the east and west coasts, much of the Gulf of Mexico, and some stretches on the Alaskan coast. Left-wing environmental groups that cheered the sweeping move insist Trump will be unable to reverse it. Such parting shots are of a piece with Biden’s entire term, which began with a raft of executive orders designed to shut down oil and gas projects under Trump, and consistent maneuvers to limit lease sales and permits, starve the fossil-fuel industry financially, and pump hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars into various green energy schemes. Biden’s anti-oil-and-gas strategy, coupled with his gigantic spending initiatives, triggered the worst U.S. inflation in decades. Biden also deep-sixed the previously approved Keystone XL pipeline to pump oil from Canada’s tar sands to refineries on the U.S. Gulf Coast; offshore exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) has stagnated, and new liquid natural gas projects were paused. In 2024, the government held no offshore lease sales for the first time in 42 years, and in their final weeks Biden’s team offered the legal minimum of Alaskan sites for auction. “The Biden administration was at war with our industry,” said Mike Moncla, president of the Louisiana Oil & Gas Association. “Industries with expensive long-term projects like offshore exploration and LNG [Liquified Natural Gas] are looking for certainty in the marketplace.” Environmentalists made much of what they called tepid interest in the recent Alaska lease auctions. But industry executives said the low interest was more attributable to the limited nature of the auctions and the fact Biden officials chose the least attractive sites from a geological perspective. In addition, while it is true domestic production is at a record high, the total is only a fraction greater than it was in 2019 before the COVID lockdowns. Just as Biden canceled or paused oil and gas initiatives when he took office, Trump can restart them on Jan. 20 in keeping with the nation’s 21st-century energy policy zigzag. In addition, Trump is expected to again withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, and the U.S. is unlikely to remain an eager participant in the various conferences the global warming alarmists hold in farflung cities. While climate change activists have raised alarms about such moves, supporters of more gas and oil exploration note that over the past 15 years, no country has reduced its carbon dioxide emissions more than the U.S., in large part because of the transition to natural gas from coal. “The Trump administration should easily be able to just start approving LNG permits again,” said Thomas Pyle, president of the Institute for Energy Research. “The greens will likely sue based on the bogus study the Department of Energy released, but it won’t hold up to scrutiny.” In addition to disengaging from United Nations-led climate agreements, Trump could take three other moves that would indicate Washington will end its hostile stance toward fossil fuels, Burnett told RCI. Two of those would involve holding regular lease sales as required by law, and laying down specific timeframes for the conclusion of the permitting process. Third, and most significant, would be rescinding of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Obama-era “endangerment finding,” regarding greenhouse gases, according to Burnett and others. Should the EPA drop that measure, which put a heavy thumb on the scale in favor of renewable energy by labeling CO2 harmful, the oil and gas industry would prosper. There is other low-hanging fruit likely to be plucked via a “drill, baby, drill” mindset, which experts said would help signal the U.S. is committed to abundant energy now and in the future. The office of “climate czar” which was created by Biden and which has adamantly refused to break down how it spends its money could be shuttered, along with the “environmental justice” offices Biden implanted in various government agencies. While some projects like the Keystone XL pipeline appear to be dead, holding more lease sales, ungumming the permit process, and removing regulatory obstacles would all send clear signals the U.S. would be open for business for oil and gas production. In addition, federal lawyers could end litigation or decline to defend against lawsuits that might be filed against regulations pushed through during Biden’s term, according to energy experts. Trump could also replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve drawn down by Biden since 2022. Chris Wright, the executive Trump has nominated as energy secretary, is a former oil executive who participated in the fracking boom, but he has long championed policies that would increase all forms of energy, including renewables and nuclear. Similarly, his interior secretary nominee, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, is expected to slash regulations and open up more opportunities for exploration and mining on federal lands. What the Trump administration does do with energy will not be confined to oil. This month Trump announced a $20 billion foreign investment in building data centers here in the U.S., a part of the technology explosion linked to artificial intelligence and a development that will require enormous amounts of energy. The juice for such projects comes from natural gas, not oil, and green lights on LNG pipelines and facilities from the Trump administration would facilitate them. A recent report by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research organization that seeks to “reduce energy waste and combat climate change,” predicts that new data centers, manufacturing facilities, and electric vehicles will require a vast expansion of the electric grid during the next decade. “A data center can be built in 12-18 months and it needs power 24/7 so windmills aren’t going to do it,” Mills said. Yet another component of “drill, baby, drill” would be geared toward ensuring futures markets and U.S. independence, according to Mills and others. After curbing domestic oil and gas, Biden was put in the uncomfortable position of rattling the U.S. energy cup before Saudi Arabia, a regime he had been sharply critical of, and nations generally hostile to the U.S. such as Venezuela. Such foreign policy contortions would be avoided by ramping up domestic production, and it might also insulate the U.S. from “black swan” events that can send shockwaves through global energy markets. It’s unclear, for example, what will happen with supplies from Iran if Trump, as expected, ratchets up sanctions on the Tehran theocracy that Biden relaxed, or if Israel were to extend its bombing campaign against Iran and target the mullahs’ export facilities. The situation in Ukraine and relations with Russia present another factor. Of the four major pipelines Russia used to supply Europe with most of its energy, only one, that running farthest south that comes up through Bulgaria and Romania, is still active. Thus, increased domestic production and supply would cushion the U.S. from possible adverse impacts on global markets and also provide more profit and jobs via exports. “Policies of restriction are bad for consumers and our national security,” Pyle said. “The street is fickle, they saw money in ‘green’ but they’ll go wherever the money is.” Trump’s pro-industry outlook is also aligned with recent market tradewinds, which have shifted away from the “environmental, social and governance” investing that leftist groups and Wall Street firms like BlackRock had pushed. Since the end of 2023, some $14 trillion was withdrawn from such funds, and in the new year many big banks and investment companies, such as JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America have announced their departure from the “ESG” fold. Republican governors like Florida’s Ron DeSantis have also fought against left-wing investing by pulling huge state pension funds from managers that embrace those trends. “People are obviously concerned about the price at the pump and the cost of electricity, but it’s important that the government gives the industry a clear signal that the policy environment will be reframed to ultimately benefit American consumers,” said Dustin Meyer, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute. “I think there’s a lot more interest in energy exploration than there was four years ago. The new administration should mark a return to the long-established, bipartisan consensus that energy production is good for the U.S.” We're proud to make our journalism accessible to everyone, but producing high-quality investigative pieces still comes at a cost.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/17/2025 3:49:27 AM PST by AbolishCSEU Governor Kathy Hochul announced that construction is underway at Town and Country Apartments, a 256-unit affordable housing complex in Binghamton. The $94 million rehabilitation project will modernize the 22-building garden-style development, fully electrify its infrastructure, and improve energy efficiency by 20%. The project is part of Hochul’s five-year, $25 billion Housing Plan, which aims to create or preserve 100,000 affordable homes across New York State, including 10,000 with support services for vulnerable populations. The initiative complements efforts by New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR), which has financed over 1,260 affordable housing units in Broome County in the past five years. The apartments, reserved for households earning 60% or less of the area median income, will receive upgrades such as new flooring, windows, appliances, and electrical fixtures. Exterior renovations include roof replacements, concrete and asphalt repairs, updated landscaping, and environmental remediation. All units will be equipped with ENERGY STAR® appliances to promote sustainability. “This $94 million investment is preserving an important part of the Binghamton community while ensuring 256 households have an affordable, safe, and sustainable place to call home for years to come,” said HCR Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas. The development’s funding includes $70.9 million from HCR’s Multifamily Preservation Program and $16 million from the State Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. Additional support includes a $3.2 million subsidy loan from HCR’s Clean Energy Initiative and $3 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding from the city of Binghamton.

The initiative complements efforts by New York State Homes and Community Renewal (HCR), which has financed over 1,260 affordable housing units in Broome County in the past five years. The apartments, reserved for households earning 60% or less of the area median income, will receive upgrades such as new flooring, windows, appliances, and electrical fixtures. Exterior renovations include roof replacements, concrete and asphalt repairs, updated landscaping, and environmental remediation. All units will be equipped with ENERGY STAR® appliances to promote sustainability. “This $94 million investment is preserving an important part of the Binghamton community while ensuring 256 households have an affordable, safe, and sustainable place to call home for years to come,” said HCR Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas. The development’s funding includes $70.9 million from HCR’s Multifamily Preservation Program and $16 million from the State Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program. Additional support includes a $3.2 million subsidy loan from HCR’s Clean Energy Initiative and $3 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding from the city of Binghamton.

Title: Citadel Securities seeks to establish brokerage in China
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citadel-securities-seeks-to-establish-brokerage-in-china-93CH-3818583

Investing.com -- Citadel Securities, led by CEO Peng Zhao, has submitted an application to the China Securities Regulatory Commission to establish a brokerage in mainland China. The move comes as many Wall Street firms find it challenging to navigate the country's markets. The application was received by the regulator on Friday, as per the information on the regulator's website. Citadel Securities' decision to establish its own operation in China follows its unsuccessful attempt to acquire Credit Suisse's onshore business last year. In its efforts to navigate the complex regulatory environment in China, Citadel Securities had hired Tony Tang, the former China head of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., in September 2023. The US-based firm's move is somewhat unusual as many foreign financial institutions have been scaling back their operations in China. Despite this trend, Citadel Securities has been actively participating in China's A-share market from Hong Kong, where it trades cash equities, futures, options, and exchange-traded funds. The company maintains an office in Shanghai with a small team that supports its offshore China business. The new application signals an ambition to expand its presence within the mainland China market. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Citadel is trying to build its own operation in China after failing to buy Credit Suisse’s onshore business last year. It hired Tony Tang, BlackRock Inc.’s former China head, in September 2023 to navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape. The Miami-based firm, led by Chief Executive Officer Peng Zhao, is going against the grain as most foreign financial institutions have scaled back in China. Building a business from scratch in China typically takes longer than an acquisition, and gaining a license approval can take more than a year. The next step is for the CSRC to accept Citadel’s application before the regulator can review it. Citadel has been participating in China’s so-called A-share market from Hong Kong, where it trades cash equities, futures, options and exchange-traded funds. It has an office in Shanghai with a small team supporting the firm’s offshore China business. Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

Title: Zuckerberg, other moguls say they're backing off ESG and DEI but are they for real?

Time Published: 2025-01-17T10:00:55Z

'Hannity' panelists Riley Gaines, Joe Concha and Leo Terrell give their take on DEI and the Trump transition team. Over the past 18 months, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) agenda has suffered setbacks in corporate DEI programs, declining investment dollars, and the collapse of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance. In just the last month, major banks withdrew from net-zero alliances and Meta dismantled many of its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs. ESG seems to be coming unglued. But don’t be fooled. A closer look at what the banks have said reveals that they are still full of unrepentant ESG financiers. Many of the touted changes are superficial or cosmetic rather than indicative of an underlying philosophical shift. Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have been the subject of heated opinions of praise and rebuke. (Adobe Stock) Dozens of Fortune 500 companies (including McDonald's and Walmart) representing trillions of dollars of market cap and millions of employees rolled back or nixed their DEI programs in 2024. ESG-labeled investment funds hemorrhaged cash over the past two years. And the incoming administration has promised to jettison DEI in federal agencies. DEI IS LIKE A WOKE IED FOR THE LEFT’S WAR AGAINST OUR MILITARY. WE MUST DEFUSE IT The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance has fallen apart with the mass exodus of insurance companies over the past year and a half when many state attorneys general expressed concern that participating in such an alliance might violate anti-trust and anti-collusion laws. U.S. states have withdrawn billions of dollars from Blackrock due to concerns about ESG. These changes are welcome corrections to the flawed and deeply ideological goals of ESG advocates. The latest dominos to fall are large American financial institutions. Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan have all withdrawn from the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance. Even Blackrock, once a vocal advocate of ESG, withdrew from Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Though this may appear to be of a piece with other rollbacks of ESG, cynicism is warranted. If you look at the press releases from these large financial institutions, you’ll find that they are unrepentant and still intend to pursue net zero goals. For example, Goldman stated: "Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress." Citigroup was even more blunt: "we remain committed to reaching net zero." I WAS FORCED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST MY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HALT COMPELLED SPEECH, RACIST DEI Blackrock has been the most explicitly unrepentant. "[O]ur memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion… and subjected us to legal inquiries… [But this] does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios." Translation: "We just want to distance ourselves from problematic PR, but we are not changing a single thing about how we do business." The moves by these large banks seem to imitate Blackrock CEO Larry Fink’s strategy of not using the term "ESG" because it was a political hot potato, but remaining committed to "sustainability." Blackrock remains heavily invested in green infrastructure and renewable energy projects. That’s fine if their clients explicitly ask for such investments. But as American Airlines learned last week, pension fund managers have a fiduciary obligation to pursue the best financial returns for their clients and they can be held liable for using the funds they manage for other ends. NEARLY HALF OF ALL US COLLEGE STUDENTS REJECT MANDATORY DEI COURSES ON CAMPUS: STUDY While superficial progress has been made with U.S. financial institutions withdrawing from destructive global net-zero alliances, they appear insincere when it comes to truly changing their ways. This should not be surprising given that bank personnel have not changed much. Nor do we see evidence of a change of heart when it comes to ESG. Instead, they seem concerned about public pressure and criticism from the incoming federal administration and from state government officials. Withdrawing from these alliances also gives them a freer hand to signal net zero intentions without having to deliver on them by a fixed date. But if ESG policy was distracting and destructive before, it is still so now. Ideological ESG priorities detract from companies’ ability to function well and benefit their contractual stakeholders. Companies have a hard enough time being profitable without pursuing various social justice priorities. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Banks would do better to clarify their commitment to maximizing shareholder value and doing business with everyone. Pursuing long-term profit successfully benefits shareholders, workers, suppliers and customers. Most corporations, especially the unrepentant financiers, need to clean house in their human resources departments to focus on value creation rather than racial identity politics or costly virtue-signaling on environmental and social issues. And as the American Airlines case shows, companies that fail to do so may very well be violating their fiduciary duty to clients and to shareholders.

Title: US President-Elect Donald Trump Said to Plan Elevation of Cryptocurrency as a National Priority

Photo Credit: Unsplash/ Ewan Kennedy The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority and giving industry insiders a voice within his administration, according to people familiar with the plans. The order is expected to name crypto as a national imperative or priority — strategic wording intended to guide government agencies to work with the industry, according to people familiar with the matter. It is also slated to create a crypto advisory council to advocate for the industry's policy priorities, said the people who requested anonymity to discuss an executive order that is not yet public. Trump has enjoyed strong support from the crypto industry, which has a powerful presence in Washington, backed by well-funded political action committees. A slew of companies, including Coinbase and Ripple, have donated to Trump's inaugural committee in recent months. On Friday, days before the inauguration, the industry is hosting an “Inaugural Crypto Ball” in support of Trump. The executive order would mark a sea change for crypto, which has been a target for investigations during President Joe Biden's administration following a spate of high-profile fraud cases, including the bankruptcy of the FTX exchange. Federal agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission filed more than 100 enforcement actions against the sector in recent years, and banking regulators made it difficult for crypto companies to work with financial institutions. Still under discussion for inclusion in the executive order is a directive for all government agencies to review policies about digital assets and possibly pause any litigation involving crypto, the people said. Stopping legal actions that have targeted a range of companies from Binance Holdings Ltd., the world's biggest crypto exchange, to startup Ripple Labs Inc. is a top priority for the industry. Also under consideration is the creation of a national Bitcoin stockpile, which would encompass the government's existing holdings of the world's biggest cryptocurrency, the people said. The US government currently holds nearly $20 billion worth of Bitcoin, confiscated as part of various investigations, according to analytics company Arkham. Bitcoin has rallied almost 50%, to above $100,000, since the November election in part on hopes that such a stockpile would be created. The token more than doubled in price in 2024. The people cautioned that the executive order, which could come as soon as Monday, is not final and could change before it is made public. A representative for Trump did not immediately respond to a request to comment. Trump has vowed to issue a bevy of executive orders across a range of disparate industries and issues within his first few days back in office. “What I think Donald Trump is going to do is signal that the United States is back and we are ready to lead in this industry,” said Kara Calvert, vice president for US policy at Coinbase Global Inc., the country's biggest cryptocurrency exchange. “What it's signaling to other countries is be careful, or you won't keep up.” Despite regulatory setbacks under Biden, crypto in the US expanded, with major financial companies including the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock Inc., launching spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds last year. BNY has been working to expand its crypto custody effort, and Cantor Fitzgerald announced plans to launch a Bitcoin financing business. Trump embraced the crypto industry during the presidential campaign last year. In July, he headlined a Bitcoin conference, where he promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world. Trump-branded collections of nonfungible tokens have been coming out for several years, and last year he and his sons announced a crypto effort called World Liberty Financial, which is supposed to let people earn and borrow crypto, but has yet to provide those services. © 2025 Bloomberg L.P.

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Bitcoin State Of Mind: Texas Aims To Pioneer Strategic Reserve

With President Donald Trump’s inauguration just a few days away, Bitcoin and blockchain supporters are bracing for crypto-friendly policies. Leading the charge is Texas, with Senator Charles Schwertner announcing a bill to launch its first state-level Bitcoin reserve. In a Twitter/X post, Senator Schwertner announced the filing of SB 778, making Texas the first state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to the Texan legislator, creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve will position the state as a blockchain leader, drive economic growth, and secure everyone’s economic freedom. Texas is the 10th largest economy globally and has over $194 billion in general revenue that will fund the state’s operations from 2026 to 2027. In addition to its huge budget, the state has a growing Bitcoin and blockchain economy. It’s also home to several crypto mines, including the one in the city of Rockdale, which is acknowledged as the biggest Bitcoin mining operation in North America. It’s time for Texas to lead the way in establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. That’s why I filed SB 778, which, if passed and signed into law, would make Texas the first state in the nation to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. This would position our state at the… pic.twitter.com/dRdCt86Otr — Charles Schwertner (@DrSchwertner) January 15, 2025 According to Schwertner, it’s about time that Texas led the way in approving and launching a crypto reserve. In addition to the proposal to start a reserve fund, SB 778 also outlines a recommendation to set up the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Advisory Committee. This committee shall include the House chairs for Appropriations and Finance, a comptroller, a member of the Senate and the House, among others. Although the general aim of establishing the state’s crypto reserve is to leverage the blockchain and use it as a hedge against inflation, SB 778 also outlines its specific purposes. According to Section 403.703, the state aims to hold BTC as a financial asset. The document also specifies that persons, including Texans, can donate Bitcoin to advance shared ownership and a sense of community. The document also highlights specific transactions that will not be allowed. For example, Section 403.705 indicates that the comptroller cannot approve transactions to buy BTC to be held in other countries. Although some questions and risks are associated with creating a reserve, many states are pushing forward. Aside from Texas, Oklahoma has shared its plans to hold the premiere digital currency as part of its currency reserves. Representative Cody Maynard filed HB 1203, the Strategic Reserve Act, which aims to allocate a portion of the state’s pension funds to buy these digital assets. Pennsylvania lawmakers also submitted their plans to invest in Bitcoin. The state’s policymakers suggest that the state’s Treasury allocate up to 10% of the funds to buy crypto. Representative Mike Cabell says the state can follow the lead of private financial firms like Fidelity and BlackRock.

Layoffs: The United Kingdom's biggest asset manager Schroders Plc plans to layoff as much as 3 per cent of its workforce, or 200 jobs, as new Chief Executive Officer Richard Oldfield looks to revive growth, according to a Bloomberg report on January 17 citing sources. The source added that the layoffs would mostly be in technology and is one of the major changes being implemented by new CEO Oldfield, who took over from former and long-time chief Peter Harrison in November 2024, as per the report. “Our priority is to reposition the business at pace, as we transition to growth,” a spokesperson for the London-based firm said in a statement, Bloomberg added. As of June 30, the nearly 220-year-old Schroders managed around £774 billion ($947 billion) of assets. The job cuts will help it “improve delivery and ensure we are well-placed to meet our 2025 objectives, which are centered on reinforcing our active investment proposition,” the spokesperson added. Schroders' share price has sunk by around 50 per cent since its 2021 peak as it faced criticism for relatively high cost base and slower organic growth. The talk points also came amid wider woes facing traditional active fund managers as investors flock to lower-cost passive funds, the report noted. Other firms in the industry have trimmed their workforces in recent months, including Wellington Management and Manulife Financial Corp. Earlier this month, BlackRock Inc. told employees it’s cutting about 1 per cent of its over 21,000 employees. This means around 200 jobs are on the chopping block. “The cuts are part of BlackRock’s efforts to realign its resources with the firm’s strategy… As part of these firmwide efforts, we will be making changes today that will see approximately 1 per cent of our colleagues leave the firm… This is never easy,” BlackRock President Rob Kapito and COO Rob Goldstein told staff in a memo on January 8.

Today’s KevinMD article is “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Amir, welcome to the show. Amir Baluch: Hey, thanks for having me on. So I’ll start by briefly sharing my story and journey. Kevin Pho: Go right ahead. Amir Baluch: Well, it was kind of not the smoothest journey to get to where I am. So right now, I’m a semi-retired anesthesiologist and mainly focus on wealth strategies and alternative investments. But unlike most people listening to the show, I actually did not get into medical school the first time I applied. That was kind of painful. And so I decided to put my life savings in my first business, electronic payments. After about a year, that didn’t work either. So then I’m like, OK, what am I going to do? I guess I’ll move back in with my parents in Midland, Texas. My dad was an internal medicine doctor, so I figure, hey, they’ve got a spare bedroom for me. But two months later, he declared bankruptcy—clinic wasn’t doing well, some failed investments—and we actually ended up moving to a one-bedroom apartment, the whole family, and kind of started from scratch. So I was just sitting there thinking to myself: How do I prevent this, or where is the lack of financial education? I definitely didn’t get it in college or in high school. So, you know, I started learning a lot just from books and audio books as well. There weren’t really that many masterminds or anything like that. So Rich Dad Poor Dad was a book that was pretty popular around that time, like a quarter of a century ago, actually. And eventually I figured out that most people make their first million in real estate. So I started getting into real estate at the age of 21 while I reapplied. Eventually, I did get into medical school, thankfully, on the second attempt, but I kept going with those alternative investments in real estate. And eventually, when I was 25, I got into my first multifamily deal as an LP with a private REIT. In 2008, when I was a resident in Miami doing anesthesia, we did a short sale flip in Dallas. I eventually moved to Dallas in 2010–2011. I got my securities license because I love to learn. I joined a boutique investment bank. It had a broker-dealer arm and also a mergers and acquisitions arm. So I learned from them for about half a decade before I went off on my own to create Baluch Capital and help educate other physicians, so they wouldn’t end up like my family did, you know, 25 years ago, and also present some opportunities for growth and passive income. Kevin Pho: All right. So you’re an anesthesiologist, and of course, you have your focus on wealth building as well. What’s your life like between those two careers? Amir Baluch: Well, a few years ago, I went down to about doing 8 days a month of anesthesia. I took a year off to kind of formalize our company, make my brother systematize on the real estate development side, and brought in some underwriters from BlackRock, JP Morgan. Then I went back into anesthesia about 4 to 5 days a month. So, you know, every other Friday and maybe every other Tuesday, I’ll be in the OR, just picking up shifts or, you know, helping out friends if they’re on vacation—I’ll cover them. That way, I still have one foot in the game and get some free food every now and then, and don’t let my Figs scrubs go to waste that I spent so much money on, right? But most days, I’m waking up at 4 a.m. and I’m online with my team. We’re doing Zoom calls, we’re preparing for the day, and usually by 9 a.m. I’ve pretty much got a whole day’s worth of work done. The rest is pretty much the bonus round. We just work a lot on acquisition of real estate development, so we’re constantly working with underwriters and brokers and wholesalers. On the private equity side, we’re constantly in meetings with companies that we’ve already invested in. And a lot of times, I’m a strategic partner with them. So we’ve got to sit in on these quarterly meetings and help, you know, either if they need to pivot or need to scale up or wherever they are in their process. Then we also do acquisitions, buying out e-commerce stores and creating fixed income products for passive cash flow for people. So all that structuring, organization, and team building is usually the space that I live in. Kevin Pho: All right. So let’s talk about your KevinMD article, “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Tell us what this article is about for those who didn’t get a chance to read it. Amir Baluch: Well, you know, physicians are in such a unique space because they study for about 12 years, and they go into debt, which is kind of a disadvantage, but then they cash flow pretty significantly, and they usually have pretty good credit. So they have the cash flow, but they don’t have the time. So now, how can you use this to your own benefit? Well, you know what, whenever we become doctors, we kind of have a systematic approach for diagnosis and treatment, right? But a lot of times, we don’t apply that to investing. People kind of just shoot from the hip, but I think if doctors started applying that to their investments, they could actually diversify and create a systematic plan. “Hey, let me have a certain amount of private equity, a certain amount of private credit, a certain amount in real estate, a certain amount in the public stock markets,” and build a portfolio just as if they were trying to build a medical plan with somebody with multiple comorbidities. “Hey, we’ve got to treat your diabetes; we’ve got to treat your blood pressure; use this; use this.” You bring in specialists when you need them, right? You consult with other people when you get stuck. You don’t try to make a diagnosis or decide what the plan is on your own. So I think a lot of that mindset is actually embedded in the back of a doctor’s head, but sometimes they don’t use it because they’re so pressured with time, which is really their greatest asset. That’s the one that they really have to protect. So what I feel that a lot of physicians should do is, you know, if they have the strong cash flow and they can live a little bit below their means and start generating passive income, if you start focusing more on assets that create passive income instead of just focusing on net worth, you could buy your time back. For example, we’ve helped a lot of doctors just take one day off a week. Let’s say you can just take a Wednesday off, or maybe two afternoons—maybe Tuesday, Thursday afternoon. You can just work on your practice or work on something outside of medicine, like if you are going to go into real estate or you have another type of side hustle, just to kind of clear your mind. But it does help to get that extra maybe 5,000 to 10,000 dollars a month first, so you can back off a little bit and get a big perspective on what’s going on. Don’t miss out on the big picture, because when you’re working as a doctor—I don’t know how it was for you—but you’re just like, man, it’s work, work, work. It seems to never end. So I think that’s a good strategy that doctors can use to get their time back, which will help them make better investment decisions, maybe help grow their practice if they’re private practice. If you’re W-2, that’s a little bit different, but they could start building a second stream of revenue and kind of have some more control in life and also diversify from some of the pitfalls of medicine, which a lot of people don’t like to talk about, like decreasing reimbursement rates and a lot more corporate control and feeling the squeeze from these mergers. Kevin Pho: So you talk about alternative sources of income, passive sources of income. Normally, that tells me that this is real estate-based—that’s part of your background as well. So let’s say we’re a physician, or a physician is listening to you here, interested in hearing more. Tell us how they can get started. What are some examples of some of these passive income streams that you’re talking about? Amir Baluch: Well, I think that an easy one to get into is anything involving real estate, just because we’re a little bit more familiar with it. So I tried to get in with just doing a single-family rental. It’s kind of easy to get your mind wrapped around it, and it’s a business, but it’s very simple. The cash flow comes in from rent; your expenses are mainly the mortgage and maybe a little bit of upkeep. And that’s a pretty small business model but very easy to understand. And for a physician, it comes with a little bit of cash flow and some decent tax benefits. So you’re working on both offense and defense there. That’s a good place to go. The next probably would be private equity, which just means private business. So there’s public equity, like public stocks, and there’s private. It just happens that private equity has made more money than public equity every year for the last 35 years. So at some point, somebody should have some exposure to it. And physicians can team up and buy into these businesses. Even some mom-and-pop businesses, you could buy at maybe three to four times the net income of a business, which means your return is, you know, the inverse of that, which is 25 percent cash-on-cash return from day one. So imagine if you could buy into something that’s maybe medically related—maybe it’s an existing medical spa, which, you know, is a little bit medical, but maybe you might not have aesthetics involved in it. Or maybe it’s a joint venture with a pharmacy or something like that, that’s a little bit medically related but not what you’re trained to do. There’s actually good cash flow from there. And then, as they get older, it’s usually better. You know, then you’re trying to just protect what nest egg you’ve created, and you’re just looking for even more cash flow to bring your time back, and maybe something less risky. So usually private credit offers that, where it’s fixed debt against lending on a hard asset like real estate. Also, there are things like municipal bonds and corporate bonds. There are some public stocks that put off dividends, but it’s not that great. And then also just traditional fixed income products as well that you could get from either a financial advisor or even online. You could find those things where you could be a debt partner into a different type of entity. Kevin Pho: Now let’s talk about the first thing you mentioned—single-family homes. How does one get started in that? You say that it’s a simple business, but let’s say a physician, like you said, is at a time deficit, may not know a lot about real estate. How does one learn enough to have the confidence to purchase a single-family home for passive income purposes? Amir Baluch: Well, there are a couple of ways. One, if somebody wanted to partner on the money side and the lending side and have somebody else kind of manage it from a distance, you could do that. And usually there are realtors out there that specialize in it. So how I got started—I got my real estate license in 2011. I don’t think anybody needs to do that. But even then, I worked with another realtor that specialized in single-family rentals. And so you can find these people online, and there are also these real estate meetups that you’re going to find in almost any city. So networking with people that are in that space is probably the first place to go. And whenever you find somebody there, as soon as you are collaborating with them, they’re going to open up their Rolodex. They’ve got people that lend on it, they’ve got people that find the properties, they’ve got people that manage the properties, because eventually you need some type of a team. If you’re wondering who those team players are, probably the best book you could get—now, I’ve actually just bought and given away copies of this; I wish it was my book—but it’s called The Millionaire Real Estate Investor by Gary Keller. It’s like a blue and white book on Amazon, probably 10 bucks or something like that. But they show you step by step on what team members you need to make this pretty smooth. And so, you know, once you start putting your team together and pull the trigger on your first one, and you get through a year or two of that first one, you kind of know, hey, what to look for, how to hire a proper property manager. And, you know, you rarely get any phone calls. So I think that’s the first thing to do: put together your team of a realtor that knows what they’re doing, get your lender—then the lender might have some contacts for you to help get you some deals too—and then a property manager. Kevin Pho: Now, contrast that option with, say, real estate syndications, because I hear a lot of physicians who may not want to make that effort in constructing their own team and directly purchasing a property, then go into real estate syndications. So contrast those two options. Amir Baluch: That’s a good topic. So the most important thing that a lot of people don’t talk about—the most important difference—is the valuation method. Most businesses, including a multifamily syndication or any commercial real estate syndication, the whole enterprise is valued at a certain multiple of the net income. Now, in commercial real estate, though, it just happens that instead of using a multiple of the net income or the multiple of EBITDA, you basically get the inverse of that, which is cap rate. And so cap rate is your, you know, if you bought a property all cash, what is your cash-on-cash return for a year? It’s usually like 4, 5, 6 percent, something like that. So that’s how those things are valued. So if you don’t increase the net income, if you don’t increase the rents, the value of that property is not going to go up. And you get a little bit of cash flow, but that value is really not going up that much. And sometimes it can go down, even if you increase rents, which is what’s happened in the last couple of years in multifamily. Now, if you contrast that with single-family, why does the value of the house go up? Well, it’s actually not the value, but the price of the house goes up because the value of the dollar goes down, and houses are always a good hedge against inflation. So houses will adjust for inflation, and the valuation is based off comps. So if your neighbor next door sold for a million bucks, and you’re right next to them, and you have about the same square footage, you’re probably going to sell for a million bucks. And it happens that, you know, all the components to make a house—wood, steel, labor, wages—that all goes up. So, you know, the replacement cost goes up, which makes these houses more valuable over time as well. So the valuation method is a little bit different, and you have to just go in there knowing what the plan is. So on a single-family, if you just buy and hold, and the cash flow is more than your monthly payment to the bank, you’re pretty much going to be OK no matter what, as long as you don’t get huge expenses coming in or too much vacancy. In commercial real estate, the difference is you’re going to be a lot more passive, so you can sit back and not do much work, but you’ve got to be careful about the valuations going in. You need to know a little bit more about how they’re going to increase those rents. In any commercial thing, it’s all about increasing the rents and decreasing expenses. You kind of have to have a better grasp of that and not just blindly invest in that, because if it’s not managed correctly, the overall property can go down in value—or maybe just not go up in value as much—compared to a single-family rental, which is pretty much always going to go up in value because it’s just hedging against inflation, sometimes a little bit better or oftentimes, in my opinion, better than commercial real estate. Kevin Pho: Now let’s talk about the second option you mentioned, which is private equity. How do physicians dip their toes into that potential option? Amir Baluch: So this is a little bit trickier. You know, sometimes they’ve done it and didn’t even know that they’re in it. For example, a lot of my surgery buddies are partners in a surgery center—that’s technically private equity. Or maybe if somebody opened up or partnered on a coffee shop down the street or anything that’s a private business, they might be in it but not thinking that it’s private equity, but it is, just on a very small scale. A lot of times when people think private equity, they think of businesses that are, you know, 10 million, 50 million, maybe even a few billion dollars. That one, at least for me, is just a lot of networking. Luckily, because of my securities license, I was networked with a bunch of broker-dealers, and we just get deals all the time. Most of these things involve issuing securities in the private market. And so through them, I’ve gotten a lot of deal flow in at least life sciences and biotech. But if somebody wants to get into private equity, you really have to go out there and basically take action and look for it. So you could go find some business brokers. For example, let’s say I really wanted to get into a pharmacy, because as an anesthesiologist, I just liked the pharmacology, right? And maybe I just wanted a pharmacy. You could find business brokers that are selling it and get on those email lists and say, “Hey, I’m looking for this. I can get an SBA loan for about a million, so I have this much down payment. If you find somebody that’s willing to owner-finance, I could do that.” And you actually go out there and have to hunt. It’s way easier to do public equity, right? You just push a button online and buy stocks. But the downside of that is those are very efficient markets, and in an efficient market, it’s hard to get good risk-adjusted returns. In the private market, there’s a lot more inefficiencies. You have to deal with brokers, and the deals take a long time to close. It’s not like if somebody puts a Twitter post online that the valuation changes in milliseconds or anything like that. So it’s a little bit more work but a lot more stable. Over time, the data has shown it’s more profitable and higher risk-adjusted returns. Kevin Pho: Now, is there a certain type of physician personality trait who would be more amenable to these alternative investments versus just sticking with low-cost index funds? Because from what I’m hearing, not all physicians may be cut out for these alternative investments that you’re talking about. Amir Baluch: Right. I think, you know, at the end of the day, you can make it through either path. I’d say if you are going to do a set-it-and-forget-it with index funds, you’re going to have to save a lot more and have a longer timeline. Right now, I mean, these people—nobody has a crystal ball—but JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs are predicting that the next 10 years, the S&P and indices should be averaging around 3 percent, 2 to 3 percent a year returns after adjusting for inflation because of the bull run we’ve had and P/E ratios, you know, two standard deviations above where they usually are, and things like that. So if you just have a longer timeline, you could set it and forget it if you don’t want to spend the time to learn about alternatives or if you don’t have the network to find some mentors that could help guide you. Now, if somebody has more time on hand and wants to diversify—which I think diversification is really key because you can never put all your eggs in one basket, right? So if somebody wants to diversify, it is a little bit more active. Even if you end up being a limited partner in some type of alternative syndication, there’s still some active role in there. You need to do some minimal due diligence. And if anybody has questions about that, they could email me on an asset class. I’ll at least show, you know, 20 or 30 things you should look at in every asset class before you pull the trigger. But you do have to take a little bit more active role or maybe put together a small investment group where everybody is putting in their two cents and dividing up the work and pooling their money together to invest as a group. That’s another way to do it if people are constrained for time. But for sure, people that have more time, which in my experience has been anesthesiologists and emergency doctors—it’s more like shift-work-oriented—or even hospitalists that are one week on, one week off, are now really getting into alternatives and having the time to do the due diligence on these deals and increase their deal flow. Because it just depends on your time, the time involvement you want to take, and your timeline. If you can look further out and save more money, you could go with the indices route—just a little bit more risk. Kevin Pho: We’re talking to Amir Baluch. He’s an anesthesiologist. Today’s KevinMD article is “Leveraging Your Medical Career for Long-Term Wealth Building.” Amir, let’s end with some take-home messages that you want to leave with the KevinMD audience. Amir Baluch: You know, in anything you want to accomplish in life, if you work hard enough and you’re around the right people, you’re going to get it. So if being financially savvy or getting enough passive income so you can maybe just take one or two days off—not really retire early, because I think if you like your job, you should keep doing it—but, you know, you want to just find some mentors out there, read as much as you can, and hang around people who have been there, done that, that pretty much already are where you want to be. And if anybody wants any other resources, we’ll have a link for anybody watching where they can get a free copy of my book, Prosperity Prescription. It has a little bit of a blueprint on how to get that started. Or if somebody wants to book a quick 10-minute call with me—just like a clarity call, I call it—where in 10 minutes, we kind of find out what the next step would be for them. Those two options will be available somewhere on a link, either on my website or somewhere after this podcast. Kevin Pho: Amir, thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight.

Samara Cohen, the firm's ETF and index instruments chief investment officer, thinks cryptocurrency deregulation will "absolutely" propel bitcoin to another historic year. "There will be progress made on… FIT21 ["Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act.] There will be progress made on stable coins. There will be progress made just on definitions in taxonomy," she told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week. Cohen is behind the firm's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) – which is up 114% since its January 2024 debut and up almost 8% year to date. It comes as bitcoin briefly traded above $100,000 this week. Despite the strong performance, she suggests cryptocurrency investors need an iron stomach. "Bitcoin is a risky asset. So, 15% in the context of Bitcoin is not an enormous move. Investors should expect volatility," said Cohen. "But in the long term, the price of bitcoin is really going to be determined by the level and pace of adoption." On Monday, BlackRock announced the official launch of its iShares Bitcoin ETF on CBOE Canada. And, it's not the only firm making an early year push deeper into cryptocurrency. Calamos Investments plans to launch its Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF next Wednesday – two days after Trump's inauguration. According to the press release, it's the "world's first 100% downside protected bitcoin ETF." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Research released by New York Digital Investment Group shows that in Q4 2024, Bitcoin broke away from major assets following the election of Donald Trump in November—but it could still move back in line with them. Bitcoin has often moved in line with U.S. equities—particularly tech stocks—as it is considered by many to be a “risk-on” asset. It has also typically done well in a low-interest rate environment. Bitcoin ETFs registered $16.5B of net inflows, but the lion’s share of flows is going to BlackRock and Fidelity while some ETFs registered outflows during the quarter. pic.twitter.com/Z1Kz1Z7GkW — NYDIG (@NYDIG) January 13, 2025 “With Bitcoin increasingly owned by traditional market investors, it’s natural to expect correlations to change,” the NYDIG report read, referring to the new Bitcoin ETFs trading on stock exchanges. “Still, the promise of a non-sovereign issued store of value is an appealing investment in the current geopolitical climate, one that should not be driven by the same macroeconomic levers of say the U.S. stock market,” it added. Bitcoin surged to new highs after President-elect Trump’s November 5 victory. The incoming leader campaigned on a promise to slash regulation and help the digital asset industry, and NYDIG credits Trump's win as the "main driver" for Bitcoin's surge. By December 17, the biggest digital coin had hit a new all-time of $108,135, CoinGecko data shows. It has since retreated and is now trading for $99,600. Earlier this week, it briefly dipped below the $90,000 mark before a resurgence back above $100,000. NYDIG added in its research that Bitcoin outperformed all asset classes by a wide margin in 2024, rising by more than 47% in the final quarter, and by nearly 120% from January to the end of the year. The biggest cryptocurrency has in the past moved both with the stock market and gold. Is it slowly becoming an asset class of its own?
