Title: China's Vice Premier lunches with Dimon, Schwarzman and other Davos financiers

By Julie Zhu and Elisa Martinuzzi DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang met with global finance and business leaders including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) CEO Steve Schwarzman, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon during a private lunch in Davos on Tuesday. The lunch, hosted by World Economic Forum (WEF) founder Klaus Schwab, was also attended by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) CEO Larry Fink, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) CEO Bill Winters and Visa (NYSE:V) CEO Ryan Mclnerney. Several Chinese government officials who are part of the country's delegation in Switzerland were also present at the event. U.S. financial firms have been keen to maintain good relations with Beijing, even as Chinese growth has waned. "All the indicators are positive, but the market is waiting to see how much conviction there is and how much follows through," an executive who attended the meeting told Reuters. "There was a determination to complete all the transformations that they (the Chinese) set out," said the executive, adding the key goals for Beijing include stabilizing the property market and stimulating the domestic demand. Chinese policymakers are intensifying efforts to stimulate a faltering economy in the face of concerns over potential U.S. tariff hikes following President Donald Trump's inauguration. Trump unexpectedly held off from imposing tariffs on China on his first day back in the White House. Ding on Tuesday welcomed more investment by foreign companies in the country, adding that China was willing to solve problems encountered by domestic and foreign firms. He is the second-highest-ranking Chinese official to rub shoulders with global business and political leaders at the Davos summit since President Xi Jinping attended in 2017.

Title: USDC Stablecoin Issuer Circle Acquires Hashnote, a $1.3B Tokenized RWA Firm

Circle, the crypto company behind the $48 billion USDC stablecoin, said Tuesday it has acquired tokenized real-world asset (RWA) issuer Hashnote. The companies closed the deal this morning, a Circle spokesperson told CoinDesk and was announced in Davos, Switzerland during the annual World Economic Forum meeting. The companies didn't reveal pricing details. Circle aims to integrate USYC with USDC, Circle’s flagship stablecoin, enabling convertibility between cash and yield-bearing collateral on blockchains, the press release said. Hashnote issues the $1.3 billion USYC token, which saw massive growth last year to become the largest tokenized U.S. Treasury product on the market, according to rwa.xyz data. Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, said this marks a significant step toward aligning traditional financial structures with the speed and transparency of blockchain-based markets. "This is a huge unlock for a market that is increasingly being driven by institutional adoption, and where participants increasingly expect market structures that are common in TradFi,” Allaire said. Circle shared plans a year ago to go public, and the crypto industry widely expects the public share offering to happen later this year. The acquisition underscores the synergies between two of the hottest trends in crypto: stablecoins and tokenization. Circle's main stablecoin competitor Tether launched a tokenization platform last year. Stablecoins, a $200 billion asset class of cryptocurrencies with prices pegged predominantly to the U.S. dollar, are a crucial piece of infrastructure in tokenization efforts. They are used as a bridge between fiat money and digital assets and widely used for settling transactions on blockchain rails. Tokenized RWAs like treasury bills and money market funds are quickly gaining traction among sophisticated investors and asset managers as collateral for trading. Unlike in traditional markets, blockchain-based assets promise transparency, accessibility and around-the-clock settlements. Treasury-backed tokens also allow investors to earn a yield while posted as collateral or margin for trades, enhancing returns compared to trades collateralized with fiat money or stablecoins. For example, Singapore-based hedge fund QCP Capital earlier in January executed a bitcoin (BTC) basis trade using BUIDL, the money market fund token issued by BlackRock and Securitize. Circle also announced that it struck a deal with Cumberland, a DRW-affiliated crypto trading firm and market maker, to provide liquidity and facilitate settlements for USDC and USYC. The partnership aims to expand USYC as a form of collateral on exchanges and custodial platforms. Additionally, Circle laid out plans to deploy USDC on the Canton Network, a blockchain used by traditional financial institutions for real-world asset transactions. The integration with Canton would allow for constant liquidity between cash and collateral and allows seamless transfers between decentralized and traditional markets.

Title: TikTok bounces back after ban, is it here to stay?

Every Wednesday and Friday, TechNode’s Briefing newsletter delivers a roundup of the most important news in China tech, straight to your inbox. On the second day after the ban, and the day before the new president’s inauguration, TikTok became accessible to users again, having effectively been shut down for just 14 hours. The fiasco leaves one big question: will TikTok stay for good? Why it matters: TikTok’s return to operation after its ban, though brief, raises larger questions about its future in the US. As one of the world’s most popular apps, TikTok’s business model, its relationship with global users, and its ownership structure have come under intense scrutiny. The app’s survival hinges on a combination of political maneuvering, legal challenges, and complex dynamics between US and Chinese interests. The app has become a focal point of broader geopolitical tensions, leaving its future anything but assured. Details: After being shut down for about 14 hours, TikTok was revived on Sunday and thanked Trump for assuring TikTok and its business partners that they would not face hefty fines for keeping the app running. The app began operating again on Monday, but TikTok was still unavailable for download in the Apple and Google app stores. Trump also stated on social media platform X that he would sign an order to “save” the software. So, what does saving TikTok entail? Context: The TikTok ban debate in the US stems from national security concerns, driven by allegations that the app could potentially allow the Chinese government to access US user data. In response, then-President Trump signed executive orders aimed at banning the app unless it was sold to a US company. At the beginning of his second term, he made an about-turn to become a proponent of keeping the app, positioning himself as the only person with the potential to put into effect meaningful change.

Title: Thoughts on Thomas Crooks and the Butler Shooting (After the new Tucker Carlson-Sean Davis Interview) - Is "Professor Raoul X" a government subcontractor?

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/21/2025 7:12:16 AM PST by MtnClimber I highly recommend that you take the time to listen to the Tucker Carlson interview with Sean Davis, six months after the near-assassination of Donald Trump. The entire hour and a half is well worth your time, but at least watch the first 15 minutes. Half a year after Butler, there is still a thick blanket of secrecy surrounding Thomas Matthew Crooks. Who was he? What was his motivation? Was he a lone wolf, part of a group, or did he have help? Davis breaks this question into four options: Option 1: Butler was a “total SNAFU.” An amazing combination of Secret Service incompetence, and an incredible series of oversights, accidents and coincidences allowed Crooks to access the roof unseen and fire eight shots at candidate Trump. Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof!

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson I highly recommend that you take the time to listen to the Tucker Carlson interview with Sean Davis, six months after the near-assassination of Donald Trump. The entire hour and a half is well worth your time, but at least watch the first 15 minutes. Half a year after Butler, there is still a thick blanket of secrecy surrounding Thomas Matthew Crooks. Who was he? What was his motivation? Was he a lone wolf, part of a group, or did he have help? Davis breaks this question into four options: Option 1: Butler was a “total SNAFU.” An amazing combination of Secret Service incompetence, and an incredible series of oversights, accidents and coincidences allowed Crooks to access the roof unseen and fire eight shots at candidate Trump. Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Davis breaks this question into four options: Option 1: Butler was a “total SNAFU.” An amazing combination of Secret Service incompetence, and an incredible series of oversights, accidents and coincidences allowed Crooks to access the roof unseen and fire eight shots at candidate Trump. Option 2: “Strategic Incompetence.” The “soup sandwich” Secret Service, under the Mayorkas DHS, deliberately made Trump vulnerable by starving his protection detail of assets and competent agents, on the off chance that some random shooter might take advantage of the weakened security and solve the deep state’s problem for them. (Please note that Strategic Incompetence can also describe California firefighting, our open southern border, and many other areas of deliberate government inattention.) Option 3: All of #2, (Strategic Incompetence), but Thomas Crooks also had a guide to nudge him into action and help him along the way. Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape!

Somebody who was looking for “super disturbed impressionable young men to poke with a stick.” Option 4: The government just plain tried to murder Trump in Butler, and failed. Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson Sean Davis rules out 1 and 4, and believes that the answer lies between 2 and 3. Strategic Incompetence plus “guides” (my term) to nudge likely assassins into action. I agree with Davis, but I lean further than he does into Option 3. The government will not conduct an assassination on U.S. territory directly. It’s much too politically risky. Instead they will wink and nod toward their countless murky gray-area assets in the “former” and “contract” areas of government service. Nothing of a criminal nature is ever written down, or transmitted electronically. All such communications are made face to face, and couched in deniable terms, moving down the contact ladder into the black-ops underworld. So how do I believe Crooks was initially discovered and brought to the point of climbing onto the roof in Butler PA with an AR-15? Start with the Blackrock advertisement. I don’t believe it’s just another amazing coincidence that Crooks was one of the high school students featured in their ad before he took up the new hobbies of bomb making and political assassination. A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs?

Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape!

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A television production team would have spent at least a week at a school to create that ad. They are going to interview dozens of students to select the ones to include. Somebody in the production team spent time speaking with Thomas Crooks before choosing him for one of the few closeup shots. It’s standard practice in the intel world for “talent spotters” to be on the lookout for useful contacts, potential agents, or even screwball patsies. These names are passed along to their intel world contacts. I think this is where Crooks came to the attention, eventually, of bad actors who over a period of months steered him to Butler. The next item that most casual observers likely glossed over was Crooks’ membership in the Clairton Sportsman’s Club. This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape! No one was fired in these debacles! 20 posted on 01/21/2025 7:50:16 AM PST by The_Media_never_lie ( @whoisourPresident) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61-78 next last Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

This is not some generic small- or medium-size “square range” under the close observation and tight control of range masters. The bad actors studying Crooks would have known of his membership at this large, rural shooting club, and it would have been simple to arrange a “chance meeting,” or, in the vernacular, a “bump” between Crooks and his future guide. From their website: The Clairton Sportsmen's Club occupies 180 acres of picturesque woodland in the southern hills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The club, situated in the boroughs of West Mifflin and Jefferson Hills within Allegheny County, boasts a membership exceeding 2000 individuals. Facilities include: Indoor and outdoor archery ranges, Rifle range to 200 yards, CMP competition rifle ranges offer target carriers up to 300 yards, 6 action piston bays, 3 pistol ranges, 2 dog training areas, 3 lighted skeet fields, Wobble trap, 10 lighted trap fields. From my previous Substack column:Note the many widely spread out shooting venues, the roofed shooting positions, all surrounded and separated by woods. If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2.

If you zoom in on Google satellite view, you will see many picnic tables and other locations for private conversations, where laying out gear would be totally unremarkable. The shooting club would provide ample “cover for action” in the spook vernacular. This club would be an ideal place for Crooks to be guided and trained in the physical in-real-life dark arts, not merely the virtual ones to be found on the internet by his inquisitive mind. My working hypothesis is that a "talent spotter" met Crooks during the Blackrock commercial filming, and then a "Professor Raoul X" was guided to him. It would be child's play for a "sympathetic older gentlemen" to frequently meet Crooks at the club, not only for firearms practice, but for clandestine ops tradecraft education in general. These would include covert communications, manufacturing explosives, remote control detonation, flying drones etc. Untold hours over weeks and months could be spent in private at any of the numerous picnic tables or covered shooting areas going over Crooks’ operational gear, practicing with tactical radios, drones, etc. It’s notable that Crooks bought dozens of firearm-related and other operational gear over the internet using false names, concealed by VPNs, etc. Did he have help in learning this real-world operational security? It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs? It can’t be ruled out that Crooks planned to escape, using the IEDs as diversions....SNIP TOPICS: Society KEYWORDS: banglist; butler; crooks; deepstate; matthewbracken; maxwellyearick; professorraoulx; thomasmatthewcrooks; trump; tucker Hey!

Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape!

It seems likely to me. This sympathetic “friend” would also stoke Crooks' hatred for Donald Trump, and finally could give him tips about the Butler PA rally site. (All while the USSS experienced a bizarre series of "coincidental" security lapses.) But Crooks was killed by a counter-sniper—after being permitted to get off eight shots, missing Trump’s head by a whisker—so we will never find out about a possible deep state handler from his own mouth. It was shut permanently. According to Sean Davis in the interview, Crooks even stopped by the shooting club on the day of the assassination attempt. For a final meeting with his guide? Or a chance to pick up previously cached items, such as his IEDs?

Three out of a hundred factoids that are very strange about this: 1) the FBI told the family to cremate the body right after the shooting; 2) Heritage Foundation found clicks on his cell phone to a location near the FBI DC Headquarters; 3) it took the police five hours to identify him and get to his parents house where he lived; two hours before, CNN had called his father to tell him of the murder. the house was squeaky clean when the police arrived two hours later. I think this is part of the reason Trump hit the ground running with EOs and Cabinet appointments... he knows he's going to be in danger the whole four years. He's got to get stuff done as fast as possible. Hopefully Trump will get to the bottom of this. Speaking of this, hopefully he already fired the acting director of the secret service. “The government will not commit an assination on U.S. territory”. = what color is the sky in your world? I’m going with Option #4. Government ‘groomed’ him to become highly agitated and against Trump. Provided him with all the right triggers, and then sat back and allowed whatever to happen. That is what I think is most likely too. It should be investigated as an option 4. Let the government prove it wasn’t. Didn’t corrupt Joe Biden say in the early summer and with a twinkle in his eye, that he didn’t know if Trump would be able to overcome the challenge he faced? What struck me from the interview: Crook had a remote detonator to detonate the explosives in his vehicle So he planned to make a melee after the assassination. Most likely part of a getaway plan The detonators were turned off at the car. Someone turned them off. His handlers/manipulators were on site at Butler at the assassinations attempt. 1. Government SOP is to hide information from the public. 2. Government takes a long time to sort things out, for a variety of reasons, some of them legitimate. But is the overall slow-walking necessary, or part of managing public perceptions and emotions? 3. Government secrecy and manipulation of public perceptions and emotions stimulates conspiracy theories and distrust. Q: Does the government consider public turmoil and confusion a bug or a feature? 1. Government SOP is to hide information from the public. 2. Government takes a long time to sort things out, for a variety of reasons, some of them legitimate.

His handlers/manipulators were on site at Butler at the assassinations attempt. Great Article, thank you. This is an amazing interview. Tucker interviews with such clarity! Two very important aspects Tucker may have overlooked and not mentioned: 1. Crooks was spotted by the crowd for about 1.5 minutes by people in the crowd who pointed out there is a man with a gun on the roof! DURING THIS TIME THE SECRET SERVICE DID NOT REMOVE TRUMP FROM THE PODIUM, ALLOWING TRUMP TO ALMOST BE KILLED, A MAN TO BE MURDERED AND TWO TO BE SERIOUSLY INJURED. 2. The second potential assassin, Routh, was spotted by a SS agent who fired 10 shots at the fleeing criminal. All 10 shots missed! Routh critically injured a 6 year old girl while trying to escape! No one was fired in these debacles!

Title: TikTok app unavailable on Apple, Google stores in US despite Trump delaying ban

Business TikTok app with the message "Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now" are seen in this illustration taken, January 19, 2025. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration TikTok remained unavailable on Apple and Google app stores in the U.S. on Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of a ban on the popular Chinese-owned short-video app by 75 days. The order came amid growing doubts on the future of the app that went dark on Saturday, shortly before a law that cited national security to say the Chinese owner ByteDance should sell it or face a ban in the U.S. came into effect on Sunday. Although TikTok resumed service after Trump's assurances that the company and its partners would not face hefty fines to keep the app running, it was yet to return to the app stores. The delay, analysts doubted, could be because Google and Apple are awaiting additional protections before bypassing the ban that punishes the companies for hosting or distributing the app. Apple's App Store said, "TikTok and other ByteDance apps are not available in the country or region you're in", while Google Play said, "Downloads for this app are paused due to current US legal requirements". Google, Apple and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. Bill Ford, CEO of TikTok investor General Atlantic, told CNBC on Tuesday there are ways to change TikTok U.S. ownership, that do not necessarily involve its sale. "I don't think that necessarily has to mean a divestiture," he said, referring to the law that bans TikTok, adding that 60 per cent of TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, was controlled by non- Chinese shareholders. ByteDance is nearly 60 per cent owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20 per cent each.

Title: Rare 'planet parade' event to light up Irish skies tonight - here's how to spot them

Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. A RARE PLANETARY event which involves the alignment of six planets in a row in our solar system will be visible to the naked eye in Irish skies tonight, astronomers have said. The celestial event, also known as a ‘Planet Parade’ or the ‘great planetary alignment’, will see the sky scattered with a number of visible planets – including Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus and Neptune will also be visible through a telescope. Resident astronomer for the Blackrock Castle Observatory in Cork Danielle Wilcox told RTÉ Radio’s News at One that the planets may be visible for an “entire month” in Irish skies. “We are very lucky – we’ll have the planets in the sky basically throughout the month of February,” Wilcox said. Most people in the Northern Hemisphere will be able to see the planets for the next four weeks. “It’s really nice to have the planets in the sky, we don’t always have so many at one time, Wilcox said. “This evening, will have four of the planets visible without a telescope or binoculars – you’ll have Saturn, Venus, Jupiter and Mars all across the sky.” Advertisement Astronomer Danielle Wilcox told RTÉ Radio that the stars will be visible from late this afternoon. “You don’t need to be out super late to see them, you can go out just after sunset and you’ll be able to see four planets without any sort of equipment,” Wilcox said. Planet-gazers are advised to look to the south, where four of the planets will progressively appear. Venus will be the first planet visible, and will be the “brightest object in the sky” after the sun and moon. “Just as the sun is setting down, one of the planets you’ll be able to spot quickly will be Venus. It will be so incredibly bright, you’ll see that one before the stars even come out,” Wilcox explained. “Following this, Saturn will appear right next to Venus in a south-west direction. Then if you turn towards the south and look slightly south-east, you’ll see Jupiter, and further east, you’ll see Mars. Once they are all visible, the planets will stretch across the southern sky from west to east”. Wilcox added that those with telescopes at home should also be able to spot two other planets, Uranus and Neptune. “They’re a bit farther out as they’re the edge of the solar system, so they will not be visible to the naked eye, but if you have a good telescope, you can look in the same direction to see them,” Wilcox said. “They’ll be in the same line as the rest of the planets, but you do need to have a bit of experience with the telescope to be able to spot those two,” she added. Wilcox went on to explain that the final planet in the solar system, Mercury (sorry Pluto) may also be visible on “particularly clear evenings”. “We’ll hopefully get some good skies towards the end of February, because Mercury will be popping up above the horizon as well, which will give you an additional planet in the sky. It looks like around the 27th will be the best time to see Mercury,” she said. Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

January 21, 2025 8:00am by Barry Ritholtz ﻿﻿ The transcript from this week’s, MiB: Jonathan Clements on Why Dying is Hard Work, is below. You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, and Bloomberg. All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here. ~~~ This is Masters in business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio Barry Ritholtz: This week on the podcast. Boy, what an extra special guest I have. Jonathan Clements was the personal finance columnist at the Wall Street Journal for nearly 25 years. He wrote over a thousand columns. He also worked as director of financial Education at, at Citigroup. Jonathan kind of famously announced that he was diagnosed with terminal cancer on his website as well as social media. And that started this cascade of not just an outpouring of affection and and appreciation for his work, but just a dialogue about how we all should be thinking about our lives, our money, and our life satisfaction. I’ve been a reader of his for, for Forever, and it was really a privilege to have him come into the studios and with no hesitancy, discuss what many people find to be difficult subjects with just tremendous grace and, and insight and dignity. And I, I found it to be an absolutely fascinating conversation. And I think you will also, if you are at all curious about estate planning or investing or personal finance, this is not the usual discussion and I think it’s very worthwhile for you to hear this and share it with friends and family. With no further ado my discussion with Jonathan Clements. Jonathan Clements: Barry, it’s, it’s great to see you again, and it’s great to be on your podcast. Barry Ritholtz: Well, well thank you so much. I’m, I’m glad we have the opportunity to do this before we start talking about the serious heavy stuff. Let, let’s get a little background for you. You, you grow up in, in London, you graduate Cambridge and you start at Euro Money Magazine in, in London. What were you studying at, at Cambridge? What was your original career plan? Jonathan Clements: So, from a relatively early age, I actually thought about being a financial journalist. ’cause my father had been a financial journalist. He spent 10 years in journalism in London. He worked for The Daily Telegraph, he was city editor for the Glasgow Herald. His first job out of college was at the Financial Times, in fact. Wow. And this’ll, this’ll blow your mind. Barry, my father graduated from Cambridge in 1956. He decided he was gonna take the highest paying job he was offered and the highest paying job he was offered. The second highest paying job he was offered at 700 pounds a year was as a management trainee for Shell Oil. The highest paying job he was offered at 800 pounds a year was as a cub reporter for the Financial Times. Wow. Can you imagine a world where the highest paying job you get offered outta college is a job in journalism that, Barry Ritholtz: That’s amazing. Journalism today has, you know, technology has changed it so much that’s really hard to fathom, although you and I not far apart in age, grew up in an era where media was very specific and thought of as a genuine career. I don’t think even at the journalism schools, people are approaching it the same way. What’s your thoughts on the state of journalism in the modern world? Jonathan Clements: Well, if you said to me, you know, what advice would I give to somebody who wanted to go into journalism, my answer would be, don’t I really feel like I was the last generation that got into journalism and made a career out of it and made a living wage. But anyway, going back to your, your question. Yeah. Financial journalism was always on my radar screen. And even before I went to Cambridge, I actually spent eight months working for a little suburban newspaper outside of Washington DC and in many ways it was the most fun and the most educational experience I had in journalism. I worked for this, you know, rinky dink little paper that came out every other week. The circulation was 25,000. But as a 19-year-old, I was able to not only get involved in writing stories, but also I was involved in the pay stop of the paper for people who remember what pay stop was. I even went on advertising calls with the advertising director. It was so much fun and I learned so much. Barry Ritholtz: So you are from the uk but you’ve spent a lot of time in the us. Where, where did you grow up? Jonathan Clements: Both places. I was born in London and when I was three and a half, my father got a job for the World Bank in Washington DC So we all moved to Washington DC Then just before my 10th birthday, my father was posted to Bangladesh for four years. So my mother and father and my sister went to live full-time in Bangladesh and my two brothers and I got packed off to boarding school in England, which explains everything. You know, we’d go out there during vacations. Four years later, my parents moved back to DC but with my parents’ encouragement, I stayed on a boarding school in England, went to Cambridge, worked there for a year, and then after a year as a journalist in London, I realized the standard living for reporters in England seriously sucked. And that’s when I decided to move to New York City and I joined Forbes Magazine as a glorified fact checker and immediately doubled my salary moving from London. Barry Ritholtz: Well didn’t you also double your cost? New York back then was still in the nineties. New York was really an expensive place to live. Jonathan Clements: London is also a really expensive place to live. And in any case, at the time I was actually living out in Princeton with my graduate student wife. Barry Ritholtz: You go from Forbes pretty much during the golden era of, of mutual funds and star managers like the eighties and nineties, that was Peak mutual fund. What was that like looking at it as the data was becoming clearer that, hey, this may not be the best deal for investors? Jonathan Clements: Yeah, when I was at Forbes after this initial spell as a fact checker, I was given the mutual funds beat and the core article as the mutual funds reporter for Forbes Magazine. And subsequently, when I covered mutual funds for the journal, was the star manager profile. And it was very formulaic. You, you went and you interviewed some star manager, usually a man, and you would have a couple paragraphs about their investment philosophy and strategy. You would offer three of their stock picks where they were probably touting stocks they wanted to unload from their portfolio. And the managers you selected were all based on past performance. And one of the things I started to realize in those years was these star managers, well, their stars started to flame out pretty quickly. And this of course was the experience of many investors across, you know, the us And that was in many ways, you know, the, the seeds of the, the index fund revolution. The people bought these star managers, you know, one after another, the managers started to flame out, they bought new star managers, they ended up with these portfolios that were just a hodgepodge of ex star fund managers. And that really set us up for the boom in indexing in the late 1990s and into the two thousands. Barry Ritholtz: The the funny thing is, the behavioral aspect of mutual funds seems to have been when people finally learn about a manager who’s put up great numbers, by the time it makes to make makes it to Forbes, hey, most of that run is probably over and a little mean reversion is about to kick in. That experience led you to becoming the index guy. Tell us a little bit what it was like being an index guy at a time when it wasn’t as popular or well thought of as it is today. Jonathan Clements: So in 1994, at the lofty age of 31, the journal gave me my own column, which in retrospect is absurd. A 31-year-old their own, Barry Ritholtz: It seemed to have worked out well for them though, to be fair. Yeah, right. Jonathan Clements: But I’m not sure I would give a 31-year-old that that chance, but okay. But yes, I was given my own column and by that point, having seen all these star managers come and go, you know, I had become an index fund devotee, and in column after column I banged the drum for index funds to the point where my editors were asking me, Hey, could you write about something else? But the numbers you can’t argue with, I mean, we all know that the brutal math of investing before costs investors collectively will earn the market return after costs. They will earn that market return less, whatever they’re paying. If you can just match the market’s return minus some tiny amount for an index funds expenses, you are gonna outperform the vast majority investors. And that annual advantage snowballs over time until probably the early two thousands, that message didn’t resonate as widely, in part because index funds were the preserve of Van, got a couple of other, you know, fund companies, but then these ETFs came along, these exchange traded index funds, and at that point, any financial advisor, any broker could sell index funds to their clients. And it was really the ETF revolution that took indexing and turned it into a national phenomenon that now it surpasses the amount of money inactively managed funds. 00:09:30 [Speaker Changed] So that’s an interesting thesis. I I know ETFs are really significant to the adoption of, of indexing, but SP Y’s been around for, seems like forever. It certainly was around in the nineties. What was it about the two thousands specifically? Was it just the variety of choice? Why do you think ETFs kicked off so much a, a attraction to, to indexing, especially considering the bulk of those monies that flowed to BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street? 00:10:05 [Speaker Changed] Well, so you’re right, you know, Spyders, SPY was came out I believe in 1993, but it was just the s and p 500 and it was just that single fund, the exchange traded index funds really did take off thanks to what was then Barclay’s now part of BlackRock with the iShare series. And suddenly you could buy index funds that cover all of the major asset classes. And you, because they were stocks that traded on the, the market, you didn’t have to have an agreement with Vanguard or with Fidelity in order to sell those funds. You just needed a brokerage account. And suddenly every broker, every financial advisor where they were operating through Merrill Lynch or Schwab could sell those funds and indexing was available to, all prior to that, there were a lot of brokers who would never have sold an index fund because they didn’t have access to Vanguard’s platform. 00:10:57 [Speaker Changed] So let me push back a little bit on that. My experience has been that the brokerage side, at least up until recently, was much more interested in the value add. And I’m, I’m making air quotes for listeners of stock selection, fund selection, manager selection, and they seem to have been less keen on passive or indexing. Whereas the RIA side of the street, the independent advisor that, or the certified planner, they seem to be more focused on, let’s get a plan, let’s figure out what your objectives are and the market will take care of itself. How, how do you see that that shift? I, I’ve watched that over decades. You, you were in the thick of it. I’m curious as to what you witnessed. 00:11:44 [Speaker Changed] So you’re right. I mean, these sort of traditional brokers were much slower to adopt ETFs than, you know, fee only financial advisors. But today, you know, a lot of brokers, you know, whether they’re with the big full service brokerage firms now have advisory accounts that they flog to clients where they can buy ETFs. And as long as they’re getting their fee, whatever it’s, you know, one, one and a half percent, whatever know amount it is, you know, they now have an incentive to sell those ETFs. And remember, if you’re an advisor and you’re selling ETFs, I mean, there’s no reason to ever say sorry. Right. That’s 00:12:21 [Speaker Changed] Right. 00:12:21 [Speaker Changed] You get the markets return. Surprise, surprise. 00:12:24 [Speaker Changed] Well, if you tilt it all towards international or emerging markets or value, there are occasional apologies along the way. Hey, but that’s the, what’s the old joke? The cost of diversification is frequently having to apologize for something that’s not keeping up with s and p. 00:12:41 [Speaker Changed] If nothing in your portfolio is performing badly, you’re not diversified. That’s 00:12:44 [Speaker Changed] Right. That’s exactly right. So, so you said something interesting that jogged something in my mind that you were constantly flogging passive indexing and ETFs, much to the chagrin of your editors. Kind of makes me think of something Jason Zweig has said, which is his job is to write the same column over and over again, but in a way that neither his editors nor the readers, no. What are, what are your thoughts on repeating yourself over and over again, but in new and interesting ways? 00:13:15 [Speaker Changed] So Jason was the next employee hired by Forbes after me. Oh, 00:13:20 [Speaker Changed] That’s hilarious. 00:13:21 [Speaker Changed] And when I left Forbes, Jason ended up with the mutual funds beat, then he went on to Money Magazine. And then when I left the journal for the first time in 2008, they said, well, who should we hire to replace you? I said, Jason’s wife. So Jason and I have known each other for over 30 years. I, he, I consider him to be one of my best friends. And in fact, you know, through my recent diagnosis, he’s been a, a super supportive, you know, we’ve remain great friends after all these years, and I’m a huge admirer of his work for the Journal and elsewhere. So yes, Jason has the same joke that I do, which is, you know, there are only 20 personal finance stories, which means that by the time I left the journal and writing a thousand columns, I’ve written each of those stories 50 times each. 00:14:06 You know, if you are going to serve your readers well, you know, there are only a limited number of stories to be written. You know, if you’re a reporter who spends their career writing the stock of the day, the fun of the month, just flogging one thing after another, trying to predict the market’s direction, you’ll be plenty busy, but your readership will be a whole lot poorer. So if you wanna do the right thing, you’re basically gonna have to have a set of sound principles and focus on them again and again. And one of the things you discover is that you sta start to sound like a repetitive blathering idiot. And that’s when for me, and I think also for Jason, you start casting around for other things to write about. So when I go back to the late 1980s and I started as a financial journalist, the sole topic was investing. 00:14:51 It was all about which fund to buy, which stock to buy. Fortunately, over time, the field that is personal finance has expanded. So today, if you are a good financial journalist, you should be writing not just about investing, but about topics like, you know, when to claim social security, what should you have in your estate plan, you know, what sort of house should you be buying? And then beyond that, writing about things like behavioral finance, thinking about things like money and happiness, the topic that we call financial journalism is expended enormously over the past three plus decades. And that’s good news for somebody like me, because if I’d still writing only about index funds, I would’ve been out of a job a long time ago. 00:15:33 [Speaker Changed] Really, really interesting. So, so the 20 years you spent at the Journal really is a fascinating couple of decades. You, you wrote at the journal through the.com implosion as well as the whole runup to 2000 September 11th, the great financial Crisis. What era of finance did you find the most intriguing as a journalist? 00:15:58 [Speaker Changed] I know this probably sounds like an a I’m an ambulance chaser, but you know what, the periods that I enjoyed the most was when the stock market was going down. 00:16:07 [Speaker Changed] I’m, I totally agree with you. I am, I, I have been warned repeatedly, Hey, people are getting, you know, really hurt out there. Can you, can you stop whistling into the office like that? But that’s when the most amount of fascinating things happen and the most amount of opportunities present themselves. Which leads me to my next question, right into the teeth of the financial crisis. You went 95% into stocks. Tell us a little bit about why you did that, which turned out to be the right call, and how you shared that information with your readers. 00:16:42 [Speaker Changed] Coming into sort of late 2008, I think, if I recall correctly, I was somewhere between 70 and 80% stocks by that point. I’d left the journal and I was working at Citi Groupers, director of financial education for the wealth management business. And a, a number of things happened. One was I was working at Wall Street, so I was earning a whole lot more money. Two, I got my first Wall Street bonus three, I sold another book, which meant I got a big advance. And four, tragically my father was killed during this period, and I inherited money from him. And I took every one of those dollars and put them into the stock market. And it was a time when the sequence of returns, that combination of what’s going on in the market and whether you’re pulling out money from your portfolio, putting it in work like magic, and said to people numerous times when we have a period like 2008, 2009, when everybody thinks the world is going to hell in a hand basket, well, if it really does go to hell, doesn’t matter what you own. Right? 00:17:41 [Speaker Changed] That’s 00:17:42 [Speaker Changed] Right. Right. More than likely, you know, we, humans being humans will figure out a way to solve this problem and the market will come roaring back. And what you wanna own at that point is stocks. So I just backed up the cart and bought stocks like crazy. 00:17:57 [Speaker Changed] So that’s kind of interesting that you’re making an active decision in the face of market turmoil and increased volatility. Did at any point in that process, did you feel like, Hey, you know, I’m kind of going against everything I’ve said in the past, or was it people said stocks were pricing now they’re cheap, I’m just a value investor. 00:18:22 [Speaker Changed] Well, guilty is charged Mary. I mean, I can’t entirely justify it, but over my career as an investing, the things that I’ve learned is one that, you know, you can’t win through stock selection. You can’t win by buying actively managed funds. You know, what you need to do is indexing, but one way you can tilt the field in your favor is in periods when people are panicking, is to, as I like to put it, ovary bound to move even more into stocks. It’s, it’s a temporary move. But you know, I’ve done it repeatedly. I did it in 2000, 2002. I did it in 2008 in oh nine. I did it during the coronavirus collapse in 2020, and I did it again in 2022. You don’t know what the bottom of the market looks like. I think it’s very hard to say stocks are objectively cheap because all of these valuation metrics have, have become unreliable over the decades as the nature of the stock market has changed. But the one thing I have learned is that if the market is off 20, 30%, things are a whole lot cheaper than they were prior to the decline. And what you should do is buy, 00:19:35 [Speaker Changed] It’s easier said than done. You mentioned covering behavioral finance as a way to look beyond just indexing funds. Tell us a little bit about the challenges that the average investor faces trying to buy into a, a down 30% market when everybody else is panicking and running the other way. 00:19:56 [Speaker Changed] Well, we know how investors behave, which is, they extrapolate recent returns. So if the market’s going up, they think it’s gonna keep going up, it’s going down, they assume it’s gonna keep going down. And that of course is what everybody around them is doing. They’re also extrapolating returns. It’s very hard to step aside from the narrative of that time and think independently. But that’s what you need to do to be a successful investor. At a bare minimum, at a bare minimum, if you can just stand your ground, you’ll probably do a whole lot better than most investors who will tend to be buying and selling at just the wrong time. I 00:20:29 [Speaker Changed] Just have to ask you a little bit about what you did after the journal, and that includes both Citigroup and Humble Dollar. You, you were at Citigroup for about six years and you were director of education. Tell us a little bit about what that role encompassed and what it was like dealing with city investors rather than journal readers. And I’m sure there’s a bit of an overlap there. 00:20:53 [Speaker Changed] So as in the couple years running up to early 2008, I was getting increasingly burned out on writing the column. And I, and I was thinking like, I gotta do something else in life. And I cast around, I I talked to various people about different jobs. Nothing quite rang a bell for me. And then I was approached by Citigroup about being director of financial education for this startup called MiFi. And the idea was they were gonna help small investors with their entire financial life in return for a fixed monthly fee. That was the notion, lovely notion, but two things went wrong. One is the idea of doing a startup within a large corporation is absolutely absurd. Companies are, large, companies are incapable of innovating in that way. It was just a struggle from day one, particularly in the regulatory environment that is the securities business between lawyers and compliance people. 00:21:46 Everything was a headache. And then on top of that, of course we ran straight into the 2008, 2009 great recession. So the business was pretty much dead before it began. And by the summer of 2009, they’d pulled the plug on this venture and suddenly, you know, I’ve thrown away my journalism career to join Citigroup. You know, what would happen next? Well, this group of people that were part of this startup for MiFi were rolled into the traditional bank based brokerage business, if you can imagine, two completely different group of people. And then on top of that, they decided they were gonna try to turn these bank based brokers into fee financial advisors, 00:22:24 [Speaker Changed] Which by the way, was the underlying trend outside of the brokerage firm. They were watching what was a small part of the business really begin to blossom post-crisis. 00:22:36 [Speaker Changed] So I became part of this new business and I did a lot of writing and a lot of public speaking over the next, you know, four plus years until I realized that, you know, I really wasn’t doing much good in the world. Huh? I I was collecting a nice paycheck, the biggest paycheck in my life, but I really felt like I was wasting my time. And I’ve never really done anything in my career solely for money. And I suddenly dawn on me that really, I was just living for my paycheck. So I made a plan to get out of there. I realized I had enough to retire if I wanted to. I was in my, I was 51, so I spent 10 or 11 months preparing to leave. I contacted the journal about writing for them again, I also started working on a book. And after I got my last urine bonus in early 2014, I walked in and handed, handed my notice. Huh. 00:23:33 [Speaker Changed] So you said something i, I have to follow up on. I can’t tell you how many people have said, you know, I don’t really do this for the money. And very often they get pushback, but I feel that way and I know you feel that way. What sort of response do you get from people when you say, well, I’m getting a nice paycheck, but that’s not why I do this? 00:23:54 [Speaker Changed] I think that in this case, I probably did not express it to people that way. I’m not saying that I don’t like getting paid, but, 00:24:02 [Speaker Changed] Well, we all like getting paid. But the question is, why do we do what we do? Is it for the money or is the money like a nice aspect of being able to do what you really love? 00:24:13 [Speaker Changed] And it’s really the latter. And I think it partly depends on the economic comfort in which you grew up. I mean, I grew up in a very comfortable middle class or from middle class household, so money was never my priority going into the workforce. You know, I wanted to cover the costs, obviously I wanted to save for the future, but I was never motivated by money. If I was motivated by money, I would never have ended up in journalism. That’s 00:24:36 [Speaker Changed] Interesting. And and you have said, especially post-diagnosis, you’ve very publicly said, gee, had I known when, when the clock was gonna run out, I would’ve spent money more aggressively. It’s kind of interesting that you were saving, despite having come from a a fairly comfortable background. Clarify that a little bit. How, how did you think about spending money and how did the diagnosis change your, your perspectives on this? 00:25:06 [Speaker Changed] So there are two reasons why I became very focused on saving money. First, what I call the great family story. So when my great, great grandfather died in 1888, he was listed in the newspapers as one of the richest men in England. 00:25:21 [Speaker Changed] Really? I have no idea. That’s fascinating. 00:25:23 [Speaker Changed] He, he was based out of Liverpool and he and his brother had launched a cigarette company called COPE Cigarettes. And they made a ton of money that Fortune ended up with my great-grandmother, and she lived the Downton Abbey lifestyle. She had an estate in the Cotswolds on which there were five mansions. Wow. She lived in one and her various children lived in the other houses on the estate. The estate was inherited by the kids to a person. They blew the money in short order, 00:25:57 [Speaker Changed] Classic three generations, shirt, sleeves to shirt sleeves. 00:26:00 [Speaker Changed] Right. So I grew up with that great family story about how you shouldn’t, you know, waste money, how you should think about the future. Huh. And then added to that was when I got out of college and I got into the workforce, I ended up getting married and having kids really quickly. I was a father at age 25 supporting a graduate student wife and living in New York City. And tight 00:26:22 [Speaker Changed] Money’s a little tight. 00:26:23 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. You know, ordering a pizza on a Friday night was a questionable decision. And, you know, I learned to be super careful with money. And that continued for probably 30 years. It’s really in the last five years that I’ve become happier about spending money, eating out more often, traveling more. And of course, since my diagnosis, you know, I’ve been doing even more of that. I mean, it’s, I still wanna make sure that my kids and my wife inherit plenty of money. But I’m at the point where, okay, I’m, I don’t need to stay for the future anymore. ’cause there isn’t much future left for me. So we’ve been traveling more. But to come back to the question that you’re gonna ask me, which is do I regret my earlier frugality? Not really. Because what I would say to you, Barry, is one sure way that money buys happiness is by allowing you not to worry about money. Absolutely. And I have not worried about money for years. 00:27:19 [Speaker Changed] And, and to be fair, you know, I don’t want to engage in what Annie Duke calls resulting when you, you know, all of us are born not knowing how long we have. And when you get an end date, when you know when the game is gonna end, well now you have that information. It’s not fair to go back and say, Hey, 20 years ago had you known, what would you have done differently? Because at the time you don’t know, it’s impossible to go back and, and revisit those decisions. The question really the fairer question is the advice you would offer people who don’t know what the end date is. How much should they be saving, how much should they be occasionally taking money out and enjoying it? And obviously it’s all a function of specifics, but how has your perspective changed, if at all, when you’re giving that sort of advice to people? 00:28:12 [Speaker Changed] So first of all, I would say to you, Barry, one of the things that’s the greatest source of happiness to me is just the day to day. You know, just getting up in the morning, having a cup of coffee, sitting at my laptop, writing and editing, you know, going out for, for lunch, having a glass of wine in the evening with lame, these are not expensive things for me. A happy life does not cost a whole lot of money. Yes. You know, we are doing more traveling now and, you know, we are traveling first class or business class, which I wouldn’t have done a couple of years ago. So yeah, I’m spending more freely, but the real happiness I get is basically doing what I’ve always done, which is to do work that I think is important. That is a big source of happiness for me. And not only does it not cost very much, but it actually earns me some money. So the other thing I would say to people is, you do not want to do all of this too early on. You know, if I had flown business class regularly in my twenties, it would not be special to me. Today, having a gradually rising standard of living throughout your life is a wonderful thing. You know, if you stayed at Motel six in your twenties, staying at a Hyatt in your sixties seems pretty special. 00:29:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s right. That’s really interesting. So, so let’s talk a little bit about Humble Dollar. When did you set that up and you’re still, you’re still running that and publishing yourself with a, a group of other people? Tell us a little bit about the Humble Dollar. 00:29:38 [Speaker Changed] So, humble Dollar was launched right at the end of 2016. I used it essentially to take a annually updated financial guide that I was producing. And I decided just to throw it on the web and make it freely available and run some ads against it. And as part of that, I invited a few people to start writing for the site. And that snowballed over time. And today I have, you know, probably 50 or 60 people who write occasionally for the site. Really? They all do it for free. They’re all amateur writers. And the thing I say to these amateur writers is, you know, you know, you may not be financial experts, but you are experts on your own life. So I encourage them to write about their own financial lives. And the result has been that people engage in a level of financial disclosure about what they’ve done with their own money that the readership finds fascinating, they find liberating. And it’s become, to my surprise, I mean this is not what I set out to do. It’s become a place where people happily talk about their own finances. And the readership tends to be very supportive. I do carefully moderate comments. I mean, if I feel like people are getting too rough on somebody, I’ll, I’ll delete comments. I also steer people away from the endless political commentary that’s poisoned social media. And it’s becomes, I like to think a safe place for people to talk about their own finances. 00:31:05 [Speaker Changed] I, I, I think that’s the right approach. I mean, I, I had a comment section on the blog on the big picture for, I dunno, close to 10 years, and mil literally millions of comments. And at a certain point really post-financial crisis, it kind of began going off the rails. And I I did the same thing you did. It’s like, hey, this is not a political forum. And if you’re gonna just really be, you know, it takes so much time and effort for someone to write something and it’s so easy to just dismiss it, it doesn’t seem fair. And I think your approach is the right, right way to go is is, I don’t know what sort of pushback you get to it from the readers. But the other thing I wanted to ask you about that, not just the other writers on the humble dollar, but the comments is people are kind of weird about money. Some, sometimes people are just like, it’s perplexing how some people think about money or use money. Tell us a little bit about your experiences dealing with the public and trying to be sort of calm and rational when consumerism and materialism very often isn’t. 00:32:11 [Speaker Changed] So, I’m not sure I have a clear view on how the typical American thinks about money these days. You know, what I have is a, a relatively narrow audience, somewhat older, more affluent. They tend to have been drawn to the site because they followed me for a number of years. A lot of them are indexers, most of them are great savers. And the biggest issue for them is not saving more and delaying gratification even more. But learning how to spend in retirement. I mean, that is the biggest struggle. Obviously not a struggle for most Americans. People do have peculiarities about money. You know this as well as I do. It varies enormously. So it’s hard to generalize, right? Probably most people are naturally inclined to spend too much and to save too little. But in terms of my audience, they’re inclination is to spend too little and save too much. So 00:32:59 [Speaker Changed] Let’s talk about that. ’cause we have about 30 advisors who are CFPs that work in my shop. And one of the common conversations is, I have a client, he’s got millions of dollars invested. We can’t get him to spend money. He wants to buy a vacation property, can’t pull the trigger, they wanna take the family on a European trip and he thinks it’s gonna cost too much. How do you help people who were earners and savers pivot in their fifties, sixties, seventies to becoming spenders? 00:33:33 [Speaker Changed] I think that pushing people to spend more is unlikely to work. I think instead you should talk about other goals. I mean, do you want to start giving money to your kids? Do you wanna start giving money to charity? Think of other ways to get them to let go of some of their dollars and maybe that doorway will become the doorway to start spending more on themselves. Certainly I’ve changed over the last five years, five years ago, sort of pre pandemic, I was very careful about spending. I didn’t go out to eat a lot, didn’t spend a lot on travel. And I think one of the things that for me coming outta the pandemic was a willingness to spend more to go out and enjoy life more after that long period stuck at home. And of course my diagnosis has, has, has done that even more. And not only have I been spending more, I’ve also been giving more to, to my kids, to charity and so on. So I think if you could open the door a little bit and people get comfortable with it, then they’ll spend more. And giving away money, whether to charity or to your children, is a way of opening that door. 00:34:36 [Speaker Changed] So I don’t know if this is my perspective or if this is accurate or not. I kind of recall prior generations the wealth was passed down out of the estate after the person passed away, they would leave their money to their family. It seems like it’s a little more modern concept is why not give them the money when you can watch them enjoy it, buy a house, travel, whatever. Is that a skewed perspective or, or do you see something similar? 00:35:07 [Speaker Changed] No, absolutely. People definitely seem to be happier to give away money now. And it’s not simply that you get the pleasure of seeing your kids enjoy the money. You can also guide how they use it. I actually just wrote checks at the beginning of the year to both my kids and you know, my kids ask, well, what should I do with the money? So it’s a chance to say, yeah, you know, you wanna put it into your retirement account, you wanna put it into your emergency fund, you wanna use it to pay down the mortgage. The other thing of course is that you get get to see them enjoy it. Right. And they are at the point where, you know, if I give my kids $19,000 this year under the gift tax exclusion, which is the sum you can give without how filing a gift tax return, that money to them in their thirties is so much more valuable than it is to me in my sixties. Right, right. I mean, they’re at a point where they’re still under a fair amount of financial stress. And I’m not saying that’s a bad thing. I mean, financial stress’s motivating. Yeah, exactly. That’s how you learn good spending habits, but you also get a lot of pleasure from getting a $19,000 check from your father. 00:36:14 [Speaker Changed] So a theme that we seem to be talking about is things that have changed. People are giving money away sooner rather than as part of the estate. We’ve talked about the shift from active mutual funds to passive ETFs. What other significant shifts have you observed over the course of your career? 00:36:33 [Speaker Changed] So we did touch on this as well, which is what is considered financial journalism has changed. It used to be that everybody was solely focused on investing and solely focused on beating the market. I mean, that was the discussion, you know, day in, day out. And to some extent it, it still is on in the financial media, but you know, the, the playing field is widened. So we are talking about things in what I consider personal finance, home ownership, social security, tax management, estate planning and so on. We’re also talking about how money meets life, things like behavioral finance, things like money and happiness. And I think the next big focus within personal finance is trying to bring this down to the individual level. Not just making, you know, broad generalizations about, you know, investors have this behavioral bias or that behavioral bias. Not talking in generalities about how you can use money to, to, to boost happiness. But you as an individual, you know, what sort of individual are you? Are you a savior? Are you a spender? You know, what is it from your past that is triggering you? I think that in the years ahead we will start focusing more on that and that will lead to even more interesting conversations about money as people get to know themselves better. And that works into how they manage their money. 00:37:58 [Speaker Changed] So let’s talk a little bit about your announcement. Last year you received a stage four lung cancer diagnosis. You are a non-smoker, so this is the genetic variation of the disease. Tell us a little bit about that diagnosis and what motivated you to share it so publicly. 00:38:21 [Speaker Changed] So back in May of last year, Barry, I started having balance issues and I, I thought I might have an ear infection. I couldn’t figure out quite what was going on. So I, on a Sunday, decided to go to an urgent care clinic and the doctor saw me at the urgent care clinic, must have realized something that was going on that, you know, was obviously I was missing. So I got dispatched to the emergency room and the next thing you know, I was stuck in the stroke victim really ward at, at a hospital in Philadelphia. So it was 16 beds up there, 15 guys who were intubated plus me sitting on the edge of my bed, like, geez, what am I doing here? Wow. So after some, some scans, some MRIs, they realized that I, I had not had a minor stroke. Instead I had, I had cancer, they found 10 lesions on my brain. 00:39:16 Wow. And a golf ball size growth on my lungs. And after some, some genetic testing and so on, they discovered that I had a relatively rare form of cancer that tends to flick people of Asian origin origin in women called EGFR Exon 20. And it’s a relatively aggressive cancer. The median life expectancy for people who have EGFR exon 20 is 16 months. Wow. So by the time I got to see the oncologist, she suggested I might have a year to live. And that was in June of 2024. Since then, I’ve had a couple more lesions on my brain and the cancers also spread to my spine. In both cases, the, the cancer on my spine was dealt with, with radiation similarly to the new lesions on my brain. I’ve also had recently had a two hour procedure to shore up my spine because of the damage done by the cancer. 00:40:17 Otherwise, there’s a risk I was gonna fracture my spine. So as of today, I’m, I’m feeling okay. But, you know, the cancer is, you know, is it my blood? It’s likely to crop up somewhere else. I think I’m gonna beat the one year mark that I was given. I’m hoping I’ll make it through 2025. But, you know, realistically, it’s unlikely that I’m gonna make it much beyond then, though of course I would love it. I mean, I have to say this Barry, you I love every day and I want every moment I can get. But you know, you have to be realistic and, you know, this is stage four cancer. There is no recovery. You know, it’s just a matter of trying to control the cancer. And, you know, I have the good fortune, I came into this in reasonably good physical shape. So I’ve coped with the, the treatment fairly well. 00:41:10 You know, I’m, I’m having chemo and immunotherapy every three weeks, taking countless medications. You know, I’ve had these radiation treatments. As I said, I just had my back operated on in order to shore it up. But, you know, at some point, you know, cancer is gonna win. I just dunno when. So come back to answer the question that you asked. So yeah, after I got the diagnosis, I, I wrote about it on my website and, you know, put out the word on social media and the response to me was quite surprising. I mean, not only did I get, you know, an outpouring of love heard from people, I hadn’t heard from in years, readers have shown a lot of love. But people also said, you know, you’re so brave for sharing your diagnosis. I was like, brave. I’ve spent my entire life writing about my own finances. 00:42:00 Why would I, why would I stop now? And you know, is it that people don’t talk about the stuff because of denial? Is it because, you know, they’re just, they’re embarrassed? Is it because of fear of death? I don’t know. But it seems like the most natural thing in the world to write about it. And to my surprise, I seem to have done a fair amount of good by doing so. People really appreciate somebody talking openly about what it is, what it’s like to have a, a terminal diagnosis. I would also say to you that a short life expectancy, this notion that your life is finite. I mean, of course that’s true for all of us, right? But it really does make you focus on the day to day. I mean, when I, you know, get up in the morning, I really notice the taste of the coffee. When I take a walk. I really notice how beautiful the trees are, how lovely the sky is. It really does focus the mind. And if anything, because I know the time is finite, I’m joined the day to day even more. It’s, it’s strange, but it’s true. And I would say to people, you know, even if you don’t have a terminal diagnosis, you know, try to be sort of more purposeful and more mindful about each day because you’ll get greater happiness out of each day. 00:43:18 [Speaker Changed] Well that, that’s really good advice. You wrote a Wall Street Journal piece, some final personal finance advice. And some of the things you discussed were, were really, I, I don’t wanna say funny, but just the way you phrased them were so blunt and matter of fact it was really intriguing. Let me run a few through a few of these and I’d like to get your your thoughts on it. The, the first one that leapt off the page was death is hard work. 00:43:47 [Speaker Changed] Explain. So I’ve always had my finances pretty well organized, but until you know that you’re about to pop off, you realize how much, sorry to use the phrase, how much crap you’ve accumulated. And you realize how hard it will be for your family to figure out your finances. So in the, the weeks and months that followed, I’ve done all kinds of things. I got a, a new will, powers of attorney, I closed accounts so that there, there are fewer accounts for my family. Everything’s 00:44:22 [Speaker Changed] Consolidated in one place. They 00:44:23 [Speaker Changed] Were already consolidated. But for instance, I had a, a Roth 401k and it’s like, I’m, I’m not gonna, I’m not gonna fund this anymore. So I’m gonna close it and roll it into my regular IRAI had an inherited IRA from my father. It didn’t have very much in it. So I, I closed that out. But also down in the basement, I had a box of papers, a couple boxes of papers. Some of them went back to when I was in college. It was like what I had every Christmas card from 1986. Wow. Why do I need every Christmas card from 1986? So I just started trashing all of this stuff and you carry around this stuff for decades, right? Thinking one day you’re gonna look at it. Well, this was my moment to look at it. And you know what, I didn’t, I just started sticking in the recycling bin. So there was a lot of work to be done in order to simplify things for my, for my wife and for my kids. And I still have more work to do. So I, all the utilities are currently in my name and in the weeks ahead, one of the final things I want to do is to make sure that I move, you know, the internet, the cell phones, the gas, the water, the electricity, all into Elaine’s name so that this one less thing for her to do after I’m gone. 00:45:33 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really very thoughtful. The other thing that really leapt off the page was so much talking. 00:45:41 [Speaker Changed] So two days after my diagnosis, both my kids were in town, landlords in town, I sat ’em down and I explained my estate plan. And of course all this was obvious to me, you know, well there’s this traditional ira, there are these Roth IRAs, regular taxable accounts, there’s, you know, this account, that account, and they’re looking at me like, like during the headlights, like what is all this about? And it’s when I realized that the stuff that’s second nature to me isn’t second nature to my kids. So had an hour discussion then and so many discussions since then as I’ve tried to explain like, you know, why you should not spend the Roth IRA until the end of the 10 year period, but you’ll have to draw down the traditional IRA over time ’cause it’s gonna be taxable income on top of your income. Lots of stuff like that. That second nature to me just wasn’t clear to them. 00:46:32 [Speaker Changed] And, and the last thing was simply taxing matters how I, I’m assuming your estate is not gonna be in the taxable size. So what do you discuss with your wife and kids about taxes? 00:46:47 [Speaker Changed] So my kids will be subject to the Pennsylvania inheritance tax four point half percent. And so, you know, that’s why I’ve started to distribute money to them. Now I had written a private mortgage for my daughter, it’s current, it was currently a little over $300,000. And I forgave that loan and then adjusted how much she’s get gonna get versus how much my son is gonna get. And as long as I make it through to July past the one year mark, then Hannah won’t have to pay the inheritance tax on, on that money soon it 00:47:22 [Speaker Changed] Becomes part of the estate and it’s non-taxable at that point? 00:47:25 [Speaker Changed] Well it’s, it’s not part of the estate at all. So she won’t have, you know, she won’t have to pay the inheritance tax on that $300,000. Oh, okay. So there are a variety of things like that that I, you know, I’ve done in order to make things a little less taxing for my kids. It’s also why as soon as January one passed this year, that’s why I made them a gift for 2025. Similarly for my grandchildren, you know, I funded their 5 29 plans early in the year so that I can get that money, you know, out of my estate and hopefully I’ll make it past the one year mark. So it’s not subject to the inheritance tax. 00:47:59 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Really, really intriguing. So given your, your diagnosis, has your perspectives on money and happiness at all changed? How have you thought about some of your previous philosophies and, and views? 00:48:15 [Speaker Changed] I think one of the things that makes me happy through this period is not only that I don’t have to worry about money with everything else that’s going on, money isn’t not a worry. So when I go back to the twenties and thirties and the sacrifices I made, I’m glad I made them so that I have that financial security today. So that amid everything else that’s going on, money is not something that’s top of mind for me. Truth is, I haven’t really worried about money for, for years. But, you know, it’d be terrible to be faced with huge medical costs potentially and not have the finances to cover it. I’ve also, however, you know, thought about, you know, this is my retirement, right? If I don’t enjoy my retirement now, such as it is, I’m never gonna enjoy it. So yeah, I have been spending more freely, you know, we went to London recently, we went to Ireland, I took the family on a fairly luxurious long weekend. This month we’re going to Paris. We’re, we’ve got other trips planned in the months ahead. There’s a limit how far I can plan ahead because I never know when I’m gonna get derailed by some bad diagnosis. And I hate the idea of the cancellation fees, but you know, we do have trips planned and we’ve booked the hotels, but I haven’t booked the flights because I don’t wanna have to cancel ’em. Huh. 00:49:34 [Speaker Changed] So, so we talked earlier about money and happiness. I’m curious as to how you think about the relationship between life satisfaction, wellbeing and what money does and does not help you obtain. 00:49:51 [Speaker Changed] So money I believe can do three things for you. One, it can allow you not to worry about money. We’ve talked about this already in many ways. You know, money doesn’t buy happiness. It lets you avoid unhappiness, the unhappiness of being broke. But two money can buy you the financial freedom. Spend your days doing what you love. If you love your job, that’s great. That’s the greatest combination get. But a lot of people clearly don’t love their jobs. So what they want is the financial freedom to do whatever it is they wished to be able to do. And you get that by saving diligently year after year, decade after decade. And then third, money can allow you to have special times with friends and family and you know, whether it’s, you know, the barbecue, the special vacation flying across the country to see the grandchildren, whatever it is, money can allow you to do that. So those three things, avoiding the unhappiness of being broke, two, doing whatever you think is fulfilling. And three is spending special times with friends and family. That’s what money can do for you. That is the way that money can buy happiness. 00:50:55 [Speaker Changed] Huh. Very intriguing. So you’ve mentioned a lot of your earlier in life financial decisions have set you up in a good financial situation today. What, what decisions do you look back and say, oh, I, I’m really glad I did that. What were the, with hindsight, with the benefit of hindsight, what were the choices you made that you most appreciate today? 00:51:23 [Speaker Changed] Prob probably like everybody, you know, Barry, who has, you know, amassed some wealth on their own. The smartest thing I ever did was to be a good saver. You know, if, you know, if you’re a good saver, you know, everything else is, everything’s gonna turn out fine. Even if you’re not a great investor, as long as you’re a good saver, you know, good things will happen if you’re a lousy saver, but a great investor, you know, it’s unlikely that you’re gonna succeed financially. So yeah, saving was the number one thing. And then two, I was very early as you might imagine on the indexing train. And that has also rebounded to my benefit, but it’s, it’s been a saver that was not top of the list. 00:52:01 [Speaker Changed] So, so let me flip that question around. What do you think most people get wrong? What are some of the biggest myths in investing in finance that we often have a hard time getting past? 00:52:12 [Speaker Changed] Well, certainly, you know, this focus on investing, this focusing on beating the market is the wrong place to, you know, be spending your time. But let me, let me broaden it out, Barry. So something that I’ve been thinking about a lot of late, which is most people, and and this is, was true of me in the early days, spend too much time worrying in general and worrying about money specifically. And I think this is hardwired into us. You know, we are here because our hunter gatherer ancestors survived. And why did they survive? Because they were warriors, right? They worried about everything, you know, they wanted to make sure that they were gonna be okay no matter what happened. Well, guess what? You know, the saber tooth tiger is not gonna leap out of the bushes. You know, we do not need to worry the way we, our ancestors used to. 00:53:02 And yet people worry constantly. I mean, people are serial worriers. It’s like the hedonic treadmill. We talk about how, you know, we strive towards goals, hoping that they’re gonna make us happy forever. And then boom, we achieve whatever it is and we immediately start striving off to something else. We can’t get off that treadmill. Well, there’s also a worry treadmill, and we worry about something bababababa choose away from us. The worry goes away, we’re onto something else. People cannot escape their worries. And what I would want for, for listeners, and I want I want for my readers is please find some way to worry less. Because if you do the right stuff financially, you live beneath your means. You’re not crazy with your investment. Hopefully you index, you know, hopefully you don’t take on too much debt. You know, you, you’re not gonna get it all right. 00:53:56 But good things will happen in the end. You don’t have to spend 30, 40 years worrying about retirement. You don’t have to get to retirement and worry that you’re spending a crazy amount of money because you’re gonna get derailed by the stock market or whatever it is. Things are likely to walk out just fine. We are not, you know, back, you know, in, you know, like our hunter gatherer ancestors, you know, worried about every threat. You know, it’s, it’s time to let go of those worries. I, that to me is the biggest mistake people make. And I don’t have a magic cure for getting away from those worries. But I do believe that is the number one thing we could do for our own happiness. Huh. 00:54:36 [Speaker Changed] Really, really very interesting. Of all the things you’ve learned over the course of being a personal finance columnist, first for Forbes and for the Journal and, and everything you’ve done in at The Humble Dollar, aside from Worry Less, what do you think is the the most important piece of financial wisdom that you wanna pass along that you wanna have outlive you? What, what’s the most significant thing you wish people would embrace and it would make their life better? 00:55:09 [Speaker Changed] I think what people need to do is know themselves, right? Much more than you know, what’s the expense ratio on their index funds or you know, which is the best age of which to claim social security. Know yourself because everybody has different financial needs and different financial worries and so on. So if you customize your finances to your own needs, not to somebody else’s needs, not to what your brother-in-law says, not to what you heard on the tv. If you focus it to your own needs, what you worry about the most, you know, that is likely to lead you to have a happier financial life. I think one of the problems is that we live too much under the influence of others. It’s not just the influence of people today, you know, our friends and family and the people we see in the media, but also we live under the influence of the past, what our parents told us or what they modeled for us. You know, people go through their life buying what their parents bought because they thought it made their parents happy, and so they think it’s gonna make them happy. Probably not gonna work out that way. So try to think for yourself and try to know yourself. Huh. 00:56:14 [Speaker Changed] Good, good advice. Let me throw you a curve ball. I remember last summer, towards the end of July, you were the focus of a New York Times piece headline, A Money Guru Bet, big on a very Long Life, then he Got Cancer. You’re usually the author of pieces like that. What, how odd was it to, to be the subject of a piece? I know you as a humble person, not just ’cause of the Humble Dollar website, you are not seeking to be the center of attention. How strange was that entire experience? 00:56:50 [Speaker Changed] Look, Barry, to be honest, sitting here, getting quizzed by you is not that difficult from getting, getting different from getting quizzed by Ron Lieber of the New York Times. But that said, yes, you know, I personally do not wanna be the center of attention. I would like the focus to be on my writing rather than me as a person. But, you know, I, I knew Ron was not gonna be unkind. I’ve known Ron for decades, right. He’s a, he’s a friend of mine. Much more uncomfortable actually was the photo shoot where I have to sit there and try to smile for an hour. Right, 00:57:22 Right. But it sort of goes back to what I was talking about earlier about the, the amount of publicity that my diagnosis has generated. I mean, since that came out, you know, I had the Wall Street Journal article that I wrote. I had, I wrote a piece for the Washington Post. I got a piece coming out in the a RP magazine. Ron Lieber wrote that piece for the New York Times. I also wrote a piece for my father’s old paper in London, the Telegraph, which was a lot of fun. Well, maybe not fun, but it was, it was great to be in there. So yeah, the focus on my, my diagnosis is a little bit odd. And certainly it’s uncomfortable for me to be the focus of attention wrong on my writing, but I feel in some way, in a way that I didn’t really realize that it’s, it’s, it’s doing some good and I, being of service to others has always been really important to me. I mean, I feel like if I’m not doing some little good in the world, I’m, I’m not spending my days usefully. I never wanna spend the days focused solely on my own needs. 00:58:28 [Speaker Changed] But you, you were able to use the opportunity to amplify the good message that you had for people, which was, hey, here’s just a fundamentally smart way to go about managing not just your investing, but your personal finance and your life. That focus must have been gratifying to get that message out. 00:58:47 [Speaker Changed] No, absolutely. I, it, it, it was, but it was also a little bit uncomfortable. 00:58:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, I can, I can certainly see knowing you and knowing your personality, I can see it was something like, all right, let me, let me make this trade off. And, and, but it all seems to have accomplished the goal of sprinting what you wanted to share with the public. 00:59:09 [Speaker Changed] And, you know, for as long as I’m able, you know, I wanna be able to continue writing. I do have a whole bunch of articles that I still hope to pen, but, you know, I know this, this ride is gonna, is gonna come to an end probably sooner than I would like. But you know, for now, while I can still write, while I can still get my fingers on the keyboard, I hope to keep punching out a few more articles. 00:59:33 [Speaker Changed] So normally at this point, I shift to some of the favorite questions I ask all of my guests. I’m not sure how relevant these are, but, but let’s, let’s run through them for posterity stake. What’s keeping you entertained these days? What are you doing if you just want to kick back and relax a little bit? 00:59:53 [Speaker Changed] Yeah, that’s not a, 00:59:54 [Speaker Changed] A, 00:59:55 [Speaker Changed] A thing. I’m very good at kicking back and relaxing. That said, you know, as I mentioned, you know, if I’m gonna be retired, which I don’t think I’ll ever be fully retired, this is the moment, right. If I don’t do it now, I’m never gonna get to do it. And for the first time in probably 20 years, I actually started watching sports again on tv, and it sort of takes me back to being a teenager and so on, sitting on the couch. I’m not sure I could ever sit through a whole football game, but maybe I could watch the final quarter. And so I’ve been trying a little bit of that. So, yeah. 01:00:30 [Speaker Changed] Have you played with Red Zone at all? No. My nephews are just crazy about it. It’s just the highlights of every big game, kind of all at once. It’s just, it’s an amazing, if you’re a football fan, you might wanna explore that. It’s, it’s pretty bonkers. 01:00:46 [Speaker Changed] So I live down in Philadelphia, so the Eagles are an obsession. Yeah. And you, you can’t help but catch a little bit of the fever on a Sunday afternoon. Half the people, and I’m not, this is not exaggeration. Half the people you see walking on the street are wearing Eagles gear. Wow. I mean, that’s how much of an obsession it is in the city. And it’s fun. You know, I, I’ve been taught by my son-in-law that when you go into a store in Philadelphia, you know, to buy something on a Sunday, what you have to say when you leave is Go Birds. 01:01:20 [Speaker Changed] That’s very funny. Tell us about your mentors who helped shape your career. 01:01:26 [Speaker Changed] So I would call out one person, which was the editor of this little newspaper that I worked for when I was 19. Her name was Leslie Levin. And she had just got out of the American University Journalism school. And she had all of this knowledge about journalism that she was anxious to pass on. And literally she, she taught me how to write. She taught me how to report. It was a great experience. I was so fortunate. And, and in fact, this was all before I went to college. And I took the advice that she gave me about, you know, how to run a small newspaper. And then I took it, and I used it when I edited the student newspaper at Cambridge. And I’ve used it ever since. So if I ever, for instance, see a piece of copy with an exclamation mark on it, I immediately hear Leslie’s voice in my back, my head saying, you only ever use the exclamation mark if it’s World War iii. Otherwise no exclamation marks. 01:02:24 [Speaker Changed] That’s really interesting. Tell us about some of your favorite books. What have you been reading recently? 01:02:30 [Speaker Changed] Lately I’ve been doing a lot of reading about Philadelphia and about the, the, the neighborhood where I live. I live very close to the Schuylkill River across from the Penn, the Penn UPenn campus. And where I live now, used to be full of Irish immigrants who worked on the wolves along the Schull. And next to me is a very, an elderly lady. I think she’s probably in her nineties, and her son lives with her, and he, he’s in his mid sixties. And Charlie tells me that when he was growing up in the neighborhood, there were two Italian families and everybody else was Irish. And the fact that he was aware that there were only two families in the neighborhood who were Italian and everybody else was Irish, tells you something about that neighborhood at the time. So I enjoy reading about Philadelphia, but I you, in terms of favorite books, the best time in terms of learning about finance was when I was at Forbes in the late 1980s. Back then, the workplace was less pressured, there’s less drive to produce, and there was more time to sort of sit, kick back and relax and read. And Forbes had a great library. So back in those days, you know, I read Burton Mals Random Walk Down Wall Street. I read all the books of Wall Street History by John Brooks, and I particularly remember 01:03:55 [Speaker Changed] Once Upon a Time in Goland, is that John Brooks? 01:03:57 [Speaker Changed] Yeah. The Go-Go years. That’s right. And then there was this little book that I discovered in the Forbes library called Investment Policy by Charles Ellis. And Investment Policy, I believe, came out in 1986, and I think the original edition was 94 pages. And it just seemed like Charlie went through and picked out every word in that book with enormous care. Since then, the book has ballooned a little bit. It’s over 200 pages, but that, and it’s now of course called Winning the Losers Game. That’s 01:04:29 [Speaker Changed] Right. That, in fact, that would began life as a research paper. I don’t, I don’t remember if it was the CFA Institute, but it was published somewhere. 01:04:39 [Speaker Changed] I think it was the Journal of Portfolio Management. 01:04:41 [Speaker Changed] I think you’re you. That’s exactly right. But it was a short 2030 Yeah. Page thing, which has persisted. Winning The Losers Game is one of my favorite finance books. 01:04:50 [Speaker Changed] But, 01:04:51 [Speaker Changed] And you know, he, Charlie has a new book coming out this year. Yep. 01:04:54 [Speaker Changed] Charlie’s Unstoppable. Yes. If you can find Charlie’s original book, investment Policy, which is the one that I believe came out in 86, you know, it’s 94 pages. It’s a great read. And that, I think was probably the most influential book on investing that I’ve ever read. 01:05:12 [Speaker Changed] Wow. That’s a, that’s a big deal. I’m gonna have to hunt that down. I I may have to reactivate my eBay account to, to, to get that. Our final two questions. What sort of advice would you give to a recent college grad interest in the career in financial journalism or investing? 01:05:29 [Speaker Changed] Well, so I, I think I already answered the financial journalism one, which is don’t do it. I, I’m not entirely serious. I mean, journalism is the most fun you can have while keeping your clothes on. I mean, it’s, you know, newsrooms are great places to be. You know, you’ll never meet a group of people who are more fun to be with and more cynical. I mean, it’s just so much fun to be in a newsroom. So yeah, go off and be a journalist for a couple of years, learn how to write, learn about the world, and then go off and make, do something that’ll make you some money. But spending a couple of years in journalism in your twenties when you don’t really need to worry about making a lot of money is a great thing to do. So yeah, I would encourage people to do it, but don’t imagine you’re gonna make a career out of it. 01:06:11 [Speaker Changed] And our final question, what do you know about the world of investing today you wish you knew 30 years or so ago? 01:06:19 [Speaker Changed] That’s an interesting question. What do I wish I knew? I guess what I wish I knew was to, was that if I did the right things for long enough, everything was gonna work out just fine. If, you know, as long as I saved as, as long as I didn’t fiddle around too much from my portfolio, if I just let it ride, you know, I could just go off and worry about other stuff, not worry about it at all. You know, things generally do work out today. You know, there are not many people, you know, who go into the world, out into the world and, you know, are reasonably prudent in managing money and so on, who don’t successfully get to retirement. You don’t need to fret about it every step of the way. You don’t need to analyze every month spending in quicker. And you, you don’t need to fine tune your portfolio every month, just, you know, set up a sensible asset allocation, buy some index funds, save regularly, and good things will happen. 01:07:14 [Speaker Changed] Jonathan, thank you so much for being so generous with your time and your incredibly insightful advice.

Title: America needs to pull off a colossal building plan to reach a new 'Intelligence Age'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/america-intelligence-age-ai-infrastructure-sam-altman-biden-trump-china-2025-1
Time Published: 2025-01-21T10:45:37Z
Full Content:
America is ready to reach a new age of intelligence. Getting there —and staying ahead of rival nations in the AI race — depends on a plan to transform the physical world that's becoming more formidable by the day. Leaders driving the AI boom entered 2025 by getting louder about the radical transformation they say is needed on US soil to deliver an era of AI-led superintelligence: more data centers, more chip plants, and more power infrastructure. By taking root in the physical world — huge data center facilities depend on complex wiring, hardware, and integration with power infrastructure across vast amounts of landmass — the hope is that AI software could one day transform society the way the Industrial Age did. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, calls this next leap the "Intelligence Age." In a September blog post, Altman said its defining characteristic would be "massive prosperity." However, he cautioned that without enough infrastructure, "AI will be a very limited resource that wars get fought over and that becomes mostly a tool for rich people." Last week, in one of his final executive orders, President Joe Biden signaled intent to build more at home with plans to lease acres of federal land to private sector firms with the know-how to develop complex AI infrastructure. The intent to build is likely to continue after Donald Trump's inauguration on Monday, as tech leaders rally around the incoming president and put AI among the top priorities on his agenda. Biden's executive order followed the release of a blueprint from OpenAI a day earlier, which claimed "the economic opportunity AI presents is too compelling to forfeit" by not building the infrastructure needed. Data centers, power plants, and chip manufacturing plants will all cost money — a lot of money. Goldman Sachs estimates that roughly $1 trillion will be spent in the next few years alone to develop the infrastructure needed to bring today's AI models closer to superintelligence. It's why the big question investors and companies must now grapple with is whether or not they are willing to put up money for a vision of the future that is hardly guaranteed. Altman has offered no shortage of reasons for spending so much money on achieving superintelligence. Ensuring technological hegemony over China is one. As his company said last week, "there's an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects" that "will flow to China-backed projects" and strengthen Beijing if not directed to the US. Another is that superintelligence could unlock unimaginable prosperity for society. Altman recently said that "if we could fast-forward a hundred years," the prosperity from superintelligence would feel just as unimaginable as today's world would to a lamplighter, a person employed to light and maintain street lights until about the 1950s. The third reason is perhaps more surprising. In a blog published at the start of the year, Altman said his company is now confident that it knows how to build artificial general intelligence, a term often interchanged with superintelligence despite their differences. It's a combination of factors that will, in some way, have triggered the flood of comments from those who want to play their part in developing the infrastructure needed to deliver superintelligence. In a blog published this month titled "The Golden Opportunity for American AI," Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company planned to spend $80 billion alone this year on data centers. "Not since the invention of electricity has the United States had the opportunity it has today to harness new technology to invigorate the nation's economy," he said. Last year, in conjunction with BlackRock and others, the tech giant unveiled a fund focused on AI infrastructure with an investment potential of up to $100 billion. In an interview with Semafor last month, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that he was ready to work on a "Manhattan Project" for AI once Donald Trump takes office, underscoring the scale of the development and investment needed by invoking the World War II program that eventually produced the atomic bomb. Meanwhile, Japanese conglomerate SoftBank committed $100 billion to investing in the US over the next four years, focusing on AI and related infrastructure. While there is clear intent to develop AI infrastructure, it's not clear if or when the investments will pay off — for two key reasons. First, much of the infrastructure needed in the US faces an uphill struggle to get built. Take chip plants. US companies like Nvidia, Google, AMD, and others that specialize in designing chips have developed a significant reliance on Taiwanese firm TSMC to manufacture those chips in the Far East, where a combination of cheap, skilled labor, economies of scale, and a long history of government support for the semiconductor sector has made the incredibly expensive business of manufacturing chips easier to pull-off. Simply throwing capital at projects aimed at getting chips manufactured in the US won't cut it. Efforts to build chip manufacturing plants at home have been taking shape — the Biden administration's CHIPS Act has provided billions of dollars of grants to semiconductor firms in the US — but there remains a huge gap between the capabilities of manufacturers in the East versus those at home. The AI boom has been kind to TSMC, with its value roughly doubling last year to $1.1 trillion. US chip manufacturer Intel, meanwhile, more than halved to around $85 billion. Clean power infrastructure, increasingly focused on nuclear power, also faces challenges. Returns on investment in nuclear power projects meant to provide clean energy to intensive data centers are highly uncertain. These projects also face significant regulatory hurdles. In December, for instance, the States of Texas, Utah, and Washington D.C.-based company Last Energy sued the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over claims that the government agency was applying the same risk analysis to small modular reactors as it was to large-scale power plants. These SMRs, as they're known, are meant to make access to nuclear power cheaper, given their compactness and greater affordability versus traditional nuclear plants. But even these face roadblocks. The second big reason that investors may want to approach infrastructure investment with caution is that the emergence of superintelligence remains highly speculative. Altman's claim that there is now a clear path to AGI is worth taking seriously, as new models like OpenAI's o3 released in December demonstrate increasingly sophisticated reasoning capabilities that do more than just parrot their training data. That said, there have been rumblings across the industry recently about AI models hitting a wall in terms of performance improvements. Without really serious advances in capabilities, then, or a clearly defined path forward to superintelligence, it is not clear how or when these colossal bets on AI infrastructure will pay off. But with China and other nations showing no sign of slowing down, it is clear that the cost of not being in the AI race could be far greater. Jump to

Title: Italy's powerful Agnelli family invests differently. Now its $6 billion asset manager is coming to America.

One of the most interesting asset managers in Europe has made it to America. Lingotto Investment Management, with $6 billion in assets under management, has generated plenty of intrigue in its short existence. It was formed in 2023 by Exor, the holding company for the wealth of the Agnelli family, which owns Fiat, Ferrari, The Economist, and the Italian soccer team Juventus. Lingotto launched as an investment house giving tenured portfolio managers a sleeve of capital and free range to invest — some bets include a private German robotics company and CBS's parent company, Paramount. The firm, which was founded by the billionaire Agnelli heir John Elkann and whose chair is former UK Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, has raised billions in outside capital and is operated separately from Exor. Now the manager is expanding to New York, where it already has 14 employees, including investing talent, on the ground. The 50-person firm, based in London, considers New York and London to be its "two pillars," Enrico Vellano, Lingotto's CEO, said in an interview with Business Insider. "The idea is to continue to grow and invest in the US but also in the UK," he said. The firm has lured in James Anderson, a star tech investor and former Baillie Gifford partner, and BlackRock executive Pam Chan to run different strategies. Matteo Scolari and Nikhil Srinivasan, two longtime Exor-connected investors, manage their own books. The investors' focuses are across the board — limited-partner stakes in other funds, public tech companies, quirky private opportunities — and they can pursue their ideas on their own timelines, which can be yearslong, without constant tinkering from a central risk manager or overarching investment commitment. This proposition has been enticing to portfolio managers as well as prospective backers. "Each team is empowered and very independent," said Scolari, whose ties to the Agnelli family go back a generation to when his father worked as the head of research and development at Fiat decades ago. In an interview with BI, he said the structure set the firm apart. "I think that's really important — I really believe in this approach," he added. The firm doesn't like the word "platform," but it's impossible to avoid comparisons between today's dominant multistrategy managers and Lingotto. These platforms have become some of the biggest names in alternative investing, in part because they can absorb so much capital from sovereign wealth funds and pensions and diversify it across dozens of investing teams. The industry's biggest investors prefer multistrategy funds because of their consistency and lack of volatility, which they achieve through tight risk limits and short-term investment horizons. Lingotto employs multiple investors who operate quasi-independently of each other, like Citadel and Millennium. But the similarities between Lingotto and the biggest hedge funds end there. At Lingotto, the ultimate authority over its four strategies lies with the heads of said strategies. There's no firmwide chief investment officer but four different CIOs. "I really liked the idea of the autonomy," Anderson said in an interview with BI. He runs the firm's $700 million innovation strategy alongside Morgan Samet, the strategy's cohead who used to work for the value-investment shop Pzena and the private-equity firm THL. The innovation team plans to invest in companies across their life cycle, including when they are private, and hold them through volatile patches. "You need to be prepared to suffer," said Anderson, who was an early investor in Tesla and Amazon and a big believer in Nvidia's potential. "Where we earn our returns is by being supporters of these companies during their downturns," he added. The long-term nature of the firm's capital, thanks to Exor's role in the formation of the company, allows Anderson and Samet — and the firm's three other strategy heads — to worry less about short-term gains and more about long-term ideas. "We're not scared of volatility," Samet said. "We see that as more of an opportunity, " she added. While the firm wants to be viewed as more than just the investment arm of the Agnelli family — and already has outside capital from the French insurer Covéa — Lingotto is the brainchild of Elkann, the billionaire heir. In a public letter after the firm launched, Elkann quoted the 18th-century philosopher Adam Smith to stress how his family would be investing alongside any outside capital. "Above all, we think and act as principals rather than agents," he wrote. Lingotto, named after an iconic Fiat factory in Turin, Italy, with a rooftop test track that began operations in 1923, plans to grow through "performance rather than capital inflows," he added. The first to run strategies for the firm were a pair of longtime family connections, Scolari and Srinivasan, who now run the intersection and horizon strategies, respectively. Scolari previously worked for Eton Park, the now shuttered hedge fund founded by the former Goldman Sachs partner Eric Mindich, and joined Exor in 2015. Srinivasan, meanwhile, was the chief investment officer at Allianz Investment Management and an HPS partner before joining Exor in 2018. The pair have very different strategies — Scolari runs a concentrated book of public equity longs and shorts, while Srinivasan manages a portfolio of other funds as well as direct investments into private companies — but similar experiences working at the firm. Without the pressures of managing a business, the two chief investment officers can focus on their main job: investing. "You have a pool of capital, you have trust from the LPs and GPs, and you have clarity for what you're supposed to be doing from an investment point of view," said Srinivasan, who invests in companies around the globe and spoke with BI from Singapore. "The stresses created are our own stresses," he added. With the firm's momentum and burgeoning reputation, it might seem like the next step would be a significant hiring spree to grow the ranks even further. While Lingotto's leaders are always looking for top people, Vellano said the firm wanted the right people for the structure, not just more people. Chan, a former BlackRock private-markets executive, is an example. Chan, who is based in New York and runs the mosaic strategy, said her portfolio was focused on the parts of the private markets that don't fit neatly into the buckets of the biggest private-asset managers. Right now, for example, she's got her eyes on the content industry, including nontraditional players like YouTube creators. "Novelty is a big part of what we do," she said. She was early into the music-rights business, something massive asset managers like KKR have now gotten into. She focuses on areas where there's a "capital demand-supply imbalance," a time-intensive strategy that requires her and her team to scour the market for deals. She said Lingotto's structure gives her the bandwidth to do that by "allowing investors to invest." It fits neatly into Vellano's vision. "We will remain a boutique" that focuses on "quality investors and LPs," he said, adding: "It's important we have that alignment." Jump to

Title: Stocks Whipsaw, Dollar Rises on Trump Warnings: Markets Wrap

(Bloomberg) -- Stocks climbed as President Donald Trump struck a better-than-feared tone on global trade and speculation grew that his policies will further boost Corporate America. Bonds continued to unwind the recent surge in yields that roiled markets. The dollar wavered.

A closely watched exchange-traded fund tracking companies with AI exposure hit a three-year high. Small caps climbed on bets they will benefit from a protectionist stance. Trump’s flurry of executive orders helped boost space shares, while weighing on electric-vehicle makers.

Subscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.​​​​​​ Treasury yields hovered near their lowest levels of the year. Mexico’s peso and Canada’s loonie got hit as Trump outlined levies he expects to place on both countries by Feb. 1. “Risky assets should benefit from deregulation and tariffs emerging as not so bad as feared,” said Mohit Kumar at Jefferies International Ltd. “For rates, less onerous tariffs and likely lower oil prices should be a positive.” Callie Cox at Ritholtz Wealth Management, says it’s time to see what speculation was “founded” and what was “just nonsense” when it comes to tariffs. Meantime, she noted that Trump faces a crucial test on another front. “We’ll start seeing more headlines around debt-ceiling talks, and possibly, more stress on the shorter end of the Treasury curve,” she said. The debt ceiling is frequently used for leverage amid budget negotiations in Congress, with agreements often made at the last minute. As a result, the standoffs typically ripple through short-term interest rates as investors dump Treasury bills most vulnerable to a potential default in favor of other securities. The S&P 500 rose 0.9%. The Nasdaq 100 added 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.2%. The Russell 2000 of small caps rallied 1.8%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps added 0.3%. In late hours, Netflix Inc. soared after reporting its biggest quarterly subscriber gain in history. United Airlines Holdings Inc. issued a bullish outlook. The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined seven basis points to 4.56%. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed. “Last week, the equity markets experienced a broad rally, supported by cooler inflation data, upbeat earnings from banks, and a recovery from short-term oversold conditions and negative sentiment,” said Craig Johnson at Piper Sandler. “We expect further upside in equities, supported by the return of Trump’s ‘business and investor-friendly’ policies. The “presidential scorecard” of stock-market performance is resetting this Tuesday, with Trump beginning his day in the White House for the first time in four years. For Joe Biden’s entire presidency, the Dow Jones Industrial average rallied 39.4% — about 18 percentage points less than the four years under his Trump’s first administration — and over 100 percentage points less than the 149.4% during the eight years of the Obama era, according to data compiled by Bespoke Investment Group. “While the Dow’s performance under Biden was the weakest of the last three presidents, it was still nothing to sneeze at, and it caps off a third straight period of strong gains under a presidential term,” Bespoke said. “Let these performance numbers serve as a reminder that as an investor you should never let your politics and investment decisions overlap.” Since 1944, from the election through the inauguration day, the S&P 500 gained an average 1.6%, according to Sam Stovall at CFRA. During the subsequent “First 100 (calendar) Days”, the S&P 500 gained an average of 2.1%, he noted. “What’s more, the performances of S&P 500 sectors and sub-industries during the ‘Post-Election Honeymoon Period’ have been predictive of sector and sub-industry leadership for the entire year,” Stovall added. Since 1993, the top four sectors from election day through inauguration day posted an average calendar-year increase of 17% versus the S&P 500’s average 15.9% rise and outperformed the broad benchmark 75% of the time, Stovall said. Even better, the top-10 S&P 500 sub-industries posted an average calendar-year increase of 26.8% and also beat the market 75% of the time, he concluded. This time around, there are early signs that investors are preparing for equity laggards to rally on bets that Trump could take a softer-than-feared stance on global trade, according to a survey by Bank of America Corp. If concerns around Trump’s tariff proposals prove to be “unfounded,” investor allocations would remain risk-on and stock markets that have trailed the powerful rally in the US would play catch up, BofA strategist Michael Hartnett said. In what could be a different macro/market regime in 2025, with a moderate pick-up in economic growth, we want to look for other equity markets that have reversion potential and have positive earnings revisions, according to Emily Roland and Matt Miskin at John Hancock Investment Management. “US large-cap value (financials heavy) and US mid-caps (industrials heavy) are the two best options across globally equities that offer reversion potential and improving earnings trends,” they noted. “Non-US equities and US small-caps could get a boost simply from the rotation trends, but fundamentally not as strong.” Roland and Miskin also added that investors don’t have to go far to benefit from the potential deconcentration of the S&P 500 from the top 10 mostly technology-driven growth stocks. “Simply a value tilt or moving down in cap a bit, may give them plenty of fundamentally favorable opportunities,” they concluded. “Our base case for the US economy is for ‘growth despite tariffs’,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “While we will be closely monitoring for risks, we do not believe that the tariff measures outlined in our base case would be sufficient to derail US growth. Nor do we believe that such tariffs would preclude inflation continuing to fall from current levels, enabling the Federal Reserve to cut rates by 50bps later this year.” The latest dovish inflation readings are “game-changers,” and should provide a Goldilocks backdrop for risk assets over the coming months, HSBC says. The bank’s strategists led by Max Kettner expect only very shallow drawdowns in the coming months and would use any dips to boost risk asset exposure. They say sentiment and positioning are still flashing a buy signal. To Matt Maley at Miller Tabak, while many of the headlines related to Trump’s policies could have an important impact on the markets, earnings season — and forward guidance — should be extremely important as well. “With the market as expensive as it is today, there are some concerns about whether the positive aspects of these new policies may have already been priced into the stock market,” Maley said. “So, it’s going to be particularly important that the overall earnings picture does not begin to deteriorate in any meaningful manner.” Corporate Highlights: Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst. Charles Schwab Corp. reported results that exceeded Wall Street estimates as it continues to attract record inflows to its retail brokerage. 3M Co. expects profit to grow this year as Chief Executive Officer William Brown works to advance his plan to turn around the sprawling manufacturer. D.R. Horton Inc. reported earnings per share for the first quarter that beat the average analyst estimate. MicroStrategy Inc. shareholders voted for a 30 times increase to the number of authorized Class A common shares to help finance the company’s Bitcoin buying. B. Riley Financial Inc. suspended dividends on a pair of its preferred shares, holding off on cash payments to some investors while it prepares to pay off another set of notes coming due next month. Adidas AG reported better-than-expected results amid the sustained boom for retro sneakers like the Samba and more sales from its shrinking stockpile of Yeezy footwear.

Title: Uninsurable homes and plummeting property values: John Rubino warns of a ‘Reverse Wealth Effect’ in exclusive interview with Mike Adams and Todd Pitner

Homeowners in California and the Carolinas face uninsurable properties due to frequent natural disasters, leading to plummeting home values and a potential "reverse wealth effect." Insurers are exiting high-risk markets, leaving homeowners with unsellable properties as banks refuse mortgages for uninsurable homes, exacerbating financial instability. The state's "Fair Plan" insurer may face $437 billion in potential payouts, risking bankruptcy and shifting the burden to taxpayers amid widespread uninsurable homes. Declining property values reduce local tax revenues, strain public services, and drive up insurance premiums, while inflation further increases costs for insurers and homeowners. Experts recommend diversifying into physical assets like gold, silver, and real estate, alongside preparing for economic instability as traditional financial systems falter.

Experts recommend diversifying into physical assets like gold, silver, and real estate, alongside preparing for economic instability as traditional financial systems falter. A growing insurance crisis is unfolding across high-risk areas in the United States, leaving homeowners in states like California and the Carolinas facing a dire financial reality. In an exclusive interview on Decentralize TV, financial analyst John Rubino joined hosts Mike Adams and Todd Pitner to discuss the alarming trend of uninsurable homes, plummeting property values, and the potential for a "reverse wealth effect" that could ripple through the economy. The crisis stems from the increasing frequency and severity of natural disastersâwildfires in California and hurricanes in the Carolinasâwhich have overwhelmed insurance companies. As Rubino explained, "Insurance companies are pulling out of these markets because they can't turn a profit insuring multi-million dollar houses in Hurricane Alley or Southern California." This exodus has left homeowners with rebuilt but unsellable properties, as banks refuse to issue mortgages for uninsurable homes. The situation is particularly dire in California, where the state's "Fair Plan," an insurer of last resort, may be on the hook for up to $437 billion in potential payouts, according to Bloomberg analysis. Rubino warned that this could bankrupt the state, shifting the financial burden to taxpayers. "When you've got 100,000 people with uninsurable and unsellable houses, you get a thing called the reverse wealth effect," he said. The reverse wealth effect occurs when declining asset values, such as plummeting home prices, lead to reduced consumer spending and economic contraction. Rubino compared the current crisis to the 2008 housing collapse, where overextended banks and unaffordable mortgages triggered a financial meltdown. "If a house can't be insured, it's not worth nearly the prices that have prevailed for the last decade," he said. "Prices have to plungeâmaybe 20%, 30%, or 40%âto clear the market." The implications extend beyond individual homeowners. As property values decline, local governments face reduced tax revenues, further straining public services. Meanwhile, insurance premiums for those who can still obtain coverage are skyrocketing, adding to the financial burden. Rubino also highlighted the role of inflation in exacerbating the crisis. "We've been debasing the dollar for the past 50 years, and one of the effects is that it makes property more expensive," he explained. "When houses go up in value, insurance companies have a bigger bill to pay off when that house burns down. Inflation is part of the process of making these houses uninsurable." The hosts and Rubino also explored potential solutions, including the need for decentralized financial strategies. Adams emphasized the importance of owning physical assets like gold and silver, which retain value during economic turmoil. "Gold and silver survive hurricanes, floods, firesâit's on the table of elements," Adams said. "There's nothing more secure in the universe." Rubino echoed this sentiment, recommending that individuals allocate at least 10% of their financial assets to precious metals. He also suggested investing in real assets like rental properties, energy infrastructure, and commodities like copper, which are essential for the electrification of the global economy. The conversation took a speculative turn as Pitner raised the possibility of conspiracy theories, including weather weaponization and government manipulation of financial systems. While Rubino acknowledged the plausibility of such scenarios, he emphasized the importance of focusing on tangible risks and preparing for economic instability. As the interview concluded, Rubino left viewers with a sobering reminder: "The crash that results from this is going to be a lot bigger than we've ever seen. We've bought ourselves extra time, but at the cost of an even bigger crash when the time comes." For homeowners in high-risk areas, the message is clear: prepare for a future where traditional financial systems may no longer provide security. Whether through decentralized assets, alternative investments, or self-sufficiency, the time to act is nowâbefore the next disaster strikes.

As Rubino explained, "Insurance companies are pulling out of these markets because they can't turn a profit insuring multi-million dollar houses in Hurricane Alley or Southern California." This exodus has left homeowners with rebuilt but unsellable properties, as banks refuse to issue mortgages for uninsurable homes. The situation is particularly dire in California, where the state's "Fair Plan," an insurer of last resort, may be on the hook for up to $437 billion in potential payouts, according to Bloomberg analysis. Rubino warned that this could bankrupt the state, shifting the financial burden to taxpayers. "When you've got 100,000 people with uninsurable and unsellable houses, you get a thing called the reverse wealth effect," he said. The reverse wealth effect occurs when declining asset values, such as plummeting home prices, lead to reduced consumer spending and economic contraction. Rubino compared the current crisis to the 2008 housing collapse, where overextended banks and unaffordable mortgages triggered a financial meltdown. "If a house can't be insured, it's not worth nearly the prices that have prevailed for the last decade," he said. "Prices have to plungeâmaybe 20%, 30%, or 40%âto clear the market." The implications extend beyond individual homeowners. As property values decline, local governments face reduced tax revenues, further straining public services. Meanwhile, insurance premiums for those who can still obtain coverage are skyrocketing, adding to the financial burden. Rubino also highlighted the role of inflation in exacerbating the crisis. "We've been debasing the dollar for the past 50 years, and one of the effects is that it makes property more expensive," he explained. "When houses go up in value, insurance companies have a bigger bill to pay off when that house burns down. Inflation is part of the process of making these houses uninsurable."

Title: Federal Reserve, BlackRock retreat from climate coalitions as economic realities take precedence

Full Content:
The Fed has withdrawn from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS), emphasizing its focus on monetary stability and rejecting the politicization of climate policy, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell argues is outside the central bank's mandate. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, has left the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM), leading to the suspension of the coalition. This move reflects growing financial and political pressures, particularly from Republican-led states, which accuse BlackRock of prioritizing ESG goals over fiduciary duties. Major energy corporations like BP and Shell are reducing their climate commitments, focusing on profitability and energy security. This shift highlights the economic challenges of transitioning to renewable energy, which remains dependent on subsidies. Nations pursuing net-zero goals are experiencing economic repercussions, including rising energy prices and public discontent. The U.S. is projected to spend $825 billion on clean energy subsidies over the next decade, with costs disproportionately affecting working-class households. The retreat from climate coalitions suggests a need for more realistic and economically viable approaches to energy and environmental challenges. Policymakers are encouraged to prioritize energy reliability, affordability and innovation over ideologically driven mandates.

The retreat from climate coalitions suggests a need for more realistic and economically viable approaches to energy and environmental challenges. Policymakers are encouraged to prioritize energy reliability, affordability and innovation over ideologically driven mandates. In a striking shift, major financial institutions and corporations are stepping back from ambitious climate commitments, signaling a growing recognition of the economic costs and impracticalities of such policies. The U.S. Federal Reserveâs withdrawal from the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and BlackRockâs exit from the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative (NZAM) highlight a broader retreat from climate-focused agendas that critics argue have overreached and underdelivered. The Federal Reserve: Staying in its lane The Federal Reserveâs decision to leave the NGFS, a coalition of central banks established in 2017 to address climate-related financial risks, underscores its commitment to its core mandate: monetary stability. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that climate policy is not within the central bankâs purview. âClimate matters belong to Congress, not the central bank,â Powell stated, reflecting the Fedâs reluctance to engage in politically charged initiatives. The NGFS, initially focused on integrating climate risks into financial oversight, has increasingly embraced broader, more politicized goals, such as promoting green energy agendas. This shift has drawn criticism from those who argue that such efforts conflict with sound economic principles. The Fedâs exit aligns with growing skepticism in the U.S. about the role of financial regulators in climate policy, particularly as these initiatives risk disrupting industries and inflating costs. BlackRockâs exit and the collapse of NZAM BlackRock, the worldâs largest asset manager, has also distanced itself from climate coalitions, withdrawing from the NZAM, which subsequently suspended operations. The NZAM aimed to align financial investments with net-zero carbon emissions goals, but BlackRockâs departure reflects a broader reckoning with the financial and political challenges of such initiatives. The firm faced mounting criticism, particularly from Republican-led states, for prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals over fiduciary responsibilities. States like Florida and Texas accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries, while Tennessee successfully challenged the firm in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions. Corporations scale back climate pledges The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Major energy companies, including BP and Shell, have scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing profitability over ambitious carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell cut back on renewable investments and exited power markets in Europe and China. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources, driven by the economic realities of energy security and profitability. This shift highlights a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to account for economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas continue to drive global economies. Attempts to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable alternatives have proven costly, as seen in Europeâs energy crisis. The cost of climate ambition The global retreat from climate commitments reflects a growing recognition of their economic toll. Nations that embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies and public discontent. Germany, once a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, while the UKâs climate policies have drawn criticism for burdening households and businesses. In the U.S., the Congressional Budget Office estimates that clean energy subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decadeâfar exceeding initial projections. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation. A pragmatic path forward The unraveling of climate coalitions presents an opportunity to reassess priorities. Policymakers must focus on ensuring energy reliability, affordability and innovation rather than pursuing utopian ideals. The retreat from costly and ineffective climate policies underscores the need for a more rational, economically sound approach to energy and environmental challenges. As institutions like the Federal Reserve and BlackRock step back, the broader public is beginning to question the wisdom of sweeping climate mandates. This shift marks a turning point, one that could pave the way for policies grounded in reality rather than ideology.

Sources include: WattsUpWithThat.com Reuters.com FastCompany.com Reuters.com BlackRockâs exit and the collapse of NZAM BlackRock, the worldâs largest asset manager, has also distanced itself from climate coalitions, withdrawing from the NZAM, which subsequently suspended operations. The NZAM aimed to align financial investments with net-zero carbon emissions goals, but BlackRockâs departure reflects a broader reckoning with the financial and political challenges of such initiatives. The firm faced mounting criticism, particularly from Republican-led states, for prioritizing environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals over fiduciary responsibilities. States like Florida and Texas accused BlackRock of undermining traditional energy industries, while Tennessee successfully challenged the firm in court. These pressures have created a domino effect, with other institutions reconsidering their commitments to net-zero coalitions. Corporations scale back climate pledges The retreat is not limited to financial institutions. Major energy companies, including BP and Shell, have scaled back their green initiatives, prioritizing profitability over ambitious carbon reduction goals. BP recently spun off its offshore wind projects, while Shell cut back on renewable investments and exited power markets in Europe and China. Both companies have signaled a return to traditional energy sources, driven by the economic realities of energy security and profitability. This shift highlights a foundational flaw in climate policy: the failure to account for economic realities. Renewable energy remains heavily reliant on subsidies, while oil and gas continue to drive global economies. Attempts to prematurely phase out fossil fuels without viable alternatives have proven costly, as seen in Europeâs energy crisis. The cost of climate ambition The global retreat from climate commitments reflects a growing recognition of their economic toll. Nations that embraced net-zero goals are now grappling with rising energy prices, faltering economies and public discontent. Germany, once a green energy pioneer, faces skyrocketing electricity costs and industrial flight, while the UKâs climate policies have drawn criticism for burdening households and businesses. In the U.S., the Congressional Budget Office estimates that clean energy subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act will cost $825 billion over the next decadeâfar exceeding initial projections. These costs disproportionately impact working-class households, who bear the brunt of higher energy bills and inflation.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Billionaire Louis Bacon’s Top 10 Long-Term Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where ServiceNow, Inc. (NYSE:NOW) stands against other Billionaire Louis Bacon’s long-term stock picks. Louis Bacon is one of the most prominent and successful hedge fund managers of his generation, known for his astute macroeconomic insights and ability to navigate volatile markets. As the founder of Moore Capital Management, Bacon built a reputation for delivering exceptional returns while maintaining a disciplined approach to risk management. Louis Moore Bacon was born in 1956 into a family with roots in business and the outdoors. His father, Louis Turner Bacon, was a businessman and chairman of the Reynolds Securities brokerage firm. These early influences shaped Bacon’s interest in finance and conservation. Bacon attended Middlebury College, where he earned a degree in American Literature, and later pursued an MBA at Columbia Business School, graduating in 1981. His education laid the groundwork for his successful career in trading and investment management.

Bacon started his financial career on the trading desk of Bankers Trust. Later, he joined Shearson Lehman Brothers, where he developed expertise in trading currencies, commodities, and futures. His early experiences as a trader honed his ability to identify macroeconomic trends, a skill that would define his investment strategy. In 1987, Bacon used a $25,000 inheritance to establish his own trading account. His success during the stock market crash of October 1987, when he profited by shorting the market, demonstrated his ability to capitalize on turbulent conditions. In 1989, Louis Bacon founded Moore Capital Management with $25,000 of his own money and $1.6 million in seed capital. The hedge fund focused on global macroeconomic investing, a strategy that involves analyzing and trading based on macroeconomic trends such as interest rates, currencies, and commodities. Bacon’s success was rapid and significant. In its first year, Moore Capital posted a return of 86%, showcasing Bacon’s skill in navigating volatile markets. Over the decades, Moore Capital became one of the most successful hedge funds in the industry, managing more than $14 billion at its peak.

Title: Bitcoin Custody: Enabling Big Finance To Benefit From Bitcoin

Traditional finance will need advanced custody solutions to capitalize on bitcoin. Bitcoin has come a long way from the fringes of finance to its current status as a mainstream investment asset. The rise of bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) and ETFs has made it easier than ever for institutional investors to gain bitcoin exposure. However, as billions of dollars flow into these products, a significant issue has emerged that warrants closer scrutiny: reliance on single custodians to hold the physical bitcoin that backs them. Take the iShares Bitcoin Trust by BlackRock, for instance. With over $50 billion in assets under management as of this writing, it is by far the most successful bitcoin ETF in the market. Yet, every bitcoin held in that fund is held in custody solely by Coinbase. BlackRock is a titan of finance, but the reality is that Coinbase – in addition to BlackRock – is a key source of counterparty risk for investors. This single point of failure exposes the fund to a risk of catastrophic loss about which few investors are likely to be aware. The potential fallout of this arrangement is clearly spelled out in the iShares Bitcoin Trust’s SEC registration statement: "...in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy of the Bitcoin Custodian... customers’ assets – including the Trust’s assets – may be considered the property of the Bitcoin Custodian, and customers – including the Trust – may be at risk of being treated as general unsecured creditors of such entities and subject to the risk of total loss or markdowns on value of such assets." In simpler terms, if Coinbase were to declare bankruptcy, holders of iShares Bitcoin ETF units could find themselves at the back of the line, treated as unsecured creditors with no guaranteed claim to the bitcoin backing their shares. Coinbase’s credit rating of BB– from S&P Global Ratings places it in "junk" status. That’s right – the company that is trusted with holding the physical bitcoin worth billions of dollars, has a less than stellar credit rating. As of this writing, there is no reason to question Coinbase’s ability to continue holding bitcoin in custody on behalf of its clients. But, before we dismiss this scenario as unlikely, remember that bitcoin history is littered with examples of custodian collapses – from Mt. Gox, to FTX, to Prime Trust. Single-custodian models are a holdover from traditional finance, where assets are often pooled with a single clearinghouse or bank. However, bitcoin is fundamentally different. It doesn’t require a centralized custodian, so relying on one undermines the very principles that make bitcoin valuable: trust minimization and resilience against centralized points of failure. The failure of a single custodian can happen for various reasons. Beyond bankruptcy and fraud, there’s the risk of state attacks, cyberattacks, and operational failures. Any of these events could render the assets inaccessible, even if the bitcoin itself is still visible on the blockchain. In a market that values speed, security, and autonomy, many institutional investors consider this an unacceptable risk. This is the problem solved by multi-institutional custody (MIC). MIC uses bitcoin’s native multi-signature technology to distribute custody across multiple independent institutions in different jurisdictions. Instead of one institution holding all the keys in a multi-signature quorum, MIC distributes them across several regulated custodians. This means that no single custodian can authorize transactions on its own, because a quorum of keys (for example, 2 out of 3) is required to move funds. Even if one custodian goes bankrupt or is compromised, the depositor’s bitcoin remains secure and accessible. By combining custodians in different countries with independent regulatory regimes, MIC minimizes risk of coordinated asset freezes or seizures. This distributed approach mitigates many, but not all, of the risks associated with bitcoin custodians, and is a more robust custody solution for institutional-scale investments than the solutions used most often today. The demand for secure, scalable bitcoin custody has never been higher. As ETFs, ETPs, corporate treasuries, and strategic reserves gain momentum, institutional investors will need solutions that address the risks posed by single custodians. Bitcoin service providers such as Onramp offer a multi-institution custody framework that integrates the best elements of traditional security protocols with the resilience of bitcoin’s decentralized architecture. The benefits of MIC extend beyond just security. By involving multiple custodians, institutions diversify their exposure, reducing the risk of catastrophic loss due to a single point of failure. Multi-sig setups provide cryptographic proof of reserves and require multiple parties to approve transactions, increasing oversight and accountability. Institutions can customize their custody arrangements to suit governance and compliance requirements, with the ability to add or rotate custodians as needed. One reason that trust structures are gaining traction again is that they can utilize MIC while offering tax-efficiency. Unlike ETFs, which generally require cash settlements, trusts can facilitate in-kind delivery, meaning investors can receive the underlying bitcoin itself rather than fiat cash. This eliminates a taxable event and preserves the long-term upside of holding bitcoin directly. For pension funds, endowments, and family offices seeking direct exposure to bitcoin without introducing additional counterparty risk, MIC-enabled trusts present a compelling alternative. By combining the ease of traditional financial products with the security of decentralized custody, these structures offer institutions a more efficient and resilient way to gain bitcoin exposure. The launch of spot bitcoin ETFs was a milestone for the industry, but as the market matures, the limitations of single-custodian models are becoming harder to ignore. Just as traditional finance developed multi-custodian clearinghouses and diversified asset management frameworks, new bitcoin financial products will need to be created to meet the needs of increasing numbers of institutional investors. As the market adapts to the opportunities presented by bitcoin technology, the institutions that nail security, transparency, and decentralization will be the ones best positioned to succeed.

Title: Corporate America bowed to Trump before he was even in the White House

(Reuters: Carlos Barria) It's just a jump to the left … and then a step to the right. Even before Donald Trump's inauguration, some of America's biggest corporations had decided to get in line with the new administration's version of the Rocky Horror Picture Show's Time Warp, a dance now playing out across the globe. The new president's views on everything from diversity and workplace inclusion to his opposition to policies on climate change not long ago would have sparked a backlash from many in corporate America. Instead, there's been an about face from major American companies, a shift that already has filtered through to Australia. US President Donald Trump's first days into his second term live updates: Follow with our blog US President Donald Trump's first days into his second term live updates: Follow with our blog Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg may be the poster child for the sudden U-turn. He's rid Facebook of fact checkers because of bias, an argument that instead suggests he needs better fact checkers. More recently, he's complained that workplaces need more "masculine energy". But Trump's resounding win in the US election has emboldened politicians elsewhere, including Australia, to step back on "progressive" policies and boardrooms across the developed world are taking pre-emptive action. Donald Trump's re-election was a revolt against economic policies that have left millions disenfranchised and uncertain about their place in the world. But Americans should be wary of his policies pushing inflation and debt even higher. How far leaders, both political and corporate, can afford to switch stance has its limits. Politicians need to win elections so winding back the gains women and minority groups have made in the workplace could quickly backfire at the polling booth down the track. Similarly, corporate leaders need to maximise profits if they want to keep their jobs. Most have embraced strategies around climate change not simply because the science is undeniable but because there's money to be made. Even worse, ignoring it comes at significant long-term cost, particularly if you're in an industry like insurance. Even at this early stage, there are jarring inconsistencies in the new approach. For the moment, though, almost any criticism can be dismissed by simply declaring it as "woke". Trump's second presidency has already emboldened boardrooms to take a step back on "progressive" policies. (Reuters: Andrew Kelly) For the past few years each December, Macquarie Bank published its achievements in winding back its exposures to carbon intensive industries. That was until last month, when the annual update failed to materialise and financiers globally sniffed the wind and opted to quietly pull back. Spooked by threats of legal action because the environmental aims put them at risk of ignoring their responsibility to maximise investor returns, some of the globe's biggest money managers have quietly pulled back on pledges made in the wake of the Glasgow COP21 meeting. A little over a fortnight ago, BlackRock — a titan of global finance and investment — pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, a collection of more than 300 major investment groups managing assets worth almost $US60 trillion ($97 trillion). In Australia, our woeful productivity lately is a source of puzzled discontent and finger-pointing, especially when compared with the United States. But the dark side has been made clear. That sent shivers through the industry and put money managers into a mild state of panic. Three days later, the organisation suddenly suspended itself and its activities and solemnly pledged that, rather than toiling to reduce emissions, it would keep its remaining members' identities secret. The reason? The incoming Trump administration. "Recent developments in the US and different regulatory and client expectations in investors' respective jurisdictions have led to NZAM launching a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context," it said. Among the members were a tribe of Australian outfits, including IFM Investors — the Industry Super collective that now ranks as one of the world's biggest infrastructure investors — Macquarie and Magellan. Until now, financiers have argued that climate change is an investment issue and that they don't want to be caught lending to or investing in stranded assets and that it is prudent to wind back exposure. Latching on to the new mood, Opposition Leader Peter Dutton recently lashed out at "woke bankers" and threatened to impose a new regime that would pressure banks to lend to creditworthy companies extracting fossil fuels or forestry. Some of the world's biggest money managers have distanced themselves from past Net Zero pledges. (Reuters: Jason Lee) The evolution of ESG, environment, social and governance, has been long and slow and taken place under governments of all persuasions. Since the turn of the century, investors have demanded public companies that are accountable, open to scrutiny and conform to the tighter regulation around environmental controls and labour laws. Similarly, the push towards Diversity, Equity and Inclusion within corporations has grown as laws have tightened to stamp out discrimination on gender, race and sexuality. That's emboldened senior executives of public companies to make statements that have been construed as meddling in politics. WiseTech is not the only publicly-listed company to face allegations of bad behaviour. What's the role of boards? Debate over The Voice referendum and the Same Sex Marriage plebiscite, when high profile executives from Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank weighed in, enraged some Coalition politicians including Mr Dutton who made it plain that he believed company executives should stick to providing better customer service. Having spent so much time and energy improving their workplace cultures, and with bonuses tied to implementing these programs, the bosses of our biggest companies have been actively spruiking their progress as a means of attracting top staff. Harassment within firms, sexual or otherwise, comes with a hefty price tag, with lawyers, penalties and smeared reputations. Winding back the diversity programs would need to first involve softening the law, a prospect that could backfire politically down the track. Donald Trump's message to corporate America left no margin for misunderstanding. In addition to targeting any firm with offshore plants, from now on the focus would be on hiring the best instead of trying to elevate workers on factors like diversity, equity and inclusion. America is to return to a meritocracy with gender or race playing no part. That philosophy, however, seems to jar with the ideals laid out under Project 2025 where the clear goal is only to hire Trump loyalists into the administration and much of the public service, a policy that takes "political correctness" into a new realm. There are similar contradictions on climate policy as well. During his last stint in the White House, the president withdrew America from the Paris climate commitments, and he has since championed the cause for fossil fuels with his "Drill Baby Drill" catchcry. But his seemingly outlandish plan to buy Greenland heavily revolves around climate change. US president-elect Donald Trump refuses to rule out using the military to seize control of Greenland and the Panama Canal. From a security and strategic viewpoint, the strip of ocean between Greenland and the UK has become a less hostile route for shipping as the polar cap melts, allowing Russian and Chinese ships easier access to North America. Then there are the economic attractions. The island has extraordinary amounts of natural resources. Not only is Greenland rich in oil, it also has boundless quantities of critical minerals, particularly rare earths which are vital for not only weapons production but for the technology required to produce renewable energy and electric vehicles. With a terrain once considered too harsh for wide-scale exploitation, climate change has made these minerals more accessible as the ice covering 80 per cent of the island thins. It also makes them more valuable. Donald Trump and consistency rarely appear in the same sentence, but his push to unwind diversity provisions in the workplace and environmental rules has struck a powerful chord amongst those who believe they have been left behind or unfairly overlooked. Corporate America appears to be falling in behind Trump for now. Scaling back workplace legal protections and environmental laws may prove to be a tougher task.

Title: Scotiabank Joins Wall Street-Led Exit of Bankers’ Climate Club

(Bloomberg) -- Bank of Nova Scotia is the latest major bank to walk away from the industry’s biggest climate-finance alliance, following a mass exodus led by Wall Street. The lender confirmed Monday it left the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, news that comes after Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada all said Friday they were leaving the NZBA. Scotiabank and other lenders that quit the group all said the decision won’t affect their commitment to decarbonizing their business. In Scotiabank’s case, the firm “will continue to finance the transition and support our clients in implementing their sustainability strategies — this is the most important role that we can play,” spokesperson Katie Raskina said by email, adding that the bank “will continue to report on our progress, while meeting the varied and growing requirements of regulators across the globe.” Royal Bank of Canada is the only large Canadian bank remaining in the alliance, but the country’s biggest lender has suggested it’s reconsidering that membership. Dave McKay, RBC’s chief executive officer, said in early January that pulling out of the NZBA “doesn’t lead to a non-commitment to net zero or climate change.” A representative for RBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday on the status of its membership in the group. Canadian banks were some of the biggest financiers to oil, gas and coal companies in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, RBC, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan Chase & Co. Since the beginning of December, the NZBA has been abandoned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan. The moves come as US President Donald Trump makes clear he’ll seek to roll back Biden-era climate policies and instead promote a revival of fossil-fuel production. Trump’s return has also emboldened the Republican Party in its ongoing attacks on climate finance, as states double down on bans and lawsuits. Other climate alliances have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among the asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying in NZAM had exposed it to “legal inquiries.” In 2023, a net-zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid Republican litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100 , was hit by high-profile defections last year by the asset-management arms of Goldman, JPMorgan and Pacific Investment Management Co.

As the founder of Omega Advisors, Cooperman built a reputation as one of Wall Street’s most successful hedge fund managers.

Cooperman began his professional journey at Goldman Sachs, where he worked for 25 years. He joined the firm as an analyst and rose through the ranks to lead the Asset Management division. His tenure at Goldman Sachs was marked by significant achievements, including his role in expanding the firm's institutional investment management services. In 1991, Cooperman left Goldman Sachs to establish Omega Advisors, a hedge fund specializing in value-oriented investing.

Title: Ethereum Market Takeover: Expert Predicts Surge To $14,000 In Six Months
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-surge-to-14000-in-six-months/
Time Published: 2025-01-20T18:30:15Z

In a thread on X today, January 20, Dennis Liu (@VirtualBacon0x), a general partner at Momentum 6, laid out a bold forecast for Ethereum (ETH), suggesting the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could reach a price target of $14,000 by the end of 2025. Liu also contends that the next six months will be pivotal, highlighting ETH’s potential to “dominate the market” through June. “Ethereum is about to dominate the market, you don’t want to miss this window,” Liu wrote. “Ethereum has been lagging behind Bitcoin this cycle, but that’s about to change. I believe ETH will shine in the next 6 months.” Despite ETH’s growing adoption, Liu argues that its underperformance relative to Bitcoin stems from “institutional timing.” According to him: “ETH is institutionally driven, unlike Bitcoin or retail-favored altcoins. ETFs provide stability and utility, making ETH ideal for institutional investors.” Liu suggests institutions have been waiting for market conditions to improve and sees 2025 as the year when these conditions finally align. Liu also points to the US Federal Reserve’s policy shifts as a catalyst for ETH’s growth. He notes that since May 2024, the Fed has been slowing its balance sheet reductions, and a possible pivot toward renewed liquidity injections could occur after the January 29 or March 19 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. “Since May 2024, the Fed has slowed balance sheet reductions, signaling a pivot. A liquidity boost could follow Jan 29 or Mar 19 FOMC meetings. Why it matters: Fed liquidity pumps historically drive ETH/BTC higher.” He concludes that such a move by the Fed “means ETH outperformance” could be on the horizon. Citing a decade of market data, Liu claims ETH typically outperforms Bitcoin from January to June, while Bitcoin tends to lead from July to December. “From January to June, ETH consistently outperforms Bitcoin. … If you’re holding ETH, now until June is historically the best window for gains.” Liu also highlights potential pro-ETH sentiments from the Trump administration, referencing the former president’s NFT collections and DeFi platform built on Ethereum: “His NFT collections and DeFi platform are built on Ethereum. Trump’s administration plans to replace SEC leadership, revisiting anti-DeFi rulings. Institutional optimism surged after Trump’s election win in Nov 2024, driving ETF inflows.” He concludes that “pro-crypto policies will directly benefit Ethereum-focused DeFi.” Further emphasizing Ethereum’s institutional strength, Liu points to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization initiatives by major firms like BlackRock and prominent DeFi platforms such as AAVE, MakerDAO, and OriginTrail: “Ethereum isn’t leading meme coin or AI trends – it’s powering serious institutional growth.” Liu underscores a notable shift in Ethereum ETF inflows, which turned positive in November 2024 after a period of outflows: “ETFs added $6B in net inflows from Nov to Jan, or 0.76% of ETH supply/month. … Institutions are buying more ETH than BTC monthly, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum as an asset.” Projecting out to 2025, Liu believes ETH could quadruple to $14,000 if Bitcoin doubles to $200,000, citing Ethereum’s historical tendency to outperform Bitcoin by an additional factor of two: “If Bitcoin doubles to $200K, ETH could 4x to $14K, following its historical outperformance (2x on top of BTC). … While diminishing returns may limit upside, ETH remains a high-conviction bet for this cycle.” Summarizing his perspective, Liu stresses that a confluence of factors—from renewed Fed liquidity to potential pro-DeFi policies—creates a near-term window of opportunity for Ethereum: “With ETF inflows rising, the Fed’s potential liquidity injection, Trump’s pro-DeFi stance, and ETH’s seasonal strength, all the catalysts are aligned. … Ethereum’s time to shine is now until June. I’d rather be overexposed than miss this opportunity.” At press time, ETH traded at $106,929. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email. Jake Simmons has been a Bitcoin enthusiast since 2016.

Advertisement A man with paralysis was able to fly a virtual drone through a complex obstacle course simply by thinking about moving his fingers, with signals being interpreted by an AI model By Matthew Sparkes 20 January 2025 A virtual drone was piloted through an obstacle course by a person imagining moving their fingersWillsey et al. A virtual drone was piloted through an obstacle course by a person imagining moving their fingers Willsey et al. A man with paralysis who had electrodes implanted in his brain can pilot a virtual drone through an obstacle course simply by imagining moving his fingers. His brain signals are interpreted by an AI model and then used to control a simulated drone. Brain-computer interface (BCI) research has made huge strides in recent years, allowing people with paralysis to precisely control a mouse cursor and dictate speech to computers by imagining writing words with a pen. But so far, they haven’t yet shown great promise in complex applications with multiple inputs. Read moreMind-reading AI recreates what you're looking at with amazing accuracy Read more Mind-reading AI recreates what you're looking at with amazing accuracy Advertisement Now, Matthew Willsey at the University of Michigan and his colleagues have created an algorithm that allows a user to trigger four discrete signals by imagining moving their fingers and thumb. The anonymous man who tried the technology has tetraplegia due to a spinal cord injury. He had already been fitted with a BCI from Blackrock Neurotech made up of 192 electrodes, implanted in the area of the brain that controls hand motion. An AI model was used to map the complex neural signals received by the electrodes to the user’s thoughts. The participant learned how to think of the first two fingers of one hand moving, creating an electrical signal that can be made stronger or weaker. Another signal was generated by the second two fingers and another two by the thumb. The latest science news delivered to your inbox, every day. These were sufficient to allow the user to control a virtual drone by thought alone, and with practice he could skilfully pilot it through an obstacle course. Willsey says the experiment could have been done using a real drone, but was kept virtual for ease and safety. “The goal of doing the quadcopter was really kind of shared between our lab and the participant,” says Willsey. “For him, it was the realisation of kind of a dream that he thought was lost once he suffered his injury. He had a passion and a dream for flying. He seemed very empowered and enabled; he would have us take videos and send it to friends.” Although the results are impressive, there is still much to be done before BCIs can be reliably used for complex tasks, says Willsey. Firstly, AI is needed to interpret signals from the electrodes, and this relies on individual training for every user. Secondly, this training needs to be repeated over time as functionality declines, which may be due to electrodes shifting slightly in the brain or changes in the brain itself.

Title: Trump buzz drives $2.2B inflow, setting new records for Bitcoin and AUM

Market enthusiasm for Trump's era catalyzes all-time high for Bitcoin and trading volumes. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The crypto market has recorded its highest weekly inflow this year, reaching an impressive $2.2 billion. According to the latest CoinShares report, this influx of capital was fueled by growing excitement around Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. The firm noted that the surge pushed total year-to-date inflows to $2.8 billion. This influx has also pushed assets under management (AUM) to a record high of $171 billion. The surge coincided with Bitcoin’s impressive performance, with the flagship crypto climbing nearly 20% over the past week to hit an all-time high near the $110,000 mark. Meanwhile, the market also experienced a corresponding spike in exchange-traded product (ETP) trading volumes, which reached $21 billion last week. James Butterfill, CoinShares head of research, pointed out that this number accounted for 34% of Bitcoin’s trading activity on leading exchanges. This robust number highlights growing institutional interest and the increasing mainstream adoption of crypto. Bitcoin continued its dominance, securing $1.9 billion in inflows last week and bringing its total for the year to $2.7 billion. The report highlighted that spot Bitcoin ETFs, offered by key players like BlackRock, Fidelity, Ark Invest, and Bitwise, collectively attracted over $2.1 billion in inflows. The inflows are seen as a positive response to market optimism about supportive regulatory policies expected under the incoming administration. Interestingly, short-Bitcoin products registered modest inflows of $500,000, a surprising deviation from typical bearish behavior during bullish trends. Meanwhile, Ethereum drew $246 million in inflows, marking a reversal of its previous outflows this year. However, the second-largest crypto continues to underperform in comparison to its peers. Butterfill noted that Ethereum remains the weakest performer this year from an inflow perspective despite significantly outpacing Solana, which brought in $2.5 million last week. On the other hand, XRP has proven to be a standout performer, attracting $31 million in inflows last week. Since mid-November 2024, XRP’s total inflows have reached an impressive $484 million, underscoring its growing appeal to investors. Stellar followed with smaller inflows of $2.1 million, while other altcoins showed little activity during the period. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

(Bloomberg) -- Constraints on banks’ ability to take on risk is opening the door for private credit to go after their top-tier clients. And traditional lenders are determined to make the most of it. Most Read from Bloomberg How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters For banks, private credit’s advance into the universe of investment-grade debt isn’t the latest chapter of a years-long rivalry. Rather, the drive is helping them find partners, backed by billions in funds, that are less held back by regulators’ push to minimize lending risks. Private credit is now offering high-value, tailored deals, but leans on traditional lenders to be connected with clients. The opportunity is immense, especially in the infrastructure and asset-backed space. Blackstone Inc. estimates that the potential scope for private high-grade asset-backed loans alone could surpass $30 trillion. In infrastructure, Apollo Global Management and Standard Chartered Plc just last week announced a partnership to invest as much as $3 billion in the low-carbon transition. “It’s a win-win,” Alison Rose, senior adviser at Charterhouse Capital Partners and former chief executive officer of Natwest Group Plc, said at the Bloomberg Women, Money & Power event last month. “If I were sitting in a bank, I could be keeping the relationship, keeping the M&A, I’d have a balance sheet-lite income model, and I could partner with private credit for access to different debt.” Previously, the formula to secure lending was simple: corporates would go to their banks. Flush with deposits, banks would aim to be a one-stop shop for clients. But much stricter regulatory requirements in the wake of the great financial crisis has made some lending simply too capital intensive for banks. In the meantime, private credit’s giants are increasingly teaming up with well-funded insurance partners who are on the lookout for long-dated and higher quality investments, offering fresh firepower for a sector that is looking to expand its $1.6 trillion in assets under management. “One of the biggest trends in private credit is moving into private investment grade or asset backed lending,” Scott Kapnick HPS Investment Partners’ Chief Executive Officer said last year during a teleconference on the firm’s merger with Blackrock Inc. The scale and highly customized nature of what private credit investors have been able to finance is showing to be a world away from the bread-and-butter lending that banks typically do. In November, Blackstone announced a $3.5 billion investment-grade private credit transaction for stakes in gas pipelines owned by EQT Corp. The deal was advised by Citigroup Inc. and RBC Capital Markets LLC. Apollo led a mammoth investment of $11 billion related to an Intel Corp. semiconductor plant in Ireland last year, its largest high-grade private credit transaction to date. Goldman Sachs & Co. acted as lead financial adviser to Intel. Banking Regulation “Bank regulation will continue to drive assets off bank balance sheets and into private capital,” said Leslie Mapondera, Apollo partner and co-head of European credit. “The focus is on finding these bespoke investing opportunities that are perhaps too complex for the investment-grade bond market to stomach.” At present, private credit is strongly relying on referrals from banks for investment-grade deals. Still, the sector views itself as a partner that can help traditional lenders enhance their return on equity. “The relationship with banks is highly symbiotic,” said Rob Horn, Blackstone’s global head of infrastructure and asset based credit. “We approach it in a partnership fashion, and are actually enabling them to achieve where they’re going with their business models.” And yet, for all the enthusiasm about a mutually beneficial co-existence, concerns linger over whether private credit would eventually chip away at banks’ position as the primary go-between. “At what point does private credit take the relationship away from the banks?” Rose said. Working Together Private credit’s expansion wouldn’t develop as a seamless partnership of equals, said John Cronin, a financial industry analyst at SeaPoint Insights. “I’d be somewhat cynical about this kind of cozy relationship persisting into the future in perpetuity with no real disruption risk,” he said. Still, private credit is a useful tool for banks to optimize their clients’ capital structure, said Giulio Baratta, BNP Paribas SA’s head of investment-grade finance debt capital markets for Europe, Middle East and Africa. Typical deals in the investment-grade space entail subordinated, asset-financing and quasi-equity transactions, he said. “Private credit provides an opportunity for companies that are seeking bespoke forms of financing or capital raising, taking advantage of private credit’s highly customizable nature,” Baratta said. “It is the early stages of something very interesting.” (Updates with comments from HPS’s CEO Scott Kapnick in the seventh paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

LONDON (Reuters) -The dollar fell broadly on Monday, while European stocks jumped, after an official for the incoming U.S. administration said President-elect Donald Trump would stop short of imposing tariffs at his inauguration, which takes place later in the day. European equity markets were firmly in positive territory in afternoon trading after the Wall Street Journal reported Trump would not impose import tariffs immediately after he's sworn in later on Monday. The dollar tumbled by as much as 1.3% at one point, falling particularly hard against the currencies of the United States' largest trading partners, such as the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the euro and China's yuan. German specialty chemicals maker Lanxess said on Monday it expected its fourth-quarter core profit to exceed market expectations by more than 20%, largely due to pre-buying by U.S. customers ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration given the threat of potential tariffs. Shares in Lanxess, which makes high-end speciality chemicals such as additives, lubricants, flame retardants and plastics, were up 6.4% in afternoon trading. "The fourth quarter was positively influenced by a stronger than expected December, in particular due to customers’ pre-buying," the company said in a statement, flagging that the underlying macroeconomic environment had not improved.

Title: Factbox-Trump's inauguration marks new era for cryptocurrency

By Tom Wilson (Reuters) - Advocates and holders of crypto will soon influence U.S. policy on the emerging technology after a slew of nominations and advisory appointments by President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Monday. The crypto industry has spent years fighting lawsuits and enforcement actions by the U.S. government. It hopes the incoming Trump administration will mark a shift in policy. Political appointees will be vetted for potential conflicts. Some have committed to selling their interests. The industry is hosting a sold-out black tie ball in Washington on Friday, with tickets ranging from $2,500 to $10,000. David Sacks, Trump's artificial intelligence and crypto czar, is scheduled to attend. Below are some facts on the crypto positions of key members of the incoming administration and Trump's inner circle. SCOTT BESSENT A billionaire hedge fund manager, Trump's pick to be Treasury Secretary has spoken favorably about crypto. "Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay," he told Fox News in July. "I think everything is on the table with bitcoin." According to a financial disclosure filed last month, Bessent holds shares in a BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) bitcoin exchange-traded fund worth between $250,001 and $500,000. Bessent will divest his interests in the fund and other investments within 90 days of his confirmation, he wrote last week to the U.S. Treasury. Bessent did not respond to a request for comment. HOWARD LUTNICK Trump's choice for Secretary of Commerce is a vocal supporter of bitcoin. Lutnick is CEO of New York brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, which earns fees to manage billions of dollars' worth of U.S. Treasuries for Tether, the company that issues the eponymous stablecoin. "Do I own bitcoin? Of course I do," Lutnick said at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in July. "Does Cantor Fitzgerald own bitcoin? A shedload of bitcoin." Lutnick did not respond to a request for comment. ELON MUSK The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief and world's richest man, chosen by Trump to oversee a government cost-cutting effort, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, has long championed crypto including bitcoin and dogecoin. His public comments and actions of his companies have in recent years influenced the price of bitcoin and dogecoin, a smaller token conceived as a joke during an earlier crypto bubble. The acronym for Musk's cost-cutting agency, DOGE, is a nod to dogecoin, which is now the world's seventh-biggest crypto token based on its circulation of $4.5 billion, according to data provider CoinGecko. In 2021 Tesla bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin, becoming one of the biggest companies to own crypto before selling most of its holdings. It held unspecified digital assets totaling $184 million in September 2024, a company financial report showed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment sent via Tesla on what crypto assets he may hold. VIVEK RAMASWAMY Set to work with Musk at DOGE, the former presidential candidate and entrepreneur is the founder of Strive Asset Management. Strive, which said in September it managed over $1 billion in assets, last month filed to launch an exchange-traded fund that invests in corporate bonds for bitcoin investments. The company's wealth management arm, launched in November, seeks to integrate bitcoin into Americans' investment portfolios, Ramaswamy said in a press release. In June 2023, Ramaswamy held $100,001 to $250,000 of bitcoin and $15,001 to $50,000 worth of the smaller token ether, according to a financial disclosure. He did not respond to a request for comment. DAVID SACKS A former PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) executive, Sacks was appointed White House artificial intelligence and crypto czar in December, tasked with developing a U.S. legal framework long sought by the crypto industry. Sacks is a co-founder of venture capital firm Craft Ventures. The firm has invested in crypto firms including BitGo and Bitwise, its website shows. Sacks did not respond to requests for comment. STEVE WITKOFF Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, a real estate tycoon and donor to the incoming president, founded crypto venture World Liberty Financial in November. World Liberty, which sells a proprietary token, lists on its website Trump as among those entitled to a large share of any of the company's revenues. Witkoff did not respond to requests for comment. ERIC TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP JR., BARRON TRUMP Eric Trump told Reuters last year he was very involved in World Liberty, which he, his elder brother Don Jr. - seen as the most influential family member in the presidential transition - and younger half-brother Barron helped to form. Eric told a bitcoin conference in December the technology was a "financial revolution," and that his father would make the United States the crypto capital of the world. JD (NASDAQ:JD) VANCE U.S. Vice President-elect Vance held between $250,001 and $500,000 in bitcoin in August 2024, according to a financial disclosure. The venture capital firm co-founded by Vance, Narya, has made investments in Strive, Ramaswamy's asset management company, and video platform Rumble, its website shows. In November, Rumble said it would allocate its excess cash reserves to bitcoin. The company also received last year a $775 million investment from stablecoin firm Tether. Asked for comment on the crypto stances of Vance and Trump's sons, Trump-Vance transition spokesperson Brian Hughes said - without providing evidence - that bureaucrats in Washington had sought to stifle innovation with more regulation and higher taxes. "President Trump will deliver on his promise to encourage American leadership in crypto and other emerging technologies," he said in a statement to Reuters. PAUL ATKINS Atkins, a lawyer and former top SEC official, is Trump's choice to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission and has advocated for deregulation. He is expected to take a softer approach to crypto than current Chair Gary Gensler. Atkins is chief executive of Patomak Global Partners (NYSE:GLP), a consultancy. Patomak advises "cutting-edge crypto-native companies" and traditional financial firms on how to "leverage digital assets for growth," its website says. Atkins did not respond to a request for comment.

Title: Four Canadian Banks Quit Climate Group as Exodus Begun by Wall Street Picks Up

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Montreal and National Bank of Canada said Friday that they’re no longer members of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. All four added that they’re still committed to meeting climate-related targets. The departures raise further questions about NZBA’s future. Defections from the group began last month when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. left. The firm’s exit was followed by Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Investor Climate Group Suspends Activities After BlackRock Exit: Reuters Exclusive The moves coincide with intensifying Republican attacks on what US conservatives call “woke” capitalism and criticisms that such voluntary alliances haven’t had a meaningful impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Now, the defections are stretching to Canada. Banks that sign up to NZBA commit to transition their financed emissions to align with “pathways to net zero by 2050” at the latest, according to the group’s website. They’re also required to provide 2030 targets to show they’re on track, and to document their progress. NZBA sent a message to members earlier this week, saying it was focusing on its “next phase” to continue to help banks manage their climate-related risks and opportunities. The alliance, which was convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative almost four years ago, still has more than 135 members from over 40 countries, according to its website. BMO Chief Executive Officer Darryl White said at an industry conference last week that the bank supports the transition to a low-carbon economy regardless of the “mechanism.” He added that the company also has “a commitment, particularly here in Canada, to our legacy energy customers completely. We won’t abandon that.” In announcing its decision to leave NZBA, BMO said Friday that it has “robust internal capabilities to implement relevant international standards, supporting our climate strategy and meeting regulatory requirements.” Toronto-Dominion said in its statement that it has “the resources, relationships and capabilities to continue to advance our strategy, deliver for our shareholders, and advise our clients as they adapt their businesses and seize new opportunities.” Montreal-based National Bank, Canada’s sixth-largest lender, said it has decided to “streamline how we report on our plans and our progress.” CIBC said the company recognizes “the scale and urgency of climate change and our stated goals and commitments remain the same” Canadian banks were some of the biggest providers of finance to oil, gas and coal in 2024, with Toronto-Dominion, Royal Bank of Canada, BMO and CIBC ranking among the top 10 for such deals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest provider of fossil-fuel finance last year was JPMorgan. Other climate alliances also have lost high-profile members. Just over a week into the new year, BlackRock Inc. said it was ending its membership in the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. The firm, which was among a group of asset managers singled out in a lawsuit led by Texas alleging antitrust breaches due to the adoption of pro-climate strategies that suppress coal production, said staying inside NZBA had and exposed it to “legal inquiries.” In 2023, a net zero group for insurers saw a mass walkout amid GOP litigation threats. A similar group for investors, Climate Action 100+, was hit by high-profile defections last year as the asset management arms of Goldman and JPMorgan, as well as Pacific Investment Management Co. all left.

Title: Box, Inc. (BOX) Unveils AI-Powered Enterprise Advanced Plan to Transform Content Management and Workflow Automation

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) stands against the other AI stocks. As President Joe Biden nears the end of his term, he is issuing a series of executive orders. In the latest, the President has signed an order to provide federal support to address the massive energy needs of fast-growing advanced artificial intelligence data centers. READ NOW: Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street’s Radar and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar The order will allow federal land owned by the Defense and Energy departments to host gigawatt-scale AI data centers and new clean power facilities. According to Biden, the order will "accelerate the speed at which we build the next generation of AI infrastructure here in America, in a way that enhances economic competitiveness, national security, AI safety, and clean energy”. According to the order, companies tapping federal land for AI data centers must also purchase an "appropriate share" of American-made semiconductors. These purchases will be decided on a case-by-case basis. "It's really vital that we ensure that the AI industry can build out the infrastructure for training and using powerful AI models here in the United States”. Several known names, including OpenAI Senior Vice President of Global Affairs Chris Lehane, have commended this effort. Lehane also called out for cultivating a robust domestic infrastructure for the growing U.S. artificial intelligence sector. “So what you get with the Biden administration today is — at least from a signaling perspective — on federal land, trying to short the timeline between when you can get your project shovels in the ground and then the project going forward”. According to Lehane, the incoming Trump administration sees AI through two lenses — national security and economic security. He hopes that both sides of the coin will amalgamate into a national strategy. AI Company OpenAI has also recently laid out its vision for artificial intelligence development in the U.S. According to the company, the US needs investment from abroad and supportive regulation to stay ahead of China in the race for nascent technology. In a 15-page document called the “Economic Blueprint”, it said that "Chips, data, and energy are the keys to winning AI" and that the U.S. needs to act now to craft nationwide rules that can help secure its advantage. OpenAI released the document days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, with CEO Sam Altman also previously donating around $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund in hopes of fostering a positive relationship. "There's an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn't attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects —strengthening the Chinese Communist Party's global influence”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In recent months, investors have taken a renewed interest in quantum computing. For this reason, most industry analysts believe quantum computing is years away from commercial viability. Fortunately, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) has developed a quantum chip that is a possible game changer for the industry. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) was founded in 1993, and it went on to create the world's first graphics processing units (GPUs) for computing, media, and gaming applications. Now, decades later, the company has adapted those powerful chips for data centers, where they are used to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes data center operators will spend $1 trillion over the next four years on upgrading their infrastructure to meet demand from AI developers. There are plenty of great stocks that offer attractive dividends and don't cost too much. Here are my picks for the smartest dividend stocks to buy with $100 right now. You can scoop up a share of Ares Capital (NASDAQ: ARCC) for roughly $23 at its current price. What to know before you accept the loan. After reaching record highs last year, shares of Monolithic Power Systems have slumped more than 30% since the firm's last earnings report at the end of October, but analysts remain bullish on the stock. It would be reasonable to assume that none of these businesses have bargain stocks. Patient investors looking not only for growth, but for protection during market volatility, should take a closer look. With a market cap of about $990 billion, most investors are already very familiar with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). Consider these pros and cons before starting a position in this leading cryptocurrency. Investors brace for a volatile ride as President-elect Donald Trump’s second term gets underway on Monday, bringing the promise of significant policy shifts. Investors would be wise to pay closer attention to the World Economic Forum about to kick off in Davos, Switzerland.
