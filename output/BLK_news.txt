Punnam Raju Manthena, Co-Founder & CEO at Tekskills Inc. Partnering with clients across the globe in their digital transformation journeys. The gender gap in the workplace remains a key business and economic issue. Back in 2015, a McKinsey report found that reducing the gender gap could add about $12 trillion to $28 trillion to the global GDP by 2025. In 2024, the chief economist for the World Bank stated that closing the gender gap "could raise global gross domestic product by more than 20%." For years, business leaders have been called on to deal with gender equality as an economic need and fundamental right, but progress is still stalled. According to findings from BlackRock, companies "with the most diverse workforces outperformed their country and industry group peers with the least-diverse workforces in terms of return on assets." Businesses with about 30% women in senior positions are 15% more profitable, as per the Victorian Government. This same report found that Australia's GDP would go up by 11% if the gender gap closed. All these point to a serious need for gender equality. So, not only is gender equality beneficial to business and society but equally importantly, gender inequality is detrimental to both. But, as an employer, how do you move toward gender equality? Can AI, the supposed game changer in the IT industry, help gender equality? The advent of AI could potentially open employment doors for women in a big way. AI, or AI-driven automation, is creating several jobs or roles that we did not think of earlier. Aside from technical skills, AI-related roles call for focused nature, communication, collaboration, adaptability, ability to learn, critical thinking, problem-solving, functional knowledge, etc. AI is data-driven and, hence, has the potential to be unbiased—but only if properly trained. Leveraging AI, employers could help develop more inclusive practices in hiring, appraising, awarding hikes, promoting and dealing with career breaks. This could help negate gender-induced interferences and discrimination. Employers could use AI to help rewrite pay-related policies or identify employees who may otherwise get passed over for promotions or those who may leave. Using AI, employers could gather data from multiple sources, viz. incidents, surveys, etc., to identify harassment possibilities, and provide for anonymous reporting, enabling more employees to report without fearing retaliation. This could help businesses build a safe online working environment with a focus on reducing workplace harassment. In doing so, organizations can create a supportive environment and prioritize mitigating the risks associated with workplace misconduct. That said, human intervention is crucial due to the risks associated with AI. However, gender bias in AI is still a very real issue and risk. Women make up only about 33% of the tech employees and only 8% of the managerial roles as per PWC, so have the representation needed to address these biases. A study by the Berkeley Haas Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership analyzed 133 AI systems in multiple domains and saw that about 44% of them showed gender prejudice. There could be inherent and unintentional gender biases in systems, and since AI works with the available data, these already-existent prejudices may come into play. These prejudices, social barriers, notions, etc., are all hard to break and are difficult to get beyond. Therefore, AI ethics is paramount in this discussion. The tech industry needs to get more women in AI to counter this issue consciously. According to UN Women, "The AI field needs more women, and that requires enabling and increasing girls’ and women’s access to and leadership in STEM and ICT education and careers." To overcome these barriers, tech leaders need to eliminate these biases. We need to ensure women engineers, developers and coders are involved in the creation and training of AI systems. We need to ensure we're genuinely creating a level playing field in hiring, learning, upskilling, appraising and advancing opportunities. To turn things around and achieve greater gender equality at work, we need to prioritize inclusivity when developing these systems, and having many perspectives involved in developing and training AI models can help negate gender-oriented biases. Business leaders need to carefully monitor and advise when implementing AI in HR functions. Human oversight is key to the ethical use of the technology. Employers should ensure their HR teams develop clear and transparent goals, a mature data strategy, proper deployment (of proven tools, technologies and sources), awareness creation, and regular evaluation and course correction where necessary, etc. These guidelines should then be shared with employees at all levels to ensure the company is on the same page. Employers have the potential to create a level playing field in hiring, upskilling, appraising, etc.—to help achieve greater gender equality at work. AI could be a potential asset in a larger gender equality strategy. Those creating AI systems for employers need to develop and train these AI models to negate gender-oriented perspectives; it falls on employers to reframe policies, build a safe online environment and create a supportive environment.

Title: Bitcoin Is Suddenly Braced For A Huge Elon Musk And Tesla Earthquake Ahead Of Critical Price ‘Tipping Point’

Bitcoin has swung wildly this last week after Tesla chief executive Elon Musk issued a surprise crypto endorsement. Unlock over $3,000 in perks including unparalleled access to a community of top Web3 entrepreneurs, creators, and investors, providing you with premium networking, priority access to global events, Free access to Forbes.com and our Forbes CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor newsletter. Apply now! The bitcoin price, up over 200% since its recent 2022 lows, has soared this year thanks to Wall Street giant BlackRock leading a bitcoin and crypto "revolution." Now, as Elon Musk warns the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy," traders are braced for his electric car company Tesla to post its third quarter earnings, potentially revealing why it suddenly moved its near-$800 million worth of bitcoin last week. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Elon Musk's Tesla sent shock waves through the bitcoin and crypto market when it suddenly moved its ... [+] bitcoin last week, fueling fears Musk could either crash or boost the bitcoin price. "We believe that the Tesla wallet movements that we reported on last week were wallet rotations with the bitcoin still owned by Tesla," blockchain sleuths with Arkham Arkham Intelligence posted to X, adding: "Tesla moved their entire balance of 11,509 bitcoin ($776.9 million) to new wallets." Tesla suddenly moving its bitcoin last week, the first time it's moved for around two years, sparked speculation that it was being moved for an over-the-counter sale. In early 2022, Musk sold off the majority of the $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin he had added to Tesla's balance sheet a year earlier to secure a quarterly profit for the company. Tesla will post its 2024 third-quarter results after the U.S. market closes on Wednesday, October 23, and may reveal why it moved its bitcoin. Tesla is the fourth largest corporate holder of bitcoin after bitcoin mining companies Riot and Marathon and Michael Saylor's software company MicroStrategy—which holds $17 billion worth of bitcoin. This week, Musk surprised the bitcoin and crypto market with an endorsement after recently directing his attention toward criticism of the U.S. spending, repeatedly warning the U.S. is hurtling toward the brink of "bankruptcy." "I think cryptocurrency is an interesting and probably valuable bulwark against centralized control," Musk said, speaking at a campaign rally for former U.S. president Donald Trump in Pittsburgh when asked by an attendee whether the cryptocurrency XRP XRP could be incorporated into the financial system. "Crypto by its very nature helps with individual freedom," Musk said, adding he wasn't endorsing XRP or any other specific cryptocurrency. Musk later said he "wasn't actively involved in crypto," dodging a question about whether blockchains, the technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, could be used in future elections to reduce or eliminate voter fraud. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has surged back toward its all-time highs this year, with Tesla and Elon Musk ... [+] poised to trigger a major bitcoin price move. Meanwhile, bitcoin and crypto traders are closely watching the polls ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election, which could be a bitcoin price "tipping point." "Take a bird’s eye view of bitcoin, and the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency has been stuck in a holding pattern since March. The question on everyone’s lips is, ‘what will it take to move it?'" Richard Ptardio, cryptocurrency and financial markets analyst, said in emailed comments. "Bitcoin bulls are looking at next month’s U.S. election as the tipping point. Should Donald Trump be returned to the White House, the promise of a low-regulation administration and the likely removal of Gary Gensler as U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair could break the resistance required for new all-time highs," Ptardio said. Trump has enthusiastically embraced bitcoin and crypto this year, backing his family's World Liberty Financial crypto project and selling four non-fungible token (NFT APENFT ) collections. Speaking earlier this year at a bitcoin conference, Trump promised to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve if reelected and predicted the bitcoin price could eventually eclipse gold. "However, even with Trump in office, bears may be right to sound a note of caution," Ptardio said. "There are signs that bitcoin is no longer the safe haven from the type of geo-political uncertainty that tends to follow him." One Community. Many Voices.

Title: Jim Cramer on The Walt Disney Company (DIS): ‘I Say Buy More Disney’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stands against the other Jim Cramer stocks. Jim Cramer recently highlighted a promising start to earnings season, pondering whether the two-year-old bull market can continue its upward trajectory during an episode of Mad Money. To address this, Cramer emphasized the importance of keeping emotions in check, cautioning against complacency. He turned to analysis by Jessica Inskip, a prominent figure in the investment community who currently serves as the Director of Investor Research at StockBrokers.com. Inskip, who co-hosts the Market MakeHer podcast, has made important forecasts, including identifying the bottom in big tech growth stocks earlier this year. “... She nailed the bottom in big tech growth stocks this spring, and she's been generally bullish, constructive on the major averages all year. And those are terrific calls. Well, as Inskip sees it, things are looking pretty darn good. But even as the rally's broadening out, moving away from just the Magnificent Seven to a whole host of smaller stocks, she says, we still need tech to participate if we're going to get another leg higher. Tech doesn't have to lead the way anymore, but it has to at least follow the leaders.” Cramer then shifted the conversation to the broader market, querying the potential of stocks outside the tech giants. He pointed out the value of the S&P 500 Equal Weight index, where all 500 components carry equal importance, contrasting it with the traditional market capitalization-weighted index, which heavily favors a few large companies. Cramer noted that 2024 has been particularly favorable for the 493 other stocks within the S&P 500, as the Equal Weight index has shown impressive performance. “First, you can see this thing's been doing great because 2024 has been all about the other 493 stocks in the index. Second, Inksip sees a lot to like here. The trading cycle for the S&P 500 Equal Weight is bullish. “ Cramer mentioned that Inskip is keenly watching for higher highs in this sector. While some technicians may view a rising RSI as a warning sign, Inskip reassures that it is not a concern as long as prices continue to climb. Currently, the S&P Equal Weight index remains well above its key quarterly moving averages, according to Inskip. Cramer reiterated the importance of this Equal Weight perspective, emphasizing that the performance is not overly reliant on the Magnificent Seven, as the broader index is being supported by the remaining stocks. Turning to the Nasdaq 100, which features the hundred largest non-financial stocks on the Nasdaq, Cramer acknowledged that while Inskip sees it in a bullish trading cycle, it hasn’t yet reached new highs like the S&P. Nevertheless, the quarterly moving averages are still trending upward, providing support. Inskip pointed out that the Nasdaq made a higher high back in July, but for it to gain real momentum, it must surpass that peak. Once that level is breached, she believes it could trigger a broader market rally. Coming toward the conclusion, Cramer said: “Bottom line, the charts interpreted by Jessica Inskip are looking pretty darn good for the S&P and the Nasdaq 100… We've got a much broader bull market than we had six months ago. But if it's going to keep running, Inskip says we need to see some meaningful participation from tech.” Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of stocks that Cramer was bullish on during episodes of Mad Money aired in October. We narrowed the list to 10 stocks that were most favored by analysts. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside as of October 18. The average price target upside was calculated while the market was open. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s Q2 database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A packed theater of moviegoers watching a blockbuster film produced by the entertainment company. Average Price Target Upside: 15.87% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 During a previous episode of Mad Money in October, Cramer said that he is a buyer of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock. “It’s come down quite a bit. It sells at 18 times earnings. It’s down today because of I think the storms, but you know what? Disney is doing much better than people realize. And it’s about time, people started giving a little more respect. I’m a buyer of it. The analysts are dumping all over it. They’re dumping all over it now. I say buy more Disney.” Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is one of the biggest names in the global entertainment industry, engaging in various sectors such as film and television production, streaming services, and theme park operations. On October 15, UBS maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $120. UBS expects results for the fourth quarter to show challenges in the Parks division while highlighting profitability in direct-to-consumer segments, improved box office performance, and consistent trends in linear television. The firm projects a year-over-year revenue increase of 7.2%, estimating an EBIT rise to $3.7 billion from $3 billion in the previous year, which could lead to a 33% growth in earnings per share for the quarter. For fiscal year 2024, the firm expects EPS growth exceeding 30%, aligning with management's guidance of $4.92. Furthermore, mid-single-digit EPS growth is expected for fiscal year 2025, with the potential benefits from the deconsolidation of India assets and cost efficiencies from Hulu expected to create additional opportunities as the year unfolds. Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is set to introduce a new attraction entry pass called the Lightning Lane Premier Pass. It allows guests willing to pay between $129 and $449 to enjoy exclusive access to some of the park's most popular attractions. A limited number of these passes will be available starting October 23 at Disneyland in California, followed by a launch at Disney World a week later. Overall DIS ranks 10th on our list of Jim Cramer stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of DIS as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than DIS but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Tokenization Unstoppable: Mega Whale Holds 3 Tons of Gold Onchain

Gold, the original store of value, is inching closer to $3,000 and is currently trading above $2,700, printing fresh all-time highs in the process. As the yellow metal stretches gains, capital may flow to Bitcoin, the digital alternative, forcing the world’s most valuable coin above $74,000. While gold and Bitcoin have advantages, with the more suave favoring the fluidity of BTC, one holder seems to be interested in both. A recent analysis by Arkham, a blockchain intelligence firm, reveals that one wallet holds over $250 million in Tether Gold. In the real world, this tokenized stash weighs approximately 3 tons. For now, the owner of this tokenized stash remains unknown. However, using AI, Arkham speculates that the 3 tons of gold belong to RhinoFi. According to on-chain data, the layer-2 bridge has processed over $2.3 billion worth of assets from more than 48.8 million transactions. It currently bridges 31 chains, connecting over 2 million accounts. Tether Gold is technically a stablecoin tracking the real-world value of gold. As of October 22, over 246,520 tokens of digital gold had been minted on Ethereum. According to Ethplorer, there are 2,618 token holders making more than 39,500 transfers. Although it cannot be immediately determined that RhinoFi controls nearly 50% of all Tether Gold in circulation, tokenization is picking up traction. The success of USD-backed stablecoins like USDT and USDC and their widespread adoption, especially in emerging economies, explain why they are here to stay. Converting real-world assets into tokens on public ledgers like Ethereum or Polygon makes it easier for users to transfer and gain exposure. The CEO of BlackRock predicts the tokenization market will command trillions in the next few years. Coingecko data shows over $7.9 billion of assets have been tokenized. Most of them are on Ondo, Pendle, and Mantra. Beyond Tether Gold, other tokenized alternatives include Pax Gold and Quorium. In addition to gold, real estate and United States Treasuries have been tokenized. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, currently issues BUIDL on Ethereum. Looking at rwa.xyz data, over $2.4 billion worth of United States treasuries, bonds, and other cash equivalents have been tokenized. BlackRock’s BUIDL currently manages over $550 million of tokenized treasuries. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Ambani’s Jio in Talks With Allianz for Insurance JVs in India

Jio Financial Services Ltd., controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has held talks with Allianz SE to set up an insurance partnership in India as the German firm seeks to scrap two existing joint ventures in the country, according to people familiar with the matter. Allianz and Jio Financial are looking to establish a general insurance and a life insurance company in the South Asian nation, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The discussions are in early stages and both parties may decide not to proceed with the plan, the people said. The Munich-based firm has indicated to its current partner Bajaj Finserv Ltd. that it’s “actively considering an exit” from the ventures, according to a statement from Bajaj on Tuesday after Bloomberg News reported the planned split. Allianz “has indicated that it remains committed to the Indian insurance market,” according to the statement. The break-up centers around a dispute over the direction of the partnership, people familiar with the matter had said. A spokesperson for Jio Financial said the firm is unable to comment on speculation. “If and when there are any material developments with respect to the company, we will continue to make necessary disclosures in accordance with our obligations, as we always have,” the spokesperson added. Allianz doesn’t comment on market rumors, a Munich-based spokesperson said. Jio Financial, helmed by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, already runs a shadow bank and an insurance brokerage and has joined forces with BlackRock Inc. to start an asset management business. Setting up insurance operations will help further the Ambani unit’s ambition of becoming a financial services behemoth. India’s insurance penetration rate — the ratio of premiums to gross domestic product — is less than half that of countries such as South Africa and Canada, implying strong growth prospects for the sector, insurance regulator data show.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 279 Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an American multinational corporation and technology company that develops and markets software, services, and hardware. The company’s AI strategy is evident through its partnership with OpenAI and the integration of AI across Azure, Office 365, and security solutions which together create a strong ecosystem. On Monday, October 21, Microsoft had its “AI Tour” in London, announcing the rollout of its Copilot AI features designed to enhance productivity by automating routine administrative tasks. The company plans to allow businesses to create their own autonomous agents within the Copilot Studio, Microsoft’s platform for building and customizing its “Copilot” assistants, fending off challenges from Salesforce. These agents can be built in the studio with low code or no code instructions, which in turn allow users to create AI-driven workflows without needing major technical expertise. The software will be available for public preview next month. The technology company has also revealed that it will launch 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365, which is the company’s suite of enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management apps. The company’s autonomous agents aim to achieve a return on investment in AI. As per CFO Amy Hood, the company has spent $19 billion on capital expenditures, including finance leases, a large portion of which was derived from AI and cloud-related needs. With 2.1 million users engaged with Copilot, Microsoft is banking heavily on the platform to generate revenues. As of Q4, the company achieved $36.8 billion in quarterly revenue from its cloud services, which includes its AI platform, a 21% year-over-year increase. While all these announcements may seem like a big leap for Microsoft, the company received a rare downgrade last month over concerns about the tech giant’s over-reliance on Nvidia for its AI infrastructure. On September 23, analysts at D.A. Davidson, an investment banking company, downgraded the company’s stock from “Buy” to “Neutral”, keeping their price target unchanged at $475. While the analysts are still positive about Microsoft, they note how the company lags behind its rivals in AI chip development, something its rivals started working on as early as a decade ago. “They started their chip development later than Amazon and Google. But apart from that, they’re doing what they need to do.” Overall MSFT ranks 1st on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of MSFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 179 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global technology company engineering the most advanced chips, systems, and software for the AI factories of the future. The company is said to represent “the dominant” infrastructure player behind the current rise of the AI sector. Wall Street is abuzz with excitement about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s new AI chip, Blackwell. Sector analysts are enthusiastic about the company’s potential major upside in the fourth quarter with all the initial rush of Blackwell. On October 18, Ram Ahluwalia, Lumida Wealth Management CEO, discussed on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts how things are looking up for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) . According to Lumida CEO, the company is still in the “early innings” and expects that Nvidia’s stock will reach $150 between now and the end of the year. With the hyperscalers intending to each spend between $50 and $100 billion on GPU compute, the primary beneficiary is going to be NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), he says. Lumidia's CEO further commented how the company has a class of its own and doesn’t have a “close competitor”. There is a growing confidence that the chip giant will be the first Tech firm to reach a $4 trillion valuation. "We made a call earlier this year that Nvidia would be the most valuable company in the world. It achieved that milestone yesterday, and the demand for GPU chips is strong. And you're seeing enterprises start to get some ROI (return on investment) on it from the early adopters”. On Friday, October 18, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated his “Buy” rating on the stock, raising his price target by $25 to $190. From Taiwan Semiconductor's (one of Nvidia’s major suppliers) third-quarter results to the “insane” demand for Blackwell chips as quoted by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, the analyst believes that recent industry trends have the potential to increase the company’s lead and generational opportunity. Furthermore, “underappreciated” enterprise partnerships with companies are also catalysts for more growth. “We also highlight a growing presence of AI in enterprise, where NVDA is the partner of choice (more on pg. 10)”. According to the bank’s forecast, the AI technology market will grow from $45 billion in 2023 to $117 billion this year while Nvidia maintains a 75% market share, which translated to a staggering $272 billion in AI computing revenues for Nvidia by 2030. Arya also believes the company could see at least $200 billion in free cash flow generation over the next two years. Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal.

As Meta's customers use more AI services across its platforms, we're helping provide Meta with a seamless, effortless, and flexible network that will meet its growing needs." Following the partnership news, Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan stated that the partnership is unlikely to move Lumen’s stock. He maintains a “Market Perform” rating on Lumen. He also emphasized that this action appears to be part of the previously announced $5 billion conduit network transaction from August. "We do not believe this announcement warrants any near-term moves in the shares as it is likely already reflected in the outlook”. Overall LUMN ranks 12th on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of LUMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LUMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ:RR) stands against the other AI stocks investors should not miss. Artificial Intelligence developments are making headlines across various sectors. From high-profile legal battles to groundbreaking advancements in model performance and safety protocols, AI is reshaping the landscape across industries at an unprecedented pace. READ ALSO: 15 AI News Investors Should Not Miss and 20 Trending AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings Before we move on to the breaking news on AI, let’s talk about Morningstar’s recent report. The investment research firm reveals that for the third consecutive year, investors are leaving exchange-traded funds related to specific themes for funds linked to broad stock-market benchmarks "that are hitting record highs". Despite overall growth in equity ETFs, thematic ETFs have lost $5.8 billion in investor capital in the year 2024. This is greater than $4.8 billion outflows in all of 2023. The reason? Broad market index returns are setting a higher bar for thematic funds this year. "It's not that people don't like the idea of themes any longer, but that a bull market dominated by a handful of megacaps makes it hard for any theme to stand out”. As per Morningstar, thematic ETFs often struggle due to mistimed investments, with investors usually missing out on two-thirds of their returns. Despite some AI-themed funds having strong holdings, higher fees and timing challenges reduce their overall appeal. "I think that when S&P 500 megacaps stop delivering the way they do today, the focus will shift back to thematic ETFs”. Moreover, while AI remains a key focus in many thematic ETFs, its impact goes far beyond investing. Consider Penguin Random House, the first of the Big Five anglophone trade publishers to amend its copyright information. The publisher has recently added a language to its copyright pages to prohibit the use of those books to train AI. Publishers and AI firms will be increasingly clashing in the future if clear guidelines and processes aren’t kept in place. In a similar endeavor, The New York Times has sent Perplexity AI, an AI-powered research firm, a "cease and desist" notice demanding that it stop using the newspaper's content for generative AI purposes. The news publisher claims that the way the AI Company uses its material violates copyright law. In other news, Anthropic, a U.S.-based artificial intelligence public-benefit startup, is now adding a comprehensive update to its safety policy, reinforcing the guardrails of its AI as it becomes more capable. This push to improve AI safety is in stark contrast to competitors such as OpenAI, whose increasing focus on improving capabilities and performance is very likely to threaten safety guidelines in the future. As per McKinsey, 63% of companies consider inaccuracy risk to be relevant. However, only 38% of companies are working to mitigate the risk. While artificial intelligence may be intimidating, it is equally, if not more, beneficial for mankind. In its latest achievement, AI has helped UCLA researchers develop a deep-learning framework that teaches itself to automatically analyze and diagnose MRIs and other 3D medical images. That too, with the accuracy matching that of medical specialists in a fraction of the time. Another breakthrough from Archetype AI, a physical AI company, is set to significantly change how we understand and interact with the physical world. The model, named Newton, shows the unparalleled capacity to generalize across diverse physical phenomena using only raw sensor measurements as input. Finally, in our roundup of the latest AI news, the US rules that will ban certain US investments in artificial intelligence in China are under final review, as per a government posting. The rules, requiring US investors to notify the Treasury Department regarding some investments in AI and other stem technologies, come from an executive order signed by President Joe Biden in August 2023. The order aims to keep American investors' know-how from aiding China's military. Chipmakers and related companies that may be impacted by the decisions denied responding to Reuters' requests for comment. Methodology For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

In a binding letter of intent signed with Ghost Kitchens America, the companies will enter into a franchise agreement whereby Richtech Robotics Inc. (NASDAQ:RR) will acquire exclusive rights to operate the restaurants. The restaurants will be directly managed by Richtech Robotics’ subsidiary, AlphaMax Management LLC. The agreement aims to optimize restaurant operations through robotics and AI cloud technology, with each location expected to generate between $700,000 and $2 million in annual revenue. "All Walmart locations where we’ve signed agreements with Richtech Robotics have strong sales numbers and steady customer traffic. Based on our previous collaborations, Ghost Kitchens is confident that Richtech Robotics’ robotic technology and operational management services will maximize the performance of these restaurants. We look forward to further expanding our partnership with Richtech Robotics as we rapidly grow our restaurant footprint”. Overall RR ranks 13th on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss.

A Nuclear power plant with all its safety & security protocols in place. Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) is a nuclear technology company engaged in the design and development of fission power plants to provide reliable and commercial-scale energy to customers in the United States. AI has been driving significant energy demand, and nuclear energy has emerged as a strong avenue to address the increase in power demand. Last week, Amazon Web Services announced plans that it will invest $500 million in nuclear power. Big tech companies are increasingly facing energy demands driven by the AI revolution, and many of them have already entered into agreements to meet their energy needs. Following the announcement, nuclear names such as Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) continued to rise on Monday on the back of optimism in the sector. There is also increased speculation that Sam Altman’s backed Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) will be the next one to secure a deal with a major tech player. In a CNBC interview last week, Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte stated the massive demand for power is being driven by AI growth. When asked about the potential for the company to announce a deal similar to Google’s deal with Kairos Power, he stated that there is “a lot more to come”. Oklo shares closed on Monday with a 22.4% increase, reaching $22.32. Overall OKLO ranks 14th on our list of the AI stocks investors shouldn't miss. While we acknowledge the potential of OKLO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Mukesh Ambani warming up to Allianz for insurance amid Bajaj exit plans? Here's what we know

Time Published: 2024-10-23T05:54:52Z
Full Content:
Feedback Jio Financial Services Ltd., led by Mukesh Ambani, is reportedly in talks with German insurance giant Allianz SE to explore a potential insurance partnership in India. Discussions are focused on establishing both general and life insurance companies in India, claimed a Bloomberg report. These talks are in early stages, and it is still unclear if the companies will proceed with the plan. Allianz is reportedly looking to exit its two existing joint ventures with Bajaj Finserv Ltd., marking the end of a partnership that has lasted more than two decades. Bajaj Finserv confirmed that Allianz is “actively considering an exit” from its life and general insurance ventures, citing a shift in Allianz's strategic priorities. This was confirmed following a report by Bloomberg. The break-up between Allianz and Bajaj Finserv stems from a dispute over the direction of the partnership, with sources indicating that Bajaj’s refusal to allow Allianz to raise its stake at a discounted price contributed to the rift. Additionally, Allianz reportedly was not given a say in key strategic decisions. A spokesperson for Jio Financial Services declined to comment on the ongoing speculation, stating, "If and when there are any material developments, we will continue to make necessary disclosures." A spokesperson for Allianz, based in Munich, also stated that the company does not comment on market rumors, Bloomberg stated in the report. Jio Financial, which is currently led by veteran banker K.V. Kamath, has already ventured into financial services through a shadow banking operation and insurance brokerage. The firm has also teamed up with BlackRock Inc. to enter the asset management business. The addition of insurance to its portfolio would further Jio Financial’s ambitions of becoming a major player in India’s financial sector. India’s insurance penetration rate is significantly lower than that of countries such as South Africa and Canada, highlighting the sector’s potential for growth. According to data from the insurance regulator, this presents a considerable opportunity for companies like Jio Financial and Allianz. Business Today could not independently verify the details of the ongoing talks. The story will be updated following comments from Jio Financial and Allianz. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

Title: WoW turns 20 (and we turn 20 years older) this year, with a huge anniversary event — here’s everything you need to know about the big birthday bash

NEXT | A checklist of achievement rewards and vendor loot to acquire durin... This year isn’t just another anniversary: with World of Warcraft turning 20, the game is getting a massive anniversary event that will let us relive old glories, collect plenty of loot, and even show off our favorite transmogs. The event is so large that it will take up an entire (minor) patch cycle, with all of patch 11.0.5 dedicated to the anniversary. The patch launches on October 22, and we’ll be able to participate in the anniversary celebration through November and December. But let’s get to the details! Here’s everything that’s happening for World of Warcraft’s 20th birthday: If you prefer, you can consume the above information in video form, though if you do I have to assume that it has not in fact been 20 years for you. Also, while I already liked Holly Longdale, seeing her respond to a comment about how everybody remembers Blackrock Depths fondly by saying “fondly is a word” truly cements her place in my heart. This is a woman who has been in a six-hour Blackrock Depths run with countless deaths that fell apart before making it to the last boss. I feel you here, Holly, though I am hopeful my current guild can handle the new raid’s 13 bosses without falling apart. While this event comprises the majority of patch 11.0.5, there are a couple of new things in the patch that aren’t directly related to the anniversary:More goodies for Dracthyr! The formerly Evoker-only race will get new classes (Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, and Warlock) and a special Skyriding talent that will let them soar in a squadron of their fellow Dracthyr.An update to Shamans’ Ascendance form, with variants themed after different elements.I think it’s a fun patch, with plenty to keep us occupied until whatever Blizzard has planned for 11.0.7.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘If You’re Looking For Pure-Play, Go With Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT)’
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-says-looking-pure-232237315.html
Time Published: 2024-10-22T23:22:37Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. As Wall Street dives into the heart of earnings season, Jim Cramer has provided insights into market trends and earnings reports to watch in the upcoming week. Cramer remarked, “It’s hard to believe, but this market’s now been up for six straight weeks. That’s right, despite interest rates running higher since mid-September, despite being on the verge of an election where both candidates want to pile on trillions of dollars of debt to an already unfathomable amount of borrowing, this market seems like it can’t help itself from going higher.” Cramer highlighted the influence of the Federal Reserve, noting that ever since the rate cut on September 18, the market has largely trended upward. He emphasized that it is not solely the Fed driving this bullish sentiment, the earnings season has brought some remarkable quarterly results. With strong performance from banks kicking off the earnings cycle, Cramer posed the question of whether the rally could extend into a seventh consecutive week, suggesting following his game plan to assess this possibility. On a separate note, addressing economic indicators, Cramer warned that if the economy continues to produce solid numbers, the likelihood of substantial rate cuts will diminish. While he believes that rates will eventually decline, he cautioned those shorting Treasurys, suggesting that they may be making a mistake. Cramer noted a significant caveat, which is the upcoming election, and pointed out that both candidates are advocating potentially inflationary policies. “Both candidates have pushed potentially inflationary policies. As I said at the top, if Trump can win enough of a majority to pass his huge tariffs, or Harris expands housing tax credits and de facto subsidy, they could push home prices higher. Then inflation might stage a comeback. But I'm not betting on that. I think both parties are terrified of being blamed for inflation, which almost single-handedly sunk Joe Biden's presidency. No matter what the candidates campaign on, I don't see their allies in Congress taking any chances with inflation beyond the usual unwillingness to balance the budget.” He concluded that those betting against Treasurys have overreached, suggesting that their efforts to counter the Fed's policies are unlikely to end well. Cramer observed that when a large number of investors align on one side of a trade, as seen currently, that group often ends up being incorrect. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 18. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A close-up of a group of technicians working on complex data center systems. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 92 Cramer recently called Vertiv Holdings Co (NYSE:VRT) a “pure-play’ and said: “Data centers remain one of the hottest themes in the market, and if you're looking for pure-play, go with Vertiv, which makes electrical equipment for these warehouses full of servers. Now that said, this stock is so red hot that it might not be able to rally on earnings unless it raises its forecast to unfathomable levels. Then again, Vertiv’s business is so strong, it's so strong that unfathomable might be fathomable.” Vertiv Holding (NYSE:VRT) is engaged in creating and maintaining essential digital infrastructure technologies and lifecycle services tailored for data centers, communication networks, and a range of commercial and industrial applications. After reporting a strong performance in the first half of the year, it gave an upward adjustment to its full-year sales guidance by $50 million, with $75 million of this growth attributed to organic development. Alongside this, the company raised its full-year adjusted operating profit forecast by $85 million, now aiming for $1.435 billion. The increase is linked to a rise in sales volume and improved variable contribution margins anticipated in the latter half of the year, driven by improved productivity in both procurement and manufacturing processes. Additionally, the company also adjusted its full-year guidance for operating margins, now projecting an adjusted operating margin of 18.7% at the midpoint. It is an increase of 100 basis points from previous estimates and 200 basis points above initial forecasts made during the November investor conference. Furthermore, the company's forecasted adjusted diluted EPS for 2024 is set at $2.50 at the midpoint, representing over 40% growth compared to 2023, largely due to an increase in adjusted operating profit. Vertiv Holding (NYSE:VRT) has been making significant strides in liquid cooling technology, positioning itself as an alternative to conventional energy management practices in data centers. In September, the company announced a significant expansion of its manufacturing capabilities in North America with the opening of a new facility in Pelzer, South Carolina. The site will add 215,000 square feet of production space and is expected to create up to 300 skilled jobs in the region. The Pelzer facility will focus on the production of various infrastructure solutions, including integrated modular systems and modular power solutions, capitalizing on the company’s extensive portfolio of power, cooling, and IT infrastructure technologies designed for data centers. Overall VRT ranks 1st on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of VRT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than VRT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Join the 20th Anniversary Celebration near the Caverns of Time, spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock, ascend with a new Shaman Ascendance form, and more. Join the celebration as World of Warcraft celebrates its 20th Anniversary with new activities and myriad ways to earn currency. When: October 22, 2024 – January 6, 2025 Where: Outside the Caverns of Time in Tanaris Here’s what you can look forward to during the 20th Anniversary Celebration: Players level 10 and up will receive the quest, “Another Timely Invitation,” inviting them to the celebration in Tanaris outside the Caverns of Time. You’ll speak with Yllana to turn in your quest and then pick up some one-time quests to learn more about the event. Take part in quests and activities to earn Bronze Celebration Tokens to spend on items during the 20th Anniversary Celebration, including returning items from previous anniversaries and new ones. Join Moira Thaurissan as the bronze dragonflight grants her a look back in history, guiding us all through a journey through eight epic boss raid encounters. Players can queue for this epic raid with the Raid Finder (Group Finder Hotkey I) or create their own groups of 10 to 15 players by speaking with Moira for Normal and Heroic difficulties. Paladin Death Knight, Hunter, Mage Warrior, Druid, Priest Monk, Shaman, Evoker Warlock, Demon Hunter, Rogue We’ve modernized some very classic Tier 2 sets for all classes, including those that didn’t exist at the time these sets were introduced—such as Monks and Evokers—for a total of thirteen class sets! Each set comes as an ensemble of 9 pieces, including a cloak, making sure you look the part from head to toe. Step back in time and show off your class pride when you purchase these appearances with Bronze Celebration Tokens earned during the 20th Anniversary Celebration. Take part in a new Timewalking event that will take you through the original version of Deadmines, Zul’Farrak, Dire Maul (east and west wings), and Stratholme’s living and undead dungeons for epic new rewards. Queue up via the Adventure Journal or the Group Finder with players level 10 and above. Players will have the option to visit special vendors to get new mounts, pets, and transmog appearances. Here are just a few items you will find on the Timewalking vendors starting with the 20th Anniversary: Blizzard employees earn special service awards during their time at the company. We’ve taken inspiration from these awards to create a new mount that is fully armored in a similar style—the Coldflame Tempest mount. This blue-flamed flying mount takes after its fiery cousin, the Ashes of Al’ar, and will let you show off your own years of service to Azeroth. Players can also earn appearances based on the employee sword, shield, and crown to show off in-game, along with a version of the employee ring as a toy. Stand out with a 20-Year balloon toy and two adorable baby doomlord pets—Lil’Kaz and Lil’Doomy— you can add to your collection. For a limited time, you will also see some returning Anniversary items that can be also purchased with Bronze Celebration Tokens when you visit Storekeeper Reginald in the Celebration Pavilion and peruse his inventory. This year’s celebration event has expanded, and the bronze dragonflight have taken the activities just outside the Caverns of Time with various new and exciting things to do. Show off your transmog at the Fashion Frenzy stage hosted by Althaea. Mount up to match Abigail Cyrildotr at the Mount Mania arena and show off your mount collection. Join Lorewalker Cho at the Storyteller stage for an epic tale you can’t help but join in on. Take a photo with guildmates, venture to epic vistas, disguise yourself as your pet, cosplay as famous heroes or villains, skate on the rink, or take a balloon for a lazy ride around the event space. There’s plenty to see and do as you join the celebration in Tanaris, and it’s available to players at level 15 and above. There are gate-crashers at nearly every party, and that’s true of our anniversary celebration. We’re bringing back some classic World Bosses from the past, including Doomwalker, Azuregos, Lord Kazzak, and the Dragons of Nightmare, along with a couple of additional party crashers in the sands of Tanaris— the Sha of Anger and Archavon the Stonewatcher. Players can join in bouncing them out of the celebration beginning at level 15 to earn some great rewards and anniversary currency. Chromie is up for any challenge, but due to her unique role, she has not kept her codex in order. When asked to put together time tours of the opening of the Ahn’qiraj gate, she’s discovered things are in a jumble. She’ll need help from Azeroth’s heroes to put things to rights once more and send out of place enemies in the sands of Silithus back to where they belong. Players can queue up using the Group Finder for this 10-20 player scenario beginning at level 15. Often a thankless job, guest relations has a new volunteer, Alyx, stepping into the role with the lofty hopes of doing a better job than their predecessor. As visitors pour into the celebration, Alyx is under pressure and could use a little help making it an event to remember. Thankfully, they have found a secret-sleuthing tuskarr family who have become the perfect helpers in getting players up to speed with the tools of the secrets trade. Assist Alyx each week with resolving new guest mysteries by using your new secret-finding skills, and be on the lookout for stolen celebration goods. Follow the rumors and solve the mystery— if you can. We’re counting on you, secret finders. Players can begin working on the initial secrets beginning on October 28 with additional secrets opening up on November 4. Run down your enemies, raze their fortifications, and exchange the tokens you loot from their corpses to summon mighty reinforcements in Korrak’s Revenge, a throwback Battleground inspired by the earliest days of Alterac Valley. Players who complete the quest, “Korrak’s Revenge,” will be rewarded one of two mounts based on your character’s faction: the Stormpike Battle Ram (Alliance) and the Frostwolf Snarler (Horde). Players taking part in the battlegrounds during the anniversary celebration can also click on the Alliance Armory or the Horde War Supplies located in the starting areas of battlegrounds to don the appearance of PvP sets from times past. Celebrate 30 Years of Warcraft with November’s Trading Post. Players will be able to fill the month’s bar to earn four iconic back appearance shields representing the factions of Warcraft III— Orc, Human, Night Elf, and Scourge. Spread your wings as a new Dracthyr Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mage, Warrior, or Warlock. Undertaking one of these new classes as a Dracthyr will allow you to choose between fighting as a Dracthyr or fighting in Visage form by activating Visage, which switches you between forms. You can additionally choose to toggle on Chosen Identity, which will automatically shift you into Dracthyr form when entering combat and Visage form when leaving combat. Dracthyr Evokers will continue to use Dracthyr form during combat, as many of their abilities emphasize their draconic nature. With the addition of new classes to Dracthyr, we are making some further adjustments to their racials. Dracthyr players will also be able to learn a new Skyriding talent called Squadron in which up to two additional Dracthyr players can join you to fly in formation as you soar through the skies. But wait, there’s more! Shaman can also look forward to new Ascendance forms to express their elemental mastery. Restoration Shaman will get a new Water form, Elemental will get a new Fire form, and Enhancement will get a new Wind form. Learn more about all the additional changes and updates in the 20th Anniversary Celebration Content Update in our notes. 1920x1080, 3840x2160, 1080x1920 We look forward to celebrating all things World of Warcraft with you.

Among those highlighted in a Monday speech by SEC Chair Gary Gensler was the need to modernize equity markets, in part by embracing shorter settlement times. A retail-led movement to bet big against Wall Street short sellers caused GameStop’s stock price to spike nearly four years ago amid the “meme stock” craze. Forced to hold or sell shares skyrocketing in price, restrictions imposed by several brokerage firms blunted the rally that was later enshrined in stock market history and recounted in books and films. Gensler, an unwavering critic of the digital assets industry, partly pinned the restrictions on a lack of market efficiency. Ultimately, a shift toward shorter settlement times—that experts say blockchains benefit from—improved upon mechanics that stifled some GameStop investors. “Many everyday investors lost access to the market at a critical time,” Gensler said. “The longer it takes for a trade to settle—the slower the plumbing—the more risk our markets assume.” When purchasing or selling a stock on a venue like the New York Stock Exchange, there is a delay between when the transaction is made and when it becomes fully processed across a series of intermediaries, including a broker-dealer, clearing agency, and exchange. Notably, the SEC has accused crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase of fulfilling several of these roles at once, without proper registration, while facilitating securities transactions. Both companies have denied the regulator’s claims amid ongoing battles in federal courts. Once conducted through paper checks and physical certificates, the settlement window for securities has been shortened with SEC rule changes over time. Commonly referred to as T+2, a two-day settlement window was reduced in May, making what Gensler said was “a real difference” for everyday investors. At the same time, the shift to T+1 influenced the relationship between brokers, which match buyers and sellers, and clearinghouses that facilitate the exchange of securities and payments. Margin calls from clearinghouses led some brokers to restrict purchases of GameStop stock during its famed short squeeze in 2021. But the “amount of margin, or collateral, that must be placed with the clearinghouse” was reduced significantly with T+1’s adoption, Gensler said. Gensler’s GameStop reflection followed crypto-focused remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller last week. Discussing the merits of decentralized finance (DeFi), he described how intermediaries have historically provided value—but now face competition. As reflected in the popularity of centralized crypto exchanges, Waller posited that DeFi could play a complementary role to existing financial markets, rather than replace legacy systems. Along those lines, he said distributed ledger technology (DLT) like blockchain could be an “efficient and faster way to do recordkeeping,” while smart contracts flatten trade structures. “Smart contracts can effectively combine multiple legs of a transaction into a single unified act,” Waller said. “This can provide value, as it can mitigate risks associated with settlement.” Companies like tZERO are building blockchain-based marketplaces for private securities. The Utah-based firm gained approval from the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) to operate as a custodian for digital assets sold as securities last month. In early 2025, the firm plans to launch with a “full digitization” of its Series-A preferred equity. But Wall Street tastemakers have visions for a crypto-based market extending far beyond that. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink hailed tokenization as the “next generation for securities” in 2022. Using a digital representation of an asset to conduct trades on a blockchain, he said the process would provide market participants with “instantaneous settlement” and “reduced fees.” Alongside the crypto’s rise, financial firms have looked at other qualities inherent to blockchains, such as the 24/7 schedule that they operate under within the context of trading. Crypto markets don’t close, which can provide both opportunities and risks alike. In April, the Financial Times reported that the New York Stock Exchange was exploring round-the-clock trading. The development would be a significant break from the exchange’s regular six-and-a-half hour trading window, extended as recently as 1985.

We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) stands against the other stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. As Wall Street dives into the heart of earnings season, Jim Cramer has provided insights into market trends and earnings reports to watch in the upcoming week. Cramer remarked, “It’s hard to believe, but this market’s now been up for six straight weeks. That’s right, despite interest rates running higher since mid-September, despite being on the verge of an election where both candidates want to pile on trillions of dollars of debt to an already unfathomable amount of borrowing, this market seems like it can’t help itself from going higher.” Cramer highlighted the influence of the Federal Reserve, noting that ever since the rate cut on September 18, the market has largely trended upward. He emphasized that it is not solely the Fed driving this bullish sentiment, the earnings season has brought some remarkable quarterly results. With strong performance from banks kicking off the earnings cycle, Cramer posed the question of whether the rally could extend into a seventh consecutive week, suggesting following his game plan to assess this possibility. On a separate note, addressing economic indicators, Cramer warned that if the economy continues to produce solid numbers, the likelihood of substantial rate cuts will diminish. While he believes that rates will eventually decline, he cautioned those shorting Treasurys, suggesting that they may be making a mistake. Cramer noted a significant caveat, which is the upcoming election, and pointed out that both candidates are advocating potentially inflationary policies. “Both candidates have pushed potentially inflationary policies. As I said at the top, if Trump can win enough of a majority to pass his huge tariffs, or Harris expands housing tax credits and de facto subsidy, they could push home prices higher. Then inflation might stage a comeback. But I'm not betting on that. I think both parties are terrified of being blamed for inflation, which almost single-handedly sunk Joe Biden's presidency. No matter what the candidates campaign on, I don't see their allies in Congress taking any chances with inflation beyond the usual unwillingness to balance the budget.” He concluded that those betting against Treasurys have overreached, suggesting that their efforts to counter the Fed's policies are unlikely to end well. Cramer observed that when a large number of investors align on one side of a trade, as seen currently, that group often ends up being incorrect. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 23 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during his episode of Mad Money on October 18. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the second quarter, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of more than 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A robotic arm in the process of assembling a complex circuit board - showing the industrial scale the company operates at. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 50 While Cramer mentioned that Texas Instruments Incorporated (NASDAQ:TXN) has shown cyclicality, he still likes it ahead of the company reporting its third-quarter earnings on October 22. “After the close, we hear from Texas Instruments. We've been hearing a lot about how semiconductor companies are in the doldrums, the ones without AI, that is. Tex Instruments falls into that category but this company's become much more focused. I like it ahead of the quarter, even though it has a little more cyclicality than most chip makers.” Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is engaged in the design and sale of semiconductors. The company provides a range of products focused on power management, signal processing, and embedded computing, which are utilized across various sectors, including automotive, industrial, personal electronics, and communications. On October 21, TipRanks reported that Susquehanna lowered the price target on the stock to $240 from $250 and maintained a Positive rating. In previewing the upcoming third-quarter results, the firm noted that the semiconductor industry is facing broad-based challenges, particularly in the automotive and industrial segments, where momentum has started to decline. For the personal computer market, there is an expectation for notebook production to rise in 2024, although the pace may slow toward the year’s end, largely due to AI-related devices not driving demand as anticipated. In the handset market, forecasts indicate an increase in smartphone shipments for 2024. Additionally, in the data center segment, recent server evaluations suggest a slightly stronger performance in the latter half of 2024, partly driven by AMD's market share gains. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) management has indicated an awareness that market conditions may not be as favorable as previously thought. In its midyear update to its long-term planning, which is typically conducted once a year, the company maintained its spending plans for 2024 and 2025. However, it revised the outlook for 2026 expenditures, lowering the anticipated range from $5 billion to between $2 billion and $5 billion, contingent on revenue performance at that time. Overall TXN ranks 13th on Jim Cramer's list of stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of TXN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TXN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

(Reuters) - (This Oct. 18 story has been corrected to say that the NYSE received approval to trade options on 3, not 11 ETFs, in the headline and paragraph 1, to remove references to IBIT and Invesco Galaxy approvals in paragraph 4, and to add a line about CBOE approvals in paragraph 3) The U.S. securities regulator has granted "accelerated approval" to the New York Stock Exchange to list and trade options tied to three spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, according to a regulatory filing. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had in January approved the bitcoin ETFs to track bitcoin, in what was a watershed for the world's largest cryptocurrency and the broader crypto industry. Separately, Cboe Global also got approval to trade options on two spot bitcoin ETFs, according to a filing. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, the ARK21Shares Bitcoin ETF, and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust BTC are among funds that received the approval on Friday. The index options - listed derivatives offering a quick and inexpensive way to amplify exposure to bitcoin - on a bitcoin index would give institutional investors and traders an alternative way to hedge their exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency. Options are listed derivatives that give the holder the right to buy or sell an asset, such as a stock or exchange-traded product, at a predetermined price by a set date. The regulator last month approved listing and trading of options for asset manager BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)'s, exchange-traded fund on the Nasdaq.

In September, it announced the acquisition of Frigo-Trans and its sister company BPL, both recognized leaders in healthcare logistics based in Germany. While the financial details of the transaction were not disclosed, these companies bring significant expertise in managing complex healthcare logistics, including a network of temperature-controlled warehousing spanning six temperature zones and a comprehensive cold chain transportation solution across Europe. The acquisition is expected to improve the company's capabilities in meeting the growing demands of healthcare customers who require efficient handling of temperature-sensitive and time-critical shipments. Kate Gutmann, UPS’s Executive Vice President and President of International, Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions, noted that the rapid advancements in the pharmaceutical industry are driving the need for integrated cold and frozen supply chains. She emphasized that Frigo-Trans will expand the company's solution offerings and support the company’s ambition to become the leading provider of complex healthcare logistics globally. On October 10, Wells Fargo raised the price target on United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) to $142 from $134 and kept an Overweight rating. Ahead of the third-quarter earnings report, the firm made slight adjustments to its estimates for the fourth quarter but kept its outlook for the third quarter positive. The firm observed favorable trends for the company in the third quarter, with signs of volume growth and pricing actions suggesting a pathway to achieving the company's full-year guidance.

Title: BlackRock taps into AI frenzy with two new ETFs

(Reuters) - Asset management giant BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) on Tuesday launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) aimed at giving investors exposure to the booming market for artificial intelligence. Generative AI, designed to create human-like interactions by processing vast amounts of data, has taken the world by storm and is expected to be integrated into virtually all industries in the coming years from technology to financial services. "As an investing theme, BlackRock views AI as a mega force with broad investing implications both now and in the long term," the world's largest asset manager said. Asset managers have been rolling out thematic ETFs to capitalize on the popularity of certain themes, sectors or trends, unlike traditional products that track broad market indexes. Demand for these products, however, has been mixed in recent months as investors have been opting for funds linked to stock market benchmarks, which are hovering near record highs. BlackRock's iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF will invest in global AI and technology stocks across market capitalizations. Its iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF shares a similar investment objective, aiming for long-term capital appreciation by investing in global technology companies across sectors like semiconductors, software and hardware, among others. "These active ETFs can help investors seize outsized and overlooked investment opportunities across the full stack of AI and advanced technologies," said Tony Kim, BlackRock's head of the fundamental equities technology group. Earlier this month, the asset manager beat Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and its assets under management (AUM) hit a record high as a U.S. stock market rally boosted inflows. As of Sept 30, its iShares business - with over 1400 ETFs - had $4.2 trillion in AUM.

Title: Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet is this week’s World Boss in The War Within

NEXT | How much World of Warcraft content is too much at one time? The War Within Season 1 continues and we’ve made our second full circuit of all the World Bosses with the return this week of Orta the Broken Mountain in Azj-Kahet. Fortunately there remain no mechanic drops similar to the older expansion’s Legendary Memories so players won’t have to worry about missing out on something important (besides the chance of loot) if they skip a week. As usual the World Bosses drop items that are ilevel-equivalent to the Normal difficulty of the concurrent raid, although with the more staggered ilevels in Palace it should be noted that World Boss drops are i603, or equivalent to the middle bosses of the raid. They can also be upgraded, starting at Champion 3/8. Orta the Broken Mountain resembles previous fights we’ve had such as Kormrok in Hellfire Citadel or Kromog in Blackrock Foundry, with runes and plenty of slamming action. One thing that is important to be aware of is the fact that Orta’s location in the Old Sacrificial Pit of the City of Threads is above an insta-death area, so falling or being thrown into the gaps surrounding the platform will kill you. Runes should be avoided as they will stun when triggered — if this wasn’t a world boss I’d suggest controlled detonation like in similar encounters, but it’s likely best just to avoid them entirely. Tectonic Roars is a raidwide AOE that will knock you back so positioning while it’s being cast is likely important. Finally Orta will grasp and squeeze nearby players at interval and then throw them away once they’re considered a “weakling”; it’s not known whether this means at below a specific health percentage or after a certain amount of time. Orta the Broken Mountain is located in the western end of the City of Threads in the Old Sacrificial Pit, and is an easy flight over from the Weaver’s Lair. Because where he’s located is absent of other NPCs you don’t need to worry about your current progress in the zone or whether you are buffed with pheromones. As already mentioned the area beneath the combat zone is instantly fatal, so don’t fall off the platform waiting for the fight to begin. The gear that Orta drops matches the normal Palace appearance, so those looking to farm transmog as well as gear upgrades will want to take the time to down the boss. In addition to unlocking the normal look, upgrading from Champion 3/8 to 5/8 will unlock the heroic appearance as well. Unlike the Dragonflight first tier bosses, Orta drops two possible armor pieces for every class in addition to a ring that can drop for all characters: As always defeating Orta the Broken Mountain counts as a World Quest with possible rewards of gold, Coffer Key shards (used for Delves), and Resonance Crystals.

NEXT | Halloween brings holiday mayhem to most of Blizzard's games. Here a... It’s patch day for World of Warcraft, so it’s no surprise that there’s a long maintenance today: The War Within servers were scheduled be offline from 7am – 3pm pacific today, but came back online an hour early. The World of Warcraft servers are now live! The servers are now live with with patch 11.0.5, which primarily features WoW’s big birthday bash, but also adds new classes for Dracthyr, new Ascendence forms for Shaman, and a whole lot of class changes for everybody else. WoW’s 20th anniversary celebration is going to be massive, with the new Blackrock Depths raid, vanilla Timewalking dungeons, more world bosses, and a big party outside the Caverns of Time with plenty of prizes to enjoy, including revamped Tier 2 sets. Blizzard hasn’t had a great track record with maintenance during The War Within, which has had an above-average number of long and extended maintenances since launch. However it seems like Blizzard made a reasonable time estimate today, getting the servers online early. Kudos to the server team! Fortunately there’s plenty to do while you wait to download the new patch. There’s always Warcraft Rumble, which is currently in the middle of its Hallow’s End celebrations, and post-expansion Diablo 4 is the best the game has ever been — even if you didn’t buy the expansion — plus the base game is on Xbox Game Pass if you don’t own it, either. There are worse ways to kill a day than by slaughtering demons. For my part, I’m refreshing my knowledge of all things Dragon Age before the next game comes out next week, and there’s plenty of game lore to keep me busy. The servers are now up, so I’ll see you in game soon! Blizzard Watch is a safe space for all readers. By leaving comments on this site you agree to follow our commenting and community guidelines.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, speaking at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association’s annual meeting on Monday, stressed the need for policy makers to address the federal deficit and $36 trillion national debt, pointing to the strength of U.S. capital markets as a way to improve the country’s fiscal woes. “The economy is growing about 3%, but if you take out the excess spending of the federal government [$1.8 trillion deficit], that’s an equivalent of 6% GDP,” Fink said. “The growth is on the back of debt; the growth is not on the back of equity … we are going to have a [debt] crisis.” One way to tackle the deficit, the CEO of the $11.5 trillion asset manager said, is to grow the economy above the trendline by investing in major projects like infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Fink pointed out the billions that AI and data center projects cost, noting that these investments are opportunities for private capital to grow the economy. For more stories like this, sign up for the CIO Alert daily newsletter.  “I’m not frightened of this deficit, but it’s pretty cautionary if we don’t find a way to unlock growth,” Fink said. “This is my message to every politician: We need to be unlocking growth from the private sector, and the U.S. is in the best position of any country in the world because of the scale of our capital markets.” Fink says the way to unlock capitalism and achieve this growth is not to raise or lower taxes, but to make the capital markets more efficient, so that they can provide more funding for more segments of the economy. Permitting reform is needed to clear a major hindrance to building needed infrastructure projects, Fink noted in his remarks: “The permitting process is inhibiting growth, inhibiting opportunity.” Fink also pointed to the role that private credit can play in infrastructure investing. “I think the biggest growth of private credit can be infrastructure credit,” Fink said. “I believe you’re going to see more and more opportunities in all the different shades of credit.” Related Stories: Takeaways From BlackRock CEO Fink’s Annual Letter BlackRock’s Purchase of GIP Deepens Its Alts Exposure Gap Narrowing Between Infrastructure Investments and Allocation Targets Tags: AI, BlackRock, data centers, Infrastructure, Larry Fink, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, SIFMA « Rest Super Names Interim Co-CIOs

Title: Michael Saylor’s Latest Remarks Shock The Bitcoin World: What He Said
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-latest-remark-shock-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T13:30:36Z
Full Content:
In a recent interview with journalist Madison Reidy, Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, stirred a massive controversy within the Bitcoin community with his remarks on custody and regulation. The discussion centered around the risks associated with large institutions holding significant amounts of BTC and the potential for government seizure or confiscation, reminiscent of historical events like the gold confiscation under Executive Order 6102 in 1933. When questioned about the risks of having a significant amount of BTC held by third-party custodians and large institutions, Saylor dismissed concerns of increased seizure or confiscation. He argued that BTC is safer in the hands of regulated public entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JP Morgan than with unregulated private holders. Saylor suggested that when Bitcoin is held by “crypto anarchists” who operate outside of government regulations and tax systems, it poses a greater risk of government intervention. “I think it’s the opposite. I think that when Bitcoin is held by a bunch of crypto anarchists who aren’t regulated entities, who don’t acknowledge government or don’t acknowledge taxes or don’t acknowledge reporting requirements, that increases the risk of seizure.” He emphasized that regulated institutions provide stability and trustworthiness. “When you have regulated public entities like BlackRock, Fidelity, JP Morgan, and State Street Bank holding the asset, all the lawmakers and all the law enforcement arms are invested in those entities. There’s no way that all the senators and all the congressmen are going to seize the assets from Fidelity and BlackRock or Vanguard because that’s where all their retirement money is invested.” Reidy brought up the gold confiscation under Executive Order 6102 during the Great Depression as a historical precedent for potential government seizure. Saylor dismissed this comparison, labeling it a “myth and a trope” propagated by paranoid “crypto anarchists.” He contended that the circumstances are fundamentally different because, at that time, the US was on the gold standard, and the government needed to control gold to devalue the dollar. “Today, we’re not on the gold standard or the Bitcoin standard,” Saylor stated. He argued that the US government has no incentive to seize BTC held in custody any more than it would seize stocks or real estate. “I don’t think we have to worry about Bitcoin held in custody being seized by the government any more than you have to worry about your Apple stock being seized by the government,” Saylor claimed. Saylor’s remarks did not sit well with many in the Bitcoin community, who value decentralization and self-custody as core principles. Jack Mallers, CEO of Strike, responded on X: “Calling self-custody ‘crypto-anarchism’ oversimplifies what Bitcoin accomplishes. It’s about freedom—freedom of speech, property rights, and protecting your right to own what’s yours. We must not dismiss it because freedom isn’t promised—it must be fought for and protected.” He acknowledged his respect for Saylor but emphasized the importance of diverse views in a free market. “My goal is simply to defend the principles that I believe make Bitcoin powerful: freedom and the ability for anyone to engage with it however they see fit,” Mallers added. Sina Nader, co-founder of 21st Capital, criticized Saylor’s position: “Terrible look for Saylor to become a shill for the government and banking system and call true Bitcoiners paranoid. Saylor is on a mission to relegate Bitcoin into an investment pet rock and halt its usage as a currency.” Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, warned: “A government doesn’t need to physically confiscate your Bitcoin. It can just lock custodial BTC into approved custodians forever, aka ‘Institutional Bitcoin.’ While a government that isn’t on a Bitcoin Standard technically shouldn’t have incentive to confiscate BTC, it actually does still have an incentive to degrade and attack Bitcoin.” Mow suggested that governments might seek to undermine Bitcoin because it represents a “harder and superior money” that could diminish the value of fiat currencies. He urged the community to “plan accordingly” with a self-custody solution and “expect [a] 6102,” referencing the historical executive order. At press time, BTC traded at $67,707.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/22/2024 6:26:16 AM PDT by Red Badger Researchers said in a recent article that Arkansas may have 19 million tons of lithium, which is used in rechargeable batteries for important products like phones and electric cars. The researchers said in their article released last month in the journal Science Advances they had “calculated that there are 5.1 to 19 million tons of lithium in Smackover Formation brines in southern Arkansas,” making up “35 to 136% of the current US lithium resource estimate.” According to a Monday release from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), “the Smackover Formation is a relic of an ancient sea that left an extensive, porous, and permeable limestone geologic unit that extends under parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida.” Lithium, which has been labeled by the USGS as a critical mineral, has been often obtained from brines or salt flats they evaporate into. According to a projection from the International Energy Agency, demand for lithium could increase by more than 40 times by 2040. According to the article, the researchers utilized a machine-learning model trained on “published and newly collected brine lithium concentration data,” making “a map of predicted lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines across southern Arkansas.” The article’s findings come from the work of both the USGS and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Office of the State Geologist, according to the USGS release. “Lithium is a critical mineral for the energy transition, and the potential for increased U.S. production to replace imports has implications for employment, manufacturing and supply-chain resilience. This study illustrates the value of science in addressing economically important issues,” USGS Director David Applegate said in the release.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 11 | View Replies] To: Leaning Right; stanne Yes indeed. But “progressives” don’t really care about that. They only care that it is not done in their backyard. Out of sight, out of mind. IMHO, most of them are scared to be the one to break the narrative. As an EV owner and solar owner (not because of warmageddon fears, but because I'm trying to be more self-reliant and I can produce my own power a lot easier than I can produce my own gasoline), I sometimes meet other EV owners if I take the EV on a trip and charge away from home. I wish I had a dollar for every time someone thanked me for saving the world or such. I usually show them the graph below and tell them that we'd all freak out if we knew what went into making EV's. Sometimes they say, "but who could I tell that would believe me". Fun topic: If I'm in the south when this conversation happens, which means in the Bible Belt, I point out that the Minoan Warm Period mirrors the Era of Judges, Greek Dark Age cooling period mirrors the Era of Kings, and the Christ and the Apostles lived during the Roman Warm Period. Because they are fellow Bible believers, those are the few EV owners who I've been able to educate that the Modern Warm Period is not the freakazoid unique thing that leftists make it out to be. Most of them still fear warmageddon. But a few of them said I made them rethink their cult religion to come back to believing more in God and the Bible. 18 posted on 10/22/2024 7:00:06 AM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)

As an EV owner and solar owner (not because of warmageddon fears, but because I'm trying to be more self-reliant and I can produce my own power a lot easier than I can produce my own gasoline), I sometimes meet other EV owners if I take the EV on a trip and charge away from home.

According to a projection from the International Energy Agency, demand for lithium could increase by more than 40 times by 2040. According to the article, the researchers utilized a machine-learning model trained on “published and newly collected brine lithium concentration data,” making “a map of predicted lithium concentrations in Smackover Formation brines across southern Arkansas.” The article’s findings come from the work of both the USGS and the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment’s Office of the State Geologist, according to the USGS release. “Lithium is a critical mineral for the energy transition, and the potential for increased U.S. production to replace imports has implications for employment, manufacturing and supply-chain resilience. This study illustrates the value of science in addressing economically important issues,” USGS Director David Applegate said in the release.

The 1922 discovery of the Smackover oil field, after which the Smackover Formation is named, resulted in a sizeable oil boom in southern Arkansas. In addition to being a petroleum reservoir, as of 2015, the brine from the Smackover Formation is the only source of commercial bromine in the United States. A 2022 report estimated that the lithium brine in the formation has “sufficient lithium to produce enough batteries for 50 million electric vehicles.” In October 2024, federal and state researchers said there might be five million to 19 million tons of lithium, more than enough to meet the world’s demand for the battery ingredient. 12 posted on 10/22/2024 6:36:33 AM PDT by Red Badger (Homeless veterans camp in the streets while illegals are put up in 5 Star hotels....................)

Title: AI datacentres take the nuclear option
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/ai-datacentres-take-the-nuclear-option-51577/
Time Published: 2024-10-22T13:11:57Z
Full Content:
Oct 22, 2024 A model of a small modular reactor designed by X-energy. Source: Amazon. The power and utility of AI, be it unimodal or multimodal, is ultimately limited by the volume, and quality, of the data that is scraped, stored and manipulated to provide relevant and useful outputs to end users. The immense quantity of data required for AI systems to operate increases with every minute of every day, seemingly ad infinitum, and that in turn is putting increasing pressure on the resources required to support that data processing. Nuclear power, it seems, is one of the ways to relieve some of that pressure. The data underpinning generative AI (GenAI) has to be stored and processed somewhere, and that means construction of bigger datacentres around the world, all of which have to access power sufficient to keep them cool (literally!), calm and collected. Datacentres are very expensive to build, operate and manage, and it is increasingly obvious that the current model supporting GenAI is becoming unsustainable and will have to be replaced: That will come at gigantic cost and huge disruption but there will be no option in the medium to long term. The data warehouses that enable the likes of ChatGPT are on the verge of exceeding their feasible size limits, Mark Russinovich, CTO at Microsoft Azure, told the Semafor news website recently, and he’s not alone. What is needed with some urgency, according to Russinovich, is a new model and method of connecting multiple datacentres so that they can handle the practically inordinate processing load that will characterise future generations of the GenAI we now take for granted and the emergence of the still-undefined and theoretical artificial general intelligence (AGI) of the future that may be capable of exceeding the intellectual capabilities of humanity – see Is multimodal AI a dead-end on the road to AGI? AGI is a long way away, and may never be realised, and as things stand today with the model we have and seem to be stuck with, even the most advanced AI is centred on large language models (LLMs) that are trained in datacentre facilities running hundreds of thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) that can be chained to run as a single gigantic computer. Datacentre annual global energy consumption to double in the next five years All of this requires astonishing levels of power. Research firm IDC expects global datacentre electricity consumption to more than double between 2023 and 2028, notching up a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5% over the five-year period to reach 857 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2028. (1TWh is 1 billion kilowatt hours, roughly the equivalent of power sufficient to fully light 1 million average homes 24 hours a day for a full year.) The amount of power required to perform massive AI operations is already putting immense strain on the ageing and often neglected national grid in the US, which is home to most of the world’s hyperscale datacentres. The available megawattage devoted to datacentre operations is at its peak and that is causing all manner of problems for the utility firms and the datacentre sector. According to the analyst house RystadEnergy, headquartered in Oslo, Norway, since 2010 total US electricity demand has been relatively stable at some 4,000 TWh but it is changing as the proliferation of giant datacentres and the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) drive demand for the extra generation of electricity. RystadEnergy’s research shows that the two sectors will add 290 TWh of new power demand by 2030. RystadEnergy adds that electricity demand for datacentres and the chip foundries that provide them with GPU microprocessors will increase cumulative demand by 177 TWh between 2023 to 2030, reaching a total of 307 TWh from the 130TWh required in 2023. Meanwhile, global management consultancy, Bain and Company, has published a report showing that “surging datacentre power consumption could require more than $2tn in new energy generation resources worldwide. Furthermore, US energy demand could outstrip supply within the next few years; meeting demand would require utilities to boost annual generation by up to 26% by 2028.” That would be a huge task. The report adds: “Facing potentially overwhelming demand from datacentres, US utilities are grappling with a challenge few executives anticipated: After years of navigating flat or shrinking demand, many organisations have forgotten what it takes to grow. What’s more, they’re finding that capitalising on this new opportunity will require a rapid, unprecedented transformation of their operating and business models.” It continues: “For nearly two decades, efficiency and operational nimbleness were paramount while US electricity demand plateaued as a result of advances in energy efficiency and distributed generation offsetting economic growth. But the era of stagnant demand is over. The late 2022 breakthrough in generative AI and the ensuing datacentre boom blindsided utilities just as demand was also rising because of repatriated manufacturing, industrial policy, and vehicle electrification. “Now, US utilities are bracing for demand to outstrip supply during the next few years, with datacentres accounting for the bulk of the increase. Supply, both in generation and transmission, will take years to catch up… by 2028, utilities would need to increase annual energy generation by between 7% and 26% above the 2023 total to meet projected demand. That’s far beyond the largest five-year generation boost of about 5% that US utilities achieved from 2005 through 2023.” The report also finds that datacentre annual global energy consumption could “double by 2027 from 2023 levels, growing at a compound annual rate of 10% to 24% and potentially surpassing 1 million gigawatt hours in 2027 [even greater than IDC’s projection]. Serving a 1-gigawatt datacentre requires the capacity of about four natural gas plants or around half of a large nuclear plant.” The Biden administration, well aware of the looming crisis in the US grid, passed the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which set aside $3bn for AI infrastructure such as new power cables, but that sum is a drop in the ocean of the investment required. To put things into perspective, in partnership with the US-headquartered BlackRock, Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager, with $10tn to call on, Microsoft has launched its own $30bn AI infrastructure fund. The company has also been negotiating the re-opening of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant – yes, the one that went into partial ‘China Syndrome’ meltdown back in March 1979 – and simultaneously is working to form partnerships to foster green energy initiatives. The problem is urgent and daunting. Google says its first small modular reactor (SMR) will be in place and working by 2030 In his interview with Semafor, Microsoft Azure’s Russinovich said one answer to the problem might be constructing datacentres in multiple locations so as to spread the load across the power grids of different cities or regions. In a masterpiece of understatement he said, “It would be technically challenging, but it may be necessary. I think it’s inevitable, especially when you get to the kind of scale that these things are getting to.” However, connecting datacentre networks across long distances is fraught with problems, not least because maintaining the speed of AI data transfer across painstakingly synchronised fibre optic cable would be of paramount importance. The greater the distance, the higher the possibility that faults and mistimings would arise. Certainly, datacentres are trying to reduce their energy consumption. For example, many are migrating from pumped air systems to liquid-cooling processes but even liquid cooling draws a huge amount of power from the grid and is financially inefficient beyond a certain size. The only solution in the short to medium term appears to be nuclear power, and in the absence of any breakthrough in the quest for nuclear fusion, nuclear fission it will be, along with its attendant problems and dangers. In a recent blog, Google announced it had reached “the world’s first corporate agreement” to “purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) to be developed by Kairos Power” of California. Water is used as a coolant in conventional nuclear reactors, but Kairos Power reactors use molten fluoride salts instead. The salts have exceptional chemical stability and a great capacity for transferring heat at high temperature and the ability to retain fission products. Many studies have shown that molten fluoride salts are compatible with conventional high-temperature structural materials, such as stainless steel, and are ideal in terms of reliability and a long-operational life in a commercial environment. The initial phase will see the first Kairos Power’s SMRs in situ and operational by 2030. Thereafter, additional reactors will be deployed at intervals until 2035. Google says the deal “will enable up to 500 MW of new 24/7 carbon-free power to US electricity grids and help more communities benefit from clean and affordable nuclear power.” Google’s announcement was quickly followed by news from Amazon that it has “signed three new agreements to support the development of nuclear energy projects – including enabling the construction of several new small modular reactors.” In Washington state it has struck an agreement with Energy Northwest, a consortium of state public utilities, for the development of four advanced SMRs, while Amazon is also making an investment in X-energy, a developer of next-generation SMR reactors and fuel: X-energy’s advanced nuclear reactor design will be used in the Energy Northwest project. In addition, Amazon has signed an agreement with utility company Dominion Energy in Virginia, where many large datacentres are located, to “explore the development of an SMR project near Dominion’s existing North Anna nuclear power station. This will bring at least 300 megawatts of power to the Virginia region, where Dominion projects that power demands will increase by 85% over the next 15 years,” noted Amazon. Matt Garman, CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), said: “Nuclear is a safe source of carbon-free energy that can help power our operations and meet the growing demands of our customers while helping us progress toward our Climate Pledge commitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations by 2040. One of the fastest ways to address climate change is by transitioning our society to carbon-free energy sources, and nuclear energy is both carbon free and able to scale – which is why it’s an important area of investment for Amazon. Our agreements will encourage the construction of new nuclear technologies that will generate energy for decades to come.” It’s not an instant solution to a very pressing problem, but it is a start. – Martyn Warwick, Editor in Chief, TelecomTV Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Oct 24, 2024 Oct 23, 2024 Oct 23, 2024 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

The platform has launched with one fund, with plans to add more soon. “Our vision is to bring liquidity and accessibility to high-yielding assets that are otherwise hard to access,” Elmnts Chief Product Officer James Pacheco told Decrypt. “Mineral rights are a perfect example—they generate predictable, long-term income through oil and gas royalties, but very few people even know they exist, much less how to participate.” The Solana project will be available “virtually everywhere,” access to certain funds could differ based on the client's country of residence, Pacheco said. Tokenized investment funds’ popularity has skyrocketed in recent months, inspiring the creation of new funds based on all kinds of tokenized tangible assets. BlackRock last spring launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund based on tokenized US Treasury Bills — the largest tokenized investment fund as of publication time with more than $550 million assets under management, according to Etherscan data. Meanwhile, Guggenheim Treasury Securities partnered with blockchain technology firm Zeconomy in September to launch a fund based on digital commercial paper, while Midas earlier this month launched two tokenized investment products based on mTBill and mBasis, respectively.

Title: How much World of Warcraft content is too much at one time?

NEXT | What could be coming in The War Within patch 11.1? World of Warcraft‘s 20th anniversary event is nearly here, and if that made you feel ancient, it’s probably time for an annual checkup; also, go drink some water. We’re getting tons of content for the anniversary event — blast levels on alts with the 20% buff, revisit the Blackrock Depths with Moira Thaurissan, blast through classic dungeons, earn some truly fantastic rewards (including a beautiful blue phoenix), and more. But does it mean ignoring regularly scheduled content? Now, The War Within Season 1 started about six weeks ago — certainly long enough for big-name guilds to clear Mythic Nerub-ar Palace and/or earn Keystone Master (if not Keystone Hero) by now, right? Well, a large portion of the player base (my guild included) is still progressing in through Heroic for Ahead of the Curve, and we’ll probably be working on it for a while longer. Does this mean anniversary content is a distraction from progression? Not really. Blackrock Depths and Classic Timewalking should be a source of equivalent upgrades — you’re not missing out on gear by running the limited-time content. Additionally, the chance to earn Tier 2 appearances and a collection of cosmetics matching Blizzard Service Awards is a delight for any transmog fiend. The War Within will still be there when the celebration wraps up, ready to pull me back into its spidery embrace (ew). Having this many choices isn’t a bad problem. The anniversary event is super exciting and marks 18 years in Azeroth for me (yes, my account is old enough to vote). It’s just also hard to remember in the face of anticipatory FOMO and choice paralysis that WoW is a game I play for fun at the end of the day, and I should do what activities I enjoy without agonizing over missing out. Either way, the content machine grinds forward and drags us along whether or not we’re ready. TWW Season 2 will be here before we know it, even if it seems like we just started Season 1! Enjoy the anniversary, play what brings you happiness, and remember to take a few deep breaths somewhere in there if you start panicking because video games are not worth that level of stress.

Title: Sexual abuse of children by priests was known ‘at all levels’ in Catholic Church, says Archbishop of Dublin

The sexual abuse of children by priests was blamed on survivors and there was “no effort made to deal with the perpetrators”, Catholic Archbishop of Dublin Dermot Farrell has said. The archbishop made his remarks on clerical abuse in an interview with a US conservative Catholic TV network. Of the perpetrators of the abuse, he said: “Sometimes they were left in situ, sometimes they were moved around, because there was maybe a thinking the problem was the person they were involved with rather than with the actual perpetrators,” he said. “So if you moved them somewhere else that’ll deal with the problem. They were putting the blame on the survivor,” he said. “We know different now but then, because there was a sexual element in it, they [church authorities] didn’t want to deal with that. That was part of the, maybe, the shame that they wouldn’t actually deal with it or make it known. They kept it secret and it was very secretive.” He said there was “a culture of denial, a culture of covering up, a culture of silencing, ignoring. Nobody would accept it. The other thing, it was endemic in society”. Archbishop Farrell was speaking in a report on the US conservative Catholic EWTN (Eternal World Television Network), titled Survivors of Sexual Abuse Speak Out in Ireland. The report included an interview with Blackrock abuse survivor David Ryan. Archbishop Farrell told reporter Colm Flynn that clerical child sex abuse “was known at all levels [in the church]”. “Yes, I think that in the case of priests, some of their colleagues knew about it, were aware, at least suspicious that something wasn’t right. Certainly, we know bishops knew about it, because they were the people who moved somebody from A to B. There was a fortress mentality, protect the church first, people closed ranks, and there were serial perpetrators.” He agreed that [for clergy] the accountability bar was higher. “Absolutely. You’ve high moral values, there’s the integrity, there’s the hypocrisy, so all of those things come into play. There is a higher standard expected of the ministers of the Catholic Church.” Where the church in general was concerned “we’ve got to face up to it as all the baptised, listening to the stories, understanding the stories, accepting the truth of those stories,” he said. “In our own case we have compensated victims that have come forward and we try to settle all of those cases as quickly and expeditiously as possible. I think the religious orders, if they knew about cases and they came forward, have settled many of those cases,” he said. Patsy McGarry is a contributor to The Irish Times © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michael Saylor Hits Minefield with Bitcoin Statements – Nurse, Administer a Dose of OG Bitcoining

We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. You know how Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy CEO) praised self-custody when FTX crashed in 2022? We do. And so does everyone else. He said self-custody is essential to preventing powerful, unchecked custodians from abusing your trust and mismanaging your funds. He also dismissed fears of state-sanctioned $BTC seizures as ‘paranoid crypto-anarchism.’ Did the crypto community grab the pitchforks? You bet they did, most of them, at least. Let’s see what prompted Saylor to make these statements. Michael Saylor, the CEO of the largest corporate Bitcoin holder (252,220 $BTC), said some things in an interview with Madison Reidy on YouTube that riled up the crypto community. He suggested two things: The second point mostly referred to ‘paranoid crypto-anarchists’ who genuinely believe state-sanctioned Bitcoin seizures could become a thing. But is that all he said? Of course not. The overarching context was a bit more nuanced, so here’s the reasoning behind his claims: In Saylor’s view, the benefits of custodial Bitcoin safekeeping (aka banks) far outweigh the risks (such as relying on trusted intermediaries to remain honest). But is that actually true? The community was fairly vocal about Saylor, with many criticizing his approach. Sina (founder of 21st Capital, a Bitcoin custody and security firm) was among his detractors. We believe the risks aren’t as ‘minimal’ as he makes them seem. So, we summarized the community’s counterpoints (and added our own) to Michael Saylor’s arguments. In the end, the risks seem more than worth considering. During the interview, Saylor seemed to dismiss them and focused on the benefits of custodial Bitcoin ownership. Simon Dixon (author of ‘Bank to the Future’ and OG Bitcoiner) speculated on Saylor’s 180-degree shift from self-custody maximalist to ‘bank lover.’ He said self-custody would go against MicroStrategy’s long-term vision of becoming a Bitcoin bank to offer collateralized loans. To us, Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its decentralized, self-custodial nature. It’s this vision that built blockchains and cryptocurrencies as we know (and love) them today. Large institutions controlling Bitcoin just doesn’t sound safe or privacy-friendly. But Michael Saylor might have a point in that institutional adoption is key to Bitcoin’s success.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/22/2024 4:57:23 AM PDT by MtnClimber After 9/11, the federal government enacted the Patriot Act to protect citizens and the country from further terrorist attacks. But in what some people would call an extreme reaction, Congress passed a bill that essentially put all Americans under surveillance: It also beefed up the Bank Secrecy Act, giving Washington greater oversight over everyone in the U.S. financial system -- which amounts to pretty much everyone in the country. And it mandated that banks collect more data on their customers -- also known as ‘know-your customer protocols’” -- and report any suspicious activities. Over the years, this machinery, which had in theory been created to stop terrorists from harming Americans, shifted its focus to Americans themselves. And it has shown up in a process called “debanking”: Debanking is an attempt by major financial institutions, those with assets of more than $100 billion, to close the accounts of organizations or individuals with whom they disagree, whether politically or religiously. This growing and disturbing trend denies individuals, businesses, and non-profits access to financial services. One of the most aggressive banks carrying out debanking is JPMorgan Chase. Not only are their actions egregious, but their demands on one client for keeping the account open were invasive and inappropriate. One of the organizations that was targeted was the National Committee for Religious Freedom (NCRF), which defends the rights of citizens to practice their faith freely. When NCRF found out from a depositor that the account was restricted and marked for closure, they tried to investigate the bank’s actions, but bank staff were unable to disclose information: (Excerpt) Read more at americanthinker.com ...

Red States need to pass laws that say that if ANY bank discriminates against ANY customer for anything but pure commercial reasons....ie creditworthiness - claims of “reputational risk” will not be accepted....they lose their banking charter in that state. They might laugh if its just Mississippi. But if Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio and about a dozen more red states pass similar laws, they’ll back down in a BIG hurry. Texas already does something similar by making banks which discriminate against oil companies ineligible for any bonds, or funds from the state. That needs to be expanded. 14 posted on 10/22/2024 5:53:19 AM PDT by FLT-bird [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Wallace T.

And it has shown up in a process called “debanking”: Debanking is an attempt by major financial institutions, those with assets of more than $100 billion, to close the accounts of organizations or individuals with whom they disagree, whether politically or religiously.

If Chase or Bank of America cuts you off, just go to your locally owned bank or credit union and do business there. Debunking= debanking Barack Obama’s war on patriotic Americans is total and unyielding. Check out the government program called Choke Point! Or ask a gun dealer or pawn shop who lost their banking relationship. As someone who has dealt with this up close and personal over many years (back to the Obama era), it doesn't work that way. These small institutions are regulated just like the big boys. The regulator can shut an institution down, and even if there is not a hard violation, the regulator's wishes/beliefs/opinions are often heeded. Check out the government program called Choke Point!

And Bush. “It’s time for debanking to be stopped.” I submit that it’s time for rubber hose treatment of executives. There is a simple solution to this. Red States need to pass laws that say that if ANY bank discriminates against ANY customer for anything but pure commercial reasons....ie creditworthiness - claims of “reputational risk” will not be accepted....they lose their banking charter in that state. They might laugh if its just Mississippi. But if Texas, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio and about a dozen more red states pass similar laws, they’ll back down in a BIG hurry. Texas already does something similar by making banks which discriminate against oil companies ineligible for any bonds, or funds from the state. That needs to be expanded. The remaining "investments" may be in Mutual Funds, Stock Market, Treasuries, etc.The idea that they are "independent of Blackrock" IGNORES the FACT that Blackrock CONTROLS the value of the assets/instruments that the Credit Unions (AND "independent small Savings and Loan banks), with the automobile over-priced bubble now beginning to collapse, the Federal Reserve manipulating interest rates (destroying the real estate market), and can bankrupt ANY of them easily.

Reason million why Patriot act needs to be repaled.Banks shouldn’t be required to collect this information. It just encourages political activity in one sided ways. The opportunity is there by institutionalization so all it takes are a few bad actors. George Bush’s “Patriot” Act: We are not going to fix our immigration system by not allowing dangerous people, including middle eastern countries who sponsor terrorism, to come into our country, so we will have to spy on everyone, including our own citizens, to keep us safe. If we don’t spy on everyone, it might make illegals and terrorists feel targeted, and we don’t want to make them feel unwelcome, so just get used to Big Brother watching you. BoA flagged my last credit card donation to FR as fraud, needed to contact them to qualify, also Rudy’s coffee and an election integrity donation. None others. Banks are very tightly controlled by the government. This kind of thing would not happen without approval by the government.

Title: BlackRock’s Spot Bitcoin ETF Draws In Gargantuan $329 Million Inflow Despite BTC’s Sharp Pullback From $69K

The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, attracted $329 million in inflows on Oct. 21 for its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). iShares Bitcoin Trust’s large daily inflow took place alongside a tumble in the Bitcoin price following a failed challenge of the $70,000 level. The 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. registered total net inflows of $294.3 million on Monday, exceeding the positive flows that continued over the past week. The inflows were led by BlackRock’s IBIT, which recorded $329 million in inflows yesterday, according to data from Farside Investors. Notably, a whopping $1.5 billion of fresh capital went into the fund in the last six days. Becoming comical now…iShares Bitcoin ETF has taken in *$1.5bil* over past 6 trading days.That $1.5bil alone would make it a top 5 launch of 2024 (out of 570 ETFs).But of course… it’s taken in a total of *$23bil* since January.Are there really still naysayers out there? https://t.co/UjBGugg0Zx The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) was the only other U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETF to post an inflow of $5.9 million. In contrast, others fell out of investor favor, posting zero or negative flows. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, IBIT recorded the third-biggest ETF inflows in 2024, surpassing Vanguard and BlackRock’s S&P 500 index funds. Cumulatively, total net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs have reached $21.3 billion. And that’s even accounting for the $20.05 billion that has exited from Grayscale’s GBTC, Farside numbers show. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of nearly $74K just two months after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted 10 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January after a decade of rejections. Notably, investors and traders in the United States feel more bullish that a Donald Trump presidency is likely. The former President and Republican presidential nominee is taking another shot at the Oval Office — and is passionately pro-crypto. His rival Kamala Harris has been much slower in embracing the crypto sector. Bitcoin briefly peeped above the elusive $69,000 mark on Monday before swiftly falling below $67,000. The alpha crypto has since slightly recovered, hovering at $67,162 as of press time, representing a 1.7% drop on a 24-hour basis.

Title: Canadian Solar faces patent lawsuit from Trina Solar
URL: https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/canadian-solar-faces-patent-lawsuit-from-trina-solar-93CH-3674802
Time Published: 2024-10-22T11:08:52Z
Full Content:
GUELPH, ON - Canadian Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:CSIQ), a leading global solar technology company, is currently involved in a legal dispute following a patent infringement complaint filed by Trina Solar Co., Ltd., a competitor in the solar industry. The complaint, submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on October 8, 2024, accuses Canadian Solar's U.S. subsidiaries of infringing on two U.S. patents related to tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar photovoltaic module technology. Canadian Solar, recognized as one of the world's largest solar product manufacturers, has a diverse portfolio that includes TOPCon solar modules. The company has an extensive patent library with thousands of patents in various jurisdictions for solar cells and related technologies. Adam Walters, General Counsel, Americas for Canadian Solar's Modules and Systems Solutions business, stated, "Canadian Solar respects and takes very seriously its own intellectual property rights and those of third parties. In our view, this is a frivolous lawsuit, and we expect the court will find that our proprietary TOPCon technology does not infringe on the patents claimed by Trina." Despite the ongoing litigation, Canadian Solar reassures that it will continue to provide high-quality solar products in the U.S. and internationally, a commitment it has upheld for over two decades since its establishment. Canadian Solar has a significant presence in the renewable energy sector, having delivered over 133 GW of solar photovoltaic modules globally. Since 2010, the company has also developed and connected approximately 11 GWp of solar power projects and 3.7 GWh of battery energy storage projects. It currently operates 1.6 GWp of solar power projects, with 6.5 GWp under construction or in backlog, and 20.9 GWp in advanced and early-stage pipeline. Additionally, Canadian Solar has a considerable battery energy storage project pipeline totaling around 63 GWh. The company, listed on NASDAQ since 2006, is considered one of the most bankable in the solar and renewable energy industry. This press release statement serves as the basis for the information provided herein. In other recent news, Canadian Solar faced a downgrade from Citi due to concerns about US market risks and tariffs. The company's stock was downgraded from Neutral to Sell, with a significant reduction in the price target. Canadian Solar's photovoltaic module business in the United States, currently the only profitable market for the company, faces uncertainties due to high countervailing duty rates and potential political implications. Additionally, the company's storage margin outlook has been revised, forecasting mid-teen margins as opposed to the previously anticipated 20%. On a positive note, Canadian Solar's subsidiary, Recurrent Energy, secured a $500 million investment from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), aimed at bolstering project development initiatives in the renewable energy sector. This investment is expected to enhance the company's capacity to expand its solar project portfolio. Despite robust second-quarter results with solar module shipments reaching 8.2 gigawatts and revenues of $1.6 billion, the company's third-quarter revenue and gross margin guidance fell short of expectations. This led to a downward revision of its full-year 2024 revenue guidance. Analyst firms Roth/MKM and JPMorgan adjusted their outlooks on Canadian Solar, reducing their price targets while maintaining their respective ratings. These adjustments were influenced by a mixed financial performance. The company's diversified business model, including a rapidly expanding energy storage segment, is expected to contribute to future growth. These are recent developments in the company's performance and outlook. As Canadian Solar (NASDAQ: CSIQ) navigates this legal challenge, investors should consider some key financial metrics and insights from InvestingPro. Despite the company's significant market presence, its financial performance has been mixed. According to InvestingPro data, Canadian Solar's market capitalization stands at $835.64 million, with a Price to Book ratio of 0.31 as of the last twelve months ending Q2 2024. This low P/B ratio, highlighted as an InvestingPro Tip, suggests the stock might be undervalued relative to its book value, potentially offering a value opportunity for investors amidst the legal uncertainty. However, the company faces some financial headwinds. An InvestingPro Tip indicates that Canadian Solar is quickly burning through cash, which could be a concern given the potential legal expenses. Additionally, the company's revenue declined by 18.28% in the last twelve months ending Q2 2024, with analysts anticipating further sales decline in the current year. On a positive note, Canadian Solar remains profitable, with a P/E ratio of 22.91. The company's gross profit for the last twelve months ending Q2 2024 was $1,072.49 million, although its gross profit margin of 16.47% is relatively low for the industry. For investors seeking a more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 11 additional tips for Canadian Solar, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position.

At the NDTV World Summit, the conversation on women's inclusion in India's energy, logistics, and entrepreneurial sectors took centre stage with a sharp focus on the "3As" - Access, Ambition, and Attainment - as key drivers for advancing women in leadership roles. Preeti Bajaj, CEO & MD of Luminous Power Technologies, talked about the tangible impact of increasing women's representation at the leadership level. "At Luminous Power Technologies, the senior leadership team constitutes 33 per cent women, really making a difference, all day, every day," she said, before detailing the "3As" framework. Besides Preeti Bajaj, business leaders and entrepreneurs, including Kami Viswanathan (President, Middle East, Indian Subcontinent, and Africa at FedEx), and Padmaja Ruparel (Co-founder, IAN Group), discussed how women are not only breaking barriers but also setting new standards in leadership, innovation, and inclusivity. Despite India's entrepreneurial boom, the growth of women entrepreneurs remains alarmingly low. Speaking on the subject, Padmaja Ruparel said, "In 2022, only 14.7 per cent of the funding went to women. In 2023, it dropped to a mere 9.7 per cent." Ms Ruparel called for stronger financial backing of women-led ventures, stating, "We need to create the BlackRock of India led by a woman. That, to me, is what will drive entrepreneurship." Kami Viswanathan of FedEx said that 36 per cent of the company's board and 26 per cent of management globally are women. "We recently added the opportunity to DEI to rededicate ourselves to inclusive hiring, promotions, and supporting career paths," she said.

Title: Bonds Are Selling Off Everywhere as Traders Rethink Fed Pathway

(Bloomberg) -- Bonds extended losses as investors mulled the prospect of slower US interest-rate cuts, a trend that risks upending debt positions everywhere. Most Read from Bloomberg Climate Change Is Killing Buildings in Slow Motion How Kyiv Became a Leader in Digital Services Amid Wartime Strain Transportation Policy Gets Left Behind in Presidential Race Dhaka's Revolutionary Makeover Pits Visions of Peace Against Vengeance Drug Decriminalization Spawns a Political Debacle for Progressives The selloff pushed yields on two-year Treasuries higher by as much as two basis points on Tuesday, while 10-year yields briefly topped 4.2% for the first time since July. The rate on 10-year German securities touched the highest level since early September. The rout also spread to Asia, where the yield on Australian benchmark debt surged as much as 16 basis points. US yields subsequently retreated to little-changed levels. At the heart of the selloff lies a reassessment of the outlook for US monetary policy. Traders are paring back bets on aggressive easing given the US economy remains robust and Fed officials this week sounded a cautious tone over the pace of future rate decreases. Rising oil prices and the prospect of bigger fiscal deficits after the upcoming US presidential election are only compounding the market’s concerns. “With less than two weeks now until the US elections, concerns about the fiscal outlook and its potential upward pressure on inflation have become more acute,” said Robert Dishner, senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman in London. The US 10-year yield rose 10 basis points on Monday. The move steepened a part of the US yield curve that’s been inverted since late 2022, with the gap between three-month and 10-year yields reaching the narrowest level in nearly two years. “We will see 4.5% probably early next year” for US 10-year yields, said Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research, speaking in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Traders have pared the extent of expected Fed interest-rate cuts through September 2025 by more than 10 basis points since the end of last week, according to swap pricing, which implies a Fed target rate of 3.50%-3.75%. Apollo Management is among those who’ve said the central bank could keep rates unchanged at its next meeting, while T. Rowe Price sees US 10-year yields climbing to 5% next year on risks of shallower rate cuts and as growth improves. What Bloomberg Strategists say... “Treasuries may struggle in the coming months, with a strong upward bias for yields as the US economy stays resilient and supply concerns grow” Garfield Reynolds, Markets Live strategist The outlook is also being repriced across other markets. Swaps are signaling the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut its benchmark rate cut by only about 50 basis points through to the end of August next year, half of what was priced in after the September policy meeting. Similarly, traders brought forward their forecast for the next Bank of Japan rate hike to June, compared with later than July seen last month. Demand for long-term holdings of Japanese 10-year bonds, “which carry relatively high interest-rate risk, is likely to be limited” in this environment, Keisuke Tsuruta, a senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co. in Tokyo, wrote in a research note. Not everyone expects the selloff to gain momentum. The Fed and Reserve Bank of New Zealand, among others, are in the midst of rate-cutting cycles, which should generate an underlying bid for bonds. “We probably see a slight correction from here,” said Lucinda Haremza, vice president of fixed-income sales at Mizuho Securities in Singapore. There’s “risk of a stronger rally on rising Middle-East tensions or a Harris election win,” she said, referring to the US presidential election contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate. For now though, the combination of US debt supply, election hedging and markets front-running the risks of a Republican “red sweep” at the polls may see larger-than-usual fluctuations in Treasuries. Treasury volatility has climbed to the highest level this year, based on the ICE BofA Move Index that tracks anticipated swings in US yields based on options. BlackRock Investment Institute is among those underweight shorter-maturity Treasuries. “We don’t think the Fed will cut rates as sharply as markets expect,” strategists at the company including Wei Li wrote in a note. An aging workforce, persistent budget deficits and the impact of structural shifts such as geopolitical fragmentation should “keep inflation and policy rates higher over the medium term,” they wrote. --With assistance from Haslinda Amin, Anchalee Worrachate and Alice Gledhill.
