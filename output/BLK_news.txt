Title: Ethereum Price Rebounds, Traders Are Scooping Up Pepe and This New ETH Memecoin Set For 150x Gains
URL: https://partner.cryptopolitan.com/ethereum-price-rebounds-traders-are-scooping-up-pepe-and-this-new-eth-memecoin-set-for-150x-gains/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T04:21:05Z
Full Content:
Ethereum prices cooled off this weekend after briefly flirting with the hallowed $4K range, dipping below $3,400. However, at the beginning of the week, the leading Layer-1 protocol bounced back to reclaim $3,560. But whilst whales are buying ETH in droves, the smart money is looking elsewhere for serious gains—and the next ETH meme token earmarked by analysts for 150x gains has arrived in the form of Layer Brett ($LBRETT). Pundits believe that the Ethereum Layer 2 scalability solution memecoin is fully primed to outpace even Ethereum itself with staking rewards above 20,000% APY and explosive price potential. Learn why this low-cap blue chip gem in its crypto presale stage is seen in crypto circles as the next big thing. Despite the recent uptick in Ethereum prices due to whale activity and on-chain ETF holdings surging to 40% in the past month—not to mention institutional giants like BlackRock also ramping up—its fundamental issues remain unsolved. Ethereum paved the way for smart contracts, but it hasn’t aged gracefully. High gas fees and slow confirmation times persist, requiring a legitimate Ethereum Layer 2 geared specifically to tackle these pain points head-on. Here’s why Layer Brett solves them: Layer Brett makes your Ethereum transactions run smoothly, bull or bear market notwithstanding, by processing transactions offchain and syncing securely back to the Ethereum mainnet. Most meme tokens are just hype with no real features. That’s not the case here with Layer Brett. Beneath the viral-inducing packaging, Layer Brett offers massive utility. It’s a fully scalable, functional blockchain project with actual user benefits. Through its native dApp, users can stake $LBRETT in seconds, earning massive yields powered by low operating costs. Ethereum staking, by contrast, involves lockups, centralization risk, and far lower returns. Layer Brett offers strictly better rewards—adding fun to function altogether. Ethereum will always be a foundational piece of crypto infrastructure. But traders are increasingly diversifying into projects like Layer Brett that offer meme coin upside with actual blockchain substance. While Ethereum is valued in the hundreds of billions, $LBRETT is still under the radar. That means there’s more room for exponential growth. And with current Ethereum gas fees still reaching $10–$20 during congestion, it’s no surprise users are migrating to Ethereum Layer 2 solutions like Layer Brett. Unlike basic meme plays, Layer Brett fuses viral appeal with real infrastructure. It’s meme-born, utility-built. This project is already generating massive attention as one of the top diamonds in the rough in presale right now. With just 10 billion tokens, a transparent tokenomics model, and a $1 million giveaway, early buyers are perfectly positioned for huge upside. Add in NFT integration, gamified staking, and future cross-chain interoperability, and it’s clear Layer Brett is built to scale. Ethereum led the revolution—but now, Layer Brett is pushing it further. With the speed of Layer 2, the power of community, and the potential for 150x gains, this is the best crypto to invest in before the next crypto bull run in 2025 kicks off. Buy, stake, and meme your way into the future. Don’t let this Layer 2 rocket take off without you. Layer Brett is available in presale—but don’t wait too late. This is YOUR opportunity to get in early on the most scalable meme project to ever launch on Ethereum. Disclaimer. This is a Press Release.

Title: Ethereum’s $10B OI wipeout and ETF exodus: What happens to ETH?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/ethereums-10b-oi-wipeout-and-etf-exodus-what-happens-to-eth/
Time Published: 2025-08-07T02:00:31Z
Full Content:
Can ETH reclaim $3,900 without ETF inflows? Ethereum is starting to show signs of distribution. Its ETFs saw the biggest outflow ever. That lines up with the drop below $3.6k. Is more downside coming? Ethereum’s [ETH] has been range-bound since tagging $3,900, and the price is now sitting at a key pivot. The 10% pullback off the highs looks like a textbook flush, clearing out weak longs and cooling overheated funding. Backing that up, over $10 billion in Open Interest got wiped out in just ten days. That’s a major de-risk across the board. Plus, we saw back-to-back $1 billion+ in Realized Profits, pointing to profit, not panic, as the main driver. Structurally, last week gave us Ethereum’s first proper weekly red candle in a while. It was a clean 9.67% pullback off the top. But this week’s already bounced back nearly 4%, so bulls aren’t out of the fight yet. Source: TradingView (ETH/USDT) That kind of resilience in a choppy market signals strong bid interest. Case in point: BlackRock scooped up 23k ETH ($88 million). It is a big tell that smart money’s still buying the dip. But is that enough to offset a $10 billion OI flush, especially with whale addresses down 164 in 30 days? According to AMBCrypto, that’s the real equation. How it resolves could dictate Ethereum’s next leg, especially with ETH/USDT longs now over 60% on Binance, showing a clear bullish crowd skew. Calling ETH’s 10% pullback a “healthy reset” might be jumping the gun. Early distribution signals are in play, and $3.9k is starting to look like a local top, or at least a level that’s going to need serious spot demand to break through again. Per SoSoValue, ETH ETF outflows just hit record levels, with over $500 million yanked in a single day. It’s a clear shift in institutional flows, flipping from steady July inflows to full-blown cooldown mode. Source: SoSoValue Meanwhile, Fidelity moved 14,978 ETH ($53.6 million) to Coinbase Prime, likely gearing up to sell into strength. That’s a textbook profit-taking play from smart money as the market turns risk-off. All eyes are now on ETH’s 4% bounce off the lows. If these outflows keep coming and whales keep trimming, we could see a liquidation cascade with $60 million in liquidity stacked around the $3,500 level. In short, Ethereum’s bounce has legs. But it’s walking a tightrope. Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

Title: Donald Trump Outlines Economic Alternative to Migration
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/08/06/donald-trump-outlines-economic-alternative-to-migration/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T22:14:30Z
Full Content:
President Donald Trump outlined his support for a low-migration/high-productivity economy in an interview with Breitbart News. “We’re going to need robots … to make our economy run because we do not have enough people,” he told Breitbart News, adding: We don’t enough people to do it. So we have to get efficient … we’ll probably add to [the existing workforce] through robotically—it’s going to be robotically … It’s going to be big. Then, somebody is going to have to make the robots. The whole thing, it feeds on itself … we’re going to streamline things. We need efficiency. July data showing a drop in the number of working migrants is welcome news, Trump told CNBC on August 5. “That’s a great number because it means we’re putting Americans to work.” Trump’s comments sketch a possible new economic strategy, said Mark Krikorian, founder of the Center for Immigration Studies. He continued: I don’t think they’ve gotten to the point of talking about robotics and AI as a substitute for migration … This is something that it would behoove the administration to present in a more rigorous and thought-out way where they actually connect the dots and explain what it is they have in mind. Our whole debate needs to get away from this “Legal [immigration] good/illegal [immigration] bad” dichotomy and talk about how the large-scale importation of foreign labor, whether it’s legal or illegal, whether it’s permanent or temporary, affects future productivity in a negative way. [The productivity alternative] provides voters with an understanding of why we should be enforcing the immigration law: Why do we want less illegal immigration? Yes, it’s illegal, obviously. And yes, some of them are criminals, but most of them aren’t …. We need to do this [enforcement] precisely because it will lead to higher productivity down the road with these advances in robotics and AI. Trump’s emphasis on robots reflects chatter in elite circles about the need to grow the economy and prosperity via productivity. If enacted, it would be a big shift from the post-1990 policy of inflating the stock market by extracting workers, consumers, and renters from poor countries. The promise of cheap labor is ” a drug that too many American firms got addicted to … [and] globalization’s hunger for cheap labor is a problem precisely because it’s been bad for innovation,” Vice President JD Vance told an audience of Silicon Valley investors in May. He added: And whether we’re offshoring factories to cheap labor economies, or importing cheap labor through our immigration system, cheap labor became the drug of Western economies. And I’d say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK that imported large amounts of cheap labor, you’ve seen productivity stagnate. That’s not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct. “I can argue, in the developed countries, the big winners are the countries that have shrinking populations,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a 2024 pro-globalist event hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: That’s something that most people never talked about. We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth. But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Some leaders in Western countries are recognizing the need to grow productivity, not foreign populations. That relook is being accelerated by the growing scale of crimes, corruption, and civic conflict caused by the migrant inflows. On July 23, Trump signed a national AI strategy and told his audience of investors: Perhaps most importantly, winning the AI race will demand a new spirit of patriotism and national loyalty in Silicon Valley and long beyond Silicon Valley. For too long, much of our tech industry pursued a radical globalism that left millions of Americans feeling distrustful and betrayed. And you know that, everybody knows that, everybody in this room certainly does. Many of our largest tech companies have reaped the blessings of American freedom while building their factories in China, hiring workers in India and slashing profits in Ireland. You know that. All the while dismissing and even censoring their fellow citizens right here at home. Under President Trump those days are over. We need US technology companies to be all in for America. We want you to put America first. You have to do that. That’s all we ask. But Trump’s strategy faces huge obstacles, including the demand by the investors in Fortune 500 companies for a greater inflow of cheap foreign white-collar workers. So far, Trump’s deputies have just a few curbs on the legalized white-collar migration. The inflow keeps at least 1.5 million foreign graduates in U.S. jobs, and pushes many American STEM, business, and healthcare graduates out of the middle class, and away from entrepreneurship and management careers. The migration inflow also helps the corporate directors to shift more investment and middle-class jobs back to India, regardless of the damage to professionalism, innovation, and national security. Investor groups and their progressive allies say they favor a policy that maximizes both productivity and migration, especially of Indian workers. But their advocates ignore the abundant evidence that migration reduces productivity while also expanding chaotic diversity and government spending. Major media outlets are also eager to hide any alternatives to migration, or even recognition of the economic costs of migration. For example, the editorial board at Jeff Bezos’ Washington Post argued on August 5 in favor of allowing illegal migrants to stay in the agriculture sector: “This frontal attack [by ICE] on farmers must end … They need relief from overregulation and excessive immigration enforcement.” Bezos owns Amazon.com, which gains from any inflow of foreign consumers into the U.S. economy. But Trump’s talk of robots may help inquisitive reporters describe the strategic choice, said Krikorian. “You need to give them the outline for them to write about it [because] you can’t expect most of them to be connecting the dots.” In another corner of U.S. politics, Trump is also trying to deliver manual-labor migrants to the GOP’s important farm-sector interest group. “Well, we want to take care of our American workers first and foremost, and that’s what we’re doing,” Trump told Breitbart News when he was asked about proposals to import more workers for the farm sector. “We also want to help our farmers because our farmers are producing like never before. We have to help them, and we’re working out some very complicated strategies and language.” “We can’t let our farmers not have anybody,” Trump told CNBC, adding: You know, these are very these people, they’re you can’t replace them very easily. You know, people that live in the inner city are not doing that work. They’re just not doing that work. And they’ve tried, we’ve tried. Everybody tried. They don’t do it. These people do it naturally, naturally. I said, what happens if they get it to a farmer the other day, what happens if they get a bad back? He said, they don’t get a bad back, sir, because if they get a bad back, they die. I said that’s interesting, isn’t it? Agriculture Secretary Rollins is talking up the need for greater automation in the farm sector, which is facing growing competition from low-wage countries. Congress has avoided the debate, but a growing number of GOP politicians are joining the productivity-beats-migration view. “They’re laying off all these American workers and then they’re importing H-1B visa people to work for cheaper,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said July 28. ” I think that’s a total scam,” he said. “Is that good policy for us as a country to have Americans put out of work and then to bring in H-1B [visa workers]?” Please let us know if you're having issues with commenting.

Title: VanEck Says One Altcoin Ecosystem Seeing Early Institutional Tokenization Interest Amid Surge in Stablecoins

Crypto asset management giant VanEck says that one altcoin project is flashing major signs of institutional adoption. In a new report, VanEck highlights the growth of the Hedera (HBAR) ecosystem, which the firm notes in July, saw a price increase of over 70% due to a “wave of partnerships, network growth, and broadening institutional legitimization.” VanEck named several examples of notable adoption of the Hedera network in July, including the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Project Acacia, which aims to explore the development of Australian wholesale tokenized asset markets. Archax, the first regulated global digital asset exchange in the UK, also announced it would begin using the Hedera network for settlement purposes, VanEck notes. “Institutional tokenization activity is also emerging. In late July, Archax created Hedera token contracts named after BlackRock, Fidelity ILF, State Street, Aberdeen Investments, and LGIM. Archax’s CEO confirmed these represent money market funds that could soon transact in HBAR, signaling early but still prelaunch interest in real-world asset tokenization on the network.” And according to VanEck, stablecoin supply has exploded on Hedera. DefiLlama data shows that Hedera’s stablecoins are almost entirely driven by Circle’s USDC. “Hedera’s on-chain activity was strong as Hedera’s transactions surged as did the supply of stablecoins on its blockchain.” At time of writing, HBAR is trading at $0.24 with a market cap of $10.3 billion.

Title: Texas Gov. Wants Democrats Who Left State Kicked Out Of Office. Can He Legally Do It?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/08/06/texas-gov-wants-democrats-who-left-state-kicked-out-of-office-can-he-legally-do-it/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T16:37:52Z

ByAlison Durkee ByAlison Durkee, Forbes Staff. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to oust from office the Democratic leader who fled the state to block Republican's attempt at redistricting — though it’s unclear if the latest move in the escalating battle over redistricting will actually work. Abbott filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court Tuesday that asks the court to declare that state Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, has forfeited his office by leaving the state. Wu and more than 50 of his Democratic colleagues left Texas on Sunday in order to block GOP lawmakers from changing the state’s congressional map to more heavily favor Republicans; their absence left the legislature short of the quorum that’s necessary in order to hold votes. Abbott argued the Supreme Court should expel Wu because the Democrat abdicated his position by leaving the state and refusing to show up for work, writing, “This Court should make clear that a legislator who does not wish to perform his duties will be stripped of them.” Texas law gives the state Supreme Court power to issue what’s called a “writ of quo warranto”—Latin for “by what warrant”—against state officials, which is a legal determination over whether the official has the right to hold office. Paxton also said he will take legal action against Democratic lawmakers if they don’t return to Texas by Friday, invoking a separate state law that gives attorneys general and district attorneys the power to file “quo warranto” petitions in court if a “public officer does an act or allows an act that by law causes a forfeiture of his office.” Wu has remained defiant—saying in a statement that leaving the state “was not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath”—and it’s unclear if Abbott and Paxton’s legal gambit will work, whether for Wu or as a broader effort to expel Democratic lawmakers. Abbott has asked the state Supreme Court to rule on whether Wu has forfeited his office by Thursday at 5 p.m. local time, though Paxton asked justices to hold off on making their decision until Friday, which is Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows’ deadline for Democratic lawmakers to return to the state. Paxton has said he “intends to pursue all available judicial remedies” if Democrats don’t return by Friday, including through the “quo warranto” petition process. It remains to be seen if the attorney general will also take aim at Wu specifically, or if he could file more legal challenges against all of the absent Democrats. “I took an oath to the Constitution, not to a politician’s agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath,” Wu said in a statement Tuesday responding to Abbott’s lawsuit and allegations that the lawmaker has abdicated his duty as a legislator. “When a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant … Unable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office.” It will ultimately be up to the courts to determine whether or not lawmakers can be removed. The legal statute that Abbott invoked in his lawsuit doesn’t specify a legal process for the Supreme Court issuing a writ of quo warranto, and it remains to be seen if justices will draw out the process by asking for a hearing or additional court briefs to be filed. The separate statute giving Paxton and local district attorneys authority to ask courts to remove lawmakers says that if there’s “probable ground” to challenge a person’s office, local judges will ultimately decide the outcome of those requests. That suggests that any effort to remove lawmakers could take a while to play out, particularly if challenges are filed against multiple lawmakers in different courts. That would leave it up to each individual judge to determine when any rulings could come out, Politico notes, and Paxton told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that bringing “quo warranto” challenges won’t result in an “immediate answer” over whether lawmakers can be removed. “We’d have to go through the court process, and we’d have to file … in districts that are not friendly to Republicans,” Paxton told Johnson, noting “every, every district would be different.” “We’d have to go sue in every legislator’s home district to try to execute on that idea,” the attorney general said. It’s still unclear how the Texas Supreme Court could rule on Abbott’s request to expel Wu. In a 2021 legal opinion, Paxton said lawmakers breaking a quorum could constitute an “abandonment of office” that justifies removing them, but that opinion is non-binding, and Paxton said the issue must ultimately be decided by the courts. The state’s Supreme Court is made up exclusively of Republicans, including multiple justices that Abbott appointed himself. Chief Justice Jimmy Blacklock is also Abbott’s former general counsel, and the governor said when he appointed the justice in 2018 that he “wanted to make sure that the person I appointed was going to make decisions that I know how they are going to decide.” That being said, Blackrock authored a 2021 opinion that said the Texas Constitution “does enable quorum breaking by a minority faction,” suggesting Democrats’ actions are lawful—though he also said the Constitution allows lawmakers to impose penalties in order to compel members’ attendance. Legal experts cited by the Texas Tribune argued it’s unlikely that taking action to break a quorum would be considered abdicating a lawmaker’s duty, as Abbott claims. “I am aware of absolutely no authority that says breaking quorum is the same as the intent to abandon a seat,” University of Missouri constitutional law expert Charles “Rocky” Rhodes told the Tribune, arguing that would be “inconsistent with the very text of the Texas Constitution.” Democrats left the state in order to halt a special session of the legislature that’s slated to end in late August. They would have to stay out of state for even longer in order to actually block the redistricting process, however, as Abbott could simply call a new special session whenever they return. Lawmakers would have to stay out of Texas until at least November to successfully stop the new maps, Rice University political science professor Mark P. Jones told the Texas Tribune. That’s when filing opens for the 2026 midterms, meaning new congressional districts would have to be set by that point. It’s unclear if Democrats will successfully be able to stay out of state for that long, given lawmakers’ commitments at home and a $500 fine that accrues per lawmaker for each day they remain out of state. Texas Democrats’ decision to leave the state in order to block redistricting comes as the issue of changing states’ congressional maps outside the normal 10-year timeframe has become a national issue ahead of the 2026 midterms. Democrats are historically favored to fare better in the midterms as the minority party, prompting Republicans in states like Texas to try and manipulate congressional districts to their advantage and add GOP-leaning seats. In addition to Texas, Republican officials in states such as Missouri, Florida and Indiana have at least floated the idea of redistricting—prompting Democrats in states like California, New York and Maryland to also consider redrawing their maps in order to balance out any advantage Republicans give themselves. Texas has become the first flashpoint in the redistricting debate, with Democrats leaving the state Sunday afternoon—repeating a playbook that Texas Democrats have used before to stymie the legislature, most recently in 2021. Abbott’s lawsuit Tuesday came after the governor previously threatened over the weekend to take legal action against the lawmakers. The Texas House has separately issued arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers. Those warrants are ineffective while the lawmakers remain out of state, however, as Democratic lawmakers in the states where the legislators have relocated—primarily Illinois—have refused to extradite them to Texas to be prosecuted.

Title: Top-ranked 400m runner Conor Kelly leads Irish medal hopes at European Under-20 championships

Conor Kelly and Cormac Dixon will be looking to maintain the Irish athletics medals rush of recent weeks when the European Under-20 Championships get under way in Tampere, Finland on Thursday morning. It is 50 years since John Treacy claimed Ireland’s first medal in these championships, winning silver in the 5,000m in Athens in 1975. Plenty of other successful names have followed in his footsteps, including Mark Carroll, Ciara Mageean, Sarah Lavin, Sarah Healy, Kate O’Connor and Rhasidat Adeleke. At the last edition of these championships, two years ago in Jerusalem, Elizabeth Ndudi won gold in the long jump and Nick Griggs won silver in the 3,000m. There are similarly high expectations for the team of 38 athletes in Tampere. Kelly is the top-ranked Under-20 European in the 400m this season, his 45.85 clocked at the Morton Games last month the only sub-46-second entry. The Finn Valley AC athlete only turned 18 last month, but has considerable experience, winning his first Irish senior title indoors earlier this year. Dixon is the top-ranked athlete in the 3,000m, running 7:56.59 indoors in the US earlier this season, where the Tallaght AC athlete is on a running scholarship at Providence College, the same alma mater as Treacy. Precious Akpe-Moses from Blackrock AC is the top-ranked Irish athlete in the women’s 100m and 200m. She is hoping to emulate her older sister Gina, who won the European Under-20 100m title in 2017. The Irish men’s 4x400m team are also the top-ranked team in Europe this year. They can draw on individual qualifiers Kelly, Seán Doggett (Athenry AC) and Alex Cullen (Kilkenny City Harriers), along with David Davitt (Clonliffe Harriers), Andrew Hayes (Dundrum South Dublin AC) and Christopher Lynch (Clonliffe Harriers). [ Athletics Nick Griggs: ‘It very quickly went from a running injury to a serious medical illness’Opens in new window ] In the field events, 2024 European Under-18 medallist Cian Crampton (Edenderry AC) competes in the discus, after throwing a national Under-20 record of 58.32m at the start of June. Tampere has played host to Irish success before. In 2018 it was the venue when the Irish women’s 4x100m relay team of Adeleke, Molly Scott, Ciara Neville, Gina Akpe-Moses and Patience Jumbo-Gula won the silver medal in the World Under-20 Championships. Enya Silkena (Ratoath AC) will have been inspired by the success of Kate O’Connor in the heptathlon in recent times, achieving a personal best to qualify for the championships. Pia Langton (Kilkenny City Harriers) and Saoirse Fitzgerald (Lucan Harriers) will both race the 800m, with Gemma Galvin (Ennis Track AC), who made the national senior 800m final last weekend, opting to focus on the women’s 1,500m. The men’s 400m heats are part of the opening session on Thursday morning. Men Dubem Amah (Tallaght AC) 200m & 4x100m; Conor Kelly (Finn Valley AC) 400m & 4x400m; Seán Doggett (Athenry AC) 400m & 4x400m; Alex Cullen (Kilkenny City Harriers) 400m & 4x400m; Ethan Dewhirst (Tir Chonaill AC) 400mH & 4x400m; Oisín Lynch (Killarney Valley AC) 800m; Seán Cronin (Clonliffe Harriers) 1,500m; Frank Buchanan (St Michael’s, Enniskillen) 1,500m; Cormac Dixon (Tallaght AC) 3,000m & 5,000m; Cillian Gleeson (Celbridge AC) 3,000m & 5,000m; Séamus Clarke (Moy Valley AC) 10km walk; Cian Crampton (Edenderry AC) Discus; Theo Hanlon (Suncroft AC) Shot Put; Jesse Osas (Ratoath AC) 4x100m; Luke Timlin (Crusaders AC) 4x100m; Joe Burke (Templemore AC) 4x100m; Ben Sykes (Orangegrove AC) 4x100m; Cillian Doherty (Crusaders AC) 4x100m non-travelling reserve; David Davitt (Clonliffe Harriers) 4x400m; Andrew Hayes (Dundrum South Dublin AC) 4x400m; Christopher Lynch (Clonliffe Harriers) 4x400m.

Title: July earnings update: Boeing, UnitedHealth Group, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and BlackRock

Let CFO.com's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox. Cathy Smith of Starbucks talks long-term cost structure, John Murphy of Coca-Cola focuses on margin expansion and Kim Kuryea of General Dynamics highlights record backlog and cash flow. Earnings calls, loved by some CFOs and dreaded by others, allow finance leaders and their fellow executives to verbalize their organization’s progress. Each month, CFO.com compiles interesting insights shared by CFOs during these calls for The CFO Earnings Dispatch series. These insights include statements about their company, analysis of financial data and answers to analysts’ questions. For July, we highlight CFO comments from Boeing, UnitedHealth Group, General Dynamics, Starbucks, The Cheesecake Factory, Tractor Supply, Coca-Cola and BlackRock. Market Cap: $170.53 billion Date of Call: July 29 Boeing’s recent financial performance shows how CFOs can stabilize operations and narrow losses during challenging times by leaning on delivery execution and steady working capital improvements. In his final earnings call in the position, CFO Brian West said free cash flow usage of $200 million in Q2 was significantly better than expected, driven by 150 commercial deliveries that included 13 777 jets, nearly double the usual volume. West projected approximately $3 billion in free cash flow for the year, assuming no major disruptions. The company also held firm on its strategy to reintegrate Spirit AeroSystems and normalize inventory as production stabilizes. "Margins at [Boeing Commercial Airplanes] were negative 6.6% in Q1, improved to negative 5.1% in Q2 and we expect to continue improving quarter by quarter, although still negative for the year," West said. "Long term, there's nothing we see that would suggest we can't get back to historical margin levels." Market Cap: $224.32 billion Date of Call: July 29 UnitedHealth Group is adjusting expectations for 2025 as elevated medical costs, exchange-related headwinds and slower OptumHealth growth weigh on results. Outgoing CFO John Rex reported Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $4.08, down from the prior year, and revised full-year guidance to at least $16 per share. The updated outlook includes $1.6 billion in potential settlement items, with $600 million recognized in Q2 and another $1 billion anticipated. Rex noted a full-year medical care ratio of 89.25%, up from the previously forecasted 86.5%, driven by higher patient morbidity in Affordable Care Act exchanges and changes tied to Medicare and the Inflation Reduction Act. "As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we expect efforts underway to steadily improve our performance," Rex said, pointing to renewed focus on pricing, operational discipline and longer-term investment in AI and modernization. Market Cap: $101.46 billion Date of Call: July 29 Starbucks CFO Cathy Smith said the company is focused on building a more durable cost structure to support its long-term turnaround. Four months into the role, Smith said the company is investing in foundational changes, including a $500 million labor investment while working across the P&L to find efficiencies. “We are, as we shared even last quarter, working across the entire P&L,” Smith said. “From cost of goods sold to operating expenses to G&A, the team is taking on both short-term and long-term cost structure efficiency work.” She emphasized the importance of building sustainability into the turnaround. “We’re working on 2026, 2027 and 2028,” she said. “We’re putting in the more durable sustainable activities to make sure we don’t just address it once, but we actually address it long term.” Smith said the company is focused on setting the foundation for future earnings growth. “What’s really exciting though is when we start to grow, we’ll actually like what comes through to the bottom line.” Market Cap: $3.09 billion Date of Call: July 29 Matthew Clark, CFO of Cheesecake Factory, said stable consumer trends and execution across concepts supported margin gains and stronger-than-expected results in the second quarter. Revenue reached $956 million with an adjusted net income margin of 5.8%, exceeding the company’s guidance range. Clark highlighted improved labor productivity, lower commodity costs and disciplined pricing as key drivers of margin performance. “We feel really good about where we’re sitting today,” Clark said. “The environment has been very, very steady for us… and I think it’s a testament to our execution as well as the brands that we have.” The company plans to open up to 25 new restaurants this year across its Cheesecake Factory, North Italia, Flower Child and other Fox Restaurants concepts. Clark said Flower Child, the company’s health-forward fast-casual concept, is delivering mature unit margins of 20.4%, with average unit volume approaching $5 million and returns in the mid-30% range. North Italia locations are also performing well, with new units opening above expectations and mature margins reaching 18.2%. Clark noted menu pricing will decline in the second half, driven by new lower-priced offerings. “The real pricing is probably going to be more like 2% to 2.5% in terms of what the consumer feels,” he said, emphasizing the company’s focus on perceived value and traffic recovery. Market Cap: $31.87 billion Date of Call: July 24 Kurt Barton, CFO of Tractor Supply, said the company delivered record sales and net income in Q2, with signs of momentum continuing into the back half of the year. Comps were positive across six of seven regions, and June saw gains in all regions, supported by a delayed but accelerated spring selling season. “We see demand solid. Our customers [are] in a strong position,” Barton said. “The expectation for the second half of the year would be balanced between both ticket and transactions.” Gross margin expanded by 31 basis points to 36.9%, aided by product cost management and efficiencies across the supply chain. Barton said tariff impacts have begun to flow through direct imports and will create modest pressure in the second half, though average unit retail has not yet been materially affected. “We believe we can still maintain even at these elevated comps… the operating margin rate that we gave in our guide,” he said. The company returned $196 million to shareholders in the quarter and reduced its full-year repurchase outlook, citing a “more measured pace” of capital deployment. Barton said Tractor Supply remains focused on expense control, with selling, general and administrative expenses expected to ease in the second half. Market Cap: $84.92 billion Date of Call: July 23 General Dynamics reported strong order activity and cash performance in the second quarter, with record backlog and improved free cash flow conversion. CFO Kim Kuryea said the company booked $28 billion in orders, resulting in a company-wide book-to-bill ratio of 2.2, led by marine systems. Aerospace also reported a 1.3x book-to-bill despite increased aircraft deliveries. Backlog reached a record $103.7 billion, up 14% from a year ago, with total estimated contract value exceeding $160 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.6 billion, with free cash flow of $1.4 billion and a cash conversion rate of 138%. The company expects full-year conversion to be approximately 90%, with the majority of cash generation in the fourth quarter. Kuryea noted full-year cash projections do not yet include potential benefits from recent tax legislation reversing the amortization of R&D expenses, which may provide additional cash flow depending on timing. Capital expenditures were $198 million, or 1.5% of sales, with full-year capex expected to be slightly above 2% of sales. The company paid $402 million in dividends, did not repurchase shares during the quarter, and reduced net debt by $1.2 billion to $7.2 billion. Interest expense is projected to be $330 million for the full year. Market Cap: $299.88 billion Date of Call: July 22 Coca-Cola CFO John Murphy said the company delivered strong margin expansion and free cash flow growth in the second quarter, even as unit case volume declined 1% due to soft June results. Organic revenue grew 5%, driven by price/mix gains, while comparable gross margin expanded by 80 basis points and operating margin rose 190 basis points. “We expect to deliver operating leverage in the second half of the year, albeit at a slightly lower rate than we had previously flagged,” Murphy said. He added that about one-third of the company’s underlying margin expansion came from faster realization of productivity initiatives. While the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth, it now expects comparable EPS to grow 3%, down slightly due to a five-point currency headwind. Murphy said Coca-Cola plans to use its strong first-half performance to “invest some of our efficiencies” into growth for the back half of the year. He noted the updated outlook reflects a softening of earlier currency-related pressure and that Coca-Cola would provide more detail on 2026 in its October call. Though not addressed on the earnings call, the company has separately indicated plans to begin using cane sugar in U.S. beverages, a potential shift with implications for costs, marketing and consumer preferences. Market Cap: $182.97 billion Date of Call: July 15 BlackRock and its CFO Martin Small reported 6% organic base fee growth in Q2 2025, marking the company’s fourth consecutive quarter above 5%. Assets under management are also at a record $12.5 trillion. Net inflows totaled $116 billion, excluding a $52 billion institutional index redemption. Small said the firm is seeing sustained growth across ETFs, its investment technology platform Aladdin, cash management, private markets and digital assets. The acquisition of HPS Investment Partners added $165 billion of AUM and is expected to contribute $450 million in revenue in Q3. Preqin added $60 million to Q2 technology services revenue. Subscription revenue rose 26% year-over-year. Small said the firm remains on track toward its goal of $400 billion in private market fundraising between 2025 and 2030. Operating margin declined 80 basis points to 43.3%, mainly due to lower performance fees and acquisition-related expenses.

Title: Why BlackRock’s 2.5K BTC and 101K ETH sell-off has traders on edge

Is BlackRock selling or preparing for something else entirely? BlackRock has transferred large amounts of BTC and ETH to Coinbase amid significant outflows from its crypto ETFs, sparking sell-off concerns. In a surprising move that has stirred fresh speculation in the crypto market, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, appears to be unloading a portion of its Bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum [ETH] holdings tied to its crypto ETFs. According to blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock transferred 2,544 BTC and 101,975 ETH to Coinbase Prime on the 5th of August. Such transfers are often interpreted as precursors to redemptions, especially when investor sentiment turns cautious. Naturally, these transfers coincided with noticeable outflows from BlackRock’s ETFs on the 4th of August. According to SosSo Value data, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, recorded a significant net outflow of $292.21 million, while its Ethereum counterpart, ETHA, witnessed an even higher outflow of $374.97 million. However, despite the large-scale redemptions, ETHA still managed to increase its Ethereum holdings to a value of around $9.3 billion, bringing its total net assets to approximately $10.7 billion. The outflow-inflow dynamics also shifted slightly on the 5th of August. While IBIT recorded another $77.42 million in outflows, ETHA saw a turnaround with $88.8 million in net inflows, according to Farside data. Importantly, not all these movements may translate to direct market selling. Since the SEC approved in-kind redemptions for crypto ETFs, firms like BlackRock can redeem ETF shares for actual crypto, reducing pressure on spot prices. This reduces the need to liquidate positions into cash, offering a more crypto-native mechanism for handling redemptions. Meanwhile, at the time of the sell-off, Ethereum was trading around the $3,700 mark. However, as of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, ETH has slipped to $3,637.32, at press time, reflecting a 0.76% decline in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin also saw a modest drop, trading at $114,145.54, down 0.22% over the same period. These shifts align with broader market jitters, which appear to have been sparked by a recent hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report. The report noted, “Inflation remains somewhat elevated.” As expected, this had signaled the potential for sustained high interest rates, prompting U.S. investors to adopt a risk-off approach and potentially triggering the outflows observed from BlackRock’s crypto ETFs.

Data from SoSoValue shows sell-offs across all U.S. funds tracking Bitcoin's spot price hit a total of $196.18 million on Tuesday. However, this is less severe than in recent days. Outflows stood at $333.19 million on Monday, while Friday's figure of $812.25 million was the second-highest since these products launched back in January 2024. Altogether, the four days of outflows have meant a net loss of $1.4 billion for Bitcoin funds. It comes as Donald Trump ramps up the rhetoric on tariffs once again, with threats of fresh levies on India, as well as imported pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. The renewed threat of trade wars has fueled risk-off sentiment among investors, with growing economic uncertainty prompting many to seek safer ground. Bitcoin is holding steady at $114,000 at the time of writing—relatively flat over the past 24 hours—but has fallen by 2.8% over the past week. According to SoSoValue, the picture looks slightly rosier when it comes to the Ethereum ETFs trading on Wall Street. Funds tracking the spot price of the world's second-largest cryptocurrency actually saw inflows of $73.3 million on Tuesday. That snapped a two-day losing streak, with outflows of $465 million and $152 million on Monday and Friday respectively. Prior to that, ETF ETFs had enjoyed inflows for 20 days on the bounce, driven by a dramatic surge in price. Analysts are suggesting that the arrival of ETFs has had a significant impact on Bitcoin's volatility. Bloomberg's Eric Balchunas recently argued that BTC has jumped by 250% since BlackRock's initial filing for the iShares Bitcoin Trust, but without "vomit-inducing drawdowns." This guy gets it. We’ve been saying same thing. Since BlackRock filing Bitcoin is up like 250% with much less volatility and no vomit-inducing drawdowns. This has helped it attract even bigger fish and gives it fighting chance to be adopted as currency. Downside is prob no more… https://t.co/0ECd5XevcO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 26, 2025 On X, he argued the absence of volatility has both pros and cons.

Title: ‘Defending Paradise’: Julia Louis-Dreyfus Takes on Big Oil in California
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/julia-louis-dreyfus-oil-offshore-drilling-exxon-california-1235400793/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
By Antonia Juhasz Julia Louis-Dreyfus has three words for the nation’s political elite: “Grow a set.” The acclaimed actress is best known for playing iconic women, from Elaine Benes in Seinfeld, to Vice President Selina Meyer in Veep, and diabolical CIA director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine in the new Avengers movie, Thunderbolts*. Louis-Dreyfus is also a longtime environmental and political activist. She has made it her personal mission to get California Governor Gavin Newsom, President Donald Trump, and every other political leader she can wrangle to understand that oil drilling is for suckers — and protecting our climate and the economies that thrive off of a healthy and sustainable environment is the stuff of true patriotism. It is not always an easy sell. Seated in her Santa Barbara, California, home with her dog Georgie vying for her attention — I fail to ask if he’s named after that George — it is clear that Louis-Dreyfus is pissed off. “The idea of this decrepit pipeline that failed so miserably and catastrophically a decade ago, the idea of that restarting is an impossible thing to contemplate, and it really has to be fought,” she tells me via Zoom. A decade ago, one of the worst oil disasters in California’s history occurred not far from Louis-Dreyfus’ home. On May 19, 2015, a massive, corroded oil pipeline ruptured, releasing 140,000 gallons of heavy crude oil onto Santa Barbara’s Refugio State Beach. Oil poured into one of the most biologically rich areas of the Pacific Ocean, a key habitat for endangered whales and sea turtles, sea otters, sharks, and more than 500 fish species. It was carried down the coast past Los Angeles, oiling 150 miles of beaches and coastline. In June 2015, I walked the beach at the Santa Monica pier, 100 miles from Refugio. A fresh line of thick and pungent oil tar balls — some as large as a hand — lined the sand along the tideline, with new oil from the spill deposited with incoming waves. The spill devastated fisheries, tourism, and areas sacred to the native Chumash peoples. Then-Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency, deploying the state’s Attorney General Kamala Harris. Editor’s picks The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 100 Best Movies of the 21st Century The oil came from ExxonMobil’s offshore operations. For 10 years, the people of Santa Barbara have successfully kept ExxonMobil from restarting those operations, including the ruptured pipeline. Resistance has been led by Louis-Dreyfus’ friend and ally, Linda Krop, chief counsel of Santa Barbara’s small but mighty Environmental Defense Center. I first interviewed Krop in 2015 just after the spill. She described watching aghast, the stench nauseating, as thick heavy waves of oil filled the ocean and poured onto Refugio Beach. “I’ve never seen anything like it,” she told me. “It was just devastating.” Last month, Krop and I walked along the same stretch of beach. Children played in the ocean and teenagers took surfing lessons, enjoying a healthy and beautiful shoreline. Krop is committed to keeping it this way. For 10 years, Krop and her allies have beaten ExxonMobil in the state legislature, the federal government, and in court battles stretching all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. “This project is the single largest threat to California’s coast,” Krop tells me.

Website ‘Glitch’ Removes Trump's Least Favorite Part of Constitution But now the entire project is poised to restart, with both state and federal agencies granting many of the necessary permits. It is fronted by a new company funded and backed by ExxonMobil — Sable Offshore Oil Corp, which is behaving with what many here describe as a “Trumpian” and “unprecedented” disdain for the law, under the hopeful eyes and dedicated support of the Trump administration. It would be the first newly started oil development off California’s coast in decades, and the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the county. The project could also usher in Trump’s plan to open the entire Pacific coast (and nearly all federal waters) to oil and gas drilling. “President Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,” Trump’s Interior Department said in a statement last week, crowing that “we’ve turned a decade-long shutdown into a comeback story for Pacific production.” In response to detailed questions, an ExxonMobil spokesperson says that the company completed the sale of these operations with Sable more than a year ago, and passed me off to Sable for additional information. Louis-Dreyfus and Krop are committed to stopping Trump. They are also clear that the final say on Sable’s project ultimately rests not with Trump but with Newsom, who they argue is failing to act. “He has an opportunity right now to do the right thing,” Louis-Dreyfus says of the governor. “This is far from over.” On March 13, Louis-Dreyfus joined legendary actress and activist Jane Fonda for a press conference at the Environmental Defense Center in opposition to Sable’s project. Louis-Dreyfus then addressed a packed house of more than 500 people who filled the La Cumbre Junior High School in Santa Barbara for a town hall on Sable. Louis-Dreyfus and Krop were the final speakers, following presentations by representatives from nine state agencies with jurisdiction over Sable’s project. Krop warmly introduced Louis-Dreyfus as a “local shero” and “a champion of fighting the fossil fuel industry and trying to protect the climate, our way of life, and a clean and healthy environment.” Louis-Dreyfus has a decades-long history of environmental and political activism. For her podcast, Wiser Than Me — just named one of the best podcasts of all time by TIME magazine — she interviews older women, including giants like labor leader Dolores Huerta, conservationist Jane Goodall, and acclaimed marine biologist Sylvia Earle, who are “brimming with the kind of unapologetic attitude and wisdom that only comes with age.” She was a staunch supporter of both Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris’ presidential campaigns against Trump. Last year, she moderated a forum of Democratic women governors and introduced the event as “what J.D. Vance might call a coven of semi-menstruating witches.” But for Louis-Dreyfus, the fight against Sable is uniquely personal. Her husband was born and raised in Santa Barbara, where his family has lived for generations. Her family previously split their time between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, but that was before their L.A. home was destroyed in the Palisades fire early this year. “The climate crisis is obviously real and upon us — it’s not coming, we’re living it right now. That was certainly felt by me during these devastating fires,” Louis-Dreyfus tells me. “Santa Barbara is a paradise worth defending and protecting,” she adds, explaining that the risk of this oil project “is very close to home… and something that is not possible to turn my back on.” Louis-Dreyfus looked resolved as she approached the podium, scanning the sea of bright red T-shirts worn by the project’s opponents reading, “Don’t Enable Sable,” and the hundreds of competing hats emblazoned with Sable’s logo that were worn by the pipeline’s supporters. Confronting the obvious tension in the room, she leaned into the mic, stared down the audience, and said, “I smell a rat.” “I am here because I’m a resident of Santa Barbara County,” she began. “And this project is a rat.” She pulled no punches, describing the pipeline 10 years ago as “crap” and the people responsible for supervising it as irresponsible. “Thankfully, the whole decrepit thing was shut down,” she said. “But now, Sable Oil from Texas is trying to restart the very same, dangerously inadequate pipeline that ruptured. And incredibly, they’re trying to do it with zero environmental review and zero opportunity for public input. That is insane. It makes me furious. I know it makes you furious.” She called the project a catastrophe waiting to happen. As Louis-Dreyfus spoke, the audience erupted in applause and hoots of support, though there were some jeers and boos, too. The Sable supporters then rose and began filing out of the auditorium en masse. Unfazed, she continued on, calling out Sable for ignoring cease-and-desist orders issued by the California Coastal Commission and for behaving as “an incompetent operator trying to grease the wheels of government.” She declared, “We’re not going to let this happen without a fight,” adding: “I will certainly fight for my home.” “Sable Offshore management, employees, contractors, labor and supporters showed up today in good faith to participate in a town hall meeting where only government officials were on the agenda to present,” Sable vice president, Steve Rusch, told the Santa Barbara news outlet Noozhawk. “Project opponents forced the moderators to give them dedicated time to present biased information and smear the project. The opponents’ self-serving fundraiser and rally was not an appropriate use of public resources.” Louis-Dreyfus later tells me that she was surprised when Sable’s supporters walked out on her, and she wishes they’d stayed. “I was speaking truth to power pretty forcefully… and so they got pissed off,” she says. “I felt emboldened by it, to be honest. It was fuel, the good kind of fuel.” Krop says that Louis-Dreyfus’ speech was significant to those in the audience. “You could feel it in the room,” she said. “It was the kind of support people needed to hear.” Krop has spent the better part of the last 40 years at the Environmental Defense Center. Working with a team of just 11 full-time staff, she has relentlessly and successfully gone head-to-head against the world’s largest corporations, cutting Exxon off in every effort to restart its Santa Barbara operations, and helping create some of the nation’s most powerful environmental and public health laws as a result. The nation’s first offshore oil drilling began in Santa Barbara in 1896. In 1969, it was also the site of what remains one of the nation’s worst oil disasters, when a blown-out well operated by Union Oil Company released 3 million gallons of oil into the ocean. The Environmental Defense Center was one of many local organizations born in the aftermath to protect the community from fossil fuels. Under the banner “Get Oil Out!” local organizers spawned a wave of activism credited with birthing the national environmental movement and achieving a series of legislative victories, including the federal National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 and the California Coastal Act of 1976. They quickly won a ban on any new offshore oil and gas leasing or drilling in California state waters. In 1982, Congress followed suit, implementing a series of similar moratoria primarily off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Despite Congress and President George W. Bush allowing the federal moratoria to expire in 2008, no new fossil fuel leases have been granted in state or federal waters outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska in decades due to staunch public opposition. The offshore oil and gas operations taking place today off the Pacific coast — all of which are offshore California — were grandfathered in; they were already underway when the bans and moratoria were imposed and were allowed to continue. “No one ever dreamed that they would still be here today,” Krop tells me. The oil from the existing operations was expected to quickly dry up. Instead, the companies developed new techniques to keep their grandfathered operations running decades longer than anyone anticipated. ExxonMobil signed its first lease for the Santa Ynez Unit offshore Santa Barbara in 1968 and began production in 1981. Santa Ynez includes three platforms in federal waters named Harmony, Heritage, and Hondo, supported by pipelines that connect the platforms to shore and on to the Los Flores Canyon Processing Plant. ExxonMobil was able to greatly extend the life of its grandfathered platforms using drilling technologies learned from its operations in Russia, according to a 2010 ExxonMobil press release. It achieved “the world’s longest extended-reach well” at Santa Ynez, extending over six miles horizontally and more than 7,000 feet below sea level. Horizontal drilling is a technique used in fracking, using water and chemicals to blast open rock to release oil and gas. ExxonMobil revealed in a 2017 court filing that the Santa Ynez wells also require acid well stimulation treatments to keep producing; acidization uses acid to dissolve the rock. Both techniques release toxic chemicals into the environment that are harmful to humans and wildlife. In 2022, the Environmental Defense Center and the Center for Biological Diversity won a lawsuit, begun nearly a decade earlier, that effectively bans fracking and acidizing from offshore oil and gas wells in the Pacific Ocean. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a plea from ExxonMobil the following year to review the case, allowing the ban to stand. At the time of the 2015 oil spill, ExxonMobil’s oil and gas was carried from the Las Flores Canyon Processing Plant along the Pacific Coast Highway in an underground pipeline that was owned and operated by the Plains All American Pipeline company. When this pipeline ruptured, the oil entered a culvert which carried it directly into the Pacific Ocean and onto Refugio Beach. Federal regulators found that Plains had allowed the pipeline to corrode to such an extent that the thickness was reduced in places from 24 inches to just 1/16 of an inch. California’s then-Attorney General Kamala Harris secured a grand jury indictment of Plains on 46 criminal charges, including four felonies. The Department of Transportation ordered the pipeline shut down, which is how it has remained ever since. Without the pipeline, ExxonMobil had no way to carry its oil to buyers and thus had no way to sell it, forcing the company to also halt production from its offshore oil and gas wells. ExxonMobil spent nearly a decade trying to secure permission to move the oil by truck, ultimately losing (again) to Krop. Companies are also barred from using tankers to move their oil offshore California. During his first administration, Trump tried and failed to open virtually all federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Under pressure from the fossil fuel industry — led by its largest lobbying group, the American Petroleum Institute — he’s now trying to do it again. “You cannot make offshore oil safe, and the Trump administration is trying to ramrod more offshore oil down our throats,” Krop tells me. Back in 2018, Krop helped secure state legislation prohibiting California from issuing new leases for any oil or gas-related infrastructure such as pipelines in the state’s coastal waters that would support federal operations, which also cut ExxonMobil off from building new pipelines to carry its oil to shore somewhere else. The state has also taken additional actions against ExxonMobil. In 2023, Newsom sued ExxonMobil along with Chevron, BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, and the American Petroleum Institute, accusing the fossil fuel industry of lying to the public for decades about its products’ central role driving the climate crisis, and demanding payment for the resulting harm. Newsom is also suing ExxonMobil for engaging in a decades-long campaign of deception that caused and exacerbated the global plastics pollution crisis. ExxonMobil is counter-suing California and several environmental organizations for allegedly “engaging in a deliberate smear campaign” by conspiring to defame the company. Not long after the climate suit was launched, ExxonMobil announced its intention to exit California and promptly sold its onshore operations. Ditching its California holdings could potentially shield ExxonMobil from the state attempting to seize Exxon’s assets if California wins its climate suit and if Exxon were to refuse to pay any resulting damages. Announcing its departure meant that Exxon could no longer count the value of its offshore oil and gas leases as part of its reported earnings. In 2023, it had to take a $3.4 billion earnings cut due to its idled Santa Ynez Unit (the entirety of its offshore California holdings). Selling the operations removes this loss from Exxon’s balance sheet. In 2024, Exxon financed the sale of its Santa Ynez operations and all related onshore facilities, including the ruptured pipeline, to Sable Offshore Oil Corporation. Exxon loaned Sable $623 million, nearly the entire amount required to fund the sale. Though the sale is complete, the handover is not. Exxon and Sable are currently suing Santa Barbara County for its refusal to transfer certain permits from Exxon to Sable. But, other than its gas stations, ExxonMobil now has no remaining significant holdings in California. ExxonMobil is likely playing the long game. While the company is for all intents and purposes being forced out of California, it also has an obsequious and acquiescent ally in Trump and his administration, which is simultaneously trying to undermine and undo climate and environmental actions taken by the state. Trump’s efforts are expected to cost American jobs and increase energy prices for consumers, including significantly raising gas prices at the pump. “Sable is ruthless, they are absolutely horrible,” Mia Lopez tells me. Lopez is a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, the first human inhabitants of the Central Coast of California. Refugio State Park is located near the original site of the historic Chumash village of Qasil. Just three days before the 2015 oil spill, Lopez was elected chair of her tribe. “It was so devastating, to our land, our sites, the ocean, the artifacts, so many things that were damaged,” Lopez tells me, pain gripping her face. “It affected our relatives in the ocean, so many birds, seals, dolphins, and whales. That’s my community. Those are my relatives. That’s who I became responsible for.” Lopez stepped down as chair in 2021, but explains, “I just realized there’s no way I can ever step away from this fight against the oil.” She has helped lead efforts to hold the companies accountable and keep the projects from reopening ever since. “They have proven from the moment they stepped in that they are untrustworthy. They have blatantly disregarded laws and regulations,” Lopez says of Sable. Sable Offshore Oil Corp. was formed in 2021 by a group of men who have worked together for years heading small oil and gas companies, including companies with ties to the Santa Barbara oil spill. Santa Ynez is Sable’s only operation — and the only operation ever undertaken by the company. James Flores is chairman and CEO (his son is president of the company). Flores’ previous company, Sable Permian Resources, filed for bankruptcy in 2020 (recovering the following year). From 2001 to 2013, Flores served as the chairman and CEO of Plains Resources, Inc., a company formed in 2001 when it broke off from Plains All American Pipeline (the owner and operator of the failed pipeline found guilty of causing the 2015 oil spill). Flores also served as chairman and CEO of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas, which currently operates several inactive platforms off of Santa Barbara’s coast. Sable is in a race against time: Exxon gave Sable just two years to either pay back its entire loan with interest or give back the assets. “It doesn’t have time to get a whole new pipeline approved and built, so it aggressively pursued restart of the old, corroded pipeline,” Krop explains. “No one thought this pipeline would ever be used again.” Sable immediately set to work, receiving permits from state and federal agencies, but without a key permit from the California Coastal Commission, an independent state regulator established under the California Coastal Act. Sable contends that it does not need the permit; the commission asserts that it does. The two sides are currently fighting it out in court, with a hearing set for October. The commission has issued several cease-and-desist orders, which Sable ignored, and leveled an $18 million fine, the largest in its history, alleging months of illegal violations of the Coastal Act. “This is the first time in the agency’s history that we’ve had a party blatantly ignore a cease-and-desist order,” Cassidy Teufel, deputy director of the California Coastal Commission, said at the March town hall at which Louis-Dreyfus also spoke. “Sable representatives have told us that they’ll only stop if a court makes them.” Louis-Dreyfus sees Sable as following the Trump playbook. “Following the rule of law all of a sudden seems to be up for grabs, and our country is based on rule of law,” she says. Teufel said that Sable has identified more than 100 locations where the pipeline was defective that are within the coastal commission’s auspices. The company brought in heavy equipment to excavate, destroying and disrupting sensitive habitats and protected areas, including federally designated critical habitat for wildlife protected under the Endangered Species Act, and within sensitive stream corridors and wetlands, all without a permit and in apparent violation of the law, he said. Lopez watched in anguish as the work unfolded, taking place 24 hours a day, seven days a week, primarily carried out by hundreds of temporary contractors. Sable has just 161 employees, none of whom are unionized. “They did not have permission to dig in our lands. They did not have permission to dig up our sites. They did it under the cover of darkness. They did it without seeking the proper permits,” she tells me. “I watched them dig, and there was nothing we could do about it.” In response to questions from Rolling Stone, Sable shared a statement from its vice president, Rusch, asserting that the company’s work to “ensure the safe condition of the pipeline” was “fully authorized by coastal development permits” and accusing the commission of exaggerating the project’s impact, “which were de minimis thanks to Sable’s implementation of best management practices.” The company further states that it “implemented several construction best practices to limit impacts” to coastal, biological, and archaeological resources. “The project is supported by employees, small businesses and community leaders like the tribal leader of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation,” Sable spokesperson Alice Walton wrote in the email, attaching a statement written in October by then-tribal chief, Gabriel Dominguez Frausto. Walton did not mention that this statement was promptly voided by the Tribal Council and Frausto was forced to resign, having “overstepped his authority by responding without Tribal Council or membership approval.” In a subsequent letter, the new tribal chief and the Tribal Council stated their “unequivocal opposition” to the project, “and to any further or continued oil development on our homelands and within our coastal waters.” On May 19, the 10-year anniversary of the oil spill, Sable announced that it had restarted production at Santa Ynez, completed its repair program on the onshore pipeline, and expected to “recommence oil sales in July.” A class action lawsuit alleges that Sable committed securities fraud or other unlawful business practices based on these claims, misleading investors to inflate its stock price just before a major stock offering. It cites the California State Lands Commission, which says that Sable conflated offshore well testing with the restart of operations, appearing to “mischaracterize the nature of recent activities, causing significant public confusion and raising questions regarding Sable’s intentions.” In the strongly worded letter, commission chair and Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis accused Sable of a willful disregard for the directives of state regulatory agencies and threatened to withhold its leases, calling the company “Exxon’s designated operator.” A few days later, the Superior Court of Santa Barbara sided with the Coastal Commission and ordered Sable to stop any further coastal work until it obtains the necessary permits. Despite these warnings and several ongoing legal battles, in Sable’s most recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on July 11, the company said that it continues to produce from the Santa Ynez Unit, anticipates receiving approval to restart the pipeline, and would begin selling oil on August 1 (it has not). Six days after the filing, hedge fund Encompass Capital Advisors announced its purchase of over 5.2 million shares of Sable, representing over 5.2 percent of the company’s stock. In June, BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset manager, reported acquiring over 5 million shares of Sable, representing 5 percent of its stock, according to an SEC filing. Sable has not and cannot restart the pipeline until it receives final approval from state and federal regulators. It did not answer questions from Rolling Stone as to whether it has secured buyers for its oil if the pipeline does restart. Sable has also gone on offense, hiring Exxon’s lobbying firm, Crossroads Strategies, to lobby the federal government and Platinum Advisors to lobby in Sacramento. Platinum’s clients include the California Business Roundtable and the Plastics Industry Association, as well as progressive groups, including the SAG-AFTRA actors union. Krop is suing on several fronts, including charging state regulators with illegally issuing a key waiver to Sable. She and Louis-Dreyfus are also calling on Newsom to put a halt to Sable’s project once and for all. “He has an opportunity right now to do the right thing,” Louis-Dreyfus says. She applauds Newsom’s forceful response when Trump sent the National Guard and Marines into Los Angeles. “I’m hoping that the same speaking-truth-to-power that he exhibited then will now be applied to this fight.” “The governor’s office could have prevented all of this,” Professor Paasha Mahdavi, Director of the Energy Governance and Political Economy Lab at the University of California in Santa Barbara, tells me. “Newsom’s office could have just killed this upfront.” Governor Newsom declined a request for an interview. In an emailed statement, a Newsom spokesperson says, “While some offshore drilling continues in federal waters under longstanding federal leases, the governor remains unwavering in his commitment: no new offshore drilling — period.” The governor’s office stresses the necessity of allowing the legal and regulatory process to play out. It disputes Sable’s predictions of a rapid completion timeline, instead asserting that any conclusion is likely far off given multiple barriers in the regulatory landscape to Sable restarting the pipeline, including in the coastal commission’s case. Newsom has taken an aggressive stand against Trump, including the administration’s efforts to open all federal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling. Trump’s Department of Transportation has also recently proposed weakening federal oil and gas pipeline safety regulations and speeding up approvals for new pipelines. Many fear that allowing Sable to restart Exxon’s offshore operations will provide Trump with the opening his administration is looking for to assert that Californians support and even condone offshore drilling, and that the door should be open for more. Krop wants Newsom to publicly oppose Sable’s project, citing the risks of another massive oil spill and climate change. She wants him to commit state agencies to conducting environmental reviews and public hearings. “We’re at the tail end of this project potentially being approved and given the green light,” Krop warns. “It’s time for Newsom to act.” Trending Stories BET Hip Hop Awards and Soul Train Music Awards Have Been ‘Suspended’ Indefinitely Treasury Secretary Admits Trump’s Tariffs Are Paid by Americans How ‘Clanker’ Became the Internet’s New Favorite Slur Jailed by Trump’s ICE, Children’s Hospital Chaplain Was Thrown Into ‘Solitary’ Louis-Dreyfus joined what was likely the largest protest in Santa Barbara’s history in June as more than 10,000 people participated in the No Kings national day of protest against Trump.

Title: This ‘Isn’t Priced In’—SEC Reveals Radical ‘Project Crypto,’ A Bitcoin Price Game-Changer

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has limped into August following a sudden sell-off that even a jaw-dropping intervention by legendary billionaire Ray Dalio couldn’t reverse. Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has fallen under $112,000 per bitcoin this last week, down from a peak of $123,000 in July (though traders are bracing for a fresh BlackRock earthquake). Now, as fears swirl around the future of the U.S. dollar, bitcoin and crypto traders have been warned the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) newly unveiled “Project Crypto” isn’t priced in. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run “The most bullish document I’ve read on crypto wasn’t written by some yahoo on Twitter. It was written by the chairman of the SEC," Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer of Bitwise, wrote in a note posted to X after SEC chair Paul Atkins published a speech he gave on July 31 at the America First Policy Institute about how crypto will be integrated into the financial markets. “I was caught off-guard by the speech," Hougan wrote, adding: "I can’t imagine reading the speech and not wanting to allocate a significant portion of your capital to crypto. If it wasn’t priced in for me, I’m going to guess it wasn’t priced in for others.” The bitcoin price had already surged following the resignation of former SEC chair Gary Gensler in January, climbing again when Atkins was sworn in by U.S. president Donald Trump in April. Last week, Atkins, picked by Trump to replace the crypto critic Gensler, unveiled Project Crypto, a radical plan to carve out a niche for crypto in U.S. securities laws and embed blockchain technology into the financial system. The SEC’s new Project Crypto initiative marks the "boldest and the most transformative crypto vision ever laid out by a sitting SEC chair," analysts at research and brokerage company Bernstein wrote in a note seen by The Block. "As Atkins puts it, the winds of change are blowing," Bernstein’s Gautam Chhugani wrote. "In our view, Project Crypto upends the concept of a regulatory moat in capital markets, allowing equal opportunity to new players to participate and innovate in security markets. It is time to upgrade the financial system from online to onchain." Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free newsletter for the crypto-curious In the speech, titled "American Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution: Evolution of Capital Markets—From Buttonwood to Blockchain," Atkins claimed U.S. financial regulation must evolve or risk being left behind. “That is why I am launching Project Crypto and directing the SEC’s policy divisions to work with the Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Peirce, to swiftly develop proposals to implement the [President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets] recommendations," Atkins said. “Project Crypto will help ensure that the United States remains the best place in the world to start a business, develop cutting-edge technologies, and participate in capital markets. We will reshore the crypto businesses that fled our country, particularly those that were crippled by the previous administration’s regulation-by-enforcement crusade and 'Operation Chokepoint 2.0.’ Whether an incumbent or a new entrant, the SEC welcomes all market participants who are hungry to innovate.” Crypto companies began complaining of banks withholding services from them in a way that felt like it was coordinated in 2022. Nic Carter, a crypto venture capitalist, then coined the term Operation Choke Point 2.0, referring to an Obama administration clandestine operation to debank undesirable industries including firearms dealers and payday lenders in the early 2010s. Since retaking the White House, Trump—who has fully embraced bitcoin and crypto over the last year—has promised to dismantle Biden-era restrictions of crypto markets and companies, calling himself the first “crypto president.”

Title: Hess Midstream announces $100m repurchase of class B and class A shares
URL: https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/hess-midstream-100m-repurchase-class-b-class-a-shares/
Time Published: 2025-08-06T11:18:27Z
Full Content:
Hess Midstream has declared a significant share repurchase programme involving the buyback of $100m in shares, including $30m of class B units from its sponsor, an affiliate of Chevron, and $70m of class A shares from the public. The repurchase of class B units is being conducted by the company’s subsidiary, Hess Midstream Operations. The board of directors of Hess Midstream’s general partner unanimously approved the terms of the unit repurchase transaction following a recommendation from its conflicts committee, which is composed solely of independent directors. This move is expected to result in increased distributable cash flow per class A share, providing the potential for incremental distribution growth above Hess Midstream’s annual target. Furthermore, Hess Midstream has entered an accelerated share repurchase agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, to repurchase $70m of its publicly traded class A shares. The securities acquired through these transactions will be cancelled upon settlement, which aligns with Hess Midstream’s strategy to enhance shareholder value and supports its commitment to a minimum of 5% annual distribution growth through 2027. Don’t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Hess Midstream CEO Jonathan Stein said: “We continue to execute repurchase transactions as part of our ongoing financial strategy, which prioritises return of capital to our shareholders. “Following these repurchase transactions, we expect to continue to have more than $1.25bn of financial flexibility through 2027 for incremental shareholder returns, including the potential for further unit and share repurchases over this period.” In a related development, Hess Midstream announced in May the pricing of its secondary public offering of approximately 15.02 million class A shares at $37.25 each, which are being sold by an affiliate of Global Infrastructure Partners, a part of BlackRock. The offering is expected to generate gross proceeds of around $559.59m, with an expected closing date of 30 May 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Hess Midstream will not receive any proceeds from this offering.

As AIB and others push teams towards in-person working, management may be missing the point Are employers who are pushing for the return to office just blind to the difficulties in-person working presents? Photo: Getty I’m never surprised when I see company bosses and top-tier management try to make a case for returning employees to offices full-time, or for mandatory days where hybrid workers must attend. They enjoy a bustling office with them starring as the ringmaster. And it’s usually easy for them to be there. Imagine large city-centre offices in Dublin, Cork or Galway. The boss usually lives nearby in a place like Ballsbridge, Blackrock or Salthill. They often have a handy parking space for their company car right outside the door or, failing that, can afford convenient commercial parking. They don’t have to worry about being in the traffic, as they can come in whenever suits. They can nip out for a tasty lunch and perhaps even expense it. Going to work and seeing the gang beaver away is easy. Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: More than 560 trespass incidents on Irish Rail network so far this year

Dublin Majority recorded in the greater Dublin area, latest figures show Irish Rail recorded over 560 cases of illegal access to tracks and stations in the first half of 2025. Pic: Stock image Dozens of people have been fined or prosecuted for trespassing on the Irish Rail network so far this year, with the majority of incidents recorded across the greater Dublin area. Figures released to Kildare North TD Aidan Farrelly reveal that 567 trespass incidents were reported to Irish Rail in the first half of 2025. The data, which includes outcomes for specific incidents, shows trespassing has occurred at key city centre stations – such as Connolly, Pearse, and Lansdowne Road – and commuter hubs including Maynooth, Bray, Blackrock, and Clondalkin/Fonthill. Most adults involved received fixed penalty notices, while in some cases, individuals were prosecuted or convicted in court. At Maynooth, one person was convicted and fined, with additional costs awarded. Several incidents remain unresolved due to those involved being minors, with details unverified or summonses unserved, particularly at locations including Sandymount, Salthill, and Malahide. The figures form part of a broader pattern of offences reported over recent years, with 985 incidents recorded in 2024, down from 1,102 in 2023 and higher figures in previous years. Trespassing on the railway is illegal and highly dangerous, carrying penalties under the Railway Safety Act 2005. Irish Rail has repeatedly warned of the fatal risks posed by people accessing live tracks or infrastructure without authorisation. A person who trespasses on railways is now liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €1,000, subject to increase under the Fines Act. Mr Farrelly, who requested the data, highlighted the concentration of offences within the greater Dublin area, but welcomed the overall decline. “These statistics suggest that the bulk of offences are happening within the greater Dublin transport network,” he said. “We appear to be seeing a declining trend in relation to trespassing, which is welcome. “It also appears that for those under age 16, it has been decided to inform parents/guardians rather than use statutory powers to sanction, which I believe to be appropriate,” he added. Concerns persist, however, as trespass-related safety risks remain a serious issue, especially amid ongoing passenger growth and the Dart+ expansion programme. Residents living close to railway infrastructure have previously highlighted safety problems, such as youths throwing rocks from rail viaducts in North Strand last November. Social Democrats councillor Daniel Ennis warned at the time that “someone was going to get killed”, and urged Irish Rail to improve site security and fencing. Irish Rail recorded over 560 cases of illegal access to tracks and stations in the first half of 2025.

Irish Rail and the Department of Transport have been contacted for comment.

They attributed the outflows to investor concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and a cooling U.S. economy, and remain optimistic that these crypto-focused products will regain momentum, particularly with the likely regulatory approval of new altcoin-based products. “The spot crypto ETPs are benefiting from a one-two punch of macro demand for Bitcoin and regulatory changes that will likely accelerate blockchain adoption,” said Zach Pandl, head of research for crypto fund manager Grayscale. “Both trends should continue in the second half of 2025 and beyond.” He added that the likely approval of staking ETFs could serve as a catalyst to further net inflows. Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas called the decline “a breather,” and said that he remained “bullish long, long term." “I stick to this phrase–two steps forward, one step back,” he said. Spot Bitcoin ETF outflows have topped $1.25 billion over the past three days, while their recently torrid Ethereum counterparts have hemorrhaged more than $600 million since last Friday. Ethereum last posted outflows on July 2. It was the first time since a three-day period extending from the end of March into early April that investors simultaneously pulled more assets from both groups of funds than they invested in them on consecutive days. BTC fell below $112,500 at one point, its lowest mark since July 10, although it recovered some ground on Tuesday. ETH sank to $3,380, its lowest level since the middle of the month. Pandl noted that “there was evidence of froth in global markets in late July, including a surge in meme stock trading, high volumes in penny stocks, and tight credit spreads.” “Signs of slower growth in the U.S. economy cooled investor enthusiasm and triggered the latest drawdown across assets,” he said. The two largest crypto assets have been declining since last week, following a cooler-than-expected jobs report, the firing of the head of the government agency that compiles this data, and a fresh escalation of the Trump administration’s global trade war. But Pandl said that the crypto exchange traded product outflows are consistent with pullbacks in financial markets as a whole and are "comparatively small,” noting that recent outflows of Bitcoin ETPs were around 1% of assets, whereas the highest volume US equity ETF saw around 2% of assets in outflows. Balchunas noted that the funds have received massive investments at an unprecedented pace, so the outflows were small relative to the size of the funds, particularly the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which alone now manages more than $70 billion in assets (AUM). IBIT recorded 295 million in net outflows over the course of the last two trading days, about 1.5% of the funds it has generated since April 7. “You should tolerate up to 10% and still be a happy camper,” Balchunas said. “These [out]flows are nickel and dime compared to the haul it just took in. You have to anticipate little periods of outflows here and there because there’s people trading it and doing all sorts of stuff. If there’s a little sell off in the equity market that’s going to hit it.” Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2025 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Horror on Park Avenue: Is America’s mental health crisis out of control?

©2024 MERCURY RADIO ARTS.ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. TERMS OF USE | PRIVACY POLICY CEO/Founder Late Monday afternoon in Midtown Manhattan, the summer heat clung to the glass and steel of Park Avenue, usually a quiet street save for the occasional honking horn or blaring siren. But as the sun dipped behind the towering skyscrapers, violence erupted. A 27-year-old man, whose name I won't bother mentioning, stepped out of a black BMW he had double-parked near 51st and 52nd Streets. His movements were calm, deliberate. In his hands, he carried an AR-15 rifle. His target was 345 Park Avenue, a tower of wealth and power, housing the offices of Blackstone, the National Football League, and Rudin Management. The idea of chaos here, in this building, felt foreign — until it wasn’t. The shooter made his way into the building lobby, where he shot in the back 36-year-old New York City Police Officer Didarul Islam, whose wife was about to give birth to their third child. The gunman then gunned down a woman hiding behind a pillar, her life taken in an instant. The footage shows him moving with a chilling calm, methodical and relentless. A guard behind a desk became his next victim. Then another man, an NFL employee, was shot and is still in critical condition. The shooter made his way to the elevators, and, strangely, as one opened, a woman stepped out. He let her pass. Why? We’ll never know. But she will likely ask herself that question for the rest of her life. He continued to the 33rd floor, where Rudin is located. There, in the quiet hum of fluorescent lights and the soft chatter of cubicles, he began “to walk the floor, firing as he traveled.” Another victim fell, another family destroyed. And then, in a final act, he turned the rifle on himself. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch confirmed that the scene was contained. But the damage was done. Four people were dead: one officer, one security guard, and two civilians. Several more were wounded. As details emerged, we learned more about the gunman’s background. He had driven cross-country from Las Vegas to New York. By trade, he was a security guard at a Las Vegas casino, and he held a concealed carry permit. Yet his history of mental illness, coupled with a backpack full of ammunition, medication, and his clear intent, painted a grim picture. We also learned that his real target was the NFL, not Rudin. The shooter, suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease common in high-contact sports caused by repeated head collisions, blamed the NFL for his condition. He had played football in his youth, but never at the professional level. His note, found on his body after he shot himself, said he wanted his brain studied, to contribute to the understanding of his condition. This wasn’t just an ordinary act of violence; it was a tragic collision of a mentally unstable man and a gun. America is in the midst of an unprecedented mental health crisis. As I walk through cities like New York, I am confronted by the increasing number of unstable individuals teetering on the brink of violence. Not long ago, my wife and I were walking through Manhattan when a man on a bike circled us, looking me directly in the eye, saying, “I’m going to kill me a white man today. Today is the day.” Michael M. Santiago / Staff | Getty Images The man was clearly unhinged. Fortunately, he noticed the armed security behind us, and he quickly rode away. But what if they hadn’t been there? What if he had been someone who wasn’t aware of the people around him? The world we live in today is one where violence is erupting in public spaces, fueled by mental illness, societal breakdown, and a lack of accountability — and it’s becoming a national trend. This isn’t just about guns or laws — it’s about what’s happening inside the minds of those who perpetrate these acts. It’s easy for people to point fingers. To blame social media, to blame the media itself, to call for more laws. But this crisis is about much more than that. It’s about a loss of morality, family, social cohesion, transcendent purpose, genuine human connection, and so much more that comes with a society whose values are rooted in God’s truth. I’m not a mental health expert, but surely the degeneration of these social goods and the historic rise in mental disorders, especially among young people, are not coincidental. We can’t keep turning a blind eye to such things and pretend that new laws or more regulations will fix it. This isn’t just about changing laws; it’s about changing hearts. If we don’t, we’ll keep losing those we hold dear. CEO/Founder When an elected official swears an oath to uphold the Constitution and defend the United States, that pledge should mean something. But what happens when a member of Congress chooses to place her allegiance with another country over the United States? It’s a violation of that oath, plain and simple. Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-Ill.), a sitting member of Congress, openly stated in Spanish during a political event in Mexico City, "I'm a proud Guatemalan before I'm an American." Ramirez didn’t have a casual slip of the tongue. Her statement was a declaration of her loyalty to another nation. And it’s not just her words that are troubling; her husband, according to Rolling Stone, is in the U.S. illegally. That’s a violation of our immigration laws — laws that Ramirez should be sworn to uphold. Ramirez’s statement isn’t an isolated incident. This is part of a growing pattern where elected officials, like Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), proudly identify with their country of origin before America. They claim cultural pride, but celebrating your heritage is distinctly different from putting your identity above the country that gives you the freedom and opportunity to express that identity. I’m proud of my heritage, as many Americans are. My wife’s family is a great example. They’re Italian-Americans who are very proud of their roots. But they would never say they’re “Italian before American.” They are Americans who cherish their heritage. This is what Theodore Roosevelt meant when he said, "There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism." This is not a swipe at immigrants. This is a call for unity under one flag, one national destiny. For too long, we’ve allowed dual loyalties to take root in the very institutions that are meant to protect our sovereignty. This is how nations crumble. George Washington warned against foreign entanglements and divided loyalties in his Farewell Address. He understood the dangers of dual allegiances. He knew the republic couldn’t survive if its leaders pledged allegiance to foreign powers instead of the Constitution. This isn’t about whether you love your country of origin. It’s about the fundamental principle of loyalty to the United States. You can’t serve in Congress, be part of the body that governs and protects America, if you’re more loyal to another country than to the sovereignty and integrity of the U.S. This issue goes beyond politics. It goes to the very heart of our national identity. The growing influence of foreign allegiance among our elected officials poses a direct threat to national security. You can’t be trusted to defend America’s borders and enforce immigration laws if you’re willing to place another country above your sworn duty. Anadolu / Contributor | Getty Images Congress must hold these people accountable. Ramirez must be removed from any committees related to national security or immigration. She has shown that her loyalty lies elsewhere. Her position on the Homeland Security Committee is not only a conflict of interest, it’s a violation of the trust placed in her by the American people. Her husband’s illegal status must be investigated thoroughly. If you or I were in the same situation, we’d be facing the consequences. There’s no reason why she and her family should be above the law. This issue is about loyalty, integrity, and national security. If we don’t demand that our elected leaders place their loyalty to the United States above all else, then we risk the very foundation of this republic. The time to act is now. Will Congressional lawmakers listen to the American people and choose America, or will they continue to play politics with our sovereignty? We need to know, now more than ever, whom these leaders are really serving. This article originally appeared on TheBlaze.com. WRITER While the media obsesses over elite scandals, Glenn is having a field day exposing the Macron lawsuit farce—and the twisted truth it tries to bury. On his show, Glenn couldn't hide his glee over French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte suing Candace Owens for claiming she's really a man named Jean-Michel Trogneux. Glenn called Brigitte the "Jeffrey Epstein of France" for grooming a 15-year-old Emmanuel when she was his 40-year-old teacher, and speculated that she is pressuring her husband to silence the rumors. Glenn also mocked the blatant overkill, which included childhood photos, birth announcements, and a desperate proclamation that Brigitte is "a woman." But it goes deeper: The liberal elites have long proclaimed that transitioning is "wonderful," so why sue over the insinuation? It's hypocrisy—elites demanding silence on grooming while forcing conformity. This isn't about truth; it's control, proving no one's above scrutiny. Want to see the absurd lawsuit firsthand?

WRITER The following oversight report from the House Intelligence Committee examines the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) rushed out by the Obama administration before leaving office in January 2017. The House Intelligence Committee’s review began in 2017, shortly after the ICA’s release, and continued through 2020, paralleling a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election, which concluded in fall 2020. Before its declassification by President Trump and public release by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, this report was among the U.S. government’s most highly classified documents. Its sensitive level of compartmentation prohibited storage on top-secret computer networks. Only five physical copies existed, all secured in safes under strict protocols. This extreme classification suggests the Obama administration sought to prevent the public from learning the extent of its alleged deception. Download the PDF here. CEO/Founder Something ugly is unfolding on social media, and most people aren’t seeing it clearly. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) — one of the most constitutionally grounded conservatives in Washington — is under fire for a housing provision he first proposed in 2022. You wouldn’t know that from scrolling through X. According to the latest online frenzy, Lee wants to sell off national parks, bulldoze public lands, gut hunting and fishing rights, and hand America’s wilderness to Amazon, BlackRock, and the Chinese Communist Party. None of that is true. I covered this last month. Since then, the backlash has grown into something like a political witch hunt — not just from the left but from the right. Even Donald Trump Jr., someone I typically agree with, has attacked Lee’s proposal. He’s not alone. Time to look at the facts the media refuses to cover about Lee’s federal land plan. Over the weekend, Lee announced that he would withdraw the federal land sale provision from his housing bill. He said the decision was in response to “a tremendous amount of misinformation — and in some cases, outright lies,” but also acknowledged that many Americans brought forward sincere, thoughtful concerns. Because of the strict rules surrounding the budget reconciliation process, Lee couldn’t secure legally enforceable protections to ensure that the land would be made available “only to American families — not to China, not to BlackRock, and not to any foreign interests.” Without those safeguards, he chose to walk it back. That’s not selling out. That’s leadership. It's what the legislative process is supposed to look like: A senator proposes a bill, the people respond, and the lawmaker listens. That was once known as representative democracy. These days, it gets you labeled a globalist sellout. To many Americans, “public land” brings to mind open spaces for hunting, fishing, hiking, and recreation. But that’s not what Sen. Mike Lee’s bill targeted. His proposal would have protected against the real land-grab already under way — the one pushed by the Biden administration. In 2021, Biden launched a plan to “conserve” 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030. This effort follows the United Nations-backed “30 by 30” initiative, which seeks to place one-third of all land and water under government control. Ask yourself: Is the U.N. focused on preserving your right to hunt and fish? Or are radical environmentalists exploiting climate fears to restrict your access to American land? Smith Collection/Gado / Contributor | Getty Images As it stands, the federal government already owns 640 million acres — nearly one-third of the entire country. At this rate, the government will hit that 30% benchmark with ease. But it doesn’t end there. The next phase is already in play: the “50 by 50” agenda. That brings me to a piece of legislation most Americans haven’t even heard of: the Sustains Act. Passed in 2023, the law allows the federal government to accept private funding from organizations, such as BlackRock or the Bill Gates Foundation, to support “conservation programs.” In practice, the law enables wealthy elites to buy influence over how American land is used and managed. Moreover, the government doesn’t even need the landowner’s permission to declare that your property contributes to “pollination,” or “photosynthesis,” or “air quality” — and then regulate it accordingly. You could wake up one morning and find out that the land you own no longer belongs to you in any meaningful sense. Where was the outrage then? Where were the online crusaders when private capital and federal bureaucrats teamed up to quietly erode private property rights across America? The real danger isn’t in Mike Lee’s attempt to offer more housing near population centers — land that would be limited, clarified, and safeguarded in the final bill. The real threat is the creeping partnership between unelected global elites and our own government, a partnership designed to consolidate land, control rural development, and keep Americans penned in so-called “15-minute cities.” BlackRock buying entire neighborhoods and pricing out regular families isn’t by accident. It’s part of a larger strategy to centralize populations into manageable zones, where cars are unnecessary, rural living is unaffordable, and every facet of life is tracked, regulated, and optimized. That’s the real agenda. And it’s already happening , and Mike Lee’s bill would have been an effort to ensure that you — not BlackRock, not China — get first dibs. I live in a town of 451 people. Even here, in the middle of nowhere, housing is unaffordable. The American dream of owning a patch of land is slipping away, not because of one proposal from a constitutional conservative, but because global powers and their political allies are already devouring it. This controversy isn’t really about Mike Lee. It’s about whether we, as a nation, are still capable of having honest debates about public policy — or whether the online mob now controls the narrative. It’s about whether conservatives will focus on facts or fall into the trap of friendly fire and circular firing squads. More importantly, it’s about whether we’ll recognize the real land-grab happening in our country — and have the courage to fight back before it’s too late.

Title: Bitcoin’s $404 mln outflows vs. Ethereum’s 15-week inflow streak: What’s going on?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoins-404-mln-outflows-vs-ethereums-15-week-inflow-streak-whats-going-on/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T19:00:48Z
Full Content:
Will Fed policy continue to trigger sell-offs? Digital assets saw $223 million in outflows, ending a 14-week streak. Bitcoin bore the brunt, while Ethereum continued to attract inflows. Digital asset investment products recorded $223 million in net outflows during the week ending the 2nd of August, the first pullback after 14 straight weeks of inflows. Source: CoinShares The week began strong with $883 million in inflows, but investor sentiment shifted quickly as the total crypto market cap fell 9.48%, erasing approximately $370 billion. The trigger? A hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve tone. The sell-off was triggered by U.S. investors reacting to a hawkish Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) report, which stated that, “Inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Following the report, U.S. investors offloaded $383 million worth of digital asset products, pushing the month-to-date outflow to $974 million, just shy of the $1 billion mark. Investors from Germany, Sweden, and Brazil also contributed to the sell-off, collectively dumping $81 million worth of crypto products. Source: CoinShares Bitcoin [BTC] accounted for the bulk of outflows, recording $404 million in net losses, almost halving its month-to-date outflow of $844 million. Sui [SUI] and Litecoin [LTC] saw relatively minor outflows of just $1 million each. Ethereum [ETH], on the other hand, remained an outlier. It recorded its 15th consecutive week of inflows, adding $133.9 million, suggesting a shift in investor preference toward Ethereum over Bitcoin. Meanwhile, investor interest in Solana [SOL], Ripple [XRP], and Cardano [ADA] added another $41 million in cumulative inflows. While most institutional investors exited their Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) positions, BlackRock took the opposite approach. The firm’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum iShares ETFs recorded inflows of $355.3 million and $394.2 million, respectively, suggesting that BlackRock views both assets as trading at a discount. However, the wider institutional sentiment didn’t mirror this move. The week began with a significant sell-off. Source: CoinGlass According to CoinGlass, $323.5 million worth of Bitcoin spot ETFs were sold in the past day alone. The Ethereum spot ETF segment saw an even steeper withdrawal—its single-largest one-day outflow yet. Continued selling pressure like this signals a broad divestment trend that could weigh on the prices of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Still, the market’s longer-term outlook remains intact. The total assets under management (AUM) for digital asset products remain steady at $215 billion, suggesting that this could be a temporary pullback rather than a long-term reversal.

The world’s largest asset manager has deposited hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) into Coinbase Prime, on-chain data shows. According to the blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain, BlackRock recently moved massive amounts of ETH and BTC worth a combined $664 million to the top US crypto platform as Trump’s latest tariff policies and new US jobs data have sparked market volatility. “BlackRock (ETHA) deposited 101,975 ETH ($372 million) and 2,544 BTC ($292 million) into Coinbase Prime [Tuesday].” The on-chain data indicate that the assets are from BlackRock’s Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA), and its Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). It’s unclear the reason for the transfers, but it may indicate an intention to sell on behalf of clients. BlackRock uses Coinbase Prime for custody, sales and other services. The asset manager moved the Bitcoin in batches of 300 BTC and it moved Ethereum in multiple 10,000 ETH transactions. Meanwhile, Lookonchain reports institutional accumulation sprees of Ethereum have been surging. “Whales/institutions keep buying ETH! Another three fresh wallets bought 63,837 ETH ($236 million) via FalconX and Galaxy Digital OTC (over the counter) [Monday]. Since July 9th, a total of 14 fresh wallets have accumulated 856,554 ETH ($3.16 billion).” Lookonchain also notices ETH Treasury firm SharpLink added more Ethereum to its books this week. “SharpLink bought another 18,680 ETH ($66.63 million) [Monday]. SharpLink currently holds 498,711 ETH ($1.81 billion).” Bitcoin is trading for $113,012 at time of writing, down 1.8% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, ETH is trading for $3,578 at time of writing, down 2.2% on the day.

Title: Peter Thiel-backed Bullish IPO may hit $4.2B valuation: Will it match Circle’s breakout?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/peter-thiel-backed-bullish-ipo-may-hit-4-2b-valuation-will-it-match-circles-breakout/

Bullish wants to go public. But its timing, partners and ambitions reveal something much bigger! Crypto exchange Bullish has filed for a $629 million IPO at a $4.2 billion valuation. This has piqued the interest of BlackRock and ARK, who may buy $200 million worth of shares. Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, backed by billionaire investor Peter Thiel, has officially entered the IPO arena with the filing of its F-1 registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company plans to offer 20.3 million ordinary shares at a price range of $28 to $31, potentially raising up to $629 million. If fully subscribed, the IPO could value the firm between $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion. The filing follows Bullish’s earlier confidential submission in June, a common route that allows firms to quietly prepare for listing while keeping key financials under wraps until the final stages. Bullish’s IPO push, with JPMorgan and Jefferies as lead underwriters, comes at a time when digital assets are regaining momentum and investor sentiment is shifting positively. This also aligns with Circle Internet Group’s impressive public debut, where shares of the USDC stablecoin issuer soared over 500%, highlighting growing market appetite for crypto firms. Bullish appears to be capitalizing on this momentum, kicking off its IPO roadshow shortly after the U.S. passed the GENIUS Act. This newly introduced but still untested law offers clearer regulatory pathways for stablecoin issuers. CEO Tom Farley addressed this backdrop in a letter included with the filing, saying, “We now intend to IPO because we believe that the digital assets industry is beginning its next leg of growth. We view transparency and compliance as hallmarks of how we operate Bullish, and believe those values align well with the public capital markets.” Major investment firms like BlackRock and ARK Investment Management have expressed interest in buying up to $200 million of Bullish shares, according to the updated F-1 filing. The Bullish IPO is part of a broader wave of ambitions in crypto. Major exchanges like OKX, Kraken, and Gemini are also signaling readiness to go public, with Gemini having already submitted a confidential filing. Meanwhile, Bitcoin [BTC] maxi Michael Saylor continues to double down on his crypto thesis through his firm Strategy Inc. (formerly MicroStrategy) via a Wall Street IPO to fund further Bitcoin purchases.

By completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions. Δ This arrangement, announced in a news release Tuesday (Aug.) will see funds and accounts managed by BlackRock advisors invest up to $1 billion through LendingClub’s marketplace programs through next year. Clarke Roberts, senior vice president and general manager for Marketplace at LendingClub, called the partnership “an exciting step forward” for his company. “It also validates the strength of our underwriting, the effectiveness of our marketplace programs, and the trust we’ve earned as a counterparty of choice in this asset class,” Roberts said in the release. “We want to thank BlackRock for their collaboration and execution, and we look forward to growing this partnership over time.” This collaboration comes on the heels of BlackRock’s first transaction of $100 million under LendingClub’s new LENDR (LendingClub Rated Notes) program, which closed in June. LENDR offers “multiple tranches, each with a credit rating from Fitch,” the release added. Under the June transaction with BlackRock, all tranches were sold to funds and accounts managed by BlackRock. In all, LendingClub has sold close to $6 billion in loans through its structured certificates programs since their launch in 2023. PYMNTS spoke in June with LendingClub CEO Scott Sanborn, who argued that as high-income Americans struggle with debt, the solution is rewarding people for using the money they actually have rather than extending more credit. “We’re saying that if rewards are important to you, that’s great, so let’s reward you for good behavior,” Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster as LendingClub introduced its LevelUp Checking service. That program offers customers 2% cash back for on-time loan payments made from the account and 1% cash back when using the associated debit card for qualifying purchases. As that report noted, the reliance on credit is not confined to lower-income brackets, as illustrated by LendingClub’s target customer for LevelUp Checking. These are people individuals with a high FICO score, typically around 725, and a higher-than-average individual income, somewhere in the range of $125,000 to $130,000. “These consumers often have enough money to afford things but lack the immediate cash to pay for them outright,” Sanborn said, making them more likely to carry larger-than-average car loans, student loans, mortgages and significant credit card debt. During an earnings call last week, Sanborn said that LevelUp Checking had driven a six-fold increase in the number of checking accounts opened each day since its launch in June.

Says Hitesh Sethia, CEO, JFS, “At the heart of our model is a future-ready and scalable technology stack, powered by data analytics and artificial intelligence. It enables us to deliver personalised financial solutions at scale with cost efficiency and precision. Our integrated data infrastructure and intelligence engine help us deliver the right product to the right customer at the right time and through the right channel.” The centrepiece of JFS’s operating model is the JioFinance app, he says. Designed to appeal to users of all generations, the app saw over 4 million downloads as of March 31, 2025. Across the JioFinance and MyJio apps, JFS catered to 8 million monthly active users in March 2025. Jio Credit, JFS’s lending arm, saw its assets under management grow from ₹173 crore at the end of FY24 to ₹10,053 crore as on March 31, 2025. It offers home loans, loans against property, mutual funds, shares, supply chain and finance solutions. Jio Payment Solutions (JPS) strengthened its merchant network and received the online payment aggregator licence from the RBI. JFS’s insurance distribution arm, Jio Insurance Broking (JIB), made tie-ups with 34 insurers and offers 61 plans. In FY25, JIB generated a total premium collection of ₹900 crore through 1.81 million policies issued. “In asset and wealth management, our joint venture (JV) with BlackRock combines our digital reach and deep understanding of the Indian market with BlackRock’s global investment management capabilities. During the year, we received in-principle SEBI approval for the asset management business and filed for licenses to operate wealth management and broking businesses,” Sethia said. K.V. Kamath, chairman, JFS, said new branches of AI, such as Agentic AI, which is capable of autonomous action and decision-making, holds immense potential to define the future of this industry. “At Jio Financial Services, we are committed to leveraging new technology as a force for good by simplifying financial services and expanding access. By embracing technology, Jio Financial Services is uniquely positioned to become a premier financial services enterprise, catering to the evolving aspirations of our customers,” he said.

Title: Built To Last: Why Skilled Trades Are Surviving The AI Disruption

ByTim Bajarin ByTim Bajarin, Contributor. For most of my career, when asked to speak to high school students or incoming first-year college students and give them career advice, I mostly steered them towards a career in technology. I would talk about how I saw tech jobs driving the future, especially in IT, programming, security, and areas that would be important to tech infrastructure. Looking back, given that today AI has threatened the jobs of millions of white-collar tech workers, I should have also recommended another option that looks like perhaps a safer bet: blue-collar jobs. When I was in high school in the late 1960s, one of the more interesting programs offered separate trade school specialties. My high school provided programs for auto repair, electricians, HVAC, and plumbing. At the time, as a certified geek, I did not appreciate these programs in my high school and their potential as a significant career opportunity for many in my class. But decades of watching manufacturing jobs disappear overseas and being told the future belonged to knowledge workers, America's blue-collar workforce may be one of the safest careers to have. As artificial intelligence threatens to automate away millions of white-collar positions, the very trades that were once dismissed as "dead-end jobs" are emerging as the economy's most recession-proof careers. While ChatGPT can write code, analyze spreadsheets, and even draft legal briefs, it can’t fix your broken air conditioner on a sweltering August afternoon or rewire the electrical systems that power our AI-driven economy. As a homeowner, I have come to appreciate the skills of plumbers, electricians, and other blue-collar workers I call on often for various issues, such as replacing my water heater, drainage problems, and roof leaks.In my teen years, I worked on cars and even took a dedicated auto class. But today, if my car has a problem, I go to a skilled mechanic to fix any issue that arises. A recent Microsoft analysis examining AI-resistant jobs reveals the scope of this economic reversal. The 40 most vulnerable occupations—translators, historians, sales representatives, and other desk-bound professionals—employ roughly 11 million Americans. Meanwhile, the 40 least vulnerable positions—heavy equipment operators, roofers, electricians, and similar hands-on roles—currently employ about 5.5 million workers. Mike Rowe, the "Dirty Jobs" host, captured this shift perfectly at a recent AI summit: “We’ve been telling kids for 15 years to code. 'Learn to code!’ we said. Yeah, well, AI's coming for the coders. They're not coming for the welders. They're not coming for the plumbers.” The irony of our AI revolution is that it requires massive physical infrastructure that only human hands can build and maintain. Every AI query runs on servers housed in data centers that need electricians, HVAC technicians, and construction workers. I once went into a central server farm in Oregon that needed massive air conditioning to cool the hundreds of servers running 24/7. The more we automate knowledge work, the more we need skilled tradespeople to keep the digital economy running. Companies are already boasting about saving hundreds of millions annually by replacing human workers with AI. But these companies also need the wiring for their new data centers or maintaining the cooling systems that prevent their AI servers from overheating, and they will acknowledge that they need these blue-collar workers to make that happen. The AI boom will only intensify this crunch as demand for data center construction and maintenance skyrockets. We will also need millions of people to manage these manufacturing lines in the future. A recent NPR article points out that the Manufacturing Institute (the NAM’s workforce development and education affiliate) and Deloitte, a consultancy firm, surveyed more than 200 manufacturing companies last year. More than 65% of the firms said recruiting and retaining workers was their No. 1 business challenge," NPR noted. "The Manufacturing Institute and Deloitte projected that the industry will need 3.8 million additional workers by 2033 and that as many as '1.9 million of these jobs could go unfilled if workforce challenges are not addressed.'" I believe there needs to be a reimagining of the workforce development. Programs like the Manufacturing Institute’s maintenance technician training, now operating in 16 states, show what’s possible. Early graduates average an income of $95,000 annually within five years—compensation that rivals many traditional white-collar careers without the student debt burden. The world is learning in real time that AI is a transformational technology that brings with it new needs, particularly when it comes to U.S. infrastructure and our electrical grid. America might not be producing enough electricians to build and service the data centers that power AI. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says he has "told the members of the Trump team that we’re going to run out of electricians as we build out AI data centers. We just don’t have enough." These centers are a critical part of building America's leadership in AI. For decades, American culture has pushed college as the only path to middle-class prosperity while stigmatizing manual labor as somehow lesser work. This cultural bias persists even as plumbers and electricians often out-earn college graduates saddled with student loans. The AI revolution may finally force a long-overdue reckoning with these assumptions. When artificial intelligence can write legal briefs but can't unclog a drain, maybe it's time to reconsider which skills are truly valuable in the modern economy. One big question asked of tech CEOs is whether they are willing to help retrain many of their tech workers who will lose jobs to AI. As of now, I have seen no dedicated programs coming from tech companies that offer any transitional programs, especially towards blue-collar careers that could be just as lucrative as the white collar programs today. I suspect this transition won’t happen automatically. It requires coordinated effort from employers, educational institutions, and policymakers to create pathways for mid-career workers displaced by AI to retrain for skilled trades. The infrastructure exists—apprenticeship programs, community college partnerships, and industry training initiatives—but it needs to be massively scaled. As artificial intelligence transforms the American workforce, one truth is emerging: the future will favor not those who mimic machines, but those who offer what machines can't—deeply human skills. In a world racing toward automation, this is a powerful reminder that some roles still demand the irreplaceable human touch.

Title: Viral RNA-Based Sprays For Plants Have Unknown Consequences

by Rhoda Wilson | Aug 5, 2025 | Headline News | 0 comments This article was originally published by Rhoda Wilson at Natural News. Terrana Biosciences is on a mission to replace pesticides with its RNA-based sprays as “vaccines” for plants to protect crops from pests and diseases. The RNA is taken from plant viruses. Terrana claims its sprays do not alter the plant genome and merely deliver RNA into plants to stimulate an immune response or produce protective proteins. But in reality, they don’t know, as there have been no long-term safety studies. The company describes its products as: “Terrana sources native RNAs from across the plant world and gives them new instructions to make any desired trait and solve for problems at any point in the plant’s lifecycle,” which indicates their true aim. Michelle Perro explains why Terrana’s sprays are risky, very risky, for people and the environment. RNA sprays are more dangerous than GMO crops, she says. Related: The architects of Moderna’s mRNA shots are plotting to spray RNA on your food, Natural News. 25 July 202 Terrana Biosciences was launched by the venture capital firm Flagship Pioneering on 1 July 2025. At the end of July, reports were circulating that the company had received approval to spray synthetic RNA onto American food crops. The reports (for example, see HERE and HERE) don’t provide their sources for the approval, so we haven’t been able to verify these claims. However, in December 2023, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) approved ledprona, a sprayable double-stranded ribonucleic acid pesticide. Marketed as Calantha, which uses ledprona as its active ingredient, the RNA interference (“RNAi”) pesticide was developed by GreenLight Biosciences. Perhaps the July reports are conflating the launch of Terrana Biosciences and the approval of GreenLight’s RNA products? Regardless, the whole agenda of replacing chemicals with RNA products is nefarious. Table of Contents GreenLight Biosciences, founded in 2008 and based in Massachusetts, is a biotechnology company that uses RNA technology to develop sustainable solutions for agriculture and human health. “In Rochester, New York, we are operating the world’s largest RNA factory,” the company boasts. It has received US regulatory approval to sell its RNAi pesticide for the Colorado potato beetle, Calantha, and is awaiting approval for Norroa, an RNAi product to “protect honeybees” from varroa mites. In December 2024, GreenLight announced the establishment of GreenLight Biosciences México, S. de R.L. de C.V., expanding its operations to Brazil and Mexico. “Among the innovative technologies to be introduced are a novel adjuvant that improves crop protection performance and Norroa,” the company said. This year, GreenLight has received substantial funding. In March 2025, the company announced a $25 million investment from Just Climate. Just Climate was established in 2021 by Generation Investment Management as a “specialist investment business focused on scaling solutions for the highest-emitting, most off-track sectors of the economy.” Generation Investment Management is an investment management firm founded in 2004 by former US Vice President Al Gore and former Goldman Sachs’ Asset Management head David Blood, along with five other partners. According to a report in 2017, the company had US$18 billion under management and was based in London with an office in San Francisco. At the time, the company employed 100 people. According to Wikipedia, it has partnerships with the following: “[Just Climate’s] investment enables the company to continue its expansion across key international markets, including Brazil and other Latin American countries. Recent expansion efforts include the establishment of a state-of-the-art Agricultural Research Station in Seville, Spain, which now serves as the Company’s European hub for innovation and collaborative research in sustainable agriculture practices,” GreenLight Biosciences said. In February 2025, the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) provided a €35 million loan to GreenLight Biosciences Spain to “support research and production of ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi)-based biocontrols.” RNAi-based “biocontrols” (i.e. pesticides) “constitute a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical pesticides,” EIB said. Adding, “The EIB loan will support GreenLight Bio’s RDI programmes associated with the research, registration, and production of a pipeline of ten products to be launched in the EU … The loan will also finance the research and innovation centre of Greenlight Biosciences in Seville, Spain.” Now read the Globalist propaganda GreenLight uses to push its gene editing products. Note the use of the phrase “nature-based pest control” and “environmentally friendly.” It is an outright lie to claim that gene manipulation is “nature-based” or “environmentally friendly.” “At GreenLight Biosciences, we believe that providing farmers with nature-based pest control solutions is key to building a more sustainable and resilient food supply chain. Our platform is not only environmentally friendly but also offers farmers an effective and safe alternative to traditional pesticides,” stated GreenLight Biosciences Chief Strategy Officer & co-founder Marta Ortega-Valle. “With the support of the European Investment Bank, we can expand our efforts to bring these innovative solutions to farmers across Europe.” Spain: EIB finances GreenLight Biosciences with €35 million to invest in research and production of RNA-based biological pesticides, European Investment Bank, 3 February 2025 According to the company profile on Investing, GreenLight Biosciences is also involved in human health, with “a phase I/II preclinical stage vaccine for COVID-19 and candidate selection vaccines for shingles and oncology.” We previously noted Flagship Pioneering in our article ‘UK’s plan to be a “science and technology superpower” progresses; dystopia looms’. In this article, we quoted a Department for Science, Innovation & Technology policy paper which said: US Venture Capital firm Flagship Pioneering announced its strategic commitment to the UK life sciences ecosystem in 2023 and established its first base outside of the US in London. This was marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UK government … This commitment was combined with Flagship’s milestone launch of Quotient Therapeutics, the first Flagship-founded company co-anchored in the UK and US. Innovation, investment and growth in life sciences – applying the Science and Technology Framework to one of the UK’s strongest sectors, The UK Science and Technology Framework: update on progress (9 February 2024), Department for Science, Innovation & Technology, 9 February 2024 In our 2021 article ‘Building an Empire – The United Nations Using the World Economic Forum to Roll Out Its Agenda’, we noted that “the top institutional shareholders of Moderna are Baillie Gifford & Company, and Flagship Pioneering Inc. (founded by Noubar Afeyan) followed by Vanguard, Blackrock and Morgan Stanley.” In an article last year, ‘Moderna’s influence over the US and UK governments is more than most realise’, we noted: “Flagship Pioneering are a venture capital firm that financed and kickstarted Moderna. The CEO of Flagship Pioneering, Noubar Afeyan, also co-founded Moderna. So, they’re essentially one and the same.” Wikispooks notes that “after Noubar Afeyan and Robert Langer, [Stéphane] Bancel is the largest individual shareholder in [Moderna].” So, who is Flagship Pioneering? Founded in 1999 by Noubar Afeyan and Ed Kania under the name NewcoGen, it was later renamed Flagship Ventures and then Flagship Pioneering in 2016. The company has originated and fostered more than 100 companies since its launch in 2000, resulting in over $60 billion in aggregate value. According to its LinkedIn profile, “The current Flagship ecosystem comprises over 40 companies.” You can see a list of these companies HERE, one of which is Moderna. In 2023, Flagship Pioneering established its first European base in London, marking a significant expansion into the UK life sciences sector. This move was followed by the launch of Quotient Therapeutics. At the beginning of this year, Flagship Pioneering partnered with Cambridge University Health Partners (“CUHP”) and the Milner Therapeutics Institute (MTI) to accelerate biotech research and innovation in the UK. You can see a list of Flagship’s numerous partners HERE, including ThermoFisher, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer and GSK. In 2025, Flagship unveiled Terrana Biosciences. Forbes reported in 2021 that founder Noubar Afeyan owns at least 75% of Flagship Pioneering. By Michelle Perro, MD, as published by GMO Science on 31 July 2025 Terrana Biosciences, launched by Flagship Pioneering, the creator of Moderna, received a $50 million initial investment and government approval for experimental-use authorisations, raising ethical and public health alarms. The company pioneers RNA-based agricultural traits throughout a “proprietary technology platform.” The company claims that their approach will empower farmers with “… precise, adaptive solutions to combat threats to crops in fields and orchards and enhance resiliency, sustainability, and productivity in the global food system.” Is this an incredible breakthrough or more of the same rhetoric that we endured and heard spouted with genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”) that turned out to be an environmental and health disaster? Instead of modifying DNA, Terrana’s spray-on RNA platform delivers engineered RNA molecules through tiny tears in plant leaves; these enter plant cells, replicate and can express proteins such as viral antigens, insecticidal Cry toxins, or climate‑resilience genes designed to act as programmable plant vaccines. Thus, Terrana will use RNA from plant viruses as a chassis to carry pieces of “cargo RNA” into a plant to help it fight infections and insects, and deliver vaccines. The CEO of Terrana (and a Flagship partner), Ryan Rapp, says we should think of this “… like software. You can stick a floppy disk or USB drive into the computer and give it a set of instructions. This is the first time we’ve had a platform where we can actually do this in plants”. Terrana CEO Ryan Rapp: “We are giving humanity this other tool as we start to deal with climate change to help us deal with the effects on food supply and production.” ‘There are so many things we can do with this’… Terrana Biosciences to unleash RNA-based crop protection, Ag Tech Navigator, 3 July 2025 Kids aren’t software updates! Keep synthetic RNA off their plates. The approach by Terrana differs from those using RNA interference (“RNAi”) on crops. The EPA gave the green light to farmers in 2024 to use an RNAi insecticide from GreenLight Biosciences. When consumed by beetles, the RNA silences their survival gene. RNA sprays are deployed without long-term safety data on human exposure, children, or immune and reproductive effects. The technology remains unlabelled, and liability protections are in place under experimental regulatory frameworks. Terrana’s products fall under experimental authorisation, meaning neither Terrana nor government agencies bear liability for adverse outcomes. There is no mandatory labelling, so consumers cannot give informed consent or opt out. RNA molecules entering human food supplies may alter gut-associated lymphoid tissue (“GALT”), raising unknown immunological consequences in children. Repeat exposure could disrupt hormonal signalling, endocrine pathways or even transgenerational development (affecting our offspring), given RNA’s potential systemic persistence. Terrana claims some RNA constructs may be heritable across plant generations, raising an alarm about unintentional spread across species and ecosystems. This uncontrolled gene expression mirrors historically what we have witnessed with GMOs, only magnified by a sprayable, replicable system. The fight against GMOs has been an uphill battle, with industry and regulatory agencies suppressing public awareness despite mounting and censored scientific evidence of harm. This is the same pattern of secrecy and dismissal now repeating itself with the untested, unlabelled RNA spray technology being pushed onto our food and environment. The EPA has already approved RNA-based applications such as GreenLight’s RNAi spray in 2024. Terrana’s RNA is more advanced: it enters the plant interior and replicates, rather than merely coating leaves like earlier RNA sprays. Regulatory agencies have permitted early usage under experimental-use guidance, without labelling mandates and with pre-emption protections, shielding manufacturers from legal accountability. What Could Go Wrong? Terrana’s “software” approach to plants is far more dangerous than traditional GMOs because it bypasses genetic modification and instead reprogrammes plants in real-time, using synthetic RNA sprays that alter gene expression without leaving a clear genetic fingerprint. Unlike GMOs, which underwent lengthy (although faulty and imperfect) regulatory reviews and must be grown from modified seeds, RNA sprays can be applied repeatedly and directly onto crops, meaning gene expression can be continuously manipulated in the field. This creates a moving target for a safety evaluation. Be clear: there is no fixed genome to study, no long-term data, and no labelling for consumers. By treating plants like “computers” to be constantly re-coded, this technology risks unpredictable ripple effects on plant physiology, pollinators, and human health. Traditional GMOs were studied and showed harm, but were ignored by industry and the government. Terrana’s RNA sprays are the next unretrievable experimental, untested at scale, and stunningly released under legal immunity, which makes this approach a vast, uncontrolled genetic experiment in our food system, our health, and our environment. The effects of RNA sprays on our microbiome? Unknown. While Big Ag and Big Tech proponents tout RNA sprays as “climate‑responsive” innovations, the lack of long-term safety studies, the absence of labelling, and legal immunity represent an unchecked genetic experiment. Unlike GMOs subjected to years of oversight and litigation, this new platform bypasses those meagre safeguards entirely. As a physician, I urge readers and policymakers alike to demand transparency, full labelling, independent safety testing, especially assessing impacts on children’s immune and reproductive health, before allowing gene-altering sprays into our food system and environment. Approval? No. Moratorium. Michelle Perro, MD, is a veteran paediatrician with over four decades of experience in acute and integrative medicine, co-founder and CEO of GMOScience. More than fifteen years ago, Dr. Perro transformed her clinical practice to include the health effects of GMOs and their associated pesticides.

Title: BlackRock Leads US Spot Ether ETFs’ Record $465 Million One-Day Bloodbath
URL: https://zycrypto.com/blackrock-leads-us-spot-ether-etfs-record-465-million-one-day-bloodbath/
Time Published: 2025-08-05T11:49:46Z
Full Content:
Investors yanked a staggering $465.1 million from spot Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Monday, marking the biggest one-day outflow since the cohort’s debut last year. The Monday outflows effectively ended their longest inflow streak. The recent run saw record-breaking activity, when the nine spot Ether ETFs trading in the US saw inflows of $2.2 billion in the second week of July, $1.9 billion in the third week, and $154.3 million just last week. BlackRock’s ETHA led Monday’s losses, shedding $375 million, while Fidelity’s FETH followed with a $55.1 million drop, according to UK asset manager Farside Investors. Not a single ETH ETF posted inflows on Monday, with multiple funds remaining flat for the day. Despite the recent outflows, the Ethereum ETFs have still collectively netted $9.02 billion in total inflows. Ethereum was recently trading at around $3,680 at press time as the broader crypto market saw a modest uptick. According to a recent report by Standard Chartered, corporations are now acquiring Ether at twice the rate of Bitcoin. Since the start of June, crypto treasury firms have scooped up approximately 1% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply, suggesting a growing institutional appetite for the second-largest cryptocurrency. On Monday, for instance, Peter Thiel-backed BitMine Immersion surpassed $3 billion in Ethereum, making it the largest corporate ETH treasury. According to the company’s official announcement, BitMine now ranks as the third largest public crypto treasury in the world, behind only Michael Saylor’s Strategy and miner Mara Blockchain, which both hold Bitcoin (BTC). BitMine, which aims to control 5% of all Ethereum held or staked, launched its strategy earlier this month. The Nasdaq-listed company said that it has achieved its 833,137 ETH stockpile in just 35 days. Standard Chartered stressed that such accumulation, coupled with steady inflows into US spot Ether ETFs, has been a key catalyst behind Ether’s recent upsurge. The British multinational bank thinks these trends could propel ETH beyond the $4,000 price threshold by year-end. Looking ahead, the bank forecasts that Ethereum treasury companies could eventually own as much as 10% of the entire supply, citing the added benefits of staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) participation.
