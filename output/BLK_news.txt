Ark Invest’s CEO and CIO, Cathie Wood, joined Fox Business’s “Morning With Maria” to discuss her investment strategy as she believes the US is entering a “historic productivity surge,” and why she is bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) for 2026. On Tuesday, Ark Invest’s CEO, Cathie Wood, shared her perspective on the recent Bitcoin performance, which has retraced over 10% in the past month and struggled to reclaim crucial levels over the past few weeks. To Wood, Bitcoin has been behaving like a risk-on asset and is currently “climbing another wall of worry” that has made investors wary of the leading crypto asset’s upcoming performance. As she explained, there is a fear of the four-year cycle, which suggests that 2026 will be a corrective year for Bitcoin. Historically, BTC has seen significant price pullbacks during bear markets, with retraces of up to 75% to 90% in previous cycles. The aggressive Q4 2025 correction has shattered most investors’ expectations of an end-of-year bull run, raising concerns that the crypto market has already entered the bearish phase of the cycle after the more than 30% drop from the October highs. However, Ark Invest’s CEO considers that “the four-year cycle is going to be disrupted” as volatility has significantly diminished over the past few years, and large-scale investors turn to the rapidly growing industry. “We think that the move by institutions into this new asset class is going to prevent much more of a decline,” Wood affirmed, noting, “we might have seen it a couple of weeks ago,” when BTC managed to hold the $80,000 barrier during the late November correction. She previously asserted that growing institutional adoption will be a powerful driver for long-term value for the cryptocurrency, adding that institutions “really have just dipped their toes into this space. We have just started, so we have a long way to go.” During the interview, Wood also reaffirmed her previous forecast that the flagship crypto will outperform gold next year, despite its choppy performance during the last quarter of 2025. She highlighted that “gold is more of a risk-off asset,” and its 60% year-to-date (YTD) rise is “proof” that Bitcoin is climbing a wall of worry as investors “are using gold as a hedge against geopolitical risks.” Nonetheless, Ark Invest’s CEO pointed out that between the early 80s and the late 90s, gold peaked and “went down as we were in the golden age of innovation, ending with the internet.” Now, she believes that the same could happen soon, as what she calls “the AI age” starts and the market potentially recovers. Meanwhile, she forecasted that Bitcoin would remain risk-on and outperform gold in 2026. “I really believe we are moving from a rolling recession where we’ve been for the last three years, into a rolling recovery, which we think we are entering now. Then, a productivity-driven boom the likes of which we have never seen before,” Wood concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $94,011, a 3.75% increase in the daily timeframe.

Rubmar is a writer and translator who has been a crypto enthusiast for the past four years. Her goal as a writer is to create informative, complete, and easily understandable pieces accessible to those entering the crypto space. After learning about cryptocurrencies in 2019, Rubmar became curious about the world of possibilities the industry offered, quickly learning that financial freedom was at the palm of her hand with the developing technology. From a young age, Rubmar was curious about how languages work, finding special interest in wordplay and the peculiarities of dialects. Her curiosity grew as she became an avid reader in her teenage years. She explored freedom and new words through her favorite books, which shaped her view of the world. Rubmar acquired the necessary skills for in-depth research and analytical thinking at university, where she studied Literature and Linguistics. Her studies have given her a sharp perspective on several topics and allowed her to turn every stone in her investigations. In 2019, she first dipped her toes in the crypto industry when a friend introduced her to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but it wasn’t until 2020 that she started to dive into the depth of the industry. As Rubmar began to understand the mechanics of the crypto sphere, she saw a new world yet to be explored. At the beginning of her crypto voyage, she discovered a new system that allowed her to have control over her finances. As a young adult of the 21st century, Rubmar has faced the challenges of the traditional banking system and the restrictions of fiat money. After the failure of her home country’s economy, the limitations of traditional finances became clear. The bureaucratic, outdated structure made her feel hopeless and powerless amid an aggressive and distorted system created by hyperinflation. However, learning about decentralization and self-custody opened a realm of opportunities. Cryptocurrencies allowed her to experience financial control for the first time and expand her financial education. Moreover, the peculiar nature of the crypto community sparked Rubmar’s curiosity about the other layers of the industry. As a result, she found a particular interest in discovering the diverse perspectives of investors, market watchers, experts, and developers. Her attempts to better understand the crypto space made her realize the strong links of the community with other industries, enriching her perspective of the sector. As someone who spends most of her day online, Rubmar enjoys finding the points where the crypto world meets with her other passions and hobbies ­–or her favorite memes. In her free time, she usually finds joy in different art forms. As a child, she enlisted in every extra-curricular activity in her hometown, including music classes, dancing, jewelry making, and the local chorus. Despite her many attempts to learn different instruments, Rubmar only knows how to play the xylophone, which she played for 7 years in her school’s marching band. She also has a passion for learning new languages and cultures, having set the goal to learn another six languages ­– currently attempting to learn Italian and Korean. Scrapbooking, paper crafting, and bookbinding are her biggest interests outside of work, constantly taking classes and attending workshops to learn new techniques. The rest of her free time is spent stressing over football matches and transfer market news or feeding cats –hers or stray. In summary, Rubmar seeks to present entertaining and educational pieces to be enjoyed by everybody, aiming to report on the latest news and offer a unique perspective while adding a meme or a pun whenever possible.

Title: Ethereum Price Climbs Toward $3,300 For The First Time Since November: What’s Driving The Surge?

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. On Tuesday, the Ethereum price experienced a notable surge, climbing by 6.5% and reclaiming the critical $3,300 mark for the first time in nearly a month. This has allowed Ethereum to outpace its peers among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, showcasing a nearly 12% recovery for the leading altcoin over the past week. Analysts from Bull Theory attribute this resurgence to several key factors, including significant institutional interest in Ethereum. The firm highlighted BitMine, which holds the largest public company collection of ETH, as a major player in this recovery phase. In a recent social media update on X (formerly Twitter), the analysts pointed out that demand for ETH is on the rise as Wall Street quietly builds on the Ethereum platform. Notably, major financial institutions are beginning to make substantial moves in the Ethereum space. BlackRock, which manages $13.5 trillion, is launching tokenized funds and has filed for a staked Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). Other notable players include JPMorgan with $4 trillion in assets, Deutsche Bank at $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered with $800 billion. These firms are developing tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure specifically on Ethereum and its Layer 2 (L2) solutions. In addition, well-known financial entities such as Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase (COIN), Kraken, and Robinhood (HOOD) are incorporating Ethereum into their operations for functions like custody, settlement, and rollup infrastructure. As a result, these large companies are holding and staking ETH to generate yield, significantly increasing the altcoin’s demand. BitMine, for instance, anticipates earning over $400 million annually from its staking position. Such institutional involvement has led market experts like Tom Lee to speculate that the Ethereum price could potentially reach $12,000 by 2026, driven by growing staking demand and the scaling of tokenization efforts. Adding to the momentum, Arkham reported that Tom Lee’s Ethereum treasury firm acquired 138,452 ETH since last week, valued at approximately $431.97 million. BitMine currently holds $12.05 billion in ETH and has an additional $1 billion allocated for further purchases. In a different development that could bolster the Ethereum price further, Chris MacDonald, an analyst for The Motley Fool, highlighted reports indicating that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) confirmed US banks can now legally conduct “riskless principal” transactions in crypto assets. The analyst asserted that this new regulatory approval may lead to an influx of capital into digital assets, which would likely benefit the Ethereum price and holders, as well as other top cryptocurrencies. As of this writing, the Ethereum price is trading at $3,325. Despite recent gains, the price is still nearly 33% below the all-time high of $4,946, which was reached earlier this year.

Title: Historic Reversal: Ethereum ETF Flows Plunge To Worst Month Since Launch
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-etf-flows-plunge/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T06:00:02Z

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Ethereum’s momentum in institutional markets just hit a major roadblock. After months of enthusiasm surrounding spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), new data has shown that ETF flows have sunk to their worst monthly total since their launch. The sharp drop reflects a broader cooldown in investor demand, as market volatility and shifting risk appetite weigh on crypto allocations. In an X post, a crypto analyst known as Milk Road revealed that the Ethereum ETFs had just printed their worst month on record since launch, which is roughly $1.4 billion in net outflows, the largest single-month withdrawal that ETH has ever encountered. Historically, ETF flow reversals tell more about liquidity pressure in the broader financial system than the long-term fundamentals of the asset itself. When redemptions spike this hard, it’s usually a sign that broader risk sentiment is cracking, not that the asset itself broke. Meanwhile, most investors don’t know that while ETFs were handing back, Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) stepped in as aggressive buyers. BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) quietly added over 300,000 ETH, worth nearly $800 million at the time, to its treasuries. If the ETF outflow continues to accelerate, the near-term price action will remain choppy as liquidity gets strained at the edges. However, if DAT inflows continue scaling, it builds the foundation for a tighter supply setup into 2026. The tension between this panicked short-term selling pressure and the quiet structural long-term accumulation is the most important dynamic for positioning. Crypto trader Bull Theory has noted that last week, BitMine bought an astonishing 138,452 ETH, worth $437.7 million. This single transaction solidifies their position as the largest ETH treasury in the world, holding 3.86 million ETH, valued at $12.4 billion and accounting for 3.2% of the entire circulating supply. The true source of rising ETH demand is that Wall Street is quietly building on ETH. BlackRock, with $13.5 trillion AUM, has launched tokenized funds on ETH and has filed for a staked ETH ETF. JPMorgan, with $4 trillion, Deutsche Bank, with $1.1 trillion, and Standard Chartered, with $800 billion, are developing tokenization and DeFi infrastructure using ETH and its Layer-2 networks. Institutions like Amundi, HSBC, BNY Mellon, Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood are all using ETH rails for custody and settlement or rollup infrastructure for scaling and security. Furthermore, large companies are now holding and staking ETH for yield. BitMine alone expects to generate $400 million+ a year in staking revenue from its position. Tom Lee believes that as staking demand grows and institutions scale tokenization increases, ETH could reach $12,000 in 2026. “A Bitcoin miner is now the largest Ethereum whale, Wall Street is building on ETH, and treasuries are shifting toward yield. ETH is quickly becoming part of the Global Financial System.” Bull Theory noted. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My name is Godspower Owie, and I was born and brought up in Edo State, Nigeria. I grew up with my three siblings who have always been my idols and mentors, helping me to grow and understand the way of life. My parents are literally the backbone of my story. They’ve always supported me in good and bad times and never for once left my side whenever I feel lost in this world. Honestly, having such amazing parents makes you feel safe and secure, and I won’t trade them for anything else in this world. I was exposed to the cryptocurrency world 3 years ago and got so interested in knowing so much about it. It all started when a friend of mine invested in a crypto asset, which he yielded massive gains from his investments. When I confronted him about cryptocurrency he explained his journey so far in the field. It was impressive getting to know about his consistency and dedication in the space despite the risks involved, and these are the major reasons why I got so interested in cryptocurrency. Trust me, I’ve had my share of experience with the ups and downs in the market but I never for once lost the passion to grow in the field. This is because I believe growth leads to excellence and that’s my goal in the field. And today, I am an employee of Bitcoinnist and NewsBTC news outlets. My Bosses and co-workers are the best kinds of people I have ever worked with, in and outside the crypto landscape. I intend to give my all working alongside my amazing colleagues for the growth of these companies. Sometimes I like to picture myself as an explorer, this is because I like visiting new places, I like learning new things (useful things to be precise), I like meeting new people - people who make an impact in my life no matter how little it is. One of the things I love and enjoy doing the most is football. It will remain my favorite outdoor activity, probably because I'm so good at it. I am also very good at singing, dancing, acting, fashion and others. I cherish my time, work, family, and loved ones. I mean, those are probably the most important things in anyone's life. I don't chase illusions, I chase dreams. I know there is still a lot about myself that I need to figure out as I strive to become successful in life. I’m certain I will get there because I know I am not a quitter, and I will give my all till the very end to see myself at the top. I aspire to be a boss someday, having people work under me just as I’ve worked under great people. This is one of my biggest dreams professionally, and one I do not take lightly. Everyone knows the road ahead is not as easy as it looks, but with God Almighty, my family, and shared passion friends, there is no stopping me.

Some 2,500 homes and businesses still without power Around 90 flights cancelled or delayed across all Irish airports yesterday, while all ferries were suspended during the storm Status Orange wind alerts lifted from all areas last night as clean-up operation got into gear Storm Bram causes disruption, damage and power cuts across the country Forecasters have issued a fresh wind warning for three counties as the Storm Bram recovery and clean-up continues. Crews are currently working to restore power to the remaining 2,500 homes and businesses left without connection. Almost 60,000 premises were left without power at the height of the storm and thousands of commuters were hit by cancelled flights, ferries and trains as well as road closures. The south Atlantic storm significantly strengthened as it approached the Irish coast early yesterday morning and struck with powerful wind gusts of almost 120kmh. Now, forecasters have issued a Status Yellow wind warning for Galway, Mayo and Kerry. The warning will be in place overnight from midnight tonight until 7am on Thursday morning. Forecasters are warning of “strong and gusty southerly winds mainly affecting coastal parts.” Ireland is now on high alert for flooding amid fears the heavy rainfall associated with Storm Bram – combined with torrential rainfall over the weekend – will cause rivers and streams to break their banks. Irish Rail has said that all routes are back operational today. “A full schedule of services will operate on all routes today,” an Irish Rail spokesperson said in a statement on X. Flight operations at Dublin Airport are also "largely back to normal" this morning after what was described as a "day of significant disruption" yesterday. More than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines yesterday, and 20 flights were diverted to other airports. Today will be busier than usual for the staff, with more passengers at terminals due to their rebooked flights departing today. Meanwhile, a number of flights were also cancelled this morning following the disruption yesterday. A spokesperson for Dublin Airport, Graeme McQueen, told the Irish Independent: "Flight operations at Dublin Airport are largely back to normal this morning following a day of significant disruption yesterday due to Storm Bram." "In total, more than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines on Tuesday, while 20 flights diverted to other airports, before returning later in the day once the challenging winds had eased." Mr McQueen continued: "The Dublin Airport team worked hard through the night to help airlines prepare for this morning's busy first wave of flights, which has departed as normal, with only a very small number of cancelled flights on the departures board." "Today will be busier than it normally would have been in the terminals with many passengers who were discommoded on Tuesday being re-accommodated on flights leaving today. "We thank passengers for their patience and understanding yesterday in what were challenging circumstances due to the adverse weather conditions. "As always, passengers seeking updates on the status of their flight today should contact their airline directly," he added. Fortunately, major flood damage was avoided at high tides yesterday despite the sea surge associated with Bram as flood defences nationwide proved effective. Cork city suffered the worst of the flooding with some city centre quays closed and a number of low-lying roads outside the city proving impassable though no major property damage was reported. Flooding hit Waterford’s Plunkett railway station where operations had to be suspended after the tracks became totally submerged. Coastal flooding was also reported in Tramore and Dungarvan in Waterford as well as Blackrock in Louth and Clontarf in Dublin. Crews work to clear a fallen tree from Killarney Road in Bray during Storm Bram. Photo: Owen Breslin Waterford City and County director of services Gabriel Hynes told RTÉ the storm had brought an “extremely hazardous day”. He said there were coastal surges and overtopping, but storm barriers had been put up in the centre of Waterford city, which had protected the area. However, areas such as Tramore and Dungarvan had experienced flooding and waves overtopping but no significant damage. ESB Networks said crews have been working since first light to restore power to all homes, farms and businesses affected by Storm Bram. As of 5.00pm today, approximately 2,500 customers remain without supply predominately in the Southeast region. "ESB Networks moved crews from other areas of the country today to assist colleagues in the Southeast region to reconnect customers as fast as they safely can,” a statement said. "Crews will continue to work late into the evening to restore supply but due to the damage to the electricity network, a small number of customers in the region will be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes. “Customers without power can check for real-time updates on when their fault is expected to be repaired at www.powercheck.ie. “If you come across fallen wires or damaged electricity network, never, ever touch or approach these as they are LIVE and extremely dangerous. Please report any damage to electricity infrastructure by calling 1800 372 999. Customers should have their MPRN available to access recorded information specific to their location." Status Orange wind alerts were lifted from all areas last night as the clean-up operation got into gear. Wind gusts of almost 120kmh were reported in some coastal waters as a Status Red alert was in place for all marine areas, with the south and west feeling the worst of Bram’s fury. This was later downgraded to a Status Orange marine alert. Sea swells caused extensive damage to the carpark at Doolin Pier in Co Clare. Photo: Press 22 A total of 70 schools remained closed or shut early because of the storm, all in exposed coastal areas of Munster and Connacht. The Department of Education said the decision to close rested entirely with local school boards of management who made such decisions based on local advice and the safety of school transport operations.

Photo: Gerry Mooney Multiple public attractions were closed yesterday because of the safety threat posed by Storm Bram including the Cliffs of Moher in Clare. Many outdoor Christmas lights attractions will undergo safety checks before re-opening today. The Punchestown race meeting planned for yesterday will now be staged tomorrow. Water Safety Ireland and the Coast Guard urged people to avoid exposed coastal areas and to exercise extreme caution near lakes, rivers and streams over the coming days as most waterways will be transformed into raging torrents. Met Éireann warned Ireland will experience unsettled weather over the coming days in the wake of Storm Bram. “This mobile Atlantic regime will continue to bring unsettled and mixed conditions over the coming days with spells of wet and windy weather but also some drier and brighter spells,” a forecaster said.

Forecasters are warning of “strong and gusty southerly winds mainly affecting coastal parts.” Ireland is now on high alert for flooding amid fears the heavy rainfall associated with Storm Bram – combined with torrential rainfall over the weekend – will cause rivers and streams to break their banks. Irish Rail has said that all routes are back operational today. “A full schedule of services will operate on all routes today,” an Irish Rail spokesperson said in a statement on X. Flight operations at Dublin Airport are also "largely back to normal" this morning after what was described as a "day of significant disruption" yesterday. More than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines yesterday, and 20 flights were diverted to other airports. Today will be busier than usual for the staff, with more passengers at terminals due to their rebooked flights departing today. Meanwhile, a number of flights were also cancelled this morning following the disruption yesterday. A spokesperson for Dublin Airport, Graeme McQueen, told the Irish Independent: "Flight operations at Dublin Airport are largely back to normal this morning following a day of significant disruption yesterday due to Storm Bram." "In total, more than 100 flights were cancelled by airlines on Tuesday, while 20 flights diverted to other airports, before returning later in the day once the challenging winds had eased." Mr McQueen continued: "The Dublin Airport team worked hard through the night to help airlines prepare for this morning's busy first wave of flights, which has departed as normal, with only a very small number of cancelled flights on the departures board." "Today will be busier than it normally would have been in the terminals with many passengers who were discommoded on Tuesday being re-accommodated on flights leaving today. "We thank passengers for their patience and understanding yesterday in what were challenging circumstances due to the adverse weather conditions. "As always, passengers seeking updates on the status of their flight today should contact their airline directly," he added. Fortunately, major flood damage was avoided at high tides yesterday despite the sea surge associated with Bram as flood defences nationwide proved effective. Cork city suffered the worst of the flooding with some city centre quays closed and a number of low-lying roads outside the city proving impassable though no major property damage was reported. Flooding hit Waterford’s Plunkett railway station where operations had to be suspended after the tracks became totally submerged. Coastal flooding was also reported in Tramore and Dungarvan in Waterford as well as Blackrock in Louth and Clontarf in Dublin. Crews work to clear a fallen tree from Killarney Road in Bray during Storm Bram.

He said there were coastal surges and overtopping, but storm barriers had been put up in the centre of Waterford city, which had protected the area. However, areas such as Tramore and Dungarvan had experienced flooding and waves overtopping but no significant damage. ESB Networks said crews have been working since first light to restore power to all homes, farms and businesses affected by Storm Bram. As of 5.00pm today, approximately 2,500 customers remain without supply predominately in the Southeast region. "ESB Networks moved crews from other areas of the country today to assist colleagues in the Southeast region to reconnect customers as fast as they safely can,” a statement said. "Crews will continue to work late into the evening to restore supply but due to the damage to the electricity network, a small number of customers in the region will be without power overnight and we apologise for the particular difficulty this causes. “Customers without power can check for real-time updates on when their fault is expected to be repaired at www.powercheck.ie. “If you come across fallen wires or damaged electricity network, never, ever touch or approach these as they are LIVE and extremely dangerous. Please report any damage to electricity infrastructure by calling 1800 372 999. Customers should have their MPRN available to access recorded information specific to their location." Status Orange wind alerts were lifted from all areas last night as the clean-up operation got into gear. Wind gusts of almost 120kmh were reported in some coastal waters as a Status Red alert was in place for all marine areas, with the south and west feeling the worst of Bram’s fury. This was later downgraded to a Status Orange marine alert. Sea swells caused extensive damage to the carpark at Doolin Pier in Co Clare.

Water Safety Ireland and the Coast Guard urged people to avoid exposed coastal areas and to exercise extreme caution near lakes, rivers and streams over the coming days as most waterways will be transformed into raging torrents. Met Éireann warned Ireland will experience unsettled weather over the coming days in the wake of Storm Bram. “This mobile Atlantic regime will continue to bring unsettled and mixed conditions over the coming days with spells of wet and windy weather but also some drier and brighter spells,” a forecaster said.

Title: Hudson Yards Remakes Its Retail Mix

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily It's been seven years since The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards had its grand opening, leases are turning, and Odyssey Retail Advisors was hired to help fine-tune the lineup. Senior Editor, Retail It’s a new day for The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards. Retail square footage has been reduced and converted to additional office space. Several stores and restaurants have opened in recent seasons, moving in where others have left. And some retailers have been updated with expansions and more efficient shopping layouts. In August, Related Cos. and Oxford Properties, which own the $25 billion Hudson Yards mixed-use complex, hired Odyssey Retail Advisors to bring in better, more relevant tenants, and step up leasing efforts. It’s been seven years since the launch of The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards, situated in 20 Hudson Yards, and leases are beginning to turn. Related Articles Jewelry EXCLUSIVE: Roberto Coin Opening New Boutiques in NYC and Las Vegas Home Decor Preston Lane Expands Home Line With Collection Exclusively on Amazon There’s already been significant change in the mall’s retail composition, especially over the past two years, when 27 stores opened, and six relocated. Among the openings seen on the main floor are Moschino, Preston Lane, Marc Jacobs, Laduree Café, La Maison Du Chocolat and Roberto Coin. You May Also Like On level two, Meulien, Aesop and Baked by Melissa opened and Miznon reopened after closing during COVID-19. Rhone expanded to 2,395 square feet, from 900; Studs expanded to 1,059 square feet from 400 square feet. PIQ, the gift and novelty store, and Van Leeuwen ice cream relocated after being situated on other floors. On level three, Aroma 360 and Mango opened; Zara expanded with a new concept and better configuration after being split on levels three and four, and H&M moved to a new space after also being on levels three and four. On level four, Eataly, Naya, Viva La Crepe, Joe & the Juice and the L’Oréal Academy of Beauty all opened, and additional fast-casual culinary options are expected to debut soon. Beyond The Shops & Restaurants, in and around Hudson Yards, Oyamel and Warby Parker opened at 50 Hudson Yards, Plaza M Spa opened at 531 West 30th Street, Locanda Verde and Los Tacos No. 1 opened at 50 Hudson Yards, and Txula opened within Mercado Little Spain at 10 Hudson Yards. In addition, SLT, a format for high-intensity workouts, is opening next month at 525 West 30th Street. The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards had a grand slam opening in March 2019 with crowds pouring in out of a sense of awe and curiosity, and actress and singer Liza Minnelli performing at the party. The site includes over 400,000 square feet of office space and approximately 400,000 square feet of retail. Initially, there was a total of 750,000 square feet of leasable but the office space increased somewhat by recouping some common space and an atrium. There was initial skepticism over the retail center’s viability and from how far away it could draw shoppers, though that seems to have waned with all the changes. Whether Manhattan really needed a mall on the far west side of Manhattan was also been debated, given the city’s already saturated retail landscape. Initial reviews about the Hudson Yards architecture were mixed, with some calling it modern and luxurious, others considering it sterile and isolated. However, the extension of the 7 subway line in September 2015 made the destination more accessible for many, and there have been additional projects completed in Midtown on the West Side, creating a continuum from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station to Hudson Yards. A year after The Shops & Restaurants debuted, COVID-19 hit. Office workers, tourists and shoppers faded from the scene, and over time, a string of retail and restaurant departures occurred, notably the then-bankrupt Neiman Marcus, as well as the Dallas-based Forty Five Ten, which had a spread of four boutiques. Citarella, the gourmet market; the 3Den lounge with its co-working space and café; Beta, an electronics and technology store, and Micro Kickboard, a Scooter company that failed, also left. Compounding the situation, the Vessel, the 15-story honeycomb-shaped sculpture that visitors could climb and is situated directly in front of the mall, closed temporarily after being the scene of four suicides. It reopened in October 2024 with added safety features. Wells Fargo is expanding by 400,000 square feet at Hudson Yards, joining other major office tenants KKR, BlackRock, Meta, SAP, Boston Consulting Group and Tapestry Inc. Real estate sources said the ground floor retail has been performing well, as are the restaurants, while retailing gets more challenging on the upper floors, with some exceptions. Much of the retail turnover involved changing out more moderate retail concepts. “The center is finding its footing, but there was an anticipation of far greater sales,” said one industry source. “Traffic is growing but there is a sense that they need to further improve the merchandising. Initial lease deals were percentage sale rents and the landlord paying for build-outs. A lot of leases are up this year.” Related’s other major development, the Shops at Columbus Circle, is situated in an area with a greater residential population, and is more productive. It opened in February 2004. “Since coming out of COVID, then introducing Wells Fargo into the building and right-sizing the retail, there’s been a repositioning happening at Hudson Yards for the last 18 to 24 months,” said Esty Ottensoser, vice president of retail at Related, in an interview. “The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards is 93 percent occupied and our office space is 100 percent leased at the moment,” Ottensoser said. “Monday through Thursday we see between 18,000 and 22,000 office workers here.” Between the office workers, residents in the area, and visitors from outside, “there’s a lot of density here, and we’re seeing it in our conversions,” Ottensoser said, referring to store visitors who actually make a purchase. The center’s sales productivity currently stands at $1,700 a square foot across the four retail floors, and is up double digits year-to-date, she said. The luxury component generates double the overall productivity, according to Hudson Yards. “A lot of new retailers and a lot of new food and beverage have been added over the past two years. It’s had a great impact on the project’s sales productivity,” said Rick Strauss, partner at Odyssey, who participated in the interview. “Utilizing the square footage that was Neiman Marcus for Wells Fargo, and then right-sizing the retail space for stores down to 261,000 square feet was very smart.” Retail is now confined to levels one, two, three and four though food and beverage takes up most of level four. “The skepticism is beginning to dissipate,” said Ottensoser. Some “very positive” stories on retail performance have emerged, she said. “This really is the place to be. You see it in the office occupancy. It’s ‘class A’ caliber office space, and we see ourselves as a ‘class A’ shopping center. There’s a lot of density here and it’s not just because of our project. It’s also what Brookfield has been doing and what Tishman has been doing,” in further developing the area. “There’s a lot happening here. There are definitely always underperforming retailers. But most of our retailers have stayed with us.” “Opening a year before COVID hit was unlucky, and obviously bad timing,” said Strauss. “Related, to some degree, was a pioneer on the West Side when they opened this project,” introducing office, residential and retail to what was largely seen as an urban wasteland. “Related was the first. The Penn West corridor is very young, but it has filled in. Look what’s happened just to the east of Hudson Yards,” Strauss said. Since The Shops & Restaurants cut the ribbon, Brookfield’s Manhattan West mixed-use complex, which includes the Pendry Hotel, the Moynihan Train Hall, and Tishman Speyer’s Spiral office and retail skyscraper opened. The Javits Center and the High Line both expanded as well. “The corridor I would say has come of age, and it’s now being highly productive because of the density of office and residential and the drawing power of good retail and good food and beverage businesses,” said Strauss. “The West Side has become a much better catchment area.” There have been approximately 2,500 rentals added in and around Hudson Yards since 2019, and Related has proposed adding thousands of additional residences above the Western Rail Yards, seeing a demand to reside in the neighborhood. The Shops & Restaurants sits atop the Eastern Rail Yards servicing the Long Island Rail Road and other train lines. “We did a full analysis once we got involved of the project, to [examine] the strengths of the project, understand who’s performing, who’s not performing, what segments are performing, what segments are not performing, and where there’s opportunity to grow with retailers or replace those that are underperforming and with better, relevant tenants,” Strauss said. “What has become very apparent is the upscale retail is highly outperforming, which is why they saw fit to bring us in to help with expanding that upscale retail.” Dior, Fendi, Cartier and Watches of Switzerland are among the luxury firms reportedly doing well at Hudson Yards. In the moderate price segments, Alo, Uniqlo, Zara, and Aritzia are said to be performing well. Aesop skin care is also performing well. “We do see opportunity to continue to grow fashion for women’s ready-to-wear, men’s ready-to-wear and women’s shoes,” Strauss said. “Men’s shoes in the upscale segment we need to grow and continue to embrace, because that’s been strong so far. But more is needed. We’re going to raise the entire performance of the project by bringing in more relevant brands.” “The fact that we have a Russ & Daughters here that performs extremely well, a Locanda Verde which opened about a year ago which has been a local TriBeCa [hot] spot, and Los Tacos, says we’ve done a good job creating this very local neighborhood feel,” said Ottensoser. “Many didn’t think we could do it.” Russ & Daughters is a family-owned New York City institution, established in 1914, well known for its traditional Jewish cuisine. Locanda Verde is an often bustling Italian tavern. “There are some vacancies but we also have tenants with leases coming up,” said Strauss. “We can either choose to renew them or replace them. That’s giving us plenty of opportunity to bring in new tenants. Over the next two years you’re really going to see momentum with more significant changes.” He said lease terms anywhere from five to 10 years is typical these days. “So that gives you constant ability to turn and stay relevant.” Initially, Related extended generous incentives to encourage Neiman Marcus and other retailers to sign leases before The Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards was launched. “We’re not really doing that anymore, because now it’s a second generation” of leases being signed or renewed. “Now you’re able to make deals that are much more just straight up, deals that are more traditional. But it’s not only that it’s second generation of leases, it’s also because 93 percent of the retail space has stores operating. “As we speak, there’s a handful of tenants that are under construction, so it’s actually higher percentage leased.” Discussing the goals and vision for the Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards, Ottensoser stressed the importance of increasing the center’s appeal to tourists, residents in the area and the office worker population. It’s possible, she said, to further grow the catchment area. “We can have people coming from further north and further south to shop and dine here. And if we can continue to improve the merchandising, you’re going to grow that catchment area. There’s still so much that we can do to get a larger slice of the pie. There’s are a lot of places for tourists to visit in Manhattan, and we’ve seen a lot of them already, but there are plenty of tourists that we haven’t captured. “Locanda Verde and Russ & Daughters, all these New York establishments, have opened with us,” Ottensoser said. Bond Street, another restaurant in the center, has been downtown on Bond Street for 22 years. “They never opened another location in New York City until they came to Hudson Yards, to the fifth floor,” said Ottensoser. “They knew they wanted to be here. They knew we had the density. “We host Frieze New York now at Hudson Yards,” she added. “And I’m sure you have seen the video with Tom Hanks. He’s out there singing about the Shed at Hudson Yards, and he’s performing there right now,” in the play “This World of Tomorrow.” “So you know, there’s a lot happening here.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

Title: Trump to begin interviews with Fed chair finalists this week: FT
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-begin-interviews-fed-chair-finalists
Time Published: 2025-12-10T03:38:55Z
Full Content:
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has presented four names to the White House, with the list reportedly including former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and frontrunner Kevin Hassett. The race for the new US Federal Reserve chair is nearing the finish line, with US President Donald Trump reportedly set to begin interviewing finalists for the top job this week. According to a report from the Financial Times on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has presented a list of four names to the White House. One of these is former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, whom Bessent is scheduled to meet with on Wednesday. Another is National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, who is seen as the frontrunner for the role. Another two names would be picked from a list of other finalists, which includes Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, and BlackRock chief investment officer Rick Rieder. Trump and Bessent are expected to hold at least one interview next week, as a decision looks likely to be announced in January. However, Trump has revealed he already has his eye on one particular candidate. “We’re going to be looking at a couple different people, but I have a pretty good idea of who I want,” Trump said to journalists on Air Force One on Tuesday. The upcoming round of interviews suggests that Hassett may not be the clear lock in for the role as previously thought, though he is seen as the favorite. Earlier this month, prediction market odds on Kalshi and Polymarket shot up for Hassett significantly following comments from Trump at the White House on Dec. 2. While welcoming guests, Trump labeled Hassett as “potential Fed chair” leading many to assume the president had let a major hint slip. Related: Trump’s national security strategy is silent on crypto, blockchain With Hassett’s odds spiking to 85% after Trump’s comments last week, they have since declined to around 73% for Hassett, while Warsh’s odds sit at 13% on Kalshi at the time of writing, which has floated around this range over December. Regardless of who ends up taking over as chair, the move is bound to impact crypto markets under the new leadership. If elected, Hassett has asserted that he will be apolitical in terms of running the Fed, despite his close ties to Trump. Speaking with The Wall Street Journal this week, Hassett said that “You just do the right thing” when asked if he would blindly follow orders from Trump. “Suppose that inflation has gotten from, say, 2.5% to 4%. You can’t cut,” Hassett said, adding that he would rely on his own “judgment, which I think the president trusts.” Magazine: The one thing these 6 global crypto hubs all have in common… Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, and fintech industries.

Title: What BlackRock’s Latest Filing Means For The Ethereum Price
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-filing-and-ethereum-price/
Time Published: 2025-12-10T01:00:33Z
Full Content:
The latest S-1 registration submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission has placed Ethereum back at the center of market speculation. A recent SEC document shows that BlackRock’s iShares division has formally filed to launch a staked ETH exchange-traded fund, a move that would give traditional investors access not only to ETH price exposure but also to staking rewards through a regulated product. The proposed trust, which is called the iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHB), differs from previous Ethereum filings because it incorporates staking into its core design. According to the S-1 filing, the ETF would hold ether directly while delegating most of its balance to external validators, allowing staking rewards to feed into the trust’s net asset value. This approach offers institutions a pathway to access ETH’s yield component without interacting with on-chain staking infrastructure themselves. Related Reading: Industry Leader Shares Why Ethereum Price Will Reach $12,000 The structure is bullish for Ethereum, as it shows that major asset managers like BlackRock are looking beyond basic price exposure and toward products that reflect how Ethereum now operates after its transition to proof-of-stake. The first indication of BlackRock’s interest in ETH staking was in July, when it filed an application to add ETH staking in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). It seems the fund issuer is now taking proactive action on the staking trust with the recent standalone filing. Under SEC procedure, the new filing begins the review period, although a formal approval timeline does not start until the exchange responsible for listing the ETF submits a Form 19b-4. If approved, the ETF could influence Ethereum’s circulating supply over time. The plan is to stake between 70% and 90% of the trust’s ETH, and this means that large inflows would steadily route more ether into long-term staking, reducing the volume actively available on the open market. The potentially smaller liquid supply is going to contribute to a bullish ETH price, particularly during periods when demand for ETH rises. The filing itself does not change ETH’s price in the short term, nor does it signal any immediate regulatory approval. Related Reading: Ethereum Buyers Have Re-Entered The Arena Below $3,400, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought What the filing does provide is a clearer picture of how ETH might fit into the next generation of institutional investment products. A staked ETH ETF would formalize staking as an investable feature and increase the types of investors who consider the altcoin a viable long-term asset. Any eventual impact on Ethereum’s price will depend on how the approval process unfolds and how much capital flows into the product once it launches. BlackRock’s existing footprint in the Ethereum ETF niche shows how influential those inflows can be. Its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has consistently led other spot issuers, including over the past 24 hours, when ETHA recorded $23.66 million in inflows compared to Grayscale’s $11.83 million, while other issuers saw no inflows at all. Once approved, shares of the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust are expected to trade on Nasdaq under the ticker ETHB. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Intel Takes Major Step in Plan to Acquire Chip Startup SambaNova
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/intel-signs-term-sheet-sambanova-ai/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T23:08:59Z
Full Content:
Intel has signed a term sheet to acquire the AI chip startup SambaNova Systems, two sources with direct knowledge of the agreement tell WIRED. The details of the term sheet are unknown. The agreement is nonbinding, meaning the deal is not yet finalized and could be dissolved without penalty. It could take weeks or even months before regulatory approval, liability scrutiny, and financial due diligence are complete. Intel’s interest in acquiring the startup was first reported by Bloomberg in late October. At the time, the talks were in the early stages. The report noted that SambaNova could sell for less than the $5 billion valuation the company said it had reached in April 2021. Notably, Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is currently the executive chairman of SambaNova Systems. Intel Capital, which Intel is in the process of spinning off into a stand-alone fund, has also invested in SambaNova Systems. Another investor in SambaNova, Japan’s SoftBank Group, made a major investment in Intel earlier this year. A spokesperson for SambaNova declined to comment. Intel had not responded to requests for comment at the time of publication. SambaNova Systems was founded in 2017 in Palo Alto, California, by Kunle Olukotun, Rodrigo Liang, and Christopher Ré. Olukotun and Ré are Stanford professors; Liang previously worked as an executive at Oracle. SambaNova Systems makes an AI chip platform for inference computing, a process where large language models make predictions from vast amounts of data. As of early 2025, the startup had raised $1.14 billion in funding, according to PitchBook data. In 2020 it raised $250 million from asset manager BlackRock, Intel Capital, the venture firm GV, and other investors, bringing the startup’s valuation to $2.5 billion. The following year, SambaNova was valued at $5 billion after a massive funding round of $676 million, led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2. The startup’s implied valuation has dropped since then, with BlackRock reportedly cutting the value of its SambaNova shares by 17 percent over the past year, according to The Information. That likely made it a target for Intel, along with the fact that Intel has lagged the rest of the chip industry in making AI chips. After taking on the top job earlier this year, Intel CEO Tan said he intends to shore up Intel’s debt, spin off the company’s noncore assets, and shift to AI-first strategies. The troubled chipmaker also received an $8.9 billion infusion of capital from the US government in August, which it plans to use to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

First announced in September, the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible network has been built to this point with early design input from global firms like OpenAI, Shopify, and Visa. On Tuesday, the Tempo team announced additional early partners, including Mastercard, UBS, and buy-now-pay-later firm Klarna—which recently announced plans for a stablecoin on Tempo. “Tempo testnet is now open to anyone,” Tempo project lead and Paradigm founder Matt Huang posted on X. “It's been a pleasure working with great design partners to shape the chain: from teams moving billions across borders, to banks testing tokenized deposits, to AI companies exploring agentic flows. With its testnet live, several key payments-specific features are now available—like dedicated payment lanes that guarantee blockspace and keep fees low, and stablecoin-native gas, which allows transactions to be paid for with USD-denominated tokens instead of a volatile, native blockchain token. "Working with Tempo allows Coastal to test and co-create the next generation of financial infrastructure,” Brian Hamilton, president of Washington-based design partner Coastal Bank, said in a statement posted to X. “It’s not just about improving speed or efficiency—it’s about unlocking new capabilities for the broader ecosystem of fintech and embedded finance partners,” he added. “Together, we’re rethinking what modern banking can deliver.” The network boasts microtransactions, global payments and remittances, agentic commerce, and tokenized deposits as out-of-the-box use cases. Additional features, like creating your own stablecoin from the browser, are also available. Tempo lets you create a new stablecoin straight from your browser.

The network’s full rollout timeline has not yet been determined. In October, the network reportedly raised $500 million at a $5 billion valuation to propel its payments-focused blockchain. Around that time, it also added Dankrad Fiest, a top researcher from the Ethereum Foundation, to help build out the chain. Like Stripe with Tempo, USDC issuer Circle is working on its own stablecoin- and payments-focused blockchain, Arc. Its testnet went live in October with early participation from firms like Visa, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs.

Title: Alleged unauthorised modular homes near Brittas, Dublin, are ‘phase one’ of 71 units, court told
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/crime-law/courts/2025/12/09/alleged-unauthorised-modular-homes-near-brittas-dublin-are-phase-one-of-71-units-court-told/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T20:11:09Z
Full Content:
An alleged unauthorised development of 28 modular homes near Brittas, Co Dublin, appeared to be “phase one” of an intended development of 71 residential units, a judge has been told. At Dublin Circuit Civil Court on Tuesday, Judge John O’Connor said he will rule in February whether the development at Chianti Park and an adjoining site is exempt from the need for planning permission, or whether it is unauthorised and must be removed. The judge was told the developer and site owners will “respect” the court in the interim. If works continued before his judgment, he would consider that “disrespect”, he said. In separate but similar applications South Dublin County Council and a local resident, John O’Neill, who lives 200m from the development, said it is unauthorised, the units should be removed and the site restored. The applications are opposed by Branach Developments Ltd, the developer, with a registered address at Thomastown, Carragh, Kildare; and the site owners, Mullnassa Limited and Threshford Limited, both with registered addresses at Rock Road, Blackrock, Dublin. Photographs before the court last week indicated about 28 homes have been constructed on the site, formerly used for mobile homes and chalets, with foundations laid for at least 12 more. In submissions on Tuesday Michael O’Donnell, for the respondents, said his core argument was this is exempt development under section 4.1.h of the Planning and Development Act. Works for maintenance, improvement or alternation of a structure that do not materially affect that structure are exempt, he said. Works are any act of construction and the disputed works involve construction, demolition, alteration, improvement, repair or maintenance. This development, he argued, falls within the exemption as it is consistent with the character and nature of the structures that were already on the site. The established use of the previous structures was residential use and the disputed works have not altered that use, he submitted. If the works are not consistent with the character of the existing development, that was “a genuine mistake”, and it would be disproportionate to order their removal, he said. There is a housing crisis, people are sleeping rough on streets, his clients were “doing nothing more than refurbishing existing units to provide a home” and “should not be pilloried”. Stephen Dodd, for the council, said this was “blatant unauthorised development”, which should be removed and the landscape restored. These “structures” are permanent modular style housing with permanent foundations, he said. It would make “a complete mockery of the planning system” if the argument that these new structures were exempt development was correct. The development has transformed the site, which was zoned to protect the outstanding natural character of the area, he said. There was “no genuine mistake”, the council had raised its concerns last August and the development was accelerated after it took proceedings, counsel said. The legal arguments by the respondents were “unstateable”. Any hardship to the respondents was “entirely of their own making”, and any “prudent” developer would have stopped once they started to get warning letters, counsel said. This was “completely uncontrolled and unregulated development in a completely inappropriate location” where the evidence was that one-off housing has been repeatedly refused by An Bord Pleanála for reasons including the location and substandard roads, he said. Barrister Conor Sheehan, instructed by Christine O’Connor, BKC Solicitors for Mr O’Neill, adopted Mr Dodd’s submissions, adding his client has raised issues about the impact of the works on drainage, sewage and roads locally. An affidavit for the respondents referred to the “first phase” of the development being repair and improvement of 29 residential dwellings to the standards necessary for rental in the private market, counsel said. This appeared to be “phase one” of an intended development of 71 units, he said.

Title: BlackRock expands Ethereum strategy with new staking ETF – Details

BlackRock’s iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF signals institutional shift, balancing yield potential with regulatory uncertainty. The race for institutional crypto market dominance is heating up, shifting focus from mere price actions to yield generation. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has signaled this transition with the filing of its iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF. Expanding on its massive, over $11 billion existing Ethereum fund, this proposed product marks BlackRock’s first U.S. offering designed to provide institutional clients with direct exposure to Ether’s staking rewards. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared this news on X (formerly Twitter), stating, Source: Eric Balchunas/X The iShares Staked Ethereum Trust ETF represents more than just a new product. It signals a major shift in how institutions approach digital assets. Rather than framing crypto purely as speculation, BlackRock is guiding investors toward protocol‑level economics and blockchain‑driven yield. The filing describes a hybrid fund designed to capture both ETH’s price performance and the staking rewards generated from a portion of its holdings. These rewards would, in turn, increase the trust’s net asset value. However, the filing also highlights a key tension. BlackRock aims to offer staking yield, but regulatory and operational uncertainties could still influence how those rewards are ultimately distributed. This move forces the SEC to finally clarify how staking rewards should be classified, an issue that has remained unclear for years. Remarking on the same, an X user commented, “This tells you everything about where demand is heading. They don’t file for products like this unless they’re confident massive capital is waiting to flow in.” BlackRock’s latest filing marks a major shift in Ethereum [ETH] ETF policy, one that seemed impossible under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler. When BlackRock first launched the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) in July 2024, the SEC forced issuers to remove staking from their products, arguing that services offered by platforms like Kraken and Coinbase resembled unregistered securities offerings. Under the new Chair, Paul Atkins, however, the agency’s stance appears to be softening. BlackRock and VanEck have now resubmitted or amended ETF filings to add staking, with BlackRock choosing to create an entirely new fund rather than modify ETHA. The original trust, which holds about $11 billion in ETH, will remain separate from the staking‑enabled version. This structure allows investors to gain regulated exposure to Ethereum’s yield‑generating mechanism without directly staking their assets. This policy shift builds on October’s milestone approval for Grayscale, which became the first issuer to offer staking rewards through U.S.‑listed spot‑market ETFs (ETHE and ETH Mini). It also aligns with broader industry momentum, as seen in REX‑Osprey’s staking‑enabled Solana [SOL] and ETH funds, signaling a growing institutional embrace of blockchain‑driven yield strategies. At the same time, on-chain activity suggests large institutions are rapidly accumulating Ethereum. Lookonchain reported substantial withdrawals from Binance involving 6,000 ETH by Amber Group and 3,000 ETH by Metalpha within hours of each other. Meanwhile, Bitmine made an even more aggressive move, adding 138,452 ETH to its holdings, bringing its total to 3.86 million ETH worth $12.4 billion. This surge in institutional buying coincides with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin signaling that an ETH rally may be approaching, even as ETH traded at $3,114 at press time, after a 1.67% daily drop. Source: X Together, rising institutional accumulation and the SEC’s warming stance on staking ETFs suggest that Ethereum’s market structure could accelerate the next phase of ETH adoption.

Title: Ether Surges 8%, Outpacing Bitcoin Gains Amid Staking ETF, Tokenization Optimism

Ethereum's ether ETH$3,204.35 surged on Tuesday to its strongest price since mid-November, leading crypto markets higher as bitcoin BTC$90,326.39 climbed above $94,000. The second-largest cryptocurrency climbed to just shy of $3,400, rallying 8.4% over the past 24 hours. Those gains significantly outpaced bitcoin’s 4.5% advance and the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index’s 6% climb. The rally also drove the ETH/BTC ratio — a closely-watched gauge of ether’s relative performance to bitcoin — to its strongest level since late October, signaling rotation into ETH from the leading crypto. Ether's rally and relative strengths against BTC is being driven by "improving regulatory expectations and renewed optimism around ETF-related inflows" with staking being added to funds on the horizon, Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX, said in a Tuesday note. Asset management giant BlackRock, issuer of the most popular spot ETH ETF, filed Monday to introduce the iShares Ethereum Staking Trust, which would provide yield from staking to investors. "The development revives optimism around ETH-focused inflows and the prospect of yield-bearing crypto products reaching a broader investor base," Kruger wrote. "While regulatory timelines remain uncertain, the headline has added more support to ETH’s relative stability versus bitcoin." ETH could also benefit from regulatory efforts to pave way for real-world asset tokenization, a fast-growing sector focusing on bringing financial instruments like bonds, funds and real estate onto smart contract platforms like Ethereum. Paul Atkins, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has touted tokenization a key innovation for capital markets, saying in an interview with Fox Business last week that it has the potential to change the financial system, reducing settlement risks and trade gaps.

More Info New York-based investment bank Xtellus Partners has proposed that proceeds from the sale of Lukoil's foreign assets be used to compensate American investors who lost money after their Lukoil stock holdings were frozen following Russia’s war in Ukraine. Leading U.S. asset managers such as Goldman Sachs, Blackrock and JP Morgan lost billions of dollars through writing off their Lukoil stocks holdings following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Xtellus has proposed a cashless sale back to Lukoil securities held by U.S. investors in exchange for the company's global assets. Lukoil's international assets are estimated at $22 billion, including upstream oil and gas projects, refining facilities and more than 2,000 filling stations ?across the globe. Buyers of the assets would have to come to an agreement with Lukoil before the U.S. Treasury can clear the transaction. Last month, U.S. Treasury issued the greenlight for companies to begin talks with Lukoil for its foreign assets, with U.S. oil and gas giants Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) have already expressed interest. Exxon is in talks with Iraq’s Oil Ministry to buy Lukoil’s 75% stake in the West Qurna 2 oilfield, one of the country’s largest. Iraq's oil ministry has invited several U.S. oil companies to enter negotiations over the West Qurna 2 takeover through a competitive bidding process. West Qurna-2 oilfield produces more than 400,000 bpd of crude. The Iraqi government has taken over operations at West Qurna 2, including paying staff salaries directly. Meanwhile, the Serbian government is preparing an amendment to the country’s budget law that will allow it to nationalize the Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS) refinery, majority owned by Russia's Gazprom Neft and Gazprom, if no third party offers quickly emerge. NIS has submitted a request to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to continue operations until negotiations for an ownership change conclude. Located in the city of Pancevo, near Belgrade, NIS is the only oil refinery in Serbia. The refinery has the capacity to process 4.8 million tons of crude per year. In the first half of 2025, the refinery processed approximately 1.677 million tons, a 20% increase compared to the same period in 2024, when a major maintenance turnaround was carried out.

Title: PNC Bank launches Bitcoin trading for eligible clients via Coinbase integration

The move makes PNC the first major US bank to offer spot Bitcoin trading within its own digital platform, starting with private bank clients. PNC Bank has begun offering direct spot Bitcoin trading to eligible private bank clients, becoming the first major US bank to enable buy, hold and sell functions inside its own digital platform. According to a Tuesday release, the launch marks the first phase of PNC’s partnership with Coinbase. Announced in July, the collaboration is supported by Coinbase’s Crypto-as-a-Service trading and custody stack. PNC Private Bank serves high- and ultra-high-net-worth individuals, families, family offices and business owners. The bank plans to expand access to additional client groups and add more capabilities over time. According to Federal Reserve data, PNC ranks as the eighth-largest commercial bank in the US, with about $564 billion in assets and more than 2,300 branches across the country. While several major US banks have expanded their crypto offerings this year, most are targeting custody services or investment products, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Dec. 2, Bank of America said that beginning next year, it will allow its wealth management clients to access four Bitcoin ETFs issued by Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale and BlackRock. The ETFs provide investors with exposure to the Bitcoin (BTC) price through a regulated fund that trades on stock exchanges, without the need to buy and hold the digital asset directly. Related: 21Shares taps Standard Chartered for custody as TradFi tightens grip on crypto As crypto adoption becomes more mainstream, asset managers and crypto exchanges are expanding services to wealthy clients. In June, JPMorgan announced that it would allow its trading and wealth-management clients to use crypto ETFs as collateral for loans. The bank also said it would begin factoring clients’ crypto holdings into assessments of their overall net worth. Binance recently introduced a concierge-style service for family offices, asset managers and private funds entering the crypto market. Crypto allocations are also rising in Hong Kong, mainland China and Singapore, with some planning to put about 5% of their portfolios into digital assets. Wealth managers in the region reported that client inquiries are increasing and new cryptocurrency funds are generating strong interest. The growing demand for cryptocurrency among wealthy investors is reshaping the financial-adviser market. A Zerohash survey of 500 US investors aged 18 to 40 conducted in November found that 35% moved money away from advisers who didn’t offer crypto access.

Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), part of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, will be investing up to ₹3,000 crore in Aditya Birla Renewables Ltd (ABR), a subsidiary of Grasim Industries Ltd, for a minority stake, the company said Tuesday evening. The GIP investment translates into an enterprise value of about ₹14,600 crore for ABR, as per a press statement issued late on Tuesday. The deal outlines a firm commitment of ₹2,000 crore by GIP in multiple tranches through the issue of compulsory convertible preference shares and equity shares. Further, it will have a greenshoe option to invest an additional ₹1,000 crore in the form of equity shares. Separately, Essel Mining & Industries Ltd, another Aditya Birla Group company, will invest ₹500 crore in the current financial year to fund its urgent capital requirements, as per a separate intimation to the bourses. ABR is the captive renewable energy platform of the Aditya Birla Group with a portfolio of about 4.3 GW spread across 10 states. It includes solar, hybrid, and floating solar, round-the-clock renewable power. It has signed captive power purchase agreements with fellow group companies like Grasim, Hindalco, UltraTech, and Century Enka. The company aims to scale its capacity upwards of 10 GW in the coming years. GIP is a leading infrastructure investor specializing in owning and operating large assets across energy, transport, digital infrastructure, water, and waste management sectors. It was acquired by BlackRock in 2024. “GIP’s experience in infrastructure across the globe, combined with Aditya Birla’s technical, operational and industrial capabilities, aims to develop Aditya Birla Renewables into a leading renewable platform that can contribute to the Indian industry’s decarbonization objective,” said Raj Rao, GIP president and chief operating officer. “Our investment reflects GIP’s confidence in India’s renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India." Grasim is a flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group engaged in the business of manmade fibres. It also holds several of the group’s businesses, including India’s largest cement company, UltraTech and the group’s new decorative paints venture, Opus. Shares of Grasim ended 0.12% higher at ₹2,745.70 on BSE on Tuesday compared to a 0.51% fall in the benchmark Sensex. The scrip has gained over 12% this year.

Title: CZ shuts down fake ASTER ETF rumor – But does his support boost the real rally?
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=552475
Time Published: 2025-12-09T18:00:14Z
Full Content:
The fake filing dominated feeds, but ASTER’s fundamentals kept shaping its short-term structure. Fake news moved quickly across the crypto market, and this round spread with force. Multiple creators shared the forged ETF form before Binance’s Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped in, calling it photoshopped and reminding the market how easily misinformation travels. His response pulled even more attention toward ASTER just as its activity and volume surged behind the scenes. The image claimed BlackRock had filed for a new “Staked ASTER Trust ETF.” That never happened. CZ corrected it publicly, adding that ASTER didn’t need fabricated hype to grow. Source: X CZ previously stated he bought and held ASTER personally, which added support during the spike in noise. By contrast, the rumor cycle caused confusion while the token’s actual fundamentals continued to build. Behind the headlines, ASTER posted numbers that didn’t require any exaggeration. Daily Volume touched $6 billion, holders climbed past 200k, and last week’s burn removed 77.86M tokens permanently. Stage 4 buybacks accelerated to ~$4 million per day, compressing the time it takes for accumulated fees to hit the chain. Once the system reaches steady state, within 8–10 days, buybacks continue at 60–90% of the previous day’s revenue. The executing wallet remains fully transparent on-chain. Can ASTER’s aggressive buyback model, similar to BNB’s early playbook, drive a larger rally once key resistance breaks? The lower timeframes reacted quickly. ASTER broke above its descending trendline and briefly pushed RSI above 50 before sellers forced it lower again. Source: TradingView On the 4-hour chart, the token continued to consolidate between $0.821 and $1.29, with one fakeout on each side of the range. Source: TradingView Losing $0.821 may open a deeper slide. Clearing $0.96 and breaking through the $1.269 resistance zone could set up a stronger move. RSI stayed oversold without severe extension, and MACD continued to fight for a shift. The day highlighted a clear divide: fake hype created noise, but real metrics carried the narrative. With buybacks increasing, volume rising, and structural resistance tightening, the market now watches whether ASTER builds enough strength to flip the trend decisively. Now, can ASTER’s real fundamentals overpower the rumor cycle? With burns, revenue, and buybacks rising, the market now asks whether this ecosystem push is strong enough to shift its multi-week structure.

Title: ‘Extraordinary talent’: Fashion designer Paul Costelloe mourned at funeral
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/fashion/2025/12/09/extraordinary-talent-fashion-designer-paul-costelloe-mourned-at-funeral/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T17:57:13Z
Full Content:
Fashion designer Paul Costelloe’s funeral Mass in Monkstown’s St Patrick’s Church was marked with the understated elegance he brought to his craft over the course of his long career. The only flowers were an abundance of white roses among greenery that covered his coffin like a bower: family flowers in a ceremony that focused almost entirely upon his family life. There were none of the now-customary gifts symbolising a life brought to the altar. The whole ceremony was simple and elemental: the sound of the wind from Storm Bram heard in between the robust singing from the Blackrock College Choir; the school Costelloe attended as a boy. His six sons, William, Robert, Gavin, Justin, Paul-Emmet and Nicholas, carried his coffin into the church. His wife Anne, and daughter Jessica were the other chief mourners. The main celebrant was Canon Michael O’Dea, parish priest of St Simon’s Church in Putney, London, where the family have a home. Costelloe, one of the highest profile names in Irish and UK fashion, died at the age of 80 in London in November after a short illness. In his homily, Canon O’Dea spoke of how, despite the glamorous world Costelloe worked in, designing for famous people and travelling the globe, it was his family who anchored him all his life. “Paul was very much the reference point of the family,” he said. “Home was a very important place for him to relax and enjoy one another’s company, whether it was in Putney, or in Monkstown, or wherever it was. “Paul was always proud of his children and grandchildren. They were the anchor of his life. He told me that ‘my family keep me grounded, especially Anne’.” [ Paul Costelloe obituary: Internationally respected fashion designer who dressed Princess DianaOpens in new window ] Canon O’Dea spoke of a man who enjoyed cycling around southwest London, and the simple things in life. He also recalled the annual Christmas card he was personally given by Costelloe. “I’d wait for Christmas each year, because Paul would give me one of his hand-painted cards. It was something I treasured. There was another card at Easter. This was his own way of expressing his faith, through art.” The front of the memorial card carried a watercolour drawing, by Costelloe, of a small boat close to a rocky shore. It was accompanied by his distinctive coiling signature, recognisable by anyone who has ever bought one of his homeware items in Dunnes Stores; the company with which he had a long and high-profile collaboration. Costelloe’s son Justin, in his eulogy, said his father always made everyone feel welcome, and spoke of “his extraordinary talent that we were all extremely proud of”. He recalled an engaged father, who took his sons to rugby matches, and his daughter to ballet classes. As for who was the boss of the household: “Anne was the only one who could put him back in his box. They loved each other deeply.” After the Communion service, Jessica Costelloe made her way up the choir, high above the congregation. From there she sang a compelling version of Down By The Salley Gardens, lamentation style, in a voice that slowly swelled to fill the cavernous church, while the congregation below listened in astonished silence. The President of Ireland, Catherine Connolly and Taoiseach Micheál Martin, were represented by their aides-de-camp. Burial took place privately afterwards.

Title: Tether makes its boldest expansion yet – AI, robots, and a Billion-dollar mint
URL: https://ambcrypto.com/?p=552354
Time Published: 2025-12-09T17:00:30Z
Full Content:
The company’s expansion machine is in overdrive, and billions are backing it. Tether is making moves on multiple fronts. From backing a major investment round in an Italian AI robotics startup to securing recognition in Abu Dhabi, the company is going well beyond its stablecoin roots. This isn’t a new move. AMBCrypto previously reported that in November, Tether negotiated a €1 billion investment in Germany’s Neura Robotics while deploying $1.5 billion in commodity-backed lending. The company has taken a step into the AI sector, joining an €70 million ($81 million) funding round for Generative Bionics. They’re an Italian startup building next-generation humanoid robots for industrial environments. Source: Tether The round was led by CDP Venture Capital’s AI fund. Tether, as one of its key private backers, supports the development of robots built for heavy-duty performance and natural human interaction. The company says its investment will help the startup scale production, validate its humanoid platform, and integrate into Europe’s fast-growing robotics ecosystem. It fits neatly into Tether’s broader strategy. Their announcement elaborated on the investment, noting, “This includes investments in brain-computer interfaces via Blackrock Neurotech and recent AI initiatives such as Tether’s collaboration with Northern Data and Rumble to deploy a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-preserving AI development.” Tether also saw a major win in Abu Dhabi’s ADGM, where USDT is now formally recognized as an Accepted Fiat-Referenced Token across several additional blockchains, including Aptos, Cosmos, Near, Polkadot, and TON. Source: X The decision gives licensed firms in the free zone broader flexibility to use USDT within regulated activities. This expands on earlier approvals limited to Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche. In the official statement, CEO Paolo Ardoino said, “The UAE continues to set the global standard for digital asset regulation, and Tether is proud to contribute to this leadership.” Tether also carried out a major mint on the TRON network — a fresh $1 billion USDT. Arkham Intelligence reported the tokens moving from the protocol’s “black hole” address to Tether’s multisig wallet, a standard process the company uses to replenish liquidity for exchanges and institutional customers. Source: Arkham Intelligence Tether has not tied this issuance to any specific deployment. But, large mints typically mean preparations for market demand, new integrations, or upcoming distribution. With billion dollar bets and a foot in multiple grounds, Tether’s influence now far exceeds stablecoins and crypto. It’s not too left field to assume that bigger and better things are yet to come.

Under the deal, there is a commitment of ₹2,000 crore (around $$225 million) and a greenshoe option to invest another ₹1,000 crore (around $110 million). This deal marks one of the largest primary commitments for a minority stake in a renewables platform in India, said ABREN, a Grasim subsidiary. The GIP investment translates into an enterprise value of around ₹14,600 crore for ABREN, it added. ABREN has achieved robust organic growth, building a diversified pan-India renewable energy portfolio of around 4.3 gogawatt (GW) across 10 states. This portfolio delivers solar, hybrid, floating solar, round-the-clock renewable power, reinforcing ABREN’s formidable position in sustainable energy. Kumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of Aditya Birla Group, said, “India stands at the cusp of an energy transformation, arguably one of the largest anywhere in the world. The scale of the renewables opportunity in India is extraordinary, driven both by the urgent imperative of decarbonisation, and the sheer arithmetic of demand. This business sits squarely at the intersection of national energy security and climate leadership, two defining priorities for the coming decades. GIP’s investment marks a pivotal moment in our growth journey, laying a strong foundation for an accelerated buildout of our renewables platform, as we target a capacity of 10 GW+ in the coming years. Their global leadership in owning and operating some of the most sophisticated energy assets worldwide brings both rigour and reach to our ambition.” The transaction is subject to receipt of necessary statutory and regulatory approvals and completion of other conditions precedent. Standard Chartered Bank acted as the sole financial advisor to ABREN on this transaction. Raj Rao, GIP President and Chief Operating Officer, said, “We are excited to partner with Aditya Birla Group, one of India’s leading conglomerates, as today’s announcement will allow us to continue to support innovation at scale. GIP’s experience in infrastructure across the globe, combined with Aditya Birla’s technical, operational and industrial capabilities, aims to develop Aditya Birla Renewables into a leading renewable platform that can contribute to the Indian industry’s decarbonization objective. Our investment reflects GIP’s confidence in India’s renewables sector and our commitment to advancing the energy transition in India.” Published on December 9, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Aviva Seeks Partner for New City of London Skyscraper Project

Aviva Plc has kicked off the search for a partner to help fund a planned new skyscraper in the heart of the City of London’s insurance district, as it aims to tempt investors willing to make a bold bet that office rents are set to soar. The insurer’s investment management arm has appointed broker Knight Frank to sell a stake in the 130 Fenchurch Street project, people with knowledge of the process said. A deal could pave the way for a start on the development, which secured planning planning approval in September, or a new partner could wait to secure a tenant for some or all of the 31 story building before commencing construction, the people said, asking not to be identified as the process is private. A representative for Aviva Investors did not respond to requests for comment. The chance to buy a stake in one of the largest planned office developments in central London comes as the city’s biggest tenants, developers and investors face a high stakes stand off. Higher construction costs threaten to make many projects unprofitable unless they achieve much higher rents than are currently being paid, prompting developers to hold off on new starts. The combination of higher asking rents and far higher costs for fitting out new offices are in turn giving large companies pause before committing to long term deals. While higher costs can be spread over time by signing longer term leases, companies are also grappling with significant uncertainties about how much space they need. That’s because some staff are still working flexibly while the rise of artificial intelligence has further complicated the process of forecasting future headcount. The upshot is a severe shortage of new office development, a factor Aviva is counting on to lure investors willing to make a bold bet on higher rents, the people added. There are already signs that rental inflation is starting to accelerate. Law firm Proskauer Rose LLP set a record rent for City of London office space at 8 Bishopsgate in the third quarter, agreeing to pay £140 ($186.82) a square foot for additional space on th 46th floor, according to a report published by broker Savills Plc. BlackRock Inc. has already begun scouting options for a new London headquarters despite having about 10-years left on its lease because of the dearth of available options, two other people said. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink complained in an interview with the Times newspaper in London earlier this year that he was unable to find space to accommodate recent acquisitions. A spokesperson for BlackRock declined to comment. Aviva’s planned 130 Fenchurch Street development, a block south of the key Lloyd’s of London insurance market, will include over 600,000 square feet (57,500 square meters) of office space, a public garden terrace on floor 20. The project, which is set to be overseen by developer Co-re, will also include ground floor stores, bars and restaurants. Demolition of the existing building, known as Fountain House, is set to complete next year and work on the new tower could be concluded as early as 2030, according to a City of London press release.

By Andreas Wiseman Executive Editor, International & Strategy EXCLUSIVE: Industry vet Alison Cornwell, who most recently served a decade as CFO of leading international cinema chain Vue, has joined emerging UK media company Easttree Media in the same role. Launched last month, Easttree is an investment platform acquiring income rights in films and TV shows. The company uses a proprietary data-driven model to assess passive profit participations, “enabling actors, writers, directors, producers, financiers and studios to monetise all or part of their income rights”. Easttree says it has closed “multiple transactions involving some of the world’s most prolific shows and artists”, but further details weren’t shared when Deadline asked.

Watch on Deadline Management firm Hipgnosis is known for buying the rights to song catalogs of well known musicians, including Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Justin Bieber, Shakira and more. The company was sold to Blackstone in 2024 for $1.6BN. Cornwell joins Easttree from Vue International where she served as the company’s Chief Financial Officer for more than 10 years. Prior to Vue, roles included CFO/SVP of Disney’s international TV business, Group CFO of the Sparrowhawk Media Group, which became part of NBC Universal, and Canadian-UK outfit Alliance Films. The trained accountant has also served as a BFI Governor. Chris Helm sayid: “Alison is a fantastic addition to the Easttree team, and we feel privileged to welcome her. Her breadth of industry knowledge and exemplary finance experience strengthen both our capabilities and our ambition for 2026 and the years ahead. Alison brings financial acumen, discipline and a strategic lens that will support Easttree as we scale our participation portfolio and deepen our partnerships with talent and rights-holders.” “I’m honoured to join Easttree Media at such a pivotal moment for the company,” added Alison Cornwell, Chief Financial Officer of Easttree Media. “The opportunity to help build an investment platform that blends institutional rigour with the agility of a founder-led business is rare. This segment of the industry remains under-served, and Easttree’s rapid progress, with multiple deals already completed alongside leading creatives across film and television, speaks for itself. It shows the strength of the model and what this team is capable of as we scale rapidly.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Comments On Deadline Hollywood are monitored.

Today’s top news: Two of the biggest names in crypto investing bought big last week. And proved that they still have the ability to raise capital during market downturns. Both Michael Saylor and Tom Lee quietly loaded up last week. First, Saylor’s Strategy added $963M in BTC (10,624 BTC to be exact) to its balance sheet, marking one of its largest buys since the summer. That total is more than the entire amount of BTC bought by Saylor over the past 3 months. Then came Tom Lee, whose firm BitMine boosted its Ethereum holdings to $12B by acquiring another $429M in ETH (138,452 ETH to be exact). Perhaps most notable, BitMine added to its cash position during the week as well, now holding $1B in cash (up from $800M). "BitMine provided its latest holdings update for Dec 8th, 2025: $13.2 billion in total crypto + "moonshots": -3,864,951 ETH at $3,139 per ETH - 192 Bitcoin (BTC) - $36 million stake in Eightco Holdings (NASDAQ: ORBS) (“moonshots”) and - total cash of $1.0 billion." - BitMNR on X “MSTR raised $1B in one week, the same amount it took them 4 months to raise in 2020. The exponential trend continues” - James Van Straten, Coindesk analyst, on X Strategy has acquired 10,624 BTC for ~$962.7 million at ~$90,615 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 24.7% YTD 2025. As of 12/7/2025, we hodl 660,624 $BTC acquired for ~$49.35 billion at ~$74,696 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD $STRE https://t.co/oyLwSuW7nW — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 8, 2025 There has been a lot of concern about the DAT trade unwinding, and neither Saylor nor Tom Lee have been spared from that conversation. The heat turned up even more recently when it was widely speculated that Strategy would start to sell BTC if and when its mNAV dipped below 1. Well, it got very close to 1 in this latest downturn - and he’s not selling. In fact, the opposite. He’s buying and in big size. It’s relieving for the MSTR bulls out there and confidence-building for those concerned about how Saylor would act in this downturn. But what’s more notable, especially from a near-term trading perspective, is Tom Lee’s ability to raise capital during this ETH downturn. BMNR stock dipped over 60% from local highs, and yet, the team has been able to keep slamming its ATM and raising cash. This has enabled Tom to buy a ton of ETH and grow his cash pile. And for perspective, his $429M buy is about 2x the size of Saylor’s $1B buy in market cap perspective (BTC is 5x ETH in market cap). The ETH / BTC ratio is up 4% on the month now and looking like it’s ready to break out of a 3-month downturn. That matters because ETH breaking out typically means some form of “alt season” rally against Bitcoin where multiple tokens see relatively large gains in a short period. The fact that Tom is still sitting on $1B in cash (and is motivated to lower his average purchase price from $4k/ETH on this dip) means that he is likely to remain a heavy buyer - which is good for ETH, and perhaps, for alts.

Title: Exclusive: Circle stablecoin for ‘banking-level privacy’ to launch on Aleo blockchain
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/09/circle-privacy-stablecoin-aleo-udsc-udscx/
Time Published: 2025-12-09T13:30:00Z

Blockchains are public databases. That’s an immediate roadblock for large institutions like banks, whose clients largely don’t want their balances and payments history open to prying eyes. Now, the crypto giant Circle has partnered with the blockchain Aleo to launch a “private” version of its stablecoin called USDCx, which will obscure transaction histories, Howard Wu, cofounder of Aleo, told Fortune. “People don’t want to reveal their business revenues. They don’t want to reveal business intelligence,” Wu said. “But the way that transparent blockchains work today unfortunately means that every time you transact, you are leaking that data.” The new Circle-backed token, which like other stablecoins is pegged to underlying assets like the U.S. dollar, won’t be truly private. Every transaction of the token will include what Wu called a “compliance record,” which Circle will be able to access in case law enforcement or other authorities reach out about specific transactions. Still, for public users looking at a blockchain log, the transactions will look unintelligible and like “blobs of data,” Wu said. “This is banking-level privacy, as opposed to ‘privacy privacy,’” he added. The launch of USDCx comes amid a broader push from the crypto industry to persuade big banks and institutions to use blockchain technology. That effort appears to be gaining traction, especially in the realm of tokenization, or the act of putting real-world assets like mortgages or even the U.S. dollar in blockchain wrappers. The asset management giant BlackRock has launched its own tokenized money market fund BUIDL, the online brokerage Robinhood has dabbled in blockchain-based stock trading, and fintech giants like Stripe have invested huge sums of capital into stablecoins. “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized,” Larry Fink, cofounder and CEO of BlackRock, said in his 2025 letter to investors. Wu, the cofounder of Aleo, has seen interest in privacy-enabled stablecoins from a swathe of potential customers, including the crypto payroll processors Request Finance and Toku. He also said that prediction markets, or locales where gamblers can bet on real-world events and sports, are also interested in experimenting with stablecoins like USDCx. Aleo, which specializes in private blockchain transactions, isn’t the only privacy-first technology of its kind in crypto. There are other cryptocurrencies—most famously Zcash—which also promise users encrypted transactions. However, these cryptocurrencies are much more volatile than stablecoins, which, as their name implies, are designed to stay stable relative to the U.S. dollar or other currencies.

Title: Inveniam buys Swarm Markets as race to tokenise $20tn private market heats up

Time Published: 2025-12-09T12:50:38Z

About us Copy link Inveniam will acquire tokenisation platform Swarm Markets for an undisclosed amount. The deal will give professional and institutional investors — such as asset managers, private equity and credit firms, custodians and market makers — access to “scalable infrastructure for tokenised assets,” Philipp Pieper, co-founder of Swarm Markets, told DL News. “This acquisition brings together the two layers institutions have been missing: trusted, machine-readable data for private assets and a regulatory-compliant execution and trading stack,” Pieper said. Inveniam is an American data analytics firm that specialises in providing clear data about the private-market assets, including real estate and private credit. In October, the company acquired decentralised cloud storage provider Stor for an undisclosed amount. The Swarm Markets deal highlights the growing competition among crypto companies and fintech firms looking to tokenise private markets. Crypto exchange Kraken and stock-trading platform Robinhood are just two businesses that have ventured into this space over the past year. The interest in private markets is understandable. Investment giant BlackRock estimates that the market will grow by over 53% to be worth $20 trillion by 2030. “The tokenisation of public and private markets is one of the largest infrastructure opportunities in global finance,” Pieper said. Despite the growing competition, Pieper is confident that Swarm Markets and Inveniam will make an impact. “We don’t believe the space is crowded,” he said. “In fact, it is only just beginning. Many companies have announced intentions to enter tokenisation or private markets, but very few have a working product that investors can actually use today.” Essentially, he argues that, once you parse through the flood of announcements, few companies are doing what the two companies can do. Pieper noted that Swarm Markets has been live for years, bringing public securities on-chain in a compliant, DeFi-compatible way. Combine that with Inveniam having brought more than $200 billion of private-market assets to the blockchain, and you’ve got a winning combo, Pieper argues. Moreover, he argues that private markets are primed for an update. “Private markets dwarf public markets in terms of market value, but remain largely opaque, slow, and inaccessible,” Pieper said. “Investors increasingly expect the same transparency, liquidity, and real-time data they experience in public markets. Tokenisation is the path towards that.” Eric Johansson is DL News’ managing editor. Got a tip? Email at eric@dlnews.com.

Title: Dogecoin ETFs lose their bite as Bitcoin, Ethereum big dogs lead the pack
URL: https://cointelegraph.com/news/dogecoin-etf-demand-cools-bitcoin-ether-dominate
Time Published: 2025-12-09T12:48:48Z
Full Content:
The total value traded for spot DOGE ETFs reached its lowest point since launch, signaling a fading of the early hype as liquidity and flows lag well behind those of major crypto ETFs. US spot Dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are showing early signs of cooling demand, as total value traded (TVT) has fallen to its lowest level since launch. SoSoValue data showed that on Monday, Dogecoin ETFs’ TVT fell to just $142,000, the lowest since launch. This marked a sharp retreat from late November, when the funds saw days where value traded topped $3.23 million. Total value traded refers to the total dollar amount of ETF shares bought and sold over a given period. It serves as a gauge of market activity and practical liquidity, indicating the amount of money that has moved through the funds. The contrast is stark when compared to Dogecoin (DOGE) activity in the broader crypto market. CoinGecko data showed that in the last 24 hours, DOGE recorded over $1.1 billion in spot trading volume and had a market capitalization of $22.6 billion. This shows that the underlying asset remains highly liquid, but not through its ETF wrappers. This discrepancy suggests that traders are accessing DOGE directly through exchanges rather than traditional market vehicles. Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF made its debut in November but fell well short of initial volume expectations. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas predicted at the time that the ETFs would get at least $12 million in volume. However, the ETF only saw $1.4 million on its first day. Related: BlackRock files with SEC for listing of staked Ether ETF On Dec. 8, ETF trading activity remained concentrated on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH)-based products. According to SoSoValue, Bitcoin ETFs posted $3.1 billion in TVT, while Ether ETFs recorded $1.3 billion. Solana (SOL) ETFs saw $22 million in value traded, while XRP products recorded $21 million in value traded. Further down the curve, the recently-launched Chainlink ETFs recorded a $3.1 million TVT on the same day, while Canary’s Litecoin (LTC) ETF had about $526,000. The data suggested that ETF capital still overwhelmingly flows toward the two largest digital assets, continuing their lead as the core liquidity centers of regulated crypto exchange-traded products. In terms of inflows, XRP (XRP) remains strong. On Monday, XRP ETFs’ inflow streak remained unbroken since its launch. Meanwhile, Solana ETFs, which first had their inflow streak broken in November, are on a three-day inflow streak after seeing $32 million in outflows on Wednesday.

Title: Tether Pours Funds Into Italian Humanoid Robots Aiming For A Smarter Future

Tether Investments has joined a €70 million funding round for Generative Bionics, a company spun out of the Italian Institute of Technology. According to the announcement, the move is aimed at speeding work on humanoid robots and Physical AI systems built for industry use. The deal brings private capital to a project that grew from two decades of university research and a large team of engineers. Based on reports, Generative Bionics draws directly from two decades of robotics work at IIT. The firm claims about sixty advanced humanoid prototypes were developed and tested during that period. It has assembled roughly 70 engineers and AI scientists from IIT into its core technical team. That team is said to bring a combined experience of more than 600 years in physical robotics and related AI work. The company also holds exclusive licenses for key technologies created at the institute. Tether Invests in Generative Bionics as Part of Funding Round to Advance Intelligent “Made in Italy” Humanoid Robots 🤖 Read more:https://t.co/q5PHCV3zvy — Tether (@Tether_to) December 8, 2025 Tether’s funding will support edge AI development, industrial validation, and the first production facility. Generative Bionics is preparing initial industrial deployment programs that it expects to announce in early 2026. Reports indicate the company intends to place robots in manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, retail, and other areas where human-like machines could help with repetitive or risky tasks. The first full humanoid concept from Generative Bionics is set to appear at CES in Las Vegas. Tether Investments, based in El Salvador, says it uses profits and reserves to back technologies that connect digital systems with physical infrastructure. The firm’s recent moves include funding work on brain-computer interfaces through Blackrock Neurotech and teaming up with Northern Data and Rumble to build a 20,000-GPU global compute network for open, privacy-focused AI development. According to the announcement, the Generative Bionics deal is part of a wider push into physical systems that complement software and compute. The investment also signals a shift by a major stablecoin-related company into long-term industrial bets. Tether presents this as a way to expand its footprint beyond financial tools and into areas that could deliver practical, real-world utility. That said, critics will point out that robotics is capital intensive, and turning research prototypes into reliable, certified machines for everyday workplaces is difficult and slow. Analysts cited in the announcement estimate the humanoid robotics sector could top €200 billion by 2035 and may reach as much as €5 trillion by 2050. Those figures show why governments, universities, and private groups are racing to commercialize advanced robots.

About us Copy link Bitmine bought another $435 million worth of Ethereum in the first week of December as the company’s stock price extended a 45% rally from last month’s lows. “Our stepped up buying activity reflects our confidence that Ethereum prices should strengthen in the months ahead given multiple catalysts,” Bitmine Chair Tom Lee said Monday. Fusaka, a major upgrade to the $376 billion network, rolled out on December 3 and “delivers an array of improvements in scalability, enhanced security, and usability,” Lee said. Bitmine, which is backed by heavyweight investors including Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund and Cathie Wood’s ARK, now owns 3.2% of the total Ethereum token supply, with a stated target of 5%. Investors are bullish on the company’s consistent accumulation of the second-largest crypto, as reflected by BMNR’s 23% rally in December to $36 per share. The firm plans to pay shareholders a year-end dividend on December 29, a rarity among crypto treasuries. Ethereum has rallied nearly 20% since its November lows. It is trading at around $3,100 at the time of reporting. To be sure, it still trades 37% below its all-time high set in August. Bitmine’s latest purchase comes after the company deployed $200 million into the second-biggest crypto on November 24. Ethereum is having its “1971 moment,” Lee said in a presentation to investors. That means Ethereum’s technology can be compared to the global financial architecture that emerged after the US unilaterally terminated the Bretton Woods gold standard and set the rules of modern finance. “The Genius Act and SEC’s Project Crypto are as transformational to financial services in 2025 as US action on August 15, 1971 ending Bretton Woods and the USD on the gold standard 54 years ago,” Lee said. Lee said big players like BlackRock, JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank, and Bank of China are all building on the Ethereum blockchain. “This 1971 event was the catalyst for the modernisation of Wall Street, creating the iconic Wall Street titans and financial and payment rails of today. These proved to be better investments than gold,” he said. Bitmine’s stockpiling comes as the Fusaka upgrade aligns with macroeconomic tailwinds. “The best years are ahead for crypto given the substantial upside to current adoption rates for crypto and given the coming transformation as Wall Street tokenises everything onto the blockchain,” Lee said on Monday as part of a keynote speech titled “The Crypto Supercycle is Intact.” He expects the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates on Wednesday as it finishes the quantitative tightening cycle. Lower interest rates are usually good for risk-on assets like Ethereum because they disincentivise holding safe-haven bonds by reducing yields. “We are now more than eight weeks past the October 10 liquidation shock event, a sufficient length of time to allow crypto to again trade on forward fundamentals,” he said. The odds of a 0.25% cut in interest rates by the Fed in December now stand at 89%, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Bettors on Polymarket are even more optimistic at 95%. Bitmine will hold its next annual shareholders meeting in January 2026. Lance Datskoluo is DL News’ Europe-based markets correspondent. Got a tip? Email at lance@dlnews.com.

Title: Friedrich Merz

No. 3 — Germany The reluctant radical Friedrich Merz is the man breaking Germany’s postwar taboos. For half a century, the now German chancellor personified his country’s conservative orthodoxy: a Christian Democrat devoted to balanced budgets and ready to trust Washington to keep the peace. Now, with war on the continent and Germany’s economy sputtering, Merz has rewritten the script: spending big, rearming fast and declaring that Berlin — and the rest of Europe — must be ready to stand on its own. His move last March to unleash hundreds of billions of euros in borrowing for infrastructure and defense marked one of the most radical breaks in modern German fiscal policy — and one of the fastest. With just two weeks left in the outgoing parliament, Merz rammed through a spending package that shredded decades of debt-averse orthodoxy. Just as dramatic has been his shift on foreign policy. Washington’s transformation from indispensable friend to unpredictable frenemy reportedly shook Merz, 70 — once described in these pages as Germany’s most American chancellor. His career includes a decade in the private sector, most noticeably with the U.S. asset manager BlackRock. That didn’t stop him, on the very day he won the chancellery, from declaring that Europe must “achieve independence from the USA.” Merz’s allies describe him as a risk-taker. And he hasn’t hesitated to push for ambitious economic reforms at home or to signal he’s ready to break with his country’s traditional tread-softly approach to Moscow by endorsing a plan to seize billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to fund a massive loan to Ukraine. His boldness, however, hasn’t translated into popularity. Six months in, the far-right Alternative for Germany overtook Merz’s conservatives in national polls for the first time since its creation. His grand coalition — a marriage of Christian Democrats and center-left Social Democrats — is feeling the heat, particularly on the economy. U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs, high energy prices and growing competition from China are squeezing the industrial base that has long made Germany the envy of its neighbors. Meanwhile, Merz’s “autumn of reforms” — intended to reboot the economy — has become bogged down by political reality, with his slim parliamentary majority struggling to pass some of his more ambitious measures. Still, the chancellor’s position remains stronger than that of most of his peers. While France’s Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Keir Starmer wrestle with debt and fractious parliaments, Merz presides over a country with healthier finances. That gives him room to maneuver. He can afford to take a bit more time to, say, craft a sustainable pension reform that’s also politically plausible. While domestic troubles take up much of his bandwidth, Merz has begun flexing his muscles in Brussels — where Germany’s word still carries decisive weight. To the delight of Europe’s so-called frugal states, he has drawn clear red lines against the European Commission’s push to expand the EU’s long-term budget, casting himself as the guardian of fiscal and institutional discipline. That stance underscores Berlin’s growing influence in Europe’s power corridors. The German chancellor has become a central player in the EU’s debate over how far — and how fast — the bloc should move in integrating its defense, cutting its red tape and putting its fiscal house in order. But his ability to lead abroad depends on results at home: He can only credibly shape Europe’s future if he can restore confidence in Germany’s own economic engine — which sometimes means reining Brussels in as much as pushing it forward. “Friedrich Merz is realizing that he is needed as a foreign policy chancellor because Europe must strengthen its presence on the geopolitical stage,” said Sudha David-Wilp, a Berlin-based senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. “But he’s going to be measured by delivering domestically.” Merz’s staff picks leave little doubt about his intention to make his presence felt in Brussels — and to keep his foreign policy insulated from domestic turbulence. He has broken with German tradition by naming a fellow Christian Democrat, Johann Wadephul, as foreign minister — a portfolio usually handed to junior coalition partners. The choice is widely seen as a bid to reduce internal friction and ensure Berlin’s diplomacy runs directly through the chancellery. Merz has also installed his powerful chief of staff, Jacob Schrot, as head of a newly created National Security Council, tasked with coordinating Germany’s sprawling security apparatus and enforcing a single message on defense and foreign policy. Europe’s leaders are watching closely — and they know one thing for certain: There aren’t many other contenders for Europe’s next natural leader.

Plume Network, a modular blockchain dedicated to real-world assets (RWAs), has received a commercial license from the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) Registration Authority, paving the way for expansion into the Middle East. The license allows Plume to scale RWA origination and distribution across the Middle East, Africa, and emerging markets, pending further approvals in ADGM, the UAE's premier international financial hub known for its progressive fintech and digital asset rules. This would help Plume, one of the leading blockchain by the number of RWA holders, establish a foothold in the region that's attracting global banks, fintech firms and asset managers, including BlackRock, Deutsche Bank and crypto firms like QCP. Abu Dhabi also hosts major sovereign wealth funds like the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA, the world's largest with over $1 trillion AUM) and Mubadala Investment Company. “The UAE and the broader Middle East are rapidly becoming global leaders in the tokenization of real-world assets,” Chris Yin, co-founder and CEO of Plume, said in the press release shared with CoinDesk. “The region’s progressive regulatory frameworks, institutional openness to digital finance, and ambition to diversify beyond traditional commodities make it an ideal environment for innovation. At Plume, we see the Middle East not just as a market, but as a strategic partner in shaping the future of compliant real-world tokenization," Yin added. The move builds on Plume's U.S. momentum, including a recent U.S. SEC transfer agent license for tokenized securities issuance and management. The latest ADGM approval is a general commercial license and does not authorize participation in regulated activities such as token issuance or custody. However, the firm is exploring partnership plans with local institutions and its own authorization for tokenization services. A permanent Abu Dhabi office is slated by year-end, with commercial announcements eyed for early 2026, alongside local hiring and ties to regional banks and fintechs. Plume's geographic focus spans the U.S., Asia, and Middle East, capitalizing on pro-RWA regimes in UAE's free zones like ADGM.

Title: The U.S. Is Betting the Economy on ‘Scaling’ AI: Where Is the Intelligence When One Needs It?

Yves here. Servaas Storm provides a fantastic broad and properly sobering view on the AI/stock market mania and the far too many reasons why US players can’t possibly deliver on their hype. One tiny quibble, more of presentation: Storm discusses AI borrowing, initially making it sound as if it is being done by the big players themselves, which to some degree it has been. He then does describe how they are increasingly making use of off balance sheet vehicles, and so far, investors are bizarrely keen about them. I have not looked at any of these structures, but wonder how off-balance-sheet they will prove to be in practice. During the financial crisis, banks who had been securitizing credit card receivables found out lenders were making them eat some of the losses, despite the entities having been structured so as to be arm’s length. The funders said, effectively: Try selling us another one. The banks depended on being able to off-load the receivables (they could not afford the capital costs of retaining them) and so relented. In at least one data-center deal, Meta had signed up for four successive five year leases. When I was as kid, we’d capitalize this sort of commitment as an operating lease and treat it as debt. That does not seem to be modern practice. What happens if the underlying business comes a cropper? Does Meta try to default on the lease payments? By Servaas Storm, Senior Lecturer of Economics, Delft University of Technology. Originally published at the Institute for New Economic Thinking website Introduction Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public. This Large Language Model (LLM) was a total novelty, an AI tool that appeared able to do things that no one believed to be possible. Within five days of launch, over one million users had signed up to chat with the AI bot – a growth rate 30 times faster than Instagram’s and 6 times faster than TikTok’s at their start. It became the fastest-growing consumer product in history, recording more than 800 million weekly users in October 2025. OpenAI, the start-up that developed ChatGPT and that began as a non-profit in 2015, became a household-name almost overnight, and is now valued at $500 billion or even $1 trillion (for an initial public offering). Surfing the LLM wave, Nvidia, the producer of around 94% of the GPUs needed by the AI industry, hit, as the first public corporation ever, a market capitalization of $5 trillion on October 29, 2025, up from just $0.4 trillion in 2022. Nvidia currently has a weight of around 8.5% in the S&P500 Index, while the so-called ‘Magnificent 7’ (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) have a combined weight in the S&P500 of circa 37%. The data-centre investments by a concentrated set of hyper-scalers in the American AI industry constitute the main source of growth in an otherwise sclerotic U.S. economy. The U.S. is betting the economy on reaching Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), by building ever bigger computing infrastructure to run and test-time their LLMs, using more GPUs, more power, more cooling water and more data than ever before. But three years after ChatGPT’s launch, fears are growing in many quarters that the bet on scaling LLMs to reach AGI is going wrong. The AI boom, many whisper, may be a bubble. The Trump administration and the AI industry are showing signs of nervousness. At a recent Wall Street Journal tech conference, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar suggested that a government loan guarantee might be necessary to fund the enormous investments needed to keep the company at the cutting edge. Her coded message was that OpenAI has become TBTF. The message was understood. President Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks said (in response) that a reversal in AI-related investments would risk a recession. “We can’t afford to go backwards,” he added, indication support for Friar’s demand. (He later clarified that he remains opposed to any bailouts for individual companies in the AI sector.) History Rhymes, Or Is This Time Different? The U.S. stock market is definitely firmly in bubble territory. Figure 1 presents data on the S&P 500’s Shiller P/E Ratio, calculated as average inflation-adjusted earnings from the previous 10 years. Historically, a Shiller P/E Ratio above 30 has been a harbinger of speculative excess, followed by a bear market. In December 2023, the Shiller index rose to 30.45 and has remained above 30 ever since; in November 2025, the Shiller P/E ratio rose above 40. Since 1871, this is only the sixth instance in which the CAPE Ratio exceeded 30. The first time it happened was during August-September 1929 and we all know what came next: the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 89% of its value. The second time it happened occurred almost seven decades later: during the end-of-the-millennium dotcom bubble, when the Shiller P/E ratio recorded an all-time high of 44.19 in December 1999. Following the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the S&P 500 lost 49% of its peak value. The next three peaks above 30 in the Shiller P/E Ratio occurred very recently: during September 2017-November 2018; December 2019-February 2020; and August 2020-May 2022. Following these surges, the S&P 500 eventually dropped by anywhere between 20% and 33%. We are currently living in the sixth such period of speculative excess. Source: Robert Shiller (2025), https://shillerdata.com/ (accessed on 15/11/2025) However, the AI party is still in full swing. AI firms are racing to build out data centre infrastructure for what they believe is virtually limitless demand for AI services. Capital expenditures on data-centre infrastructure by Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft are steeply rising (also as a percentage of sales) (Figure 2). JP Morgan Chase & Co projects that 122GW of data centre capacity will be built from 2026-2030 to satisfy the (arguably) astronomical demand for ‘compute’ (Wigglesworth 2025a). The additional 122GW of data centre capacity is estimated to cost between $5-7 trillion. For 2026, the projected data centre funding needs will be around $700 billion, which, according to the report, could probably be entirely financed by hyper-scaler cash flows and by High-Grade bond markets. “However, 2030 funding needs are in excess of $1.4 trillion, which will surpass current market capabilities, necessitating the search for alternative funding sources.” Source: Christopher Mims (2025), ‘When AI Hype Meets AI Reality: A Reckoning in 6 Charts.’ Wall Street Journal, November 14. Crucially, most of the mega-financing deals are remarkably circular. To give you a flavour: Nvidia invests in OpenAI and OpenAI is looking to buy millions of Nvidia’s specialized chips. OpenAI buys computing power from Oracle which buys Nvidia’s GPUs. Nvidia owns about 5% of CoreWeave and sells chips to CoreWeave. CoreWeave’s biggest customer is Microsoft, which is an investor in OpenAI, shares revenue with OpenAI, buys chips from Nvidia and has partnerships with AMD. AMD, a rival to Nvidia, was so eager to land OpenAI as a customer that it issued warrants for OpenAI to buy 10% of AMD at a penny a share. OpenAI is a CoreWeave customer and also a shareholder. Nvidia has invested in xAI and will supply it with processors. And so on and so forth. The deals include revenue sharing across the stack and cross-ownership. Nothing in these circular deals is transparent. It is not clear where the money needed for these deals is coming from. It is not clear what these opaque circular transactions imply for the valuations of the listed and non-public AI firms involved. It is not clear what all this means for the competition over hardware between chip producers (Nvidia versus AMD) and over AI services AI startups (OpenAI versus Anthropic versus xAI versus Microsoft). Not surprisingly, therefore, these astronomical circular financing deals (referencing billions of U.S. dollars) are raising eyebrows. To many observers, they bring back traumatic memories of the circular financing arrangements of the late 1990s, when vendors and clients reinforced each other’s dotcom stock valuations without generating any real value. AI Bang or Bubble? AI industry leaders are now busy doubling down on their message that the AI revolution is NOT A BUBBLE, but real and sustainable. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated (in an earnings call on November 19) that there is no AI bubble and exponentially growing AI demand is structural rather than speculative. Huang claims that the AI boom constitutes a Big Bang, a historical revolution, because of three fundamental shifts toward accelerated computing: the move from CPUs to GPUs (which can simultaneously process multiple tasks and solutions), the rise of generative AI, and the emergence of agentic AI systems that supposedly can independently make decisions based on large datasets. Asset-managing firm Blackrock concurs: “AI is not just a technological trend; it represents an infrastructure transformation with growing macroeconomic significance”, adding that “unlike the speculative frenzy of the late 1990s and early 2000s, today’s technology leaders are anchored by fundamental stability.” The optimistic vibes around the transformative power of AI have even infected Nouriel Roubini (2025), the profession’s perennial Dr. Doom and now a senior economic strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, who has somehow become convinced that the tailwinds of the unprecedented AI data-centre investment boom will overwhelm any disruptions coming from Trump’s tariffs and geopolitical strains. But the various statements by Huang, Blackrock and Roubini are “sound and fury, signifying nothing.” The structural demand for Nvidia’s GPUs originates from the same circle of companies that are betting the business on scaling AI. The AI data centres may not be the “shovels of the AI gold rush”, but rather a black hole in which billions of dollars disappear. The surge in demand for GPUs and data-centre infrastructure may, in other words, very well be speculative, if it turns out that the AI models are not delivering good value for money to the investors – and cannot live up to the exaggerated expectations of the Lords of the AI Ring. Every reader of Kindleberger and Galbraith knows that this would not be the first time in (economic) history that most people – all in the same bubble – had it fully wrong, all at the same time. The financial crisis of 2008 is just the most recent example of a collective mania that ended in a crash. The Insufferable Irrationality of the AI Industry The AI race is mostly based on the irrational fear of missing out (FOMO), in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street – which induces a herd mentality to follow ‘momentum’, a complete disregard for fundamental values in favour of placing an exaggerated importance to the limited availability of a key resource (here: Nvidia’s GPUs and ‘compute’), and overwhelming confirmation bias (the all-too-human inclination to look for information that confirms our own biased outlook). To bring home the point: the use of ChatGPT has been found to decrease idea diversity in brainstorming, as per an article in Nature. It is deeply ironic that the industry that is supposed to build ‘super-intelligence’, a deeply flawed concept with rather sinister origins (see Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna 2025), is itself deeply irrational. But solid anthropological evidence on the local tribes living in Silicon Valley and working on Wall Street shows that this irrationality is hardwired into the perma-adolescent psyches of the inhabitants, who are wont to talk to each other about the coming AIpocalypse, almost religiously believe in AI prophecies, have deep faith in their algorithms, regard AI as a superior ‘sentient being’ in need of legal representation, enthusiastically engage in techno-eschatology, and, above all, are deeply fond of Hobbits and the LOTR. These very same people are also used to talk about and think in terms of billions of dollars as just ‘stuff’ that funds compute, necessary for scaling in order to reach AGI. “I don’t care if we burn $50 billion a year, we’re building AGI,” Sam Altman said, adding: “We are making AGI, and it is going to be expensive and totally worth it.” The same Sam Altman lost his cool during an interview with podcaster and OpenAI investor Brad Gerstner, when he was asked how it all is supposed to add up, given OpenAI’s miniscule revenue. “If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” a taken-aback Altman replied curtly. “Enough.” There are more signs of irrationality in the AI industry. In the first six months of 2025, AI start-ups that have no profits, no sales, no pitch and no product to speak of, have been securing billions of dollars of funding. For example, pre-revenue, pre-product AI company ‘Safe Superintelligence’, founded by Ilya Sutskever, ex-chief scientist at OpenAI, raised $2 billion at a $32 billion valuation in April 2025. Similarly, ‘Thinking Machines Lab’, an AI research and product company launched by OpenAI’s former chief technology officer Mira Murati, raised $2 billion at a valuation of $12 billion from investors such as Nvidia, AMD and Cisco in July 2025. The company has not released a product, has no customers and has even refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati said. “She was like, ‘So we’re doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.” The best AI people are in charge, or so they tell us. A handful of labs, led by Tolkienesque techies, control the narrative around frontier LLMs. The narrative they tell the public is that they are on a mission to build AGI to benefit all of humanity, but this emerging autonomous super-intelligence is so complex and potentially dangerous, even apocalyptic. Anthropic’s chief scientist Jared Kaplan is only the latest in a long line of AI-experts sounding the alarm; or consider Geoffrey Hinton who predicts, once more, the total breakdown of society once AI gets smarter than people. The overblown claims go like this: “It would become impossible for humans to get paid to do work because the superintelligence could do it better and cheaper. You and I would not have jobs. Nobody would have jobs.” The message is clear: reaching AGI is Very Serious Stuff, and Potentially Dangerous. But rest assured: the AI-developers can safely handle these risks and they have the expertise to decide what counts as ‘safe’. Reaching AGI will also need gigantic data-centres, land, electricity and water (for cooling), but don’t worry: the promised results will be transformative and a benefit for all. AGI will find cures for cancer, discover ways to end hunger, solve the affordability crisis, empower students and workers, and somehow also solve climate change. Just trust us, they tell us. Give us the resources we need to build AGI. But what they tell their investors is altogether different: we are building technology that can “do essentially what you will pay us for”, including making workers redundant by automating jobs or turning them into gig workers while putting them under corporate surveillance. Emily M. Bender and Alex Hanna (2025) recount, for example, how the National Eating Disorders Association in the U.S. replaced their hotline operators with a chatbot days after the former voted to unionise. AI algorithms also work successfully to help landlords push the highest possible rents on tenants. Likewise, the health insurance industry uses AI automation and predictive technologies to systematically deny patients coverage for necessary medical care. AI also works for the military: defence company Anduril builds autonomous drones, virtual reality headsets, and other AI-powered technologies for the U.S. military. And private equity firms are hiring AI people to go through the companies they own and see how these should be restructured. This way, the AI industry has convinced the financial sector, the cash-rich platform corporations and wealthy venture capitalists to invest their cash in funding the training and inference of the LLMs and the giga-data-centre infrastructure, that is driving the current AGI boom in the U.S. In a new Working Paper, I argue that this AI data-centre investment boom is a bubble which will pop, probably rather sooner than later. This will prove to be socially costly to the larger U.S. economy, not just because of the inevitable correction, crash and recession, but more fundamentally, in terms of the scarce resources that have been and will be wasted on the hallucinogenic pipe dreams of a few entitled Ayn Randian billionaire tech brothers and sisters, who, quite in character and as was noted already above, have begun to hedge their bets by begging the taxpayer for subsidies and government loan guarantees (Cooper 2025). The AI bubble will eventually pop for the following four reasons. The Revenue Delusion There is no world in which the enormous spending in data centre infrastructure (more than $5 trillion in the next five years) is going to pay off; the AI-revenue projections are pie-in-the-sky because of the following: Hence, most AI companies will fail to turn a profit, as prices will fall (because of Chinese competition), while (training and inference) costs go up due to the scaling strategy. Source: U.S. Census Bureau, Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) 2023-2025. Notes: The U.S. Census Bureau conducts a biweekly survey of 1.2 million firms. Businesses are asked whether they have used AI tools such as machine learning, natural language processing, virtual agents or voice recognition to help produce goods or services in the past two weeks. See Torsten Sløk (2025b), https://www.apolloacademy.com/ai-adoption-rate-trending-down-for-large-companies/ The Ticking Time-Bomb of Hyperscale Borrowing There is no way in which the AI industry can fund its capital expenditures out of revenues from paid subscribers or money from sovereign wealth funds. Hence, AI firms will have to resort to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets to fund their capex, laying the foundations for the next debt crisis. This hyperscale borrowing will create a ticking time bomb on the balance sheets of AI firms, because the core capital expenditure is on specialised GPUs and servers, which — because of unrelenting technological progress — risk becoming economically obsolete within two or three years. Nvidia is not helping in this respect, because it is building new generation GPUs each and every year and GPU prices are likely falling. Nvidia’s latest generation Blackwell GPU’s require entirely new servers, and if you use many of them, an entirely new data centre, because the Blackwell GPUs require much more power and cooling. The rate of economic decay of the AI compute infrastructure, therefore, is high and the payback periods are correspondingly short. “You’re investing in something that is a perishable good,” economist David McWilliams told Fortune, calling AI hardware “digital lettuce” that is “going to go off now.” Data servers, networking equipment and storage devices have a useful lifetime of 3-5 years and a corresponding annual depreciation rate of 20%-30%. These chips are not general-purpose compute engines; they are purpose-built for training and running generative AI models, tuned to the specific architectures and software stacks of a few major suppliers such as Nvidia, Google, and Amazon. These chips are part of purpose-built AI data centres — engineered for extreme power density, advanced cooling, and specialised networking. Together, they form a closed system optimised for scale but hard to repurpose. Figure 4 shows borrowing for AI data-centre construction. Investment-grade (IG) borrowing by AI big tech firms during September-October 2025 amounted to $75 billion — compared to $32 billion on average per year during 2015-2024. IG bonds issued by the AI companies make up 14% of the American IG bond market in October 2025. Barclays estimates that cumulative AI-related investment could reach the equivalent of more than 10% of U.S. GDP by 2029, compared to circa 6% in the first six months of 2025. OpenAI, Anthropic and other startups continue to lose money, and must fund most of the planned investment by selling off pieces of themselves to investors and by resorting to hyperscale borrowing from banks and investment-grade bond markets. Ignoring numerous red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage and the short pay-back periods, virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a slice of the action, generally via off-balance-sheet Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs), from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to asset managers such as BlackRock and Apollo Global Management. This Wall Street frenzy will in all likelihood lay the foundations for the next debt crisis (Fitch 2025). Source: Bank of America Global Research; chart created by Lucy Raitano (October 31 2025). Notes: IG = investment grade. The data for Blue Owl and Meta refer to a project-style holding company created by Blue Owl Capital to invest in a large-scale Hyperion data centre joint venture with Meta. Exponential Growth in an Analogue World It will be impossible to build the projected data centre infrastructure in the next five years or so (which is the horizon of most AI investors). The lead time necessary to build a hyperscale data centre is currently around 2 years, but expect it to become much longer, say 7 or more years. Why? Upstream suppliers to the growth in data centres — the established industrial companies — have to expand production. These upstream suppliers will run into labour shortages, long waiting times for power grid connections, material bottlenecks and regulatory blowback – and all this will lengthen the lead times necessary to build a hyperscale data centre, as explained in more detail in the Working Paper. FT Alphaville (2025) further notes that the nature of the AI-related power demand is particularly problematic (Wigglesworth 2025a). It cites a recent Nvidia (2025) report: “Unlike a traditional data center running thousands of uncorrelated tasks, an AI factory operates as a single, synchronous system. When training a large language model (LLM), thousands of GPUs execute cycles of intense computation, followed by periods of data exchange, in near-perfect unison. This creates a facility-wide power profile characterized by massive and rapid load swings. This volatility challenge has been documented in joint research by NVIDIA, Microsoft, and OpenAI on power stabilization for AI training data centers. The research shows how synchronized GPU workloads can cause grid-scale oscillations. The power draw of a rack can swing from an “idle” state of around 30% to 100% utilization and back again in milliseconds. This forces engineers to oversize components for handling the peak current, not the average, driving up costs and footprint. When aggregated across an entire data hall, these volatile swings — representing hundreds of megawatts ramping up and down in seconds — pose a significant threat to the stability of the utility grid, making grid interconnection a primary bottleneck for AI scaling.” AI Scaling is Hitting a Wall The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Three years into the LLM wave, AI-expert Gary Marcus explains very clearly why ChatGPT has not lived up to expectations: “The results are disappointing because the underlying tech is unreliable. And that’s been obvious from the start.” Generic LLMs are hard to control; they still can’t reason reliably and never will; they still don’t work reliably with external tools; they continue to hallucinate; they still can’t match domain specific models, they continue to struggle with alignment between what human beings want and what machines actually do. “The truth is that ChatGPT has never grown up,” Marcus concludes. Marcus also presents disturbing new research on the performance of frontier LLMs across three benchmarks by CMU professor Niloofar Mireshgalleh. The first benchmark is a math test that could plausibly be answered by large quantities of data. Unsurprisingly, the frontier LLMs perform increasingly well – but, as we saw, at the cost of gigantic volumes of compute. On the second benchmark (which is focused on coding), initial progress in performance is now tailing off, exhibiting diminishing returns. However, as Marcus explains, on the third benchmark, “on a complex task combining theory of mind and privacy that seems harder to game”, the frontier LLMs show slow linear progress – again, at the cost of billions of dollars and huge quantities of electricity and water. In sum, progress in performance on complex tasks is just terribly slow – which is the key factor explaining the disappointment of users of LLMs and the limits to profitable adoption by enterprises. LLMs are great at generating plausible output – while being much less good at getting their facts straight, while being incapable of reasoning. The hardwired inclination to hallucinate (Metz and Weise 2025) limits the usefulness of AI in high-stakes activities such as healthcare, education and finance. Potential liabilities resulting from the harm done by the decisions of autonomous unsupervised AI tools are simply too large in these high-stake activities — and this will restrict the adoption of and reliance on such AI tools. More generally, we have to think of LLMs, as Bender and Hanna (2025), suggest, as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. The same is true of other “generative” AI models that spit out images and music. They are all, the authors say, “synthetic media machines” – or giant plagiarism machines. “Both language models and text-to-image models will out-and-out plagiarize their inputs,” the authors write. A large fraction of the output will be AI-slop. In an ironic twist, the supply of AI-slop will only increase in future, because due to the lack of ‘authentic training data’, LLMs will increase their input of ‘synthetic’ AI-generated artificial data — an incredible act of self-poisoning. The more AI-slop these models ingest, the greater the likelihood that their outputs will be junk: the “garbage-in, garbage-out” (GIGO) principle does hold. AI systems, which are trained on their own outputs, gradually lose accuracy, diversity, and reliability. This occurs because errors compound across successive model generations, leading to distorted data distributions and irreversible defects in performance. Veteran tech columnist Steven Vaughn-Nichols warns that “we’re going to invest more and more in AI, right up to the point that model collapse hits hard and AI answers are so bad even a brain-dead CEO can’t ignore it.” Conclusion Because of these four reasons, AI’s ‘scaling’ strategy will fail and the AI data-centre investment bubble will pop. The unavoidable AI-data-centre crash in the U.S. will be painful to the economy, even if some useful technology and infrastructure will survive and be productive in the longer run. However, given the unrestricted greed of the platform and other Big Tech corporations, this will also mean that AI tools that weaken the labour conditions — in activities including the visual arts, education, health care and the media — will survive. Similarly, generative AI is already entrenched in militaries and intelligence agencies and will, for sure, get used for surveillance and corporate control. All the big promises of the AI industry will fade, but many harmful uses of the technology will stick around. The immediate economic harm done will look rather insignificant compared to the long-term damage of the AI mania. The continuous oversupply of AI slop, LLM fabricated hallucinations, clickbait fake news and propaganda, deliberate deepfake images and endless machine-made junk, all produced under capitalism’s banner of progress and greed, consuming loads of energy and spouting tonnes of carbon emissions will further undermine and self-poison the trust in and the foundations of America’s economic and social order. The massive direct and indirect costs of generic LLMs will outweigh the rather limited benefits, by far. FWIW. This morning from DeepSeek. … Thank you for that important clarification. You are absolutely right to correct the author. “The AI Con” is by Alex Hanna and Emily M. Bender (released in 2025). The previous answer incorrectly attributed it to Josh Bivens, whose book is “The Ultimate Goal.” My apologies for the confusion… Hallucination is a technical term for any result we don’t like. For the AI, it is all hallucination. Hallucination is an extreme case of misperception. First one has to admit that our senses are far from perfect so we human can naturally hallucinate. For instance when we see mirages in the desert. Couple our limitations with drugs and the hallucinations can become a permanent feature. Illusory thinking and illusory perceptions might be defined as a kind of hallucination which derives from strong stimuli. Because the LLMs are forced to have an answer (are stimulated to reply) always or nearly always the term “illusory thinking” might be more appropriate than hallucination. For the AI it is all an illusion. Just an illusion for the elder or a beautiful Illusion for the younger. You can Hallucinate (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgBmIfaHLKQ&list=RDGgBmIfaHLKQ&start_radio=1) with this Dua Lipa. I think hallucination is a sort of marketing term that implies that the results that we consider bad are anomalous, like a made up reference is worse than a real one for us. For the LLM they are the same. Humans are prone to apophenia, or seeing patterns in random information that aren’t there, it seems generative AI applies the patterns whether they are there or not. People are also prone to generate plausible answers with no information, and present them as if they were true. This behavior, epitomized in the BS artist, has also been adopted by chatbots. “Three years ago, on November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public.” What tells another part of the story: Look at what the the Nasdaq and S&P indexes were doing in 2022. Some hype needed to be created and fast. Outstanding article. Does a good job of summarizing the major problems of the AI craze in an accessible way (Ed Zitron gets a shout-out, which I find personally satisfying since it shows that a bizzare writing style does not lock you out of the discourse!) One thing I don’t understand is why the fourth section of critiques, which is basically that AI doesn’t work and is unfit for purpose, is left for last. This seems to be a common feature of AI criticism, the fact that AI is technically unsound and inherently dangerous, is downplayed and treated as a minor issue compared to things like economic problems in the industry. The strategic bet of leading AI firms that Generative AI can be achieved by building ever more data centres and using ever more chips is already going bad. This scaling strategy is already exhibiting diminishing returns. It is the wrong strategy, since generic LLMs are not constructed on proper and robust world models, but instead are built to autocomplete, based on sophisticated pattern-matching (Shojaee et al. 2025). LLMs will continue to make errors and hallucinate, especially when used outside their training data. Generic AI products are never going to actually work right and will continue to be untrustworthy. Talk about burying the lede! BTW, there is an extremely good metaphor for LLMs in here: More generally, we have to think of LLMs … as “synthetic text-extruding machines”. “Like an industrial plastic process,” they explain, text databases “are forced through complicated machinery to produce a product that looks like communicative language, but without any intent or thinking mind behind it”. It’s an urgent task to find ways to explain the problems with AI in ways that people outside the industry can effectively grasp. “AI industry leaders are now busy doubling down on their message that the AI revolution is NOT A BUBBLE…” When “industry leaders” feel the need to make such a statement it’s a sure sign that it is. Not sure which deals, but in the case of Meta raising funding for AI data centres, Zuckerberg has personally promised to reimburse the investors in the event that things go sideways. If he had not done so, no one was going to invest so much as a nickel. A promise you can take to the bank, I’m sure. Ha Ha. No Making Shit Up. Zuckerberg has not made any personal guarantees. They were made by Meta entities, FFS. I take umbrage at those who misinform readers. One more like this and you will be blacklisted. Your email address will not be published.
