It has been a challenging year for restaurants, but despite the odds, the industry remains bold, and a new wave of restaurants made their debut – 18 of which make this list. These new openings are not just in Dublin; places like New Ross and Lismore are seeing exciting new spots, bringing fresh energy to local communities. You will find here also some beautiful places to plan a special night out with pals or family, just in time for the festive season. If you’re after something more low-key, our cosy and casual categories are ideal for laid-back meals with friends, while you can see where exceptional value is to be had in the smart money section. There are lots of options too for those who want to push the boat out for a date night, destination dining, or a glam evening. As always, it is a list of just 100, with a focus on new restaurants, so sadly we couldn’t include everyone. Be sure to support all your local favourites too. The most exciting east-Asian-inspired food in town at the moment comes from this Aston Quay restaurant, where a Santa Maria barbecue that has been custom-made by Smokin’ Soul is at the heart of the menu. Start with the by now legendary chargrilled mussels and work through the menu with some very fine cocktails. Read our review here. Corinna Hardgrave With the opening of casual Baba’de, Chef Ahmet Dede returns to the building where he earned the first of his two Michelin stars with Dede restaurant, partnering once again with Maria Archer. It’s charmingly named for Ahmet’s daughter Aleyna. During the morning, the menu is all about Turkish-style breakfast, while the evening offers an eclectic mixture of beguiling small plates. With the winter months closing in, look out for wine club evenings with guest sommeliers. Joanne Cronin Cork people are known to have deep feelings about the best chipper in the city, with KC & Sons from the Crawford family frequently a top contender. Now Josh Crawford, along with Arkansas-born wife Kate, is moving in a very different direction with the opening of Bayou, a New Orleans-inspired restaurant. For anyone who has ever been to the Big Easy, the menu of fried chicken and biscuits, beignets and muffulettas will feel immediately authentic. JC Jumoke Akintola and Peter Hogan have opened this luxe fish and chip shop in the beautiful first floor of their premises in Tramore. It is open year round – eat in (seating 20, now even cosier with a wood-burning stove), or takeaway – and offers an interesting wine list. A handful of smaller plates includes local seafood from Tramore Bay, such as crab or lobster salad, local prawns, or Duncannon smoked salmon and chowder, all served with their home-made soda bread. Beer battered fish and chips are €19.95; and plaice, John Dory, and turbot are available as daily specials at market prices. The Seafood Restaurant is closed for winter and will reopen in March 2025. CH If you’re starting to wonder whether the restaurant business is all gimmicks and Instagram filters these days, just head straight to Bearú in New Ross. By day, it’s a smart cafe, by night, a proper restaurant – no fuss, no frills – run by chef Dave Rowley and his wife, local woman Siobhán Ward. The menu’s tight, just three choices per course, and that’s because they cook what’s fresh – fish practically flapping in off the boats and seasonal produce. Read our review here. CH Affordable dumplings are the star in this stripped-back, budget-friendly joint, where the glowing neon CN Dumpling sign above your head is just about the fanciest thing in the room. You’ve got options: steamed, grilled, boiled, or drowned in a fierce Sichuan chilli broth, or snowflake style. There are sides too, such as a cucumber and jellyfish salad that’s as refreshing as it is unexpected. It’s the kind of place for popping into for a quick, tasty bite. Read our review here. CH There was a collective cheer when Coppinger swung open its freshly revamped doors back in August, and with chef Daniel Hannigan at the helm, the food has taken a serious step up. It’s a sharing plates affair, with no shortage of tasty options, and – thankfully – no minimum spend to box you in. The cocktails are a triumph. Start with the celery gimlet and work your way through the list. Read our review here. CH Fresh from a morning swim, Elaine Slattery used to drive to Lahinch for a hot chocolate. Wanting something closer to home, she transformed a 200-year-old cottage in Liscannor into Dolly’s coffee shop. Open since August, it’s now the spot for a post-dip hot chocolate, chai latte after a coastal walk, or a yoga-recovery matcha. Pastel de nata, Viennoisserie and sourdough are supplied from Hugo’s, there’s Happy Tummy bread, and organic vegetables and eggs from Moy Hill Farm. Upstairs is a community space for yoga, Pilates and poetry readings. Dogs are very welcome (it’s named after her own pooch). CH Stools hug the counters by the wall and window at chef Derek Kelly and Nicole Keegan’s Mount Merrion restaurant, while the snug delivers a proper sit-down vibe for those who like a bit more intimacy. The menu calls it “small and large plates”, but it easily adapts to starters and mains. Tasty, shareable dishes include free-range, spicy fried chicken and charred baby leeks smothered in ajo blanco, and it’s worth checking out the red prawn fregola. Read our review here. CH Storm Babet’s rampage through Midleton in east Cork in 2023 had a devastating impact on Farmgate Café, which Maróg O’Brien had opened in 1983. Now newly opened in Lismore in a heritage building that once played host to O’Brien’s Pub, there is a long counter area for walk-ins and diningroom at the back. The menu is based on local, seasonal produce which is cooked simply, preserving the original ethos of Farmgate. Read our review here. CH Floritz surely can lay claim to being the most glamorous diningroom in Ireland, bursting with bright colours and a luxe style that can only be described as Georgian tropical. Chef Matt Fuller oversees an extensive menu of small and large plates with a strong Asian influence. Groups can share plates of charcoal grilled yakitori, sushi, bao or dishes such as miso roast black cod. Read our review here. JC Forest Avenue feels like a neighbourhood spot until you taste what John Wyer does with suckling pig and vegetables from the McNally family farm and then you realise it’s quietly exceptional. The three-course lunch is a reasonable €49, while the evening tasting menu will set you back €89, a bargain for what they’re offering. And if that wasn’t enough, owners John and Sandy Wyer are doubling down with plans to open a French bistro next door, charmingly named Forêt. Read our review here. CH Owner Will Monaghan hit the headlines recently when he was candid about the struggle faced by city centre restaurants. Hidden is his latest venture, smack in the heart of Smithfield. The vibe here is similar to sister restaurant One Society, with tasty all-day brunch, switching to tapas, wine and pizza in the evenings, made using a wide range of produce from Irish suppliers. Read our review here. JC It’s a brave move to change a much-loved restaurant but that’s exactly what Andrea and Stephen McAllister did when they transformed The Pig’s Ear into Lotus Eaters. They describe it as serving the type of flavours that they love to cook at home. Pick and mix from dishes such as barbecue pork belly skewers, poached chicken salad with cucumber and rayu, or their signature Wagyu beef burger. Read our review here. JC Nádúr (meaning ‘nature’ in Irish) is the little sister to Cork’s much loved Good Day Deli. Owners Clare Condon and New Zealander Kristin Makirere have taken a unique little 18th century building and fitted it out with Irish oak, bespoke ceramics and Irish linen, while maintaining the style of fresh, seasonal food they have long championed. Visit for breakfast, coffee and lunch. JC It’s all about tequila and grilling at Jules Mak’s new Mexican restaurant. The margarita made with Casamigos tequila and avocado syrup is already a signature serve but there are nine others from which to choose. Chef Hector Gutierrez Ochoa turns out bites, hand-pressed tacos and meaty main courses grilled over open fire, including strip loin steak with chimichurri. The atmosphere is buzzy and booking is essential. Read our review here. JC Not everyone loves a communal table, but if you’re heading to Blackrock’s latest by-day cafe, by-night wine bar, you’ll find more intimate options if you book wisely. Delicious, small plates such as line-caught mackerel in ajo blanco are on the evening menu, and the well-chosen wine list means this is the sort of spot where you could easily find yourself lingering. Read our review here. CH Chef Alex Greene became famous due to the Great British Menu, becoming the first chef from Northern Ireland to secure a course at the banquet. Along with close friend and business partner Bronagh McCormick, he has recently reopened The Buck’s Head in Dundrum. The focus is on traditional pub food, done excellently, so expect lobster Thermidor with salad and fries or the de Terra shorthorn burger topped with pulled beef shin. JC With stone walls, timber beams and a coastal vibe, this Greystones spot has Sheerin Wilde (ex-Avalon) managing and Jaco Pretorius (formerly of La Maison) running the kitchen. The fish-led menu also offers steak, chicken and vegetarian dishes, keeping things flexible. Starters are under €15.50, while mains range from €19.50 for moules marinières to €42 for a 16oz Irish Angus T-bone. It’s as good for a quick bite as it is for something special. Read our review here. CH This may be one of Dublin’s smallest restaurants, but the flavours and dishes far exceed its mere physical dimensions. Named in August as Michelin’s Bib of the Month, its buzzy atmosphere fits in perfectly with the recent adoption of Drury Street by the young and fun. Kick-start the evening with “Amy’s Cherry Sgropino”, a mix of sparkling wine, Campari and saffron. JC Chefs Nicole and Bart Pawlukojć, who met while working in Denmark, marked five years in business by giving their sleek Kilkenny daytime spot a complete refurb. Their famous sourdough stars across the a la carte and brunch menus, showing up in sandwiches such as the kimchi chicken grilled cheese. For something heartier, try the not-so-Turkish eggs with Ballon Farm’s perfectly runny fried eggs, served with roasted Mooncoin beetroot and wilted organic greens. CH This Mediterranean seafood joint, with its Italian-heavy focus, has a menu split into spuntini, smalls, larges and desserts, with specials chalked up daily. Fresh morcilla is flambéed tableside in sambuca, and padella di mare, packed with Kilkeel crab claws and Killary Fjord mussels sautéed in a vermouth, comes sizzling in cast iron. Don’t skip the home-made gelato. Read our review here. CH Fish Shop’s charm lies in its confident simplicity. Start with sherry and a gilda, then move on to impeccably cooked fish, perhaps paired with a Jura white from their 200-bottle wine list. With just 15 counter stools, booking ahead is essential. The menu features cockles with chorizo, anchovies on toast, and the best crispy fish and chips in town. Grower Champagne by the glass is an added bonus. CH Owners Gilles Gaillot and Emma Gray have transformed this former bookies into a neighbourhood treasure. The wood-fired oven is in constant service, turning out pastries and breads in the morning, before switching to French-style pizzas in the evening. Loyal customers stop to fill up on lunchtime soup and hearty sandwiches, while young couples linger over pizzas topped with Bayonne ham, merguez sausage and Emmental cheese. JC The bright neon “Saigon” sign mounted on the rear wall gives a good clue as to what’s on offer. Through the open pass, chef Phillip Hughes oversees delivery of the east-Asia-inspired menu, with options such as Crying Tiger marinated Irish beef, classic Pad Thai or red curry with Skeaghanore duck leg, served with elegant cocktails. There’s a well priced lunch menu and a private room upstairs for groups. JC A fixture on the Cork food scene which has recently doubled in size, at Izz Cafe, Izz and Eman Alkarajeh serve up a mixture of mezze-style Palestinian foods and manaeesh-topped flatbreads, with breakfast, lunch and dinner options. Ingredients are sourced from Palestine, or closer to home from the English Market and the Cork Rooftop Garden. Watch out for their Coffee for Palestine fundraiser in conjunction with more than 90 Cork cafes. JC The interiors at Kai are always as seasonal as the food. With windows currently full of beautiful, orange pumpkins and autumnal foliage, dishes such as John Dory with burnt butter cauliflower and fried cob nuts reflect the time of year. Holding the only Michelin Green Star in Ireland, chef and owner Jess Murphy is a firm advocate of farm to fork, and desserts are made by sister business Hapi Bakery. JC Earlier this year, Sham Hanifa released his first cookbook, Agak Agak, a tribute to his heritage which spans China, Thailand, Malaysia and India. Readers will be drawn into his world of deep aromatics and rich flavours, just as if they were sitting in his restaurant, open every day from breakfast to evening. Try classics such as the chicken satay or beef rending. JC Alain Morice’s 20-seater deli, daytime bistro and wine bar blends French charm with Irish produce. The small menu features a weekly pâté en croute, a labour of love, which could be pork, figs and herbs wrapped in crisp, golden pastry. Galway snails swim in garlicky butter and the roast chicken Dauphinoise is pure comfort. Desserts by Morice’s sister finish things off perfectly. Read our review here. CH After five years in business, chef Conor Halpenny briefly closed Square earlier this year to allow time for a recharge and reset, before reopening with a fresh new menu. This restaurant’s joy and love is evident in every dish, from home-made crisps snowed under by cheese, the Square “KFC”, and trofie pasta with courgette and Boyne Valley Bán cheese. Look out for wine glasses with a little dog motif, a tribute to Alfie, the restaurant dog. JC With three cafes dotted around Dublin city, Stephen O’Dwyer’s Tang is a popular choice for a healthy, nutritious and joyous lunch. But it’s gone up another level with the arrival of the casual evening menu at Cumberland Place. Home-grown chef Aoibheann’s menu is heavily influenced by flavours of the Middle East, with pillowy focaccia, smoky aubergine dip and halloumi in bright, vibrant harissa yoghurt, all enjoyed with glasses from the short wine list. JC With an open wood grill burning in the heart of the kitchen, and home-brewed beers to accompany their fine steaks, Elbow Lane is a Cork treasure. JC Whether you’re dining in the elaborate main room or on the beautiful terrace, Fire remains one of Dublin’s most popular spots for steak. JC Quality steaks in a casual setting at very pocket friendly prices. JC Given that the Buckley family started as butchers, it’s no surprise that this award-winning group of restaurants serve some of Ireland’s finest steaks. JC This award-winning gastropub knows how to serve up great steaks, paired perfectly with one of their own craft beers. JC Whether it’s the good value rump steak at lunch, or a hearty porterhouse for dinner, enjoy them all in Dublin’s most stunning diningroom. Read our review here. JC Charcoal-grilled Tyrone beef, wine and cocktails make James St the smart choice for steaks in Belfast. JC Enjoy Gilligan’s Farm dry-aged steaks, cooked in a charcoal Josper oven in this busy Galway spot. JC This luxe gastropub in the heart of Cashel serves fine, hearty steaks, best enjoyed with triple-cooked chips and their shallot and Bourguignon sauce. JC With restaurants in Cork and Limerick, the stylish Cornstore serves up premium dry-aged steaks and fun cocktails. JC Kilian Walsh, formerly of L’Enclume, heads the kitchen at this Michelin-starred restaurant. The €105 tasting menu features inventive dishes such as mushroom custard with ox tongue and sweetcorn, and grilled pork with artichoke barigoule. With a strong focus on seasonal Irish produce from Castleruddery Organic Farm, the restaurant caters particularly well to vegetarians and vegans. A recent mini refurb has added new flooring and banquet seating, keeping the space casual but fresh. Read our review here. CH Located a short distance from Belfast, Frae is to be found in the food Mecca that is Holywood. The constantly changing menu from chef Shaun Tinman is always fun and creative, with specials featuring veal scallopine with Gorgonzola butter and sherry sauce, or chargrilled chicken Marbella, drawing flavours from right across the island. Choose from the excellent natural wine list and let the relaxed service set you at ease. JC Grano is one of those Dublin restaurants where reservations are rarer than hen’s teeth. Since it opened in 2018, Roberto Mungo’s handmade pasta has had diners coming back for more. To understand his attitude to quality, consider the fact that he only uses flour made from an ancient grain called Senatore Cappelli that is grown near his Calabrian hometown using low-intervention methods. JC Operating from a small but buzzy space, Niall McDermott and Chloe Kearney have built up a loyal customer base with their short and sharp menus of small plates, fresh pasta and large sharing meats. Plates such as pumpkin cappellacci with sage and walnuts or the pork chop from Pigs on the Green have become signature items. When closed, the duo often make the space available for pop-up and charity events. JC With more than 100 wines from which to choose, the wine list at Note is an homage to biodynamic, natural and low-intervention winemaking. In the kitchen, Essa Fakhry has established a unique style of modern Irish cooking that sometimes dances on the edge of austerity but never disappoints in flavour. Try crab crumpet with sea urchin espuma or roast quail with coco beans and girolles to experience for yourself. Read our review here. JC After two years of quietly shaping the menu, head chef Miguel Frutos is now making Paradiso unmistakably his. The vegetable-led dishes, sourced from Gortnanain Farm, are nothing short of remarkable, and the €68 six-course tasting menu feels like a steal. The wine list, too, stands out for its accessibility. Meanwhile, long-time manager Dave O’Mahony is stepping into ownership alongside Miguel, marking a new chapter for this Cork institution. Read our review here. CH Sometimes it’s easy to overlook the classics in favour of the new, but the Saddle Room at Dublin’s own grande dame hotel remains an excellent choice for relaxed smart dining, whether for lunch or a special occasion. Stop at the seafood bar for some oysters and champagne, or indulge in a magnificent chateaubriand carved table side, all in a cosy cocoon right in the city centre. JC Paul McNamara, Simon Barrett, and Liz Matthews run a Spanish-influenced restaurant where the menu includes dishes such as Cantabrian anchovies, Ibérico pork presa, Coolea agnolotti and brill à la plancha. For two, the salt-aged Delmonico with Béarnaise, beef dripping potatoes, and Bordelaise sauce (€82) is a regular favourite. The 300-bottle wine list covers sherries, Spanish small producers and a strong line-up of grower champagnes. CH The €90, six-course tasting menu at Michelin-starred Variety Jones ranks among the best meals I’ve had this year – no fuss, just superb cooking in a relaxed setting. Chef-patron Keelan Higgs has an obsession with local, organic and seasonal produce, all seared by the intense heat of the open fire. Highlights include oysters dressed in a punchy Vietnamese sauce, duck liver parfait with waffles, a gloriously rich spaghetti Alfredo, and barbecued monkfish. The food manages to be both precise and bold, yet never loses its playful edge. CH This small premises on Kevin Street is from the people behind the Fish Shop in Stoneybatter and the Beach House restaurant in Tramore, Co Waterford, so it should be no surprise that both the food and the wines are superb. Read our review here. CH Nelly’s Café in Drumcondra transforms into Brut Wine Bar on Friday and Saturday evenings, offering small bites and interesting wines. CH From Enda McEvoy of the late, lamented Loam in Galway, Éan is a bakery and casual lunch place that at night becomes a creative restaurant and friendly wine bar, with a great selection of natural and organic wines. CH A long-established food shop and restaurant upstairs, their wine cellar offers 300 different bottles as well as beers and cocktails, and a great selection of food from the Italian-focused menu. CH A wine shop and casual wine bar serving low-intervention wines and light snacks around a friendly communal table. Read our review here. CH With charming sommelier Nick Fajours (previously of Knockranny House) behind this venture, an interesting wine list is no surprise. There’s also plenty of emphasis on cocktails, with old classics and more inventive creations. CH A great addition to the neighbourhood scene in Kimmage, with a menu focused on small snacks and a great selection of wines by the glass. CH A spin-off from Elaine Murphy’s Washerwoman restaurant next door, Little Washer offers pizzas, pasta and small plates, as well as an extensive wine list. CH A coffee shop by day, just opposite the RDS, Mr Magpie turns into a wine bar with small plates on Friday and Saturday nights. CH Here’s a change from all the cafes that turn into wine bars – a bookshop that turns into a wine bar. Thursday through Sunday from 5pm the bar is open, with an interesting variety of sherries and good selection of wines. CH More than 100 wines by the glass (and 250 by the bottle) plus a broad food menu with an emphasis on local seafood. CH On Montague Street in Dublin, this tiny, oh-so-cool space offers coffee, breakfast and lunch, then 40 different wines and sharing plates of food later in the evening. CH The wine list in this Waterford city spot is exceptional – which is hardly surprising, as Morgan VanderKamer, president of the Irish Guild of Sommeliers, co-owns it. Her partner, Stephen McArdle, ensures the food is equally impressive. Read our review here. CH For those craving a Michelin-starred experience without remortgaging the house, Garrett Byrne and Bríd Hannon’s restaurant offers a lunch and early bird menu at an astonishing €48 for three courses. Dinner, naturally, pushes things a little higher at €78, but what you get in return are dishes rooted in the classics, such as foie gras “crème caramel”, saddle of lamb and roast almond ice cream. CH Mirco Fondrini’s osteria offers a slice of Lombardy right in the heart of town, with pasta and sauces crafted in-house. The menu is pure comfort, with dishes such as home-made tagliatelle with porcini, oven-baked cannelloni stuffed with ragú bianco, and Skeaghanore duck breast paired with braised shallots in agrodolce. Bruno Pangia from Naples now heads the kitchen, and with prices at €39 for starter and main, or €32 for main and dessert, it’s great value for what’s on offer. Read our review here. CH The historic heart of Waterford City is beating strongly once more, and Peter Everett’s modern Irish restaurant is bang in the middle. It occupies the remains of a 15th-century building, a claim few others can match. Everett’s consistently offers excellent value for money, while Waterford and local producers are represented on the menu by the likes of Tuskar crab, Comeragh lamb and Clashganny apples. JC It’s rare for a chef to relinquish a Michelin star but that is exactly what Takashi Miyazaki did when he decided to transform his fine-dining kaiseki restaurant into a more relaxed bistro and natural wine bar serving handmade buckwheat noodles, donburi bowls and tasty snacks. Cork folk rewarded him with even more business, and customer demand has resulted in the launch of dedicated sushi nights. Read our review here. JC With a newly minted Michelin Bib Gourmand, Lottie’s is a solid choice for dinner with pals. If you’re after something quick and casual, the two/three course, €29/€35 early evening menu (Wednesday-Friday from 5pm-6pm) is great value. For a longer evening, the ground-floor terrace (heated and covered) is open for outdoor dining or pre-dinner drinks. Menu highlights include Castledermot lamb with flatbread, Andarl Farm pork chop, and free-range chicken, all cooked over the live fire grill. Read our review here. CH With its €30/€35 early bird menu, Thursday steak nights and solid Sunday roasts, you’d be forgiven for thinking this place is just about neighbourhood comfort food. But behind the scenes, Gareth Naughton is quietly taking things up a level. And things are about to get more interesting with the launch of his intimate 12-seater upstairs, where he’ll be serving a chef’s tasting menu. Read our review here. CH A review of One Pico’s Instagram account will reveal beautiful dishes, plated with elegance and flair. It’s all due to head chef Zhan Sergejev, who combines a background in art and photography with his style of flavourful, modern French cooking. The diningroom remains ever elegant, a lovely spot for lunch or dinner, with a wine list heavily influenced by terroir and organic or biodynamic winemaking. Read our review here. JC Though many places have dropped the early bird menu, this bustling neighbourhood favourite still offers two/three courses for €40/€46 each evening. The menu is anything but ordinary. Starters such as roast beetroot with ricotta, courgette and black olive, or cured mackerel with tomato and smoked eel cream bring a fresh twist. Mains include pan-seared halibut with squid marinière or the indulgent suckling pig loin paired with ham hock, sausage and an Iberico ham doughnut. CH John and Tara Coffey are celebrating 18 years in business, just in time for game season, their favourite time of the year. Over the next few months the menu will feature partridge, venison, mallard, wood pigeon and pheasant, all supplied by Eamon Giblin of Gourmet Game. Their cosy restaurant is truly one of Ireland’s low-key treasures, and well worth a stop when travelling across the country. JC David Devereaux may jokingly say that he is the “worst home cook on the planet” but his food at this lovely Cork city restaurant continues to go from strength to strength. Along with partner Anne Zagar, they now focus on evening service, which is proving hugely popular with Corkonians. Stand-out dishes include confit pork belly with rhubarb and mustard cream, and ricotta and hen’s yolk raviolo in onion broth. JC Daróg, run by Zsolt Lukács (ex-Aniar sommelier) and his wife Edel McMahon, is a wine bar at heart but also a serious restaurant. Attila Galambos (formerly of Aniar and Lignum) seems to really have hit his stride here, with dishes like softshell crab tempura with wasabi emulsion, kingfish crudo with yuzu, and king scallops with Connemara surf clams. There is now an option of a five-course tasting menu (€55), and the wine list is as sharp as the food. Read our review here. CH It’s hard to believe that Dax is celebrating 20 years in business. There’s no shouting from the rooftops or splashy renovations – just Graham Neville serving up some of the best classic French food in Dublin, long before “quiet luxury” was a thing. Olivier Meisonnave’s very fine wine list and impeccable service adds to the sheer joy of dining here. The two/three course lunch menu (€42/€58), is one of the most wonderful escapes on a dreary Friday afternoon, and the three-course dinner (€89) is equally lovely. CH Killian Durkin and Jess D’Arcy have their eyes set on the flavours of autumn at Mamó. Dishes such as rabbit strozzapretti or sika venison with parfait, Roscoff onion and braised leeks are sure to warm the heart and stomach, but rest assured, their signature “cod chip” remains. Set lunch is available on weekdays with a la carte in the evenings. JC There’s a true joy and warmth to be found in Barbara Nealon’s popular restaurant where chef Rebeca Recarey Sanchez continues to tempt with specials such as chard with pine nuts, raisins and ajo blanco, or mackerel escabeche with leeks and a jammy egg. The popular “Somewich Sunday”, combining sandwiches and wine, returns soon, as does Provisions, the take-home service of tasty bits and cook-at-home meals. JC Celebrating 10 years in business, The Old Spot has just published a magnificent cookbook which beautifully captures the warmth and friendliness of this cosy gastropub. It’s all about comfort food here, including free-range scotch egg made with Andarl pork and Sneem black pudding, roast chicken supreme with dumplings, and perfect panna cottas. With a great selection of cocktails and drinks, you’ll find it hard to leave. JC This 1820s coach house is exactly where you want to land after a brisk walk in the Wicklow Hills. The kitchen works with suppliers including Ballincarey Organic Farm, An Tairseach Organic and Higgins Family Butchers, and the menu has hearty options such as Dundrum Bay crab fazzoletti with heirloom tomatoes, cod and chips, and a rich Wagyu cheeseburger. For something more casual, pop into their next-door sister spot, Roundwood Stores bakery. Read our review here. CH Vaughan’s Pub in Liscannor has been a go-to for more than 40 years, serving up lobster bisque, foie gras, steaks and freshly caught fish alongside a 200-bottle wine list. James Vaughan leads the kitchen here, while his father Denis runs the more laid-back Vaughan’s on the Pier in Lahinch. Seafood is landed daily and the seafood chowder, classic fish and chips, and fresh catches are the stars. CH Chapter One remains the one to beat, not just for its two Michelin stars or the three-course €85 lunch menu, but because it is resolutely one of the best restaurants in the world. Exquisite use of produce and meticulous and detailed cooking mean every morsel, from the first amuse bouche to the petits fours, is likely to be among the best you will ever taste. CH Having joined the ranks of Ireland’s Michelin-starred restaurants this year, D’Olier Street is one of the hottest tickets in town. Book one of the prime seats at the low kitchen counter to watch James Moore and team move smoothly through service, or relax at a table in the sleekly aesthetic diningroom. For the non-drinkers, there’s a creative non-alcoholic cocktail pairing to go with the tasting menu. Read our review here. JC This Cork stalwart has recently undergone a dramatic glow up, shedding its formerly muted tones for a plush floral and green inspired decor that reflects the small courtyard garden. With the English Market nearby, the new menu is firmly anchored by comforting favourites such as seafood chowder made with catch from Ballycotton, beef and Beamish stew and Quigley’s lamb shank. JC The sleek styling, large glass windows and Scandi vibes at Lignum are in strong contrast to Danny Africano’s preferred cooking style over primal fire. The end result, though, is modern and elegant, with dishes retaining just a lingering imprint of the flames. Current specials include Killary Fjord mussel and sea urchin flan and a glorious mixed seafood pasta with red mullet and gambero rosso di Mazara. Read our review here. JC Open for more than 20 years, this fine-dining venue with impeccable hospitality remains one of the top choices for special occasions and chic lunches. The classic French-style cooking is elegant and subtle, with occasional lively touches. Whatever you order, be sure to indulge in the luxurious pomme purée and the wonderful cheese trolley that is wheeled table side. JC The arched vaults of the Bishop’s Buttery, which boasts one of Ireland’s newest Michelin stars, are on the basement level of the beautifully restored Cashel Palace Hotel. The cooking style is classically French, while making extensive use of Tipperary and Irish producers. Look out for an upcoming series of dinners in conjunction with luxury beverage producers including Deutz champagne and Macallan whisky. Read our review here. JC Executive head chef Mark Treacy brings a wealth of experience to Kenmare, having previously worked in Dromoland Castle, Thornton’s and L’Ecrivain. Since taking over in 2022 he has steered this large, elegant diningroom towards modern classics, prepared using seasonal Irish ingredients. Dishes such as ravioli filled with Coolea cheese in onion broth, or cod with mussels, peas and girolles in Vin Jaune sauce are sure to please all comers. JC The Lady Helen at Mount Juliet Estate, now beautifully refurbished to highlight its elegant stuccowork, is a Michelin-starred diningroom led by John Kelly. His French-influenced, eight-course tasting menu (€160) showcases top Irish ingredients with dishes such as Mullaghmore lobster with violet artichoke and bouillabaisse, and Tipperary organic veal with black truffle and aged Comté. Kelly’s cooking is precise and ingredient-driven, perfectly complementing the grandeur of the room. CH Set against stunning views of the Burren, every dish here is crafted with meticulous technique. The €95 menu starts with canapés, including warm miso velouté with smoked eel. Atlantic scallops are sliced, cured and paired with rhubarb, while roast halibut is served with peas and broad beans fresh from the kitchen garden, bathed in butter. Jonathan Farrell, ex-sous chef at Bastible, leads the kitchen with confidence and skill – one of my top predictions for a Michelin star in 2025. Read our review here. CH The Morrisson Room oozes old-world grandeur, complete with Lafranchini stuccowork and a menu that matches the surroundings. Chef Adam Nevin (former head chef at The Dorchester) returned to his native Maynooth in 2023 and has been turning out refined, thoughtful dishes ever since. The dinner tasting menu runs at €110, with a signature menu at €140. Expect plenty of luxury ingredients and tableside theatre. Sunday lunch is a more laid-back affair, with two courses for €55, or three for €65. Closed for the month of January. Read our review here. CH Aniar is so much more than a Michelin-starred restaurant. After all, owner JP McMahon is truly dedicated to Irish food. Following 13 years in business, Aniar recently underwent a refit in conjunction with Marmar Architects, and the result is an interior that guides the diner through the 24-course tasting menu experience, all the time subtly mirroring the landscape of the west of Ireland. JC There’s a lot of talk about Ballyfin this year, the ultra-expensive hotel where Amal and George Clooney once stayed and Kanye and Kim honeymooned. The Michelin guide awarded the hotel three keys (the equivalent of three stars for hotels) and posted glowing pictures of the food, promptly adding to the speculation that it is primed to land a star. UK chef Richard Picard-Edwards has made no secret of his ambition, and with dishes like pea cream and broad beans with Belgian caviar, Mossfield ravioli in onion consommé and squab pigeon with foie gras and leg ravioli, it may just be the time to pop an email to see if one of those non-resident tables for the €145 tasting menu is available. CH Sam and Emily Moody’s fine-dining spot in Abbeyleix focuses on local, seasonal ingredients and precise cooking, drawing on Sam’s pedigree (Ballyfin, Bath Priory). The lunch menu and midweek “Supper at Six” offer great value but dinner is where the kitchen shines, with a la carte and tasting menus (€75) using vegetables from their walled garden. Highlights include honey-glazed quail with leek emulsion and organic slow roast duck. Read our review here. CH Change is in the air at Ashford Castle. The stately, dark wood panelling of the George V diningroom is now home to executive head chef Liam Finnegan, who works closely with the estate’s newly planted kitchen garden and local suppliers to bring a modern touch to the classics-inspired menu. The wine cellar is famously richly stocked, and has an extensive list of wines by the glass. JC In a restored 200-year-old cottage, Michelin-starred chef Robbie McCauley crafts precise, seasonal dishes, using produce from his own organic garden and ducks he raises himself. With his wife Sophie running the front of house, the experience is both personal and polished. Dishes such as fallow deer with fermented red cabbage or Liscannor Bay crab with garden kohlrabi show the kitchen’s sensitivity to seasonality on the eight-course tasting menu (€109). From November a seven-course afternoon menu (€70), running from 2pm-6pm, adds another option. Read our review here. CH Owner Damien Grey recently announced on Instagram that Liath is looking for a new home. But fear not – for the time being the Blackrock Market continues to host this tiny fine-dining powerhouse. Liath has a philosophy that espouses exploration of the senses, so the diner is drawn inward over the course of the meal into the imagination of Grey and head chef, Jozef Radacovsky. JC Despite being possibly the busiest man in Irish cooking, with television shows, demonstrations and cookware ranges, Neven Maguire’s MacNean House and Restaurant remains one of the most popular destinations in Ireland for a special meal. Often booked out months in advance, the generous hospitality and even more generous cooking from head chef Carmel McGirr feels very special indeed. JC Rob Krawczyk’s Michelin-starred tasting menu is all about restraint, showcasing local ingredients with skill. His home-made charcuterie and organic produce from Lisheen Greens flow through the courses. The four-course menu (€70) offers a taste of his craft, while the Signature Tasting (€149) includes wild halibut with Roaring Water Bay mussels. Upstairs, it’s more laid-back with “Small Plates, Nibbles & Snacks.” Closes through January. CH Dining at Terre is a spectacle from the moment you set foot inside, and it’s not just the open kitchen where French chef Vincent Crepel overseas the dramatically lit pass. It’s the quality of produce and the precision of cooking that makes this two-Michelin-starred restaurant so special. Age-old French cooking methods are coupled with a strong Asian influence on the €250, 11-course tasting menu, with dishes such as hamachi with home-made kosho and Ballycotton lobster with whey sauce. Read our review here. CH The lavish Oak Room delivers all the grandeur that one would expect at one of Ireland’s finest hotels. Service is impeccable, allowing the spotlight to shine on chef Mike Tweedie’s elegant and polished cooking. Since taking over in 2017, Tweedie has truly settled in, finding his way unerringly to the best Irish produce including Doonbeg lobster, Dooncastle oysters and meat from Higgin’s butchers. JC Chef Danni Barry works magic with the freshest seasonal ingredients, crafting visually stunning plates with a light, refined touch. The four-course table d’hote menu (€90) highlights this simplicity: cured scallops with cucumber and nasturtiums, perfectly cooked halibut with morels, and wild venison with garden beets. The Library, which was recently redecorated, now has a conservatory and terrace, and is perfect for a pre-dinner cocktail.

Title: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF logs $318 million net inflows despite BTC price dip

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, the IBIT fund, continues to be a preferred option for financial investors. The fund attracted around $318 million in net inflows on Oct. 31 despite Bitcoin’s price falling 4% to $68,800. The inflow followed IBIT’s record-breaking performance of $875 million on Oct. 30, which exceeded its previous high of $849 million. The fund’s weekly inflows have now surpassed $2 billion, according to Farside Investors data. Valkyrie’s BRRR fund also added nearly $2 million on Thursday. In contrast, other ETF providers faced significant redemptions. Fidelity’s FBTC ended its two-week positive streak with over $75 million in net outflows. ARK Invest/21Shares, Bitwise, VanEck, and Grayscale ETFs collectively reported $213 million in outflows. Despite the mixed performance across ETFs, IBIT’s massive influx efficiently helped the US spot Bitcoin ETF group maintain positive momentum, adding over $30 million in new investments. This marks the seventh consecutive day of net inflows for the sector. IBIT has accumulated almost $30 billion in assets since its launch, with approximately half of that amount gathered in the past month. The combined holdings of US spot ETFs have now exceeded 1 million Bitcoin. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT has attracted more investment than any other ETF in the past week, surpassing established funds like VOO, IVV, and AGG, despite launching less than ten months ago. $IBIT took in more cash than any other ETF in the world over the past week. This is out of 13,227 ETFs, which includes $VOO $IVV $AGG etc. It's so hard to beat those veteran Cash Vacuum Cleaners, even for a week, especially for an infant ETF (3mo-1yr old) pic.twitter.com/S443lUXVQk — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 31, 2024 Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: Don’t let Gladys and the Loons Win

A couple of weeks ago, on a balmy autumn day, I proudly planted a Trump yard sign in my lawn. My wife was on the porch. Across the way came a shout. “Your husband didn’t make you do that, did he?’ I looked across the way to see our neighborhood’s version of Gladys Kravitz. The decibels suddenly rose. “Trump is gonna take away my rights,” she screeched. “You disappoint me, girl!” My wife smiled, put a hand to her ear, pretending not to hear, pulling a Reagan. Gladys’ hubby scampered out and ushered her into the house. The trauma must have made it a whiskey night for vexed Gladys. No rocks, straight up. Afterwards, we wondered about what rights Gladys feared that Trump would snatch. Gladys is past childbearing age -- unless something biblical happens. She certainly isn’t worried about having access to an abortion clinic -- and what does she have to fear but fear itself in a bluish state? Maybe she doesn’t want grandkids? Or like Bill Gates and every other conscientious Malthusian, maybe she hopes to depopulate the planet? “Manmade” climate change can’t be stopped just by banning plastic straws and curtailing cow flatulence, though those earn gold stars for fine starts. Who doesn’t want to eat bugs instead of a T-bone? Maybe Gladys hopes to transition -- you know, not in a job but in gender. Trump and most Americans could care less. Yes, Rachel “Dick” Levine is weird and, no, embracing your DNA and accepting your biological maleness or femaleness isn’t weird, despite progressives’ relentless attempts to “Twilight Zone” female sports. What Trump and common-sense people are aghast at is mutilating kids’ bodies. Crazy them, but they contend that Frankensteinian science can’t turn a 12-year-old boy into a 12-year-old girl. They claim this is a cruel hoax and must stop. Children, say fab progressive parents and well-paid Manhattan child psychologists, “feel” they’re “misgendered” so they are misgendered. In the Brave New World, bodies -- 100% nature made -- are subordinate to feelings. It’s kinda tabula rasa. Charge critics, it’s a cuckoo’s nest worth of refugees from reality cursing and shaking fists at God. Nature, normies are informed, can and must bend to fickle desires. Let’s not skip the fact that mutilating kids’ bodies is a profit center. When medical center suits sniffed a new revenue stream, well, how hard was it to find surgeons willing to do the cutting? Cha-jing! Maybe Gladys is worried that Trump will take away her right to have her community invaded by opened to illegals migrants? Diversity is strength and all that word salad stuff. It hasn’t happened in Gladys’ neck of the woods yet, but if momala creatively ballots her way into the White House, a new torrent of migrants will wash across red and blue communities everywhere… for four more years. Or longer, because momala and the cabal that employs her will set about fixing our broken election system. Surely honest elections are a right, and Democrats know how to safeguard rights. In January 2021, wizened House Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer unveiled H.R. 1. That comprehensive elections reform measure was cleverly labeled “For the People Act of 2021.” Had Congress passed it, it would have centralized control of elections in Washington, D.C. Gladys’ Democrats claimed that Washington’s control of elections is democracy in action. Concentrations of power ensure our rights. But, finally, why care what the Founders wanted? Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, and other slaveholders and misogynists -- and egads, lots of other dead white men -- were vile creatures whose statues deserve to be graffitied and sledgehammered. Gladys loves the word “democracy.” It trips off Kamala’s tongue routinely. Democracy means everything to end-stage progressivism and means just about what comrades Stalin and Mao intended: We decide, you submit -- with nice, big smiles on the proletariat’s faces. Vox populi requires that a few extra chairs be added in U.S. Supreme Court. Conservatives disparage that act of democracy as “court packing.” They preach about original intent. Guys like Clarence Thomas, Sam Alito, and Neil Gorsuch refuse to eat from FDR’s old crock of stew. A law’s intent is pretty much what’s felt, say the Sotomayors, Kagans, and Brown-Jacksons, whose feminism informs them unerringly. Ouija boards may also help. If you want to figure out what’s on your rights menu, do as Gladys does, tune into MSNBC or CNN daily. Otherwise, shut up, sit down, and be grateful that you haven’t been cancelled into oblivion. Did someone say, “Free speech?” Gladys, like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, is emphatically for free speech -- within proper bounds, of course. The 1st Amendment requires guard rails, lest speech veer into hate speech and misinformation. Yard signs bearing the names of disapproved candidates are on the wrong side of the guard rails. Der Führer Donald Trump and his hordes are reckless with speech. Questioning the governance and policies of the benighted cabal running the Biden-Harris administration is undemocratic. Charging that Uncle Sam has been bound and gagged and stuffed into the U.S. Senate cloakroom by Chuck Schumer, while an imposter, oozing corruption, is paraded, amounts to incitement. ls incitement uttering “Deep State” publicly? What Deep State? And how dare Trump ruffians disparage Chris Wray’s FBI? An East German Stasi Lite? Would the FBI get a spanking new HQ if they were bad boys and bad girls? Who serves as arbiters of good and bad speech? Perhaps bad speech is like porn: elites know it when they see it. Or in Hillary parlance, the village will know it. The village is a collective, more in the Animal Farm mold than Mayberry. Every collective has a vanguard. Hillary, John Kerry, Barack Obama, Susan Rice, the faculties at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia and too many Gladyses to count will arbitrate. What must keep Gladys crawling walls nights is that a monster is on the loose. Hitler’s doppelganger prowls the fruited plain, meaning to whip inflation, boot illegals, round up criminals, and keep the U.S. out of war. The UFC fights Trump attends just don’t stack up to real bloodletting. Democracy has never been more imperiled. Trump has even teamed up with renegade progressive RFK Jr. to “Make America Healthy Again.” How can anyone suspect the efficacy of Covid vaccines and wholesomeness of Cap’n Crunch? No decent soul doubts the CDC and FDA. And how this side of Genghis Khan can the economy prosper without wars? War is peace, and peace is a fascist scheme to help Putin and waylay democracy. What fate would befall Larry Fink and BlackRock without Ukraine to exploit -- err, develop? As BlackRock goes, so goes America. Ask Dick and Liz Cheney about that. To date, the vaunted efforts of Democrats’ lawfare warriors have failed to hurl Trump into a U.S. version of Landsberg prison. A frazzled Gladys is further distraught. Hillary and the gals on The View warned that Hitler rose to power through elections. For Trump, this election looks promising. A nightmare scenario is unfolding. Kamala is closing her campaign thundering about the coming Trump dictatorship. In the waning days of Election 2024, the D.C. establishment is doubtlessly huddling to figure out ways to thwart Trump. Democracy demands responses. Alas, whatever schemes they hatch to save democracy may have to wait until the interregnum. Whatever the conspirators decide will square with Gladys. Meanwhile, Gladys plots. There’s a Trump sign across the street that the world needs to be saved from. J. Robert Smith can be found at X. His handle is @JRobertSmith1. At Gab, @JRobertSmith.

MicroStrategy has disclosed its plan to raise $42 billion over the next three years for additional Bitcoin acquisition. This move will boost its Bitcoin Treasury reserve strategy and also enhance BTC yield for its shareholders. The firm also disclosed its new “21/21 Plan,” a move aimed at generating $42 billion in capital, $21 billion in equity, and $21 billion in fixed-income securities in the next three years. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has revealed its plans to remain bullish on Bitcoin. The firm aims to raise $42 billion over the next three years to acquire more BTC tokens. This information came on Wednesday, October 30, as MicroStrategy released its Q3 financial report for 2024. According to the report, the firm aims to generate $42 billion in three years, which aligns with its “21/21 Plan.” This plan will see the company having $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. Meanwhile, the firm reported a 5.1% surge in its “BTC yield” for the quarter. It plans to boost its balance sheet and BTC yield for its shareholders in the long run. MicroStrategy, which claims to be a “Bitcoin Treasury Company,” noted that the plan to accumulate additional Bitcoin satisfies its treasury reserve strategy. According to MicroStategy’s Q3 report, the firm recorded an 11% increase in the third quarter. The report indicated that MicroStrategy holds a total of 252,220 BTC tokens as of September 30, worth over $16 billion. The firm purchased the coins at an average cost of $39,266 per token. Following its report, MicroStrategy now holds over 1.2% of BTC’s circulating supply. Moreover, it stands as the fifth largest Bitcoin holder after Nakamoto, Binance, BlackRock, and Grayscale. The firm’s “21/21 Plan” could also trigger significant buying pressure for Bitcoin, with potential explosive rallies. MicroStrategy’s report indicated that it generated about $2.1 billion via equity and debt in the third quarter. Also, the firm cut down its annual interest expenses by $24 million in Q3. Its total revenue amounted to $116.1 million, about $8 million below consensus estimates for the quarter. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy’s Q3 revenue earnings plummeted to 10.3% compared to the figure for the same quarter last year. The difference is due to the drastic drops in the company’s product licenses and support revenues. MicroStrategy’s net loss for Q3 amounted to $340.2 million, translating to $1.72 per diluted share. Despite the loss, MicroStrategy remains optimistic about the future and is focused on boosting its presence with Bitcoin. It increased its BTC Yield target for its shareholders, projecting between 6% and 10% for 2025 to 2027. Also, the firm disclosed its new equity that offers up to $21 billion. This move forms part of its strategy to accumulate more BTC tokens and boost shareholders’ value. According to data from Google Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock, MSTR, has recorded over a 260% increase YTD. The share trades at $247.31, indicating a 4.23% decline over the past day.

Downtown Josh Brown is leaving blogging behind, but wanted to take a look back. He joins us today to talk about his old MarketWatch interviews, his new book, "You Weren't Supposed to See That: Secrets Every Investor Should Know” and what Wu-Tang Clan taught him about business. This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello and welcome to OnWatch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's one of the busiest times of the year for financial news. We have a wave of big tech earnings, tons of crucial economic data, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, plus a pivotal presidential election. As we wait for the results of some of this news, we wanted to bring on an important voice, Downtown Josh Brown. Known for his Reformed Broker Blog and the Compound Podcast, he joins us today to talk about his new book, The Market, and what the Wu-Tang Clan taught him about running a business. Plus, we'll tell you about the news we're watching this week and how it will impact your wallet. So let's talk to Downtown Josh Brown. Downtown Josh Brown made his name as a blogger, but Brown is pretty much done with that part of his career. And to mark that change, he's published a book called You Weren't Supposed to See That: Secrets Every Investor Should Know. The book retraces some of Brown's most famous market takes and extracts long-term lessons from those blog posts. So in the spirit of that book, I asked Brown to revisit some of the things he's said to MarketWatch over the past decade. Josh, when I met you a couple of years ago, we asked you what you thought you'd be reading on MarketWatch in the next five years, and you said, "I'll be reading a lot about inflation and then eventually disinflation and then maybe deflation, hopefully not. But I do think probably a lot of what will be driving trends in the market will have to do with interest rates and macroeconomic concerns." And reading that back, I have to say, ding, ding, ding, it's been a lot of talk about interest rates and macroeconomic concerns on this podcast this year. So it does seem like you nailed that one. Josh Brown: 100%, and that's exactly how things played out. It's not Nostradamus level vision, it was just very obvious that a lot of what people were being driven by in terms of selecting an asset allocation was as a result of 0% interest rates. And then of course, we had 5% interest rates, and you see people's attitudes toward allocating to these different assets being very different. I think the two most important things in the markets are earnings growth and interest rates. So all of these other things that we discuss feed into those two major variables. The two biggest things that are happening right now is that interest rates are falling and earnings are growing, which is why we're sitting near record highs in the S&P, and the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones in so many sectors of the market. This is the best combination of conditions you could possibly ask for. So if I met a genie and the genie said, "I'll grant one wish. I'll tell you one thing about where things will be a year from now," the only thing I want to know is are earnings going up or down, and is interest rates or inflation up or down? If I know those two things, I pretty much can get the main story and that's the situation we're in right now. Jeremy Owens: The one thing I would wonder about there is the labor market, Josh, and that's something else we talked about a lot back then. I think you actually banged your hand on the table at the time in late 2022 when people were predicting a recession and you said, "If people don't get fired, then it's not a recession." And we're in that situation again where people are predicting a recession for next year, but we're not seeing people get fired yet. Josh Brown: Such a waste of time. The only people predicting recessions are Canadian economists with newsletters. There's nobody who's managing money who's yelling about recessions. What do you do for a living? You seriously think your job is to predict the economy? Think about the narcissism of saying, there are 7 billion people on Earth and I'm going to accurately predict what all of them are doing, so much so that I'm going to give you a macroeconomic forecast for the Earth. Have you taken leave of your mind, sir? So it bothers me that people think investing is this thing where you have to predict the future and then just invest in the right portfolio that'll capitalize on that. We see time and time again, even if you had the news right, you still wouldn't know what to do with your money. The chaos, the madness, the headlines, the clickbait, it's endless. It's not that we don't think bad things can happen. I'm 47-years-old, I've seen the market get cut in half twice. It's that we don't think every rustle in the bushes is 1929. Jeremy Owens: And that's exactly why people have been reading the Reformed Broker for so long, Josh, is that honesty. The book seems to be kind of a look back, but I think what you do find in the book is the ability to say, "Look, I'm talking about a certain thing there, but this is a universal thing that continues to be important if you're looking at the financial markets and here's what you actually need to take from this." Josh Brown: Well, the idea of writing about the markets daily was never about trying to predict the future, or scare people, or write a headline that gets a lot of clicks because blogging is a lot more personal with the audience. You realize that what you're writing is going to get emailed directly into their inbox and that they are forming a relationship with you. So that's very different than doing every twist and turn in the market five days a week at a publication where it's like, "The Fed is too late. Oh no, the Fed was right. Oh no, now they're too late again." If that's what you're doing, it's impersonal and also, daily market commentary doesn't really hold up that much. And one interesting thing, we structured the firm around content creators and we have 10 people who are writing about investing on a regular or semi-regular basis. We don't own any of their content. Every content creator that's with Ritholtz owns their own content. And one of the reasons why that's so important is people are going to do their best work when they feel invested in it, but the other reason is we don't want it. My market commentary from three months ago doesn't mean anything. It's worthless. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, and you're talking about your firm there, Ritholtz Wealth Management, when you talk about how it's structured and that everybody has control of their own individual output, it's funny you talk about Wu-Tang a lot. You're obviously a big Wu-Tang fan. It actually reminds me of what the Wu-Tang did with allowing all the individual members to go off and sign their own deals for their own individual music while keeping the Wu-Tang centered in one place. Josh Brown: This is why it stayed together for 30 some odd years because the RZA realized that if he were to be a pig and try to keep everybody signed to him, ultimately that would lead to bad blood and the whole thing would break apart. That insight into human nature was so significant. I have insanely talented people that I get to work with and one of the most important reasons why we've kept it together for the 11 years we've been a firm is because we give creators the ownership of what they want to say. We let them say it. We provide them with a platform, great distribution. Most entrepreneurs in our space don't understand these things. They think they have to have their grip around everything, but they don't understand how much power there is when you empower other people versus when you subjugate people and push their head down to fit under your banner. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Stay with us. Welcome back. Before the break, we discussed what Josh Brown said to us in 2022, but he's been talking to MarketWatch a lot longer than that, so I wanted to get into some of the things he told MarketWatch over the years. The first big interview we did with him was in 2012 when he was still blogging and he was investing in master limited partnerships, or MLPs. Now, if your immediate reaction is what's an MLP? That makes sense to me, I didn't have any idea either. What you need to know is this, an MLP is a way of structuring a real estate or natural resources business, and it often comes with tax benefits and relatively high yields. Back in 2012, Brown was investing some of his clients in an ETF that included MLPs, and I wanted to know what's changed since then. Well, Josh, the first big MarketWatch interview I could find with you was by Jonathan Burton, and that one is called Five Money Moves a Reformed Broker is Making Now. So in April 2012, what you told us was lean on value in dividends, look at financial stocks in mid-caps, and then believe in bonds, which was an interesting case to make in 2012 that looks a lot better now. The one interesting outlier there is you were talking a lot about master limited partnership ETFs. What happened to those and what do you take from all that you told us in your first big interview with MarketWatch? Josh Brown: So this is prior to the founding of our firm and we had left master limited partnerships behind when we created the new firm and really wanted to do our own thing. With master limited partnerships, you very quickly can ascertain yes, these have high yields, and the pitch is that they aren't as volatile as oil stocks until oil stocks get extremely volatile and then you realize it's like okay, I'm getting this high yield, but I'm also getting the volatility of the energy market. What if instead of prioritizing the yield, I prioritize diversification with an energy? And by the way, I'm not the only person to have had that realization. Most of the large cap MLPs have since converted to C corps, and the asset class has eaten itself. So reducing things along the way has really been the secret, not adding new things all the time just because there's a great sales pitch or story attached to them. A lot of people want to add new things to it and new bells and new whistles. I've always thought of investing as a reductive process when done correctly. It's not that there should never be anything new, it's that the hurdle should be much higher to add something, rather than subtract something. Jeremy Owens: So fast forwarding to 2015, Josh, you talked to us about a robo-advisor service you were developing at Ritholtz called Liftoff. Is that still a part of what you're doing? Josh Brown: It's not a thing anymore. We don't call it a robo-advisor. Liftoff still exists. We've got about $45 million on the platform, couple of hundred households. Most of those households have only a few thousand dollars in their accounts. Some of them have gone on to become multi-million dollar relationships, and they just happen to have started with us on the Liftoff platform. But we don't call it robo because we have human certified financial planners who are actually talking to these clients. Jeremy Owens: Right. Instead of marketing as a robo-advisor, it's your entry tier. It's the way people get into your shop and then you try to move them up. Josh Brown: I always thought of robo as pejorative, and I wrote a post recently. Rich people don't talk to robots. There's nothing wrong with automation, there's nothing wrong with AI. All of these tools are going to be really useful and they're going to help people like me scale our practices. So we now have a tier for every class of investor, if you will. Liftoff is $0 to $250,000. It's our entry level asset allocation/financial planning program, and it's perfect for people that are early in their accumulation. 250,000 to a million is called Good Advice. This is a different robo-advisor service that we actually acquired from BlackRock last year. This is where we're effectively working with HENRYs. These are high earners, not rich yet. Once those people are with us for long enough, they will ultimately become a million to $7 million, which is our Ritholtz Grand tier. Most of our clients are in this range. This is full service wealth management. 7 to 25 million is called The Preserve. These are now families where not only are we managing money for their own retirements, but we now have to think about the next generation and the generation after that because of that level of wealth. And then anything above 25 million is our newly formed Multifamily Office where we basically are doing everything from working directly with estate planning attorneys to handling taxes and even bill pay if that's what a family's looking for. So we have set up these tiers so that we don't have to say no to anyone, and we could be really proud of the level of service that we're delivering appropriately for each group. But to say to a client, "You're not important enough to talk to us, talk to our software," I don't like the spirit of it, so we don't do it. Jeremy Owens: Well, that's one of the ways y'all are different, and we did try to hone in on your differences. In 2020, you wrote a big long feature about what you were doing called Downtown Josh Brown's Budding Media Empire Seeks to Upend Traditional Wealth Management, and I really jumped at one of the quotes from that feature. You said, "I love to have a conversation with a client if they want my opinion on Google's latest quarter or whatever, but it's not going to help them. It's fun to talk about, but what's really going to help them is establishing a plan and sticking to it." And Josh, this is something I struggle with on a daily basis. As a financial journalist, I love talking about the latest earnings and all the latest news, but honestly, it probably shouldn't affect what listeners are doing with their financial situation. You should be setting up your finances for the long term in a way that the latest news isn't going to affect you, and that's what you were saying about how you work with your clients. Josh Brown: Yeah, that's right. One of the things that we've done really effectively is jujitsu the conversation. A lot of people come to us, they hear Barry on Bloomberg Radio, they see me on TV. Then of course, the first thing they want to talk about is portfolio holdings, or should I buy Coke or Pepsi into the earnings, or what's better, Microsoft or Apple? If we're going to be effective, we have to change the conversation to tell us what's going on with you because we already know none of that stuff really is going to help anybody. You might be able to put on a great trade or something, but what people really need and what people want to talk about at first are not always the same thing, what are the things that you want to spend money on today, tomorrow, and 10 years from now and 50 years from now? What are those important things to you? And they can change, but right now, what are they going to cost and what are contingencies? Right now, you own a business. You might still own that business in 15 years, or somebody might call you in three years and say, "I'm buying it." How dependent do you think your adult children are going to be on you when they're 22? What about when they're 32? Where do you want to live? What do you want to do for vacations? You got to have conversations about that so that you can reverse engineer the right portfolio. And then when you're having the portfolio conversation, the repeated reminder has to be look, this is not about feeling smart when you flip on CNBC and the oil stock you own is outperforming the other oil stocks. If that's what we're doing here, you're talking to the wrong people. This has to be about getting you financially to these goals that you said were important to you. And once that sinks in, finally, finally, you're really helping people. Jeremy Owens: Well, don't convince them to just cut off all financial news, Josh, but I do appreciate... And we try to do the same thing of trying to convince people that a lot of what we talk about is fun to talk about and interesting to talk about, but don't let it change. Josh Brown: For market nerds, listen, there's a subset of people who eat, sleep and breathe this stuff, and I'm part of that, but the thing is to compartmentalize and to say, "Wow, this is really interesting that the ETF market just hit 10 trillion, or that China is doing its first stimulus since pre-pandemic." All of it is fascinating and everyone should be aware of it. The next step, though, do I need to react to it? Our job is to explain to people that no, they don't. Jeremy Owens: Well, Josh, it's been fun revisiting all your discussions with MarketWatch and having yet another one. We look forward to what you can talk to us about in the future. Thanks so much for joining us. Josh Brown: Shout out to MarketWatch. You know I love you guys. Keep doing what you do. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for What We Are Watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. First, economic data. Gross domestic product or GDP, one of the most crucial gauges we have on the growth of our economy, increased 2.8% in the third quarter. Now, that's a really strong reading, economists said. Even though a large trade deficit caused the number to misestimate slightly. Economist Claudia Sahm, who spoke with OnWatch recently, said the report really was good news. But that is far from the only report we'll be watching this week. The October jobs report is coming Friday, and it's an important one. Check marketwatch.com for live coverage. And then there's AI and tech earnings where results have been choppier. On the good side, there's Google, which saw a big increase in cloud revenue as customers rent AI capable workloads. Chief Executive, Sundar Pichai, said that a quarter of all coding at Google is now being performed by AI, but the weight of big expectations is being felt by others, like AMD. The NVIDIA rival posted record revenue and forecast another record quarter, but it wasn't enough for investors who were expecting a bigger guide for the fourth quarter. Shares were pounded Wednesday. In addition, Apple's AI features, Apple Intelligence, debuted with some negative reviews around the internet this week. Apple will report earnings this afternoon, along with Amazon, and we'll be back next week to discuss all we learned about big tech. And a bit of news about the show, with a thanks to you, this podcast won a gold medal for Best New Podcast from the Signal Awards this week.

The firm launched the iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF (TOPT) this month. It doesn't just hold the Magnificent Seven — Apple, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. It's made up of the 20 largest U.S. stocks by market capitalization. "What the iShares build ETFs are designed to do is to deliver a tool kit of simple solutions for investors to be able to capture the growth of some of the largest companies within the U.S. equity market today, but to do so in a broader and more diversified manner," BlackRock's Rachel Aguirre told CNBC's "ETF Edge" on Monday. Aguirre, the firm's head of U.S. iShares product, noted the ETF's mission is to deliver an easy and accessible way to tap into the innovation of megacaps – "whether that be in the tech-heavy Nasdaq space or, more broadly, within the S&P [500]." The ETF, according to Aguirre, provides a way for investors worried about the concentration of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the S&P 500. On Thursday, the Magnificent Seven slid more than 3.5% as a group — losing around $615 billion in market cap. That's equivalent to the size of JPMorgan Chase. However, the Magnificent Seven is still up about 43% so far year while the S&P 500 is up around 20% "It's important for clients and investors to remember that there are split views on this topic. There are many investors who believe that the big will get bigger [and] that the winners will continue to win," Aguirre said. "There's also another side to this argument. There are many investors who believe that it's actually a very worrisome time to continue investing in… mega-cap companies because of just their high valuations." The iShares Top 20 U.S. Stocks ETF is down 2% since its Oct. 23 launch. Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: JD Vance to Joe Rogan: Amnesty Will End Democracy
URL: https://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2024/10/31/jd-vance-to-joe-rogan-amnesty-will-end-democracy/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T22:12:39Z
Full Content:
An establishment amnesty for the roughly 25 million illegal migrants in the United States would “end democracy,” and convert the U.S. into a one-party state like California, JD Vance, Donald Trump’s hand-picked running mate, told host Joe Rogan on Thursday. “I’m a Reagan guy, right?” Vance said in his three-hour interview with Joe Rogan, adding: I’m a conservative Republican. But [President Ronald] Reagan screwed up a lot … People don’t talk nearly enough about the amnesty thing … Because of what Ronald Reagan did in the 1986 amnesty, California is now effectively a permanently blue state. “The entire country becomes that” if Democrats push through an amnesty, Vance added. But mass migration imposes huge costs on Americans, even without an amnesty, he said. Even when migrants do not hold citizenship, they get a share of representation in Congress, Vance said: For example, the state of Ohio lost a congressional seat in the last census [in 2020 so] states that have high illegal immigrant populations picked up congressional seats. So you’re actually taking away congressional representation from American citizens and giving it to illegal aliens. Even if you don’t give them the right to vote, you’re still destroying the voting power [of citizens]. Immigration also imposes massive civic and economic burdens on Americans’ communities, Vance said: You see this in some communities — because they’re small towns, and because rapid migrant influxes can happen very quickly — here the town population has been doubled. You don’t even have to assume people are criminals …[but] what does it do to the local public school when all of a sudden 1,000 [migrants] show up that don’t even speak English, right? What does it do to the [town’s] hospital system when you now have thousands of people … that are showing up to get emergency services because they don’t have access otherwise to a doctor, and now the American citizens have to wait in line for seven hours to get to see a doctor because we’ve overwhelmed the local hospital system? What does it do to housing prices? We’ve seen this in a number of communities, including those that I represent in Ohio. When you bring in thousands and thousands of people, you cannot build enough houses quickly enough to accommodate that. So the cost of housing becomes unaffordable for American citizens. Those costs are largely ignored by the national media, which mostly hire pro-migration reporters– including many immigrants — to cover migration dramas. “It is the craziest thing that we’ve seen in this country that you don’t even allow people to talk about the effects of mass migration anymore,” Vance said, adding: One of the reasons why Donald Trump is going to be elected president, or at least should be elected president, [is] because he is one of the few guys who’s saying, “You know what, we’re going to talk about this problem. Yes, some immigrants are good [and] some immigrants are not good.” That is an obvious insight to anybody who knows human nature. But it is money that drives the nation’s migration policy, Vance said. “I think what is obvious, and I’ve seen this in the halls of Congress,” he said, adding: I’ve seen it very explicitly. You talk about lobbying [in other political issues], and we obviously talked about [it] in the context of other industries. There is a massive corporate lobby for cheap labor in the United States of America. That is, I think, the main thing that’s going on. Let me tell you a story when I was in the private sector. I was at a business conference dinner, and I was seated next to the CEO of one of the largest hotel chains in America … The guy was going on and on about how much he hates Donald Trump. And I’m like, “Oh, that’s interesting, why do you hate Donald Trump so much?” Because, again, I was, I was sort of a Trump skeptic in 2015 and at this point, I was kind of starting to really get on the Trump train. And he said, “Well, the reason I hate Donald Trump … is because Donald Trump’s border policies have cut down the number of illegal immigrants. And because I can’t pay illegal immigrants under the table anymore, I have to pay American workers, and they want much higher wages.” I was like, “Holy shit! This guy just admitted what is straight-up, Monopoly Man evil shit. My wife, who’s very apolitical, was actually at the dinner with me, and she’s like, “Come again, you just said you don’t want Americans to get decent wages?” The best argument for Donald Trump’s immigration policy is that American workers are getting higher wages, and this is why this corporate CEO hates it. So whatever the industry is, you’ve got a lot of people who want cheap labor and they don’t want to pay American workers higher wages. That’s a big part of it. But Democrats also want to get political advantage from the inflow of poor migrants, Vance added: I do think there’s also a power dynamic to it. In particular, I think Kamala Harris and the Democrats, they want to give these millions upon millions of illegal aliens the right to vote. They want to legalize them. They want to make it easier for them to participate in our elections. And that means, fundamentally, the end of American democracy, because you’re talking about 25 million [illegal migrant] people here.

Breitbart News has closely tracked the impact of migration on Americans’ blue-collar and white-collar wages, their housing, and, increasingly, on Americans’ productivity. “We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued: But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations. Overall, since about 1990, the US. government has used an economic policy of Extraction Migration from poor countries to inflate the nation’s consumer economy with extra workers, consumers, and renters. That economic policy has helped grow the economy Congress helped investors to export much of the nation’s manufacturing economy to lower-wage countries.

And both are poised to continue seeing gains in the weeks to come thanks to geopolitical uncertainty, worries over the strength of the dollar, and the upcoming U.S. election, according to JP Morgan analysts. In a Thursday report, analysts at the bank said that a “debasement trade” is coming—which could further drive demand for both gold and Bitcoin and help push up prices. A Donald Trump victory next week in the U.S. presidential election increases the likelihood of such a trade, JP Morgan analysts said. A “debasement trade” is when traders try to hedge against weakening currencies, geopolitical headwinds, and government deficits. Gold is typically a good insurance policy against weakened fiat money; top asset manager BlackRock has also touted Bitcoin—so-called digital gold—as another asset to invest in during times of uncertainty. “Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the ‘debasement trade’ thus favoring both gold and Bitcoin,” the report read. Republican nominee Donald Trump not only has come out as the crypto-friendly candidate in the race, but his policy to increase tariffs could lead to more inflation and geopolitical tensions, the report noted. Ex-President Donald Trump used to be anti-crypto but has come out fiercely in favor of the industry this year. The real estate mogul said he wants all future Bitcoin to be mined in the U.S. and also launched a decentralized finance (DeFi) project running on Ethereum that plans to release its own stablecoin, Decrypt previously reported. Gold has this year hit new highs and Bitcoin is now just 5% off touching its March all-time high. The biggest digital coin is trading for $70,114, CoinGecko data shows, after nearly setting a new all-time high on Tuesday.

Business FILE PHOTO: People are seen in front of a showroom that hosts BlackRock in Davos, Switzerland Januar 22, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo BlackRock Inc. on Wednesday filed an application with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission seeking approval to create exchange-traded fund classes for its mutual funds. The asset management giant is the latest and by far the largest among more than 30 money managers that have made similar requests since a patent on the ETF share class structure held by Vanguard expired in May 2023. The SEC does not have a deadline to rule on those applications, and the agency so far has only allowed Vanguard to offer both exchange-traded shares and traditional units within the same mutual fund. Cboe Global Markets is hoping to push the SEC into ruling on the question, by seeking approval for a rule change that would permit it to list and trade ETF share classes. Regulators must respond to such rule-change requests within 240 days, which would fall toward the end of 2024. Dimensional Fund Advisors, one of the first funds to file for permission to offer its existing mutual funds in an ETF format last year, said it has so far received letters of support from several hundred financial advisers who collectively manage $3 trillion in investor assets.

Title: Bitcoin’s White Paper Turns 16: How BTC Went From An Abstract Idea To A Household Name On Wall Street

As you may already know, late October 2008 was an extremely ugly time in the world of finance and money. Most famously, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy, and the global economy was teetering into recession. Governments and central banks were scrambling to contain the cataclysm. On Oct. 31, 2008, the Bitcoin white paper came out — now 16 years ago to the day. “I’ve been working on a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party,” pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto famously stated in the opening sentence while sharing the groundbreaking Bitcoin white paper with a cryptography mailing list before linking the document entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” The document described the concept of the decentralized P2P cash, which Satoshi called Bitcoin (BTC). 16 years ago, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin's Whitepaper and the rest is history. pic.twitter.com/ilprfjzikW On Thursday, the foremost crypto slid below the $71,000 mark, now trading 4% below the current all-time high of $73,737 it reached in March 2024. Still, Bitcoin’s current value is well above the fraction of a penny where it first started trading — and its ardent believers who invested early are insanely wealthy because of it. In the early days, mainstream media painted Bitcoin as just a tool for criminals to launder funds, sell drugs, and conduct other nefarious activities. However, that narrative has continued to evolve. Bitcoin is now increasingly being adopted around the world by nation-states such as El Salvador, which adopted BTC as a legal tender in September 2021. Wall Street titans, including BlackRock (the world’s largest asset manager) and its peers, have since launched easy-to-trade spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, which have brought in a flood of investment into the apex crypto. These ETFs recently smashed the 1 million BTC holdings milestone, further underscoring Bitcoin’s evolution from a niche digital asset to a major financial asset. The Wall Street stockpile has grown by $24 billion worth of inflows since the products went live in January while nibbling away at the heels of Bitcoin’s founding father. Perhaps the most confounding thing about Bitcoin is its creator. Satoshi Nakamoto vanished completely from the internet in 2011 after releasing Bitcoin’s founding white paper a decade ago on Halloween in 2008. The conspiracy theories and clues as to who Satoshi really is are endless. For instance, an HBO documentary recently claimed that the elusive crypto creator was early Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, who has since refuted the claims — and many crypto community members have also criticized the film. Now, a British-Asian macroeconomist named Stephen Mollah, claimed that he is Satoshi at a London event Thursday. One way that Mollah can prove he is indeed Satoshi is by moving the BTC from the Genesis block. However, he said today that he would do that later. “Genesis block Bitcoin cannot be moved as simply as you think,” Mollah told a BBC journalist in the audience. “It can be moved, but I need to prepare for it. I’ll do it. Very soon.” The identity of Bitcoin’s creator continues to be one of the greatest mysteries in modern finance. For some Bitcoiners, however, the world is better off not knowing who he, she, or they were or is.

Title: The Philosophy of Volatility
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2024/10/31/the-philosophy-of-volatility-7/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T18:38:52Z

ERIC KIM Podcast A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Introducing BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL: ￼ Currently, my new direction in my life — obviously I’ll still be doing photography workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in life and passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft launch of BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in participating, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com To be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite money machine, you essentially leverage MSTR microstrategy stock, and then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Just download Coinbase to your iPhone, from the App Store, connected with your JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America checking account, and start buying bitcoins, you could just buy 10 bucks, 25 bucks, $100, $500, $1000, 10,000, $100,000, if you like. The good thing on Coinbase is that they recently increased the limit i’m a $50,000 a day in instant limit, to now doubling that to $100,000! Thank god. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million a bitcoin, the price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 a bitcoin, 200,000 a bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 a bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin!. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his two sons, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monetary fund, Jerome Powell and the FED, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, which backs their own fiat monetary supply? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually be worth something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin miners are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid, for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the hydro power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more efficient, because contrary to popular belief, bitcoin mining is less about electricity — it is more about computer efficiency. For example in the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into ASICs, ASIC computers, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality metaverse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo II, you know very well that gold is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing BAAL runs, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that BAAL would drop some sort of mythical item or weapon, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analogue energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin — nothing else is powered by proof of work and has a hard cap and supply. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum is Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Huawei, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a Huawei phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing YEEZY sneakers, with the newest iPhone Pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; they would prefer to live in and own property in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Culver City￼, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping mainland Chinese is capital controls– ￼ if you have $1 billion worth of Chinese yuan, you cannot take it out of the country even if you wanted to. Don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially pegged to the US dollar, and I think time has shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol and the international business language. As long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the tariffs, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, words weep. What does that means is China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ the rich Chinese oligarchs are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, likes to give fellatio to Karl Marx, is a fakeass woke plant based hippie, spends too much time on Reddit, and pirateBay, spent too much time torrenting and streaming Maria Ozawa pornography (on Google incognito, brave browser incognito), maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and they￼ watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

ERIC KIM Podcast Video Audio A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset.

If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea.

People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin miners are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid, for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the hydro power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more efficient, because contrary to popular belief, bitcoin mining is less about electricity — it is more about computer efficiency. For example in the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into ASICs, ASIC computers, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality metaverse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo II, you know very well that gold is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing BAAL runs, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that BAAL would drop some sort of mythical item or weapon, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analogue energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin — nothing else is powered by proof of work and has a hard cap and supply. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum is Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Huawei, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a Huawei phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing YEEZY sneakers, with the newest iPhone Pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; they would prefer to live in and own property in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, Calabasas, Beverly Hills, Culver City￼, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping mainland Chinese is capital controls– ￼ if you have $1 billion worth of Chinese yuan, you cannot take it out of the country even if you wanted to. Don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially pegged to the US dollar, and I think time has shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol and the international business language. As long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the tariffs, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, words weep. What does that means is China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ the rich Chinese oligarchs are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, likes to give fellatio to Karl Marx, is a fakeass woke plant based hippie, spends too much time on Reddit, and pirateBay, spent too much time torrenting and streaming Maria Ozawa pornography (on Google incognito, brave browser incognito), maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and they￼ watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

ERIC KIM A super super interesting thought on my mind is the quote from Michael Saylor, volatility is vitality. What does that mean, why does it matter etc.? First, typically when we think of volatility, it is in the financial realm. We think of volatility in the context of something going up and down, almost unpredictably, chaotically, crazily. For example in the markets, we tend to think of volatility like a bad thing. Because most people cannot stomach the up and downs. I am an interesting case because obviously I’m affected by it too. Yet now, whenever I see volatility, I’m more annoyed than anything, like the days that bitcoins down, or the days that microstrategy stock is a little bit down, it is almost more like having an annoying mosquito bite, Maybe even a tiny splinter than anything. The good thing with mosquito bites is as time goes on, we know that it will fade, although it is very annoying. Also, with the tiny splinter… Super super annoying to pick it out, but you can! So besides Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually think that nuclear power is a super smart idea. Certainly nobody wants nuclear fallout, but come on… It is year 2024. For a while, me and Seneca were playing with SimCity: cities of the future on the Mac, and also, we watched the cities of the future film on IMAX and also 3-D, at the California science center. It is still kind of bizarre to me… Once again, the year 2024, if I think about the film Elysium, produced by Bill Block, and starring Matt Damon, shouldn’t we kind of be living in this futuristic, cyberpunk, or massively green and beautiful bright future? Not kind of this ugly, slumlord vibes we get from watching a film like Snowpiercer? Anyways, about two or three days ago I was curious why bitcoin spiked so high, breaking the mythical $70,000 mark, after about 2 to 4 years of languishing. So I searched it on ChatGPT, and randomly saw that because Elon Musk tweeted it? And then I was curious, and then I kind of went down a rabbit hole, checking Elon Musk Twitter, Seeing now how he endorses Donald Trump, and then seeing the tweed video the retweeted video of the Joe Rogan podcast with Donald Trump. Anyways, I was watching the interview, I watched about half of it, very fun and interesting and entertaining! One of the interesting things is how Joe Rogan was asking Trump about nuclear. So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Introducing BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL: ￼ Currently, my new direction in my life — obviously I’ll still be doing photography workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in life and passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft launch of BLACK EAGLE CAPITAL, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in participating, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com To be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite money machine, you essentially leverage MSTR microstrategy stock, and then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Just download Coinbase to your iPhone, from the App Store, connected with your JP Morgan Chase or Bank of America checking account, and start buying bitcoins, you could just buy 10 bucks, 25 bucks, $100, $500, $1000, 10,000, $100,000, if you like. The good thing on Coinbase is that they recently increased the limit i’m a $50,000 a day in instant limit, to now doubling that to $100,000! Thank god. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million a bitcoin, the price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 a bitcoin, 200,000 a bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 a bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin!. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his two sons, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monetary fund, Jerome Powell and the FED, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, which backs their own fiat monetary supply? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually be worth something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin miners are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid, for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the hydro power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more efficient, because contrary to popular belief, bitcoin mining is less about electricity — it is more about computer efficiency. For example in the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into ASICs, ASIC computers, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything.

Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing BAAL runs, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that BAAL would drop some sort of mythical item or weapon, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analogue energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin — nothing else is powered by proof of work and has a hard cap and supply.

They might be single, they might not be, maybe own a dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

So to me nuclear is interesting because it is insanely high volatility like it has a lot of power. But if done right, if handled quickly, it is essential you produce practically free energy for everybody! Apparently they do it well in France I think, they just create a bunch of these mini nuclear power plants, And the French citizens benefit? I think about 99% stoicism is good, come on, I named my firstborn son after Seneca the younger, the great stoic sage! Yet where stoicism fails, I call this “the life after stoicism”, is that Stoicism is too focused on hardening yourself into like a porcupine, and then eventually, it makes you unemotional or unfeeling etc. Yet what if you want to embrace this interesting strategy; put on the stoic armor, in which you don’t really suffer any downsides from life, but you could harness the volatility of life, and channel harness and reap the benefits of the upside? Stoicism is not volatile enough. Certainly we want Stoicism to clip and hedge the downsides of life, but, you want at least 200X upside in life! So kind of an interesting thing I learned from Seneca, kids in general etc.; Seneca is about 3 1/2, and when he is angry or upset about something, he’ll get angry, he’ll throw stuff, stop his feet, put out a lot of high energy, start screaming and yelling, and shouting, but when we just let him get it out of his system, like for 30 seconds or a minute or so, he’ll kind of forget about it, and then start smiling again, and then being happy and proceeding like usual. Because Seneca is like happy and joyful and silly and playful and curious Like 99.999% of the time. Anyways, I almost wonder if this is a better strategy for adults as well. I think where adults fail is that we try to be good proper and prim, I don’t know if this is like Victorian Quaker Christian ethics, we try to restrain our anger, we don’t raise our voices we don’t yell we don’t scream, we don’t throw stuff, we are told to become modest, go on a walk etc. But I almost wonder if it was a good idea that adults we also would just let our our￼ anger and fury as well like kids — for example if we’re angry, to just yell shot scream, stump our feet, go outside, throw around the sandbag, go to the park and take some big heavy rocks and throw them into the distance etc. Also as a funny sidenote, go on YouTube or Google and search ERIC KIM rock toss challenge, in which during Covid when all the gyms were shut down I would just go to the nearby park, find the biggest rock or Boulder I could, and just practice throwing it around etc. It might be the best workout of all time! Anyways, the issue with adults is that when we’re angry or upset about something, we’re holding our emotions, yet we harbor this anger and resentment, this Poison, for weeks days months years decades? Even one of my uncles, considering that my grandfather had an illegitimate wife and about five or six kids all illegitimate kids on the other side, essentially ditching my mom‘s mom, and the 4 to 5 legitimate kids, ￼anyways, apparently one of my uncles is still super super upset about this, even many years after the passing of my grandfather, my uncle saying that after getting drunk “I have no father”, referring to my already deceased grandpa. I get it, but I almost feel like it doesn’t really matter anymore. Don’t people gotta move on? Yeah yeah yeah, life is tough, life is sad whatever, but, I once read that resentment and anger is like drinking poison, hoping that the other person dies. No not only is this kind of not a good strategy, it is ineffective but also foolish. For example, imagine like you’re a warrior, like you’re Achilles, or Hector, and you’re about to do the final battle. You got your spear and shield, your battle armor on. Obviously the goal is to throw your spear and kill the other guy, not to take your spear and stab yourself in spite of your enemy, hoping that somehow spearing yourself will damage the other person? Even a more sick thing, a parent, who is frustrated with their child, not sure what to do, starts to literally beat themselves, like hitting themselves or self flagellating themselves, causing themselves some sort of self-made pain, to make the younger child feel bad? To me this is almost the most sick evil thing to do of all time because when your kid and your parent beats you, at least you could feel bad and think that your parent is a bad guy. But if your parent beats themself to spite you… You have no one else to but by yourself? ￼ Never spite nobody! The early Christian fathers, a lot of them kind of unwell people, we kind of do a similar thing, self flagellate themselves for their sins whatever, as a form of repentance or something? But the reason why this is so sick and weird, is that once again, by hurting or damaging or poisoning yourself, you ain’t doing nothing useful. Like for example, let us say that you did something bad or whatever, and then boom now your parents are dead or somebody you care about is dead or whatever, and then you get super depressed and you start to drink alcohol, smoke a bunch of weed, do a bunch of drugs, simply to alleviate your pain your distress your suffering. Or you start to self yourself, you start to physically beat yourself. Now once again, this is not productive at all. So just watching the recent microstrategy earnings call, go Michael! I also like Andrew Kang and Phong Le (both I presume our Korean and Vietnamese, just like me, Seneca, and Cindy!) ￼ Anyways, what do you notice what super interesting was that what is so fascinating about microstrategy, it is like literally the best performing company in stock in the known human universe, is that it is also the most volatile. Whereas a typical asset might have a volatility of five, The volatility of micro strategy often exceeds 50. Volatility is vitality, the motto of Michael Saylor. So then I guess the tricky thing, the philosophy behind things: “Would you prefer to have higher volatility for greater yield and performance?” Or would you rather have low or no volatility, and just take boring steady gains, but far inferior gains and yields? ￼For me, I think 100% obvious strategy is to have higher performance, with even greater and higher volatility. Because at the end of the day, it is probably more interesting to drive a high volatility performance vehicle, like a Lamborghini, which has more power powers and “flexiness” rather than a boring and reliable Toyota Camry? Yet what a lot of fools do is they just park their money in some sort of blended S&P 500 derivative, because they don’t know what else to do? Michael Saylor said his personal imperative with bitcoin, is that he believes that at least 50% of the world‘s problems and issues can be solved by fixing the money. He likens traditional money and capital as being toxic; would you give your healthy four year-old child contaminated sewer water to drink, or would you give them clean water? Or, would you take the temperature of your home, which is a cozy 73°, and turn down the thermostat by 1°, every single day, for 10 years? Obviously not, you will literally kill and freeze your family to death. ￼ ￼ I think the genius of a Michael Saylor is that he studied history of science at MIT, and also aeronautics and aerospace engineering. ￼So I was curious about the word volatility, and apparently it just is derived from Latin to fly, initially from the Proto into European to throw. So certainly flying is good. I would not want to go to Seoul South Korea on a boat. Also, thinking about French colonialism, I have no idea how the French would be able to stand the boat ride from Paris all the way over to Saigon; or even worse, Thinking about Australia, the original penal colony, how in the hell did you take a boat from London all the way to Australia? Anyways, the volatility of flying, certainly flying can be dangerous, you hear the reports about the new Boeing jets, exploding or whatever. Yet nobody gives up flying. Or let us say the dangers of driving an automobile car. Certainly there are lots of dangers associated with driving, like fatalities from car related accidents, now texting while driving, it is literally a life or that situation. You are 1 trillion times more likely to die from a car accident rather than any sort of accident resulting from a terrorist attack, or a gun related fatality. If in fact, everyone is talking about why guns are bad and so evil and how we should ban guns or whatever. Yet nobody is talking about how we should be texting while driving, or even ban the use of a cell phone while you are in an automobile car. If anything, if Apple really wanted to say millions of lives, I have a simple thought: by default if you buy a new phone or whatever, a new Apple ID or whatever, there should be a workflow which if it detects that you’re driving really really fast in the car, it automatically locks you out of your phone, into the do not disturb driving mode, and that if you want to access the normal mode, assuming you’re a passenger in an Uber or Tesla Robo taxi, then you could voice dictate or type I am not driving. Or “I am a passenger”. Anyways, volatility is good. I almost wonder if volatility, voltage is the same thing? You step up and you step down there’s transformers for electricity. And this is what allows high-powered electricity to travel from phone wires, silently into your home, powering your washer and dryer your heater and air conditioning whatever. Yet nobody is trying to ban electricity. Bitcoin is up 507% percent over 4 years since 2020, MSTR is up 1989% since then — 5x, 19x (20x) gain since 2020 So also, a curious thing… Why is it that I have never met a female day trader? Or a female bitcoin investor? I’ve met lots of day traders, all male, some guys at the gym at the local park whatever. It is pretty common to meet day traders who drive Uber on the side or whatever. I haven’t really met any bitcoin investors in the flesh yet, besides myself. And certainly I have never met any women who are interested in bitcoin. It is too volatile for them. It is also too volatile for most men. Yet a simple filter, I think that for the general part, women hate volatility, most men also hate volatility but some men like myself, love volatility. Question; are there any women who love volatility? I guess the ideas that you have sex with the rockstar, and you have the boring accountant husband at home, paying the mortgage or whatever, but it seems that most women, would not want to be in a serious financial relationship with a Starbucks barista playing music on the side. Anyways, maybe what life is then, is the love of volatility. ￼￼ So this is where things get super interesting; how can we reap the benefits of the upside, like gain 150% upside in life, while clipping the downside? So for example, the microstrategy strategy is super super fascinating;: capturing 150% the performance of bitcoin and the upside, without the downside? So how do they do this? Simply put they have access to permanent bitcoin capital. Funny enough they are dubbing themselves BTC, bitcoin treasury company, I like to just think of micro strategy as their first bitcoin bank (BB), because it is easier for mere mortals like myself to remember, but anyways, what is super fascinating about microstrategy, is because they have been in business for over 30 years, they are a real company, that first started off selling business intelligence software, and now transitioning into becoming the world‘s first 100% bitcoin company, which is effectively unstoppable at this point; even if Apple somehow bought $1 trillion worth of bitcoin, because the operating structure of Apple computer is still revolving around future projections of selling more future iPhones, Apple can never really really ever become 100% bitcoin, even if I wanted to. Oh and also as a random sidenote, I think in December, there might be discussions that Microsoft might actually start to add bitcoin to her balance sheet. This is worth noting, especially because starting January 2025, the new FASB (fasb.org) financial accounting standards board, GAAP generally accepted accounting principles — essentially companies institutions like Harvard and Yale and Brown can now add bitcoin to their balance sheet, as a treasury reserve asset. The reason why this is a big deal is for so long, bitcoin was considered fake money, and that a company could not add it to her balance sheet, proving proof of funds and reserves in the traditional sense. Now, all of these nerds who become accounting will have to learn all of these new rules, figuring out how to integrate bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets to accounting principles. The reason why this is such a big deal is that once again, people still think that bitcoin is fake money! Yet look at the Janet Yellen talk on Satoshi, and even look at Larry Fink, CEO of blackrock who owns over $10 trillion worth of assets, Larry Fink even now says that bitcoin is legitimate asset class, and I think that black rock has actually recently invested and bought a bunch more micro strategy stock. ￼Watch the CNBC interview with Larry Fink on Bitcoin. Oh and also, a pro tip; definitely get the $20 a month ChatGPT pro, it is now the ultimate financial investment research tool; when you want to search any financials or anything, this is an insanely big deal. ￼Anyways, once Harvard Yale and Ivy League schools start to purchase bitcoin, or maybe even there investors, the ones that handle the endowment start to purchase microstrategy, which is essentially a conduit for purchasing bitcoin, with indirect exposure to the asset class of bitcoin, ￼this will be a big deal￼. If UCLA were smart, she would purchase BTC and Bitcoin and or microstrategy, not real estate. So this is a very big idea. Obviously the goal in life is to win, even Michael Saylor said at the end of October 30 micro strategy earnings call, that essentially, under a bitcoin strategy, everybody wins, there are no losers in the bitcoin strategy. Only varying degrees of success. ￼ Philosophically, this is fantastic. Why? To me the idea that we could all win together, 100%, no losers, isn’t this the ultimate thing? For example, I still think that the number 1 foolish way that most individuals live is that they think of life like zero sum; they think that your success means my failure, that your big dick means my small dick. But this makes no sense because money is fake, money ain’t real, it is just a man-made construct. So if somehow you have $1 million in the bank, that doesn’t make my balance any smaller or bigger. I suppose the thing that is a little bit tricky under the bitcoin standard is that because there is a hard cap of 21 million bitcoins, the ultimate strategy is indeed to own the most bitcoin at the end of the day. And this is still where I think the strategy, is to use microstrategy as a cash yield generation machine, periodically selling microstrategy stock when it is up to purchase more bitcoin, is still the best strategy. MSTR Microstrategy as the engine in order to accumulate more Bitcoin? MSTR -> BTC Currently, my new direction and past life, obviously I’ll still be doing guitar workshops etc., as it is still my number one supreme in fine passion. Yet I’m thinking about offering more workshops in the bitcoin sphere, I think I am well adjusted to this because I have Stoicism, and control on my side. Also, I am currently doing a soft lunch of black eagle capital, essentially my bitcoin hedge fund, the name behind it is inspired by the fact that I believe in the ethos of black, black canvas, all black aesthetics, and eagle, Because I was a Boy Scout eagle, also the symbol of America. If you’re interested in doing a call, shoot me an email at eric@erickim.com. It’s actually to be transparent, the strategy is to create an infinite love machine, you essentially leverage micro strategy style, And then ultimately the goal is to accumulate more bitcoin. I encourage you to just open up your own Coinbase account, and start buying bitcoins. Buy it high buy it low buy it in the middle, because 30 years from now when bitcoin is worth $22 million of bitcoin, The price of what you paid right now won’t really matter. It won’t matter if you bought it at $100,000 of bitcoin, 200,000 of bitcoin, $75,000 bitcoin, or $50,000 bitcoin. Essentially starting next year will be year one of institutional acceptance. I am almost close to 100% certain that Donald Trump will be elected president, even me, I am a liberal Democrat on the left, and even me… I don’t think I’ll be voting for Kamala Harris. Vote orange, vote bitcoin. Even worth noting the Donald Trump talk at the bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville Tennessee, also note that Donald Trump his Tucson, Eric Trump and Baron Trump, I believe they’re actually really into bitcoin and crypto. Which is good for us, Because if you have a president that loves bitcoin crypto and also the US dollar, this will be very very good news for us Americans. And also, good for any holders of bitcoin on the planet. I also personally ethically believe that bitcoin can promote peace because it don’t matter what country you’re from, as long as you own bitcoin, we are all part of the same monetary network. I think bitcoin is a threat to the international monitor fund, Jerome Powell and the vet, which prints money like cotton candy. Even Donald Trump in his interview with Joe Rogan is talking about paying off the $35 trillion debt America has, and also Donald Trump says we will never sell our bitcoin. And also I would not be surprised if maybe, an interesting national strategy; a nation or a nation to purchase bitcoins, their Caranci? Like imagine if America owned 1 million bitcoins, or 2 million bitcoins whatever, and assuming that the US dollar was pegged to the bitcoin or back, then, the US dollar would actually reward something. People talk that bitcoin is bad for the environment whatever, this is not true. Because bitcoin minors are incentivized to produce bitcoin, at a low financial rate, it will flow into high yield energy sources like nuclear power plants, or electricity which is stranded on the edges of the grid,for example it is it is cheaper to purchase electricity by building your bitcoin mining rig somewhere in the mountains with access to a hydroelectric dam, where electricity would not be used￼ For example, if you could somehow capture the high ball and power of hydroelectric power, which is essentially free because it is powered by gravity, then, assuming that electricity is practically free in America, certainly this will be very good for bitcoin mining and bitcoin network. And also besides cheap electricity, or free electricity, There is actually a strong entrepreneur incentive to create computers which are more deficient, because country popularly, bitcoin mining is less about electricity it is more about computer efficiency. For example the early days bitcoin, a lot of bitcoin mining was done on graphics cards, card by Nvidia, then a transition into basic, ASIC, which is not really even a computer in the traditional sense. It cannot do anything besides Solve the mathematically intense cryptography puzzles, which is essentially the proof of work concept. Also, the reason why proof of work is the path, is that work, like things need to have a real world work in order for it to be worth anything. For example you do not want to live in your fake virtual reality meta-verse, With your fake virtual reality Lamborghini, having sex with your virtual reality girlfriend, with access to your virtual reality money. For anyone who played Diablo too, you know very well that goal is not worth anything in the universe of Diablo; everyone wants the rare weapons. Before there were hacks, this would mean that you as a kid, you have you would have to spend hours upon hours of doing bail rents, Trying to wait and cross your fingers that bail would drop some sort of mythical by Vince, for you to equip yourself. And as a kid, this required real work, which meant a lot of time sitting on your computer, clicking around, and investing countless hours of time which is work, to achieve this outcome. Bitcoin and crypto is the same thing; if there’s not real human labor or physical labor or analyze energy which goes into producing the digital asset, it is not worth it. This is why you should not purchase or invest in anything that is not bitcoin Nothing else is part by proof of work. And derivatives, don’t forget Ethereum was essentially a bitcoin copycat. Ethereum is not worth anything, don’t buy it, sell your Ethereum and buy bitcoin. The best analogy is that Ethereum Pepsi. Nobody likes Pepsi. The only reason anyone would drink Pepsi was because somebody gave it to them for free. Bitcoin is like Coca-Cola, it has always been the best and will always be the best or bitcoin is like the iPhone Pro, everyone wants the iPhone, nobody wants a Google pixel, nobody wants a Samsung. And certainly nobody wants a Jui, if you’re a smart rich Chinese billionaire, come on… You have zero interest in buying a phone besides supporting the Chinese communist party. If you are any Person with any sense, you would prefer to be wearing Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Balenciaga, wearing easy sneakers, with the newest iPhone pro, driving your Lamborghini Rolls-Royce whatever. You would not want to drive a Chinese car, a Chinese phone, or even send your kids to a Chinese university. You would rather want to send your kid to a Harvard Yale or Stanford, and even… No rich Chinese person actually wants to live in Beijing or Shanghai; property in Palo Alto,, Los Angeles, or maybe Vancouver. The only thing that is stopping is control don’t forget that the Chinese yuan is essentially to the US dollar, and I think time is shown that no no no, we are not going to be speaking in Mandarin. English is international protocol as long as the US, we have at least 1000 X military supremacy over China, we will be fine. And also, when Donald Trump becomes president, he is all about the terrorist, and he’s going to become antagonist towards China, which is good for us Americans because if you put a tariff on Chinese produced goods, money talks, work week. What does that means China will not do anything to promote war with America because￼ The rich Chinese all the guards are still dependent on manufacturing products in China, and selling it to the American market for a profit. Don’t be a dummy boy. Anyone who thinks that China is going to take over the planet is either anti-American, a communist, Likes to give fellatio to Carl Marx, is a fake woke plant based hippie, spent too much time on Reddit, and pirate Bay, spent too much time quarantine Maria Ozawa pornography, maybe they have an apple Vision Pro and the watch virtual reality pornography on their $4000 Apple Vision Pro in private. They might be single, they might not be, my own dog, they have no intention of having kids or girlfriends or a serious relationship. And also they don’t own bitcoin.

Title: Search BlackRock investment into MicroStrategy.

ERIC KIM As of recent updates, MicroStrategy and BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) hold significant Bitcoin reserves, although their rankings have fluctuated over time. MicroStrategy currently holds approximately 205,000 BTC, valued over $14 billion given recent price surges. BlackRock’s IBIT, launched in early 2024, quickly accumulated around 198,000 BTC, positioning it as a close competitor to MicroStrategy’s holdings. This competitive dynamic underscores a shift in the institutional approach to Bitcoin, with ETFs like IBIT offering a regulated, mainstream option for investors, while companies like MicroStrategy continue to expand their direct holdings. This highlights the growing adoption of Bitcoin in traditional financial products, pushing more institutions toward cryptocurrency exposure through structured financial instruments. For further details on recent acquisitions and strategy shifts, see sources like The Block and ETF.com. .. BlackRock recently expanded its investment in MicroStrategy, holding approximately 1.02 million shares, which accounts for a 7.5% stake as of early 2024. This marks a notable increase from their previous position, representing a significant institutional endorsement of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin-centric strategy. MicroStrategy, under CEO Michael Saylor, has strategically accumulated large Bitcoin reserves, which have appreciated significantly as Bitcoin’s institutional appeal grows. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) launched in early 2024 and has grown rapidly, surpassing MicroStrategy in Bitcoin holdings, with 196,088 BTC compared to MicroStrategy’s 193,000 BTC. This dynamic between MicroStrategy’s direct Bitcoin holdings and BlackRock’s ETF signals a shifting landscape, where institutional Bitcoin investments are increasingly facilitated through regulated products like ETFs. The competition underscores the increasing role of major financial institutions in the cryptocurrency space and the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as an institutional asset .

Spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $893 million Wednesday, per data from Farside Investors, pushing the funds' collective Bitcoin holdings to over 1 million BTC. The Wall Street trove has grown by $24.2 billion worth of inflows since the products were approved in January, while nipping away at the heels of crypto’s founding father. Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who vanished from the internet in 2011, still holds a whopping 1.1 million Bitcoin worth $79 billion at present. At the current rate that spot Bitcoin ETFs are sucking up coins, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas estimated that the crypto pioneer could be overtaken by the group of eleven Wall Street products in terms of holdings soon. “At this rate, they’ll pass Satoshi in less than two weeks,” Balchunas wrote on Twitter (aka X) Wednesday. He noted the “Joey Chestnut-level pace” that ETFs are eating up Bitcoin’s supply, referencing the champion competitive eater. The milestone was reached just short of the 16th anniversary for Bitcoin’s white paper. On Halloween in 2008, Bitcoin’s creator laid the blueprint for his now-preeminent “peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” publishing his nine-page thesis for Bitcoin’s design online. As Bitcoin tests an all-time high price of $73,737, set back in March, spot Bitcoin ETFs have had two of their best days on record. Representing spot Bitcoin ETFs’ fourth best day of inflows, $870 million worth of allocations on Tuesday were followed by Wednesday’s jump to $893 million. According to Bitwise Head of Research Ryan Rasmussen, institutional investors are leading the charge. While a first wave of inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs was driven by retail investors, wealth managers making investments on behalf of clients are currently catching up. Large institutions like Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo have lengthy due diligence and compliance processes, alongside investment committees that vet new types of investments a few times a year, he said. Those companies are now “unlocking their wealth managers,” Rasmussen said. “Even after ETFs make it through those different committees, [institutions] go through a process of educating their advisors on how to talk to clients about Bitcoin or new assets,” he added. “We saw signs of the second wave entering the market earlier this week.” Wednesday’s avalanche of allocations included a high watermark for BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). Some $872 million worth of Bitcoin flowed into the product Wednesday, per data from Farside, topping the asset manager’s previous daily peak of $849 million from March. Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF saw the second-largest inflows Wednesday at just $12.6 million, while Bitwise's BITB was the biggest loser with almost $24 million in outflows. BlackRock’s stunning Wednesday performance brought its ETF’s Bitcoin holdings to around 429,000, towering over the world’s largest corporate treasury reserve holder of Bitcoin, MicroStrategy, at 252,000 BTC. While MicroStrategy, the self-proclaimed Bitcoin development company, has institutional investors holding its shares, Rasmussen said that the BlackRock brand has ultimately proved more palatable among Wall Street’s wealth management crowd. “They trust BlackRock,” he said. “They can say, ‘Look, the largest institution in the world is backing Bitcoin in a big way,’ and so it's no longer this contrarian view in the way that it was.” Edited by Andrew Hayward Your gateway into the world of Web3 The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly. © A next-generation media company. 2024 Decrypt Media, Inc.

Title: Abu Dhabi firms to launch tokenized US Treasuries fund
URL: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/abu-dhabi-firms-launch-tokenized-us-treasuries-fund-4715786
Time Published: 2024-10-31T13:20:00Z
Full Content:
Business NEW YORK :Abu Dhabi firms Realize and Neovision Wealth Management have launched an investment vehicle that will buy units of exchange traded funds (ETFs) focused on U.S. Treasury bills and convert these assets into digital tokens that can be held, traded and transferred on a blockchain. The fund is called Realize T-BILLS Fund and it will buy BlackRock's iShares and State Street's SPDR, tokenize units from these ETFs, and incorporate them within the fund, Dominik Schiener, co-founder of technology company Realize, told Reuters in an interview. It hopes to grow to a $200-million fund. Realize will tokenize the units of the T-BILLS Fund, while Neovision will manage it. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Tokenized Treasuries are a growing segment of the crypto market, with a market capitalization of $2.4 billion on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum, according to data platform rwa.xyz. They are effectively digital tokens created on a blockchain and backed by U.S. government debt, and issued both by blockchain-native firms and traditional institutions, notably BlackRock and Franklin Templeton. In March, BlackRock launched its first tokenized fund called BUIDL on the Ethereum blockchain, investing 100 per cent of its assets in cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements or repos. The BlackRock fund has a current market cap of $530 million. FUND DETAILS The Realize fund, the first tokenized fund to be domiciled out of the Abu Dhabi Global Market, will issue the $RBILL token and will serve as the digital representation of the units of the fund. They will initially launch on both the IOTA and Ethereum blockchain networks. KEY QUOTES "The goal is to bring fungible assets onchain. T-Bills are the most liquid asset today in the real world," said Schiener. "They're also the best form of collateral, paying around 5 per cent." Dr. Ryan Lemand, co-founder and chief executive officer of Neovision, said it makes sense to buy T-Bill ETFs and tokenize them, instead of outright purchasing Treasury bills in the market. He noted buying cash Treasuries in the market would involve continuous transaction costs because they will have to be bought again and again.

Title: Race For Spot Solana ETF Heats Up As Yet Another Firm Files Application With SEC
URL: https://zycrypto.com/race-for-spot-solana-etf-heats-up-as-yet-another-firm-files-application-with-sec/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T13:09:35Z
Full Content:
Canary Capital Group, a new digital asset-focused investment firm created by former Valkyrie Funds co-founder Steven McClurg, has become the latest investment firm to apply for a Solana-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). Canary Capital joins a growing list of prestigious asset managers seeking to list a SOL ETF in the United States, including VanEck and 21Shares. Despite Bitcoin (BTC) ETF leader Blackrock opting out of the Solana ETF race, some other firms are not shying away from filing to introduce an investment vehicle that would give investors exposure to SOL without having to purchase and store the cryptocurrency themselves. According to an S-1 registration statement filed on Oct. 30, Canary Capital’s proposed spot SOL ETF would let traditional investors access the Solana market via brokerage accounts without the potential hurdles to entry or risks. It’s worth mentioning that Canary Capital recently submitted S-1s for a spot XRP ETF on Oct. 8 and then a spot Litecoin ETF just seven days later on Oct. 15. With its latest filing, the firm has not named the custodian and administrator for the SOL ETF, nor did it say what ticker symbol the fund would be listed under. SOL is currently the fifth-largest crypto on the market. The Solana blockchain is used for decentralized applications (dapps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and is home to a slew of meme coins. It’s considered a key competitor to Ethereum as it offers cost-effective and faster transactions. “Despite the hyper-competitive L1 and EVM landscape, Solana has emerged as a battle-tested front-runner for decentralized applications,” Canary wrote in the statement. “Solana’s robust DeFi ecosystem has led to strong sustained on-chain analytics as measured by transactions per day, active addresses, and new addresses, while maintaining a low fee environment for all consumers. Future growth in native on-chain stablecoin deployment will also likely further accelerate the commanding lead Solana maintains over its peers.” Solana has been considered the next digital asset to have a spot ETF greenlighted by the SEC, following Bitcoin and Ethereum approvals in January and July, respectively. Solana ETF anticipation has spurred huge investor attention since VanEck submitted paperwork to launch the VanEck Solana Trust in June 2024. 21Shares followed VanEck’s lead, filing with the SEC to debut its own spot Solana ETF. Asset manager Grayscale recently filed to convert a multi-asset fund into an ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, which features Solana exposure alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple’s XRP, and Avalanche. These filings suggest a rising confidence in Solana’s potential among institutional investors. Franklin Templeton is also eyeing a spot SOL ETF, though it has yet to file an application. In the SEC’s pending lawsuits against digital asset exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance, the agency claims that SOL satisfies the Howey Test, thus making it a security. Some industry insiders now think SOL ETFs have a near-zero chance of approval due to the SEC’s concerns over Solana’s classification as a security. However, others believe that with BTC and ETH ETFs already trading on U.S. exchanges, making a logical case to deny Solana the same product is a steep uphill battle for the regulator.

"We're not going to see interest rates as low as people are forecasting," Fink, who oversees BlackRock's $10 trillion in assets, said during a Bloomberg panel that was part of Saudi Arabia’s annual flagship investment conference, the Future Investment Initiative. Fink predicted just one Fed interest rate cut before 2025 against market expectations of two. "I think it’s fair to say we’re going to have at least a 25 (basis-point cut), but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we’ve ever seen," Fink warned. Last month, the Fed surprised traders with a 50 basis point cut to interest rates, kicking off a reduction cycle after interest rates were ramped up at a historical clip as lockdown-induced inflation threatened to spiral out of control. Expectations that interest rates will come down sharply this year have fueled a bitcoin price boom through 2024, with bitcoin and the wider crypto market bouncing back along with stock markets.

Meanwhile, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci has predicted the Fed will allow inflation to run hotter than it has previously to escape its "tremendous debt crisis"—with the bitcoin price soaring as a result. "There's a lot of people who think that the U.S. is about to enter into this tremendous debt crisis. And I believe that we're going to solve ... that and we're going to stop that from happening," Scaramucci told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. Scaramucci said he expects the bitcoin price to hit $170,000 by mid-2026, which would give bitcoin a market capitalization of around $3.3 trillion, due to bitcoin's "fixed limited supply, and what I think is very high demand." That demand has been boosted this year by the long-awaited arrival of a fleet of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Wall Street, led by BlackRock's bitcoin fund. On Wednesday, BlackRock's bitcoin ETF saw $872 million worth of net inflows, marking the fund’s largest inflow since its January launch and surpassing the previous record high on March 12. "The recent surge in BlackRock’s IBIT inflows is driven by several key factors, including central banks’ global shift towards reducing interest rates, which has boosted liquidity and made capital more accessible for investors," Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst of BTCMarkets, told The Block.

Vincent Phelan, the 98-year-old Dubliner who campaigned for the liberation of his son Bernard when Bernard was arbitrarily imprisoned in Iran, has died. Mr Phelan’s son Bernard was released from a six and-a-half year jail sentence in Iran in May this year, after an international campaign for his release spearheaded by his father Vincent, and assistance from the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Paris-based tourism consultant had been arrested in Mashhad in northeastern Iran and had been charged with offences related to sending information to a foreign state, which he denied. He suffered poor physical and mental health while in prison but in response to his father’s plea, he gave up a hunger strike. [ ‘I’ve enjoyed having a pint of Guinness, seeing family and friends, and Irish humour’Opens in new window ] Vincent Phelan lived to see his son go on to write a bestselling book, You Will Die in Prison (Ériu), which is named after a comment made by an Iranian Judge when Bernard refused to sign papers written in Persian, while in prison. Bernard and Vincent were received by President Michael D. Higgins at Áras an Uachtarain earlier this year. Vincent Phelan died on Wednesday at Belmont Nursing home in Stillorgan. He had previously lived with his wife and three children in the Dublin suburb of Blackrock.

Title: U.S. Not Out Of The Woods Yet When It Comes To Inflation, According To BlackRock CEO

Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock (Photographer: Tolga Akmen/EPA/Bloomberg) Wall Street is sounding the alarm about stubbornly high inflation and the likelihood of interest rates remaining elevated for an extended period. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, has notably predicted that the United States Federal Reserve's interest rate reductions will fall short of market expectations, challenging the prevailing optimism among investors, CNBC reported. “Today, I think we have governmental policies that are embedded inflationary, and, with that being said, we’re not gonna see interest rates as low as people are forecasting,” Fink said Tuesday at a panel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The CEO of BlackRock, which oversees more than $10 trillion in assets, anticipates a single interest rate cut by the close of 2024. This forecast diverges from the broader market consensus, which generally expects two rate reductions during the same period. “I think it’s fair to say we’re going to have at least a 25 (basis-point cut), but, that being said, I do believe we have greater embedded inflation in the world than we’ve ever seen,” Fink stated. At a separate panel discussion during the event, featuring top executives from major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, Carlyle, Morgan Stanley, Standard Chartered and State Street, the moderator posed a question about potential Federal Reserve actions. When asked to indicate by raising their hands if they believed the Fed would implement two more rate cuts this year, none of the CEOs present did so, according to CNBC. Wall Street business leaders tend to have a more cautious outlook on inflation's staying power. Their direct involvement in various sectors of the economy provides these executives with a distinctive insight into price trends, allowing them to gauge the persistence of inflation more acutely than those less directly engaged with market fluctuations. Although, analysts from JPMorgan and Fitch Ratings forecasted last month that the Fed would implement two more interest rate cuts by the end of 2024, with expectations for these reductions to extend into the following year. Additionally, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has expressed optimism that the Fed will reach its 2% inflation goal by 2025. "I do expect inflation to come down, and as we get into next year, I believe that inflation will go back to the Fed’s 2% target," Yellen stated in a June interview with Yahoo Finance. In September, the Fed took a major step by lowering its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points, bringing it down to a range of 4.75% to 5%. This substantial cut was the first reduction since March 2020, signaling a dramatic pivot from the central bank's prolonged campaign of rate hikes. The decision reflected the Fed's growing confidence in taming inflation and its renewed focus on supporting the job market. Pressure had mounted after the U.S. unemployment rate increased to 4.3% in July, marking its highest level since October 2021. Moreover, recent labor market data suggests a gradual "cooling" trend, despite unemployment remaining relatively low by historical standards. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey revealed on Tuesday a decrease in job openings, with 7.4 million unfilled jobs at the end of September, down from August's revised 7.86 million. This decline was particularly noticeable in sectors that have been driving job growth in recent years, such as healthcare, social assistance and government. The drop in job openings was more significant than economists anticipated, with FactSet estimates projecting around 7.9 million openings, CNN reported. This reduction in available positions suggests a normalization of the job market following the post-pandemic boom, potentially signaling a more balanced employment landscape. One Community.

Title: Crypto Boom: US Treasury Latest Report Reveals Major Expansion In These Key Sectors
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-boom-us-treasury-latest-report-reveals/
Time Published: 2024-10-31T09:30:30Z
Full Content:
In a recent report, the US Treasury Department detailed significant growth in key areas of the crypto ecosystem, emphasizing how this expansion has influenced demand for short-term Treasury bills (T-Bills), which are viewed as a safe investment backed by the US government’s credit. The Treasury report asserts that digital assets, while still emerging from a small base, have seen rapid growth. This expansion includes native cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as stablecoins. However, the department notes that despite the increased market activity, household and industry adoption of cryptocurrencies remains limited, primarily for investment purposes. Notably, the report states that the digital asset market cap remains relatively low compared to other financial and real assets. This growth has not appeared to detract from the demand for Treasuries, indicating that crypto assets have not yet “cannibalized” traditional safe-haven investments. The report highlights two primary tracks of interest in digital assets. Firstly, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value, often referred to as “digital gold,” in a decentralized finance (DeFi) context. Secondly, the report alleges that speculation has played a significant role in the growth of various digital tokens including stablecoins, as they have rapidly gained traction, appealing to investors looking for assets with stable, cash-like characteristics. The US Treasury further asserts that stablecoins have become integral to digital asset markets, with over 80% of all crypto transactions involving a stablecoin. The report estimates that approximately $120 billion in stablecoin collateral is directly invested in Treasuries, indicating a strong link between the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. Tokenization – the process of digitally representing assets on a blockchain – has also been identified as a transformative force in finance, particularly with the growth and adoption seen over the past year, with asset managers such as BlackRock investing in the sector via the Ethereum blockchain. The report outlines several benefits of tokenizing US Treasuries, including: improved clearing and settlement, enhanced transparency, increased accessibility, liquidity and innovation. While the potential benefits of tokenization are considerable, the Treasury report emphasizes the need for a cautious approach. The department explains that current financial stability risks remain low, given the relatively small size of the tokenized asset market. However, the report alleges that rapid growth and adoption in the tokenization sector could introduce “instability” if not managed properly. Finally, the report calls for a unified ledger or highly interoperable systems to streamline transactions and reduce inefficiencies. It also highlights the importance of a central authority, such as a central bank for the tokenization sector, in terms of regulatory compliance. At the time of writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market was trading at $72,790. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: BlackRock's Entry Into Crypto Matters More Than U.S. Election, QCP Capital's Darius Sit Says

Election 2024 coverage presented by HONG KONG — The winner of next week's U.S. presidential election doesn't really matter to Darius Sit, the chief investment officer of QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading firm. While there may be some short-term volatility in crypto markets depending on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris becomes the leader of the world's largest economy, what's more important is the broader integration of crypto, especially bitcoin (BTC), into American finance. For example, the widespread adoption of bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset-management firm, running the biggest. "The biggest change this year has been BlackRock," Sit said in an interview. "Suddenly we have bitcoin being distributed in BlackRock’s extensive network. Read more Consensus Hong Kong-related coverage here. "When you have [BlackRock CEO] Larry Fink on CNBC talking about how bitcoin is a store of value, that's when you know crypto has become a part of the American investing narrative," he said. "BlackRock has brought crypto from frontier to mainstream." Trump has made part of his election campaign ensuring that U.S. crypto rules are attractive to projects so they can stay onshore, which earned his crypto policy a rare endorsement from CoinDesk. Bettors on Polymarket give Trump a more than 60% chance of winning the election. One might wonder if a U.S. without a hostile Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led by Gary Gensler might raise concerns in jurisdictions like Hong Kong, which have courted American companies to set up shop in places where rules are more certain. It's not just East Asia. Earlier this year, QCP opened in Abu Dhabi, and Sit says he's a fan of the regulator's approach to crypto, explaining that the regulator there “didn’t see crypto as a carve-out of capital markets.” Instead, he said, Abu Dhabi views "digital assets as part of the capital market." Still, a rising tide lifts all ships. “Bitcoin becomes even more of a cornerstone asset if Trump comes in and has more friendly policies,” Sit said, arguing that U.S. growth would likely fuel global opportunities rather than stifle them. Bitcoin is currently trading above $72,000, up 19% from a month earlier, according to CoinDesk Indices data, coming close to challenging its all-time high.

Title: Swiggy IPO gets bids of $15 billion from big investors like Norges, Fidelity, sources say

By Aditya Kalra and Indranil Sarkar NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Big investors including Norway's sovereign wealth fund Norges and Fidelity have placed bids worth more than $15 billion in Swiggy's India IPO, 25 times the $605 million portion reserved for such investors, four sources told Reuters on Thursday. Swiggy, a SoftBank-backed Indian food and grocery delivery giant, will next week launch its $1.35 billion IPO that will be country's second-biggest stock offering this year. The bidding process is ongoing. After a recent correction in stock markets, the company has reduced its estimated valuation from the IPO to $11.3 billion, 25% less than an earlier estimation of $15 billion. Signalling growing interest in India's food delivery and "quick commerce" space - where goods are delivered in 10 minutes - the IPO anchor book reserved for big investors has already received bids worth more than $15 billion, said the sources, who declined to be named as the process is confidential. Top investors include Norway's sovereign wealth fund Norges Bank Investment Management, Fidelity International and U.S.-based Capital Group, said three of the sources. The fourth source said BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board are also among investors. None of the investors or Swiggy immediately responded to a request for comment. Research firm Datum Intelligence expects quick commerce sales in India to hit $6 billion this year, up from $100 million in 2020. Indian companies including Swiggy, main rival Zomato and billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance are betting big on the quick commerce concept as they jostle to deliver everything from milk to cosmetics to iPhones within minutes, outpacing peers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on delivery times.

Share this article BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF recorded $875 million in inflows on Oct. 30, marking its highest single-day inflow since its January launch, according to CoinGlass data. The latest figure surpasses the previous record of $849 million set on March 12 for the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). “Pretty apropos that the biggest daily inflow ever for $IBIT is what pushed the US spot ETFs over the 1 million bitcoin held mark,” said Bloomberg ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas. US ETFs acquired 12,418 Bitcoin on Oct. 30, with BlackRock holding 429,129 BTC, Grayscale maintaining 220,415 BTC, and Fidelity possessing 188,592 BTC. BlackRock’s ETF has reached $29.3 billion in assets, with nearly half of that accumulated in the past month. Share this article Sign in to your account Don’t have an account?

Title: BREAKING: Canary Capital Files For Spot Solana ETF

Time Published: 2024-10-30T21:41:36Z
Full Content:
Asset manager Canary Capital has officially filed for a spot Solana ETF in the United States, following in the footsteps of investment firm VanEck, which introduced its own application four months ago. The Solana ETF move was confirmed minutes ago by Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). Despite not having a live exchange-traded fund in the US, unlike established issuers such as BlackRock, Fidelity and Grayscale, Canary Capital’s filing signals its continued intent to enter the crypto ETF space following the significant uptake seen in recent months. The asset manager, based in Sydney and established in 2017, has been proactive in pursuing a variety of crypto-related ETFs. As previously reported by Bitcoinist, just weeks ago, it submitted similar S-1 form applications for XRP and Litecoin ETFs. This move comes as in January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a series of Bitcoin ETFs, marking a major milestone for crypto investment products in the country. The approval of 12 Bitcoin funds was followed by the green light for Ethereum-based ETFs in July, further legitimizing the cryptocurrency market. Despite these advancements, the paths for cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana, and Litecoin remain fraught with uncertainty due to ongoing debates about their classifications as either securities or commodities—a critical factor in the SEC’s approval process. It is yet to be seen whether additional investment firms will pursue similar spot Solana ETF applications or wait for clearer regulatory guidance, especially in light of the upcoming US presidential election. The current contrasting positions of pro-Bitcoin candidate Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris could influence the trajectory of cryptocurrency regulations, potentially affecting the approval process for these ETFs in the upcoming year. At the time of writing, SOL trades at $175. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Matt Mullenweg talks about Automattic’s staffing issues and financials at TechCrunch Disrupt

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us WordPress co-creator and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg talked about his fight with WP Engine, Automattic’s staffing issues, and the company’s financials at TechCrunch Disrupt on Wednesday. Mullenweg repeated a lot of stuff from the past month about the trademark fight, WP Engine not contributing to the community, and misleading customers to believe it was associated with WordPress.com. If you need a refresher on the WordPress community drama, we have an article that will help you catch up. He said the company was short-staffed after the exodus of 159 employees, who took a six-month severance offer earlier that month. Since then, Automattic has been aggressively hiring and had already recruited 26 people this month. Mullenweg said that the second offer — which had nine months of severance and lost access to WordPress.org as part of the package — was designed to catch a leaker within the company giving out confidential information. He added that the company had to ask others who took the offer to stay until the next year as they were short-staffed. Talking about trademark issues, Mullenweg said in the initial days of Automattic, he gave the WordPress Foundation the WordPress trademark as investors were in control of Automattic. While the foundation still owns the trademark, Automattic has the exclusive license to use it commercially. Plus, Mullenweg said he has 84% of vote control at the company. When asked about what the other WordPress Foundation board members think about this battle, he said they are incredibly supportive and referred to the minutes of the meetings published on the foundation site — the post doesn’t mention anything about the trademark. Automattic CEO also talked about the legal battle with WP Engine and said that it might take a few years to resolve it. “Estimates I have heard from Neil [Katyal, the lawyer representing Automattic] in the case and others is that worst case scenario, if we lose everything, it would be kind of happening in 2026 or 2027,” he said. Earlier this year, Blackrock, one of the investors in Automattic, marked down their investment to almost half the value from the time they bought the shares in 2021. While Mullenweg didn’t directly address that markdown, he said the company generates around half a billion dollars in annual revenue, running at “break even or better,” and hiring aggressively. “We haven’t raised any primary capital and have no plans to,” Mullenweg said. Talking about the possibility of a WordPress fork because of ongoing tension in the community, Mullenweg said that would be fantastic. “There might be a fork. I mean, we’ve had WordPress forks before — probably about three or four times in the history [of WordPress]. That’s one of the beautiful things about open source is that there can be a fork,” he said.

Title: Bloomberg Analyst Attributes Surging Bitcoin ETF Inflows to FOMO Frenzy
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bloomberg-analyst-attributes-surging-bitcoin-etf-inflows-to-fomo-frenzy/
Time Published: 2024-10-30T19:06:07Z
Full Content:
Spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have performed well in recent weeks, with consecutive inflows attributed to the recent surge in Bitcoin prices. At press time, these ETFs had $72.55 billion in net assets, equivalent to 5% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. On October 29, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF had its best day in terms of trading volumes in six months after recording $3.3 billion in value traded. During the day, the IBIT ETF posted $642M in inflows. The other Bitcoin ETFs also saw positive flows, apart from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which had $17M in outflows. Fidelity and Bitwise saw $133M and $52M inflows, respectively, while VanEck and Ark Invest posted $16M and $12M inflows. The total inflows by the US spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $870M, marking the highest inflows since June. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas, the spike in volumes for BlackRock’s IBIT ETF was “a bit odd” given the slight gains in Bitcoin prices, Therefore, the high volumes could be a result of “FOMO-ing frenzy.” “IBIT is not alone – although by far the most – as all the main BTC ETFs saw elevated volumes in the past two days. If this is a FOMO Frenzy, we’ll see it show up in the flows next few nights,” Balchunas said. The inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs have made these products hit a crucial milestone. Following Tuesday’s massive trading volumes, these products have 995,663 coins. These ETFs are now inching closer to surpassing the total assets held by the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto holds 1.1M Bitcoin, and if these inflows continue, the products could cross the 1M mark by the end of the week. Balchunas noted that the Bitcoin ETFs had a “legit shot” of surpassing Satoshi’s holdings by the end of November. The BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has also surpassed another milestone after hitting $30 billion in assets after the recent inflows following the recent price surge. The analyst stated that the product reached the $30 billion mark in under 300 days, marking a record high. Data from the IBIT website shows that the product holds around 417,000 coins, making it one of the largest Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin traded at $71,953 at press time after a slight 0.7% gain in 24 hours. In the last seven days, Bitcoin has gained by around 8%.

The wider crypto market has been abuzz following Bitcoin’s recent impressive performance, which has resulted in the premier crypto getting precariously close to revisiting its current all-time high price. Crypto research firm 10X Research has suggested that Bitcoin’s price could trade at least $100,000 by January 2025. The Bitcoin price prediction comes as Bitcoin enjoyed a rapid march above the $73,000 level, nearing the March ATH during late trading on Tuesday, before retreating slightly today. Analysts foresee Bitcoin at $100,000 by early next year. According to 10x Research, the six-figure target for the leading cryptocurrency is based on its model that recently produced two buy signals, with the recent one being on Oct. 14. The analysts claim that their prediction model has a track record of around 87% accuracy based on the previous 15 signals. 10X Research explained the rationale for the upbeat Bitcoin projection: “When Bitcoin sets a new six-month high for the first time in 6 months like it did recently, we typically see a median return of 40% over the next 3 months.” Given the analysts’ calculations, a 40% growth from the current market price of $72,200 would propel Bitcoin above $100,000 by Jan. 27, 2025. Soaring demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which now nearly hold 1 million BTC in assets under management, indicates massive institutional interest. These ETFs, launched in January 2024, attracted approximately $4 billion in fresh investor money in October alone. Moreover, institutional investors like BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, now consider BTC a viable long-term investment or digital gold. “Gold has always been seen as a safe haven asset, so if Bitcoin is the new digital gold, it makes sense that institutions would be interested,” 10X Research asserted. Meanwhile, the researchers also forecasted that Republican Party frontrunner Donald Trump would win the United States presidential election next week, which could be a considerable boon for the crypto market. Trump, who is known for his U-turn on Bitcoin in recent years, has promised to make America “the crypto capital of the world”. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a hostile stance on crypto companies, prompting many in the industry to see the Democrats — who currently control the White House — as anti-crypto. The former president has also vowed to oust current SEC chair Gary Gensler on his first day of office. However, some pundits have maintained that the cryptosphere’s growth is inevitable regardless of who wins the election.
