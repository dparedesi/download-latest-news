The entire crypto market is on a down-drift after what seems to be a prolonged market correction, forcing Bitcoin down to $118,148 after a 0.40% slip over the past 24 hours. While there are multiple proposed reasons for the current market shift, one of them seems to connect to FTX’s payment plan set to come into effect in September. The now-defunct exchange will release another court-approved payment round of at least $1.9B through the same third-party entities: Kraken, Payoneer, and BitGo. This marks the third big payout in 2025 as part of FTX’s efforts to repay their creditors and redistribute $14.5B in damages. FTX’s upcoming payment could explain, at least in part, the current market shift by digging up the doubt and fear linked to the disgraced exchange, following Sam Bankman-Fried’s scam. An even bigger factor for the current market sentiment seems to be Bitcoin’s $86M in outflows, with BlackRock ($IBIT) and Fidelity ($FBTC) bearing most of the burden, with $142.48M and $227.24M respectively. Trader T is the bearer of bad news, keeping track of Bitcoin’s performance and highlighting the three consecutive days of consistent outflows. The outflows aren’t bad on their own, but their impact on the market is. Entities like Fidelity, for instance, may be forced to liquidate their Bitcoin holdings to cover the withdrawals, which could increase the sell pressure, amplify price volatility, and push market sentiment even lower. But what are the triggers behind this sudden market shift, given that FTX’s payment plan couldn’t account for it on its own? Several factors may contribute to the current market shift: However, while the market is on the back foot, it’s unlikely to backpedal for too long. The Fear and Greed Index is already telling half the story, with the community sentiment still borderline extremely greedy. Trader Tardigrade seems to nourish similar sentiments, stating that, based on the market’s performance, crypto is set to become the largest asset in the world. Another crypto analyst, Titan of Crypto, hints at a second Breakout coming, which would be the final hurdle before Altcoin Season 3.0. With the market winding for a coming rally, some assets may experience higher gains than others, especially those with blockchain utility and massive long-term potential. Snorter Token is one of them, introducing the Snorter Bot, the trading companion which snipes hot tokens milliseconds after liquidity appears. Snorter Token’s ($SNORT) Snorter Bot promises to become the most proficient coin hunter, thanks to its ease of use, integrated scam alerts, protecting against suspicious projects, and its appetite for hot and booming tokens. The Aardvark sniper is the perfect solution to manual coin hunting, which demands high technical knowledge and subjects you to potential scams like honeypots and rug pulls. The Bot operates in its Telegram chat-only, centralizing its activity in one place and rendering the need for multiple wallets, plug-ins, and browser extensions obsolete. You only need to instruct the Bot accordingly and watch it claim its victims milliseconds after liquidity becomes available. This reaction time puts UIs like Raydium, Pump Fun, and Jupiter to shame. Based on these facts, Snorter Token is set to become one of the best meme coins on the market, following successful implementation and witnessing widespread adoption. The project is currently in presale, having accumulated over $2.3M with a token price of $0.0991. Given Snorter Bot’s roadmap and efficiency, we expect the project to witness growing success post launch. In that context, $SNORT could easily push to $0.94 shortly after its public listing. If you want to support the project and buy yourself some $SNORT, go to the presale page and place your order today. Despite the heavy Bitcoin outflows and the perceived market uncertainty, the bullish market sentiment seems to suggest that what we’re seeing is not recession, but rather market correction, following the recent generalized rally. We expect Bitcoin to push again soon, once it clears the psychological threshold of $120K, at which point projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) will also steam up.

Title: Inside Private Equity’s $29 Trillion Retirement Savings Grab
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/07/24/private-equitys-29-trillion-retirement-savings-opportunity-under-trump/

ByHank Tucker andSergei Klebnikov ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff andSergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. Jack Bogle became a legend by popularizing low-cost passive index funds at the Vanguard Group, which he founded in 1975 after spending the first 23 years of his career at Wellington Management. “Don’t look for the needle in the haystack. Just buy the haystack,” he famously mused. That philosophy—be the market, don’t try to beat it—spawned generations of index fund-loving, buy-and-hold “Bogleheads” who have made Vanguard into what it is today: a $10 trillion-in-assets mutual fund colossus serving more than 50 million individual customers. Over the same half-century, private equity was also growing into a more than $10 trillion-in-assets industry—in a very different way. This one was built on the promise of market-beating returns produced by managers demanding high fees: usually a percent of assets (typically 2% a year) and a hefty cut of profits (typically 20%). Plus they insisted on a long-term commitment of assets by their institutional investors, inclu­ding pension funds, college endowments and foundations. Vanguard, which Bogle set up to be owned by its investors, has produced a lot of prosperous retirees but zero money-manager billionaires. Private equity, with its profit share (known as carried interest), has minted dozens of them. Stephen Schwarzman, chairman, CEO and cofounder of Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity manager with more than $1 trillion in assets under management, is worth an estimated $50 billion. So it was a bit jarring, culturally and historically speaking, when Vanguard and Wellington announced in April that they had formed a “strategic alliance” with Blackstone to offer products for individual investors blending private and public market assets. Jarring but maybe not so surprising given that the heavyweights of private equity and retail distribution are now pairing off with an urgency that suggests they’re desperate to avoid missing out on the next big moneymaking opportunity: getting into Americans’ 401(k)s and IRAs, which hold $29 trillion in assets. And the Trump administration aims to help them. In February, Boston’s State Street Investment Management, which created the exchange-traded-fund business back in 1993, kicked off the action by offering the first ETF with a mix of public and private debt, with the latter sourced from private equity giant Apollo Global ($785 billion under management). Then, a couple months later, State Street announced the launch of an “Index Plus” retirement target date fund series—90% index funds with a 10% kicker of Apollo private market assets. In May, Empower, a top player in the market for small-company 401(k)s, said it’s working with Apollo, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs and others to offer retirement savers collective investment trusts containing a mix of private equity, private credit and real estate. And in July, Voya Financial, another big 401(k) player, announced it was teaming up with private credit’s Blue Owl Capital on a new series of blended products. There’s no mystery why private asset mana­gers are keen to play. After years of beating public stock markets, private equity’s average annual return has lagged stocks by more than three points over the last three years (see “Turn of Fortunes”). A slowdown of exit deals has led to a glut of aging assets in private equity funds. New funds raised by the industry have plunged 39% since 2021 as clients have fewer payouts to reinvest and some college endowments and pension funds are free­zing or even reducing their private asset allocations (see “A Slowing Spigot”). Private asset managers have been gathering money from high-net-worth individuals for more than a decade. Until now, though, they haven’t cracked regular investors’ $29 trillion retirement nest egg—$12 trillion in defined contribution workplace plans like 401(k)s and $17 trillion sitting in individual retirement accounts. That’s now changing. Crucially, President Joe Biden’s Department of Labor threw cold water on private assets in 401(k)s, but President Donald Trump is reportedly close to signing an executive order specifically encouraging alternative assets in the accounts. The mutual fund and retail distribution companies see a win here too. Their margins have shrunk as competition and the share of money in low-cost index funds have grown. A private-assets kicker is a new way to differentiate their offerings and charge higher fees. Ordinary investors? They may or may not be winners. More options are almost always a good thing, but they need to be careful of higher fees and less liquidity. Plus, assessing the performance of these new hybrid private products will be difficult. In an interview with Forbes in June 2017, a year and a half before his death at 89, Bogle wasn’t giving any ground. “The idea of making money for the funds’ shareholders is counter-opposed to the idea of making money for fund managers,” he declared. Wellington Management CEO Jean Hynes, ensconced in an office on the top floor of a 31-story tower overlooking Boston Harbor, likes the long view: The 56-year-old has spent her entire career at the firm. She was raised in the Boston suburb of Milton as one of six children born to Irish immigrants—her father was a bricklayer—who believed, she says, in investing through their children; they spent their money sending them to Catholic school and college. Hynes wound up at Wellesley College, where she majored in economics and interned for a local stockbroker. After graduating in 1991, she was hired by Wellington as an administrative assistant. Her detailed notes at morning investing meetings impressed the late Ed Owens, who managed the Vanguard Health Care Fund to a 16.4% average annual return over 28 years before retiring in 2012. Hynes became his research assistant, protégé and, eventually, a fund manager herself. “It was a match made in heaven from day one,” she says. “He’s probably one of the top 25 investors of all time, and that’s who I learned from and worked with for 20 years.” After winning the CEO job in 2021, Hynes got some advice from health care chiefs she knew. Merck’s Ken Frazier (now retired) told her that of all the decisions he made daily as CEO, only four really mattered. The lesson: Get the big swings right. Hynes sees the alliance with Blackstone as one of those big decisions. She ticks off the trends she has seen—actively managed equity, an explosion of fixed income, the dominance of index funds and, now, alternative investments. And she makes a credible case for why Main Street investors might want to get into private assets. “If you look holistically at the economy, 20 years ago the average person who invested and bought mutual funds could invest in the whole economy. And that’s not true today,” she says. “You have a whole part of the economy that is only for the institutional investor, and that’s all the private companies.... It’s fair that more individuals have access to that.” While Wellington has always been an active manager, it is deeply intertwined with Vanguard’s low-cost passive investing DNA. The relationship dates to Bogle’s firing as Wellington’s CEO in 1974 during a brutal bear market. A boardroom fight and peace treaty eventually left him in charge of a new company (Vanguard) that would administer funds, while Wellington controlled investment management and distribution. Bogle told Forbes in 2017 that he launched low-cost index funds and direct-to-consumer sales in part because it allowed him to do an end run around Wellington by claiming there was no money management or distribution involved. A half-century later, Wellington is still the largest external advisor for Vanguard’s actively managed funds. The Vanguard Wellington Fund, the nation’s oldest balanced mutual fund (two-thirds stocks, one-third bonds) has returned an average of 8.3% annually since inception in 1929. It charges a modest 0.25% of assets and has $115 billion in assets. While Wellington has dabbled in private markets for a decade, they still amount to only $9 billion of the $1.2 trillion in assets it manages, less than 0.8%. So last year, when Hynes was ready for her big swing, Wellington approached Blackstone about teaming up. “We’ve never thought that we would be good at buyouts, taking a company private and managing a company and fixing it. That’s not our skill set,” says Wellington managing partner Terry Burgess, who supervises the team tasked with steering the alliance’s funds. Its first product, the WVB All Markets Fund, is a closed-end “interval fund”—meaning it will offer quarterly redemptions to investors for liquidity and could be the centerpiece of a diversified portfolio. Public stocks (from Vanguard funds and direct Wellington investments) will be 40% to 60% of assets; bonds (through actively managed Vanguard funds) will be 15% to 30%; and private Blackstone funds will make up 25% to 40%. Wellington will determine exactly how assets are allocated. The preliminary prospectus leaves the door open for exposure to private equity, credit, real estate and privately owned infrastructure. It doesn’t specify what the management fee will be, but it will be on top of the fees in the underlying funds. If the overall fund is down in value due to a decline in the public markets, Wellington will reimburse it for Blackstone’s performance fees—that way, retail investors sitting on losses from WVB wouldn’t get whacked with a stiff performance fee regardless. The WVB Fund will be marketed first to wealthy clients through financial advisors and family offices. But all eyes are on the 401(k) prize. “Do I think over time, privates will start to serve more of a role when it comes to target date funds? I do,” says Vanguard president and chief investment officer Greg Davis, noting that the timing will depend on how comfortable plan sponsors (meaning employers) are with adding higher-cost products to their offerings. It’s notable that across the industry, the new private asset–tinged investments are being sold first to accounts managed by financial advisors and to target date funds, which are managed by investment pros, with allocations based on a saver’s expected (i.e., target) retirement date. “It’s a simple equation,” Vanguard founder Jack Bogle told Forbes in 2017. “Gross return minus costs equals net return, which is a universal principle in investing that I put to work after a long struggle.” Target dates are an obvious entry point for two reasons. First, they’re growing like crazy. Thanks to Congress and regulators, millions of workers are being automatically enrolled in 401(k)s, with their contributions (and employer matches) funneled into target dates by default. According to Morningstar, over the last 15 years, assets in these funds have grown at an astounding 30% annual compound rate and now amount to $4 trillion. Vanguard controls 37% of the target date market, more than double the share of its nearest competitor, Fidelity Investments. The second reason is that professional management of target dates blunts the criticism that average investors won’t be able to judge the performance of hard-to-value private assets. “I think over time, just like there are Morningstar ratings of all sorts of public mutual funds, when you look out five, ten years from now, all these funds are going to be ranked based on performance,” says Jonathan Gray, Blackstone’s president and chief operating officer. “That is critically important.” Private equity pioneer KKR launched in 1976 with cash from an insurance company and wealthy backers. But by 1978, it had money from Oregon’s public pension plans, and others soon followed. Today, public pensions allocate an average 23% of assets to alternative investments, the National Association of State Retirement Administrators reports. College endowments began piling aboard after David Swensen took over Yale’s endowment in 1985 and bolstered returns by diversifying into private assets. Today, endowments allocate an average 26% of assets to private markets, accor­ding to Cambridge Associates. Harvard has 39% in private equity; Princeton has 41%. Now some of these traditional sources are pulling back. As America’s richest colleges face deep federal funding cuts and a federal tax as high as 8% (up from 1.4%) on endowment income, Yale, Harvard and others are said to be selling private equity investments on the secondary market. The University of California system is cutting back on its target allocation for private investments in its endowments and pension funds, even as it is working with State Street to make private assets available in employees’ retirement savings plans. Traditional pension plans, particularly private ones, are diminishing in relative importance as employers shift the retirement burden to workers. Back in 2000, traditional pensions—public and private combined—held roughly the same $5 trillion as 401(k)s and IRAs. Now it’s $12 trillion and $29 trillion, respectively, according to the Investment Company Institute. Private asset managers have been wooing financial advisors and their wealthy clients with perpetual capital funds, which often allow up to 5% of investors to cash out each quarter. An early example was the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, launched in 2017. It now has $53 billion in net assets. Blackstone Private Credit Fund, launched in 2021, has $72 billion. All told, Blackstone manages $270 billion from individuals, and this market is growing with a boost from cloud-based platforms for investment advisors. Example: BlackRock, which manages $12.5 trillion in assets, recently teamed up with fintechs GeoWealth and iCapital to create model portfolios holding both private and public assets. Joan Solotar, Blackstone’s head of global private wealth, says most individual investors in private markets have $5 million or more in investable assets, but those with at least $1 million are now being actively targeted. “It’s still quite early for investors below a million dollars,” she adds. Except when it comes to 401(k)s and target date funds. This does not come without risk. In a recent report, Moody’s laid out a series of worries about the push to put private assets into ordinary Americans’ portfolios. A big one is that Main Street investors, used to quick access to their cash, will create liquidity risks. “These fund structures haven’t really been tested extensively at periods of market stress,” says Alexandra Aspioti, a Moody’s senior private credit analyst. “Retail investors tend to be more sensitive to market volatility and increase redemption requests during periods of stress—this in turn can lead to further volatility.” Another worry Moody’s describes: All those extra dollars sloshing around will encourage private asset managers to make dumber deals, particularly in credit. The credit risk is real and growing. Private lenders face fewer regulatory requirements than traditional banks, which is largely why they financed 77% of private equity buyouts last year, according to Preqin. Private loans don’t trade and are valued only quarterly, with estimates that are often well off the mark. The International Monetary Fund warned last year that private lenders’ connections to private equity-backed companies could allow systemic problems to go undetected for too long. As for retail investors and liquidity risk, there have already been scares. Blackstone had to limit redemption requests in its real estate income trust in late 2022 and most of 2023 when individuals spooked by rising interest rates raced for the exits. The market rebounded, and Blackstone is back to honoring 100% of repurchase requests, but there’s little assurance that a similar situation won’t result in a future crash. Another concern: As exit deals from private equity funds have slowed, a fast-growing secondary market, including so-called continuation funds, has emerged, with a record $160 billion in transaction volume in 2024. With continuation funds, asset managers in essence are using new investors’ money to pay off old ones. Orlando Bravo, cofounder and managing partner of $184 billion (assets) Thoma Bravo, has cautioned that in this financial game of musical chairs, retail investors who are late to the party might get saddled with continuation funds with underperforming, hard-to-sell assets. Wellington’s Burgess promises that individual investors in the Wellington-Vanguard-Blackstone product will have access to the same private funds as Blackstone’s institutional clients—not the rejects. And he insists that the proposed fund will be able to withstand waves of withdrawal requests. “There’s 70% of it that’s public, and that’s a really big buffer to make sure you can maintain your liquidity profile,” he says. “We’ve tested it in [severe] down markets, and it’s gone to a level that’s still below what we would consider to be a pain point.” Then there are the objections raised by the Biden administration: that private assets might be too expensive and complex for 401(k)s. “These products are harder to understand and harder to value—it’s very different from looking at individual stocks traded on the public market or mutual funds,” says Lisa Gomez, who served under Biden as the Department of Labor’s assistant secretary for employee benefits security. But private asset managers are betting that the Trump administration will dismiss such worries and are hoping it—and the Republican Congress—will provide some protection from worker lawsuits for employers who offer the new products in their 401(k)s. That could further line the pockets of the wealthiest people in finance. It also could be great for individual investors, who will no longer be locked out of the type of lucrative private investments that have made the nation’s colleges and pension plans so rich for so long. With so much information soon to be available at their fingertips, retail investors might prove to be smarter than Wall Street thinks. They need to keep an eye on fees, and there is risk, for sure. But blue-chip financials like Blackstone, Vanguard and Wellington are going to be extra-careful not to saddle retirement savers with lousy private investments, thereby damaging their brands. Other outfits might be less cautious—caveat emptor—but democratizing investing is well worth the attendant dangers.

Title: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Is Outsourcing More of His Office’s Work to Costly Private Lawyers

Despite having an office with hundreds of attorneys, Ken Paxton frequently opts to hire private lawyers. One cost taxpayers more than $24,000 in one day.

Sign up for ProPublica’s Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox as soon as they are published. Also, sign up for The Brief, our daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. One day in late May 2024, lawyer Zina Bash spent 6 1/2 hours working on a case against Facebook parent company Meta on behalf of the state of Texas. She reviewed draft legal filings. She participated in a court-ordered mediation session and then discussed the outcome with state Attorney General Ken Paxton. In her previous job as senior counsel on Paxton’s leadership team, that labor would have cost Texas taxpayers $641. But Bash had moved to private practice. Paxton hired her firm to work on the Meta case, allowing her to bill $3,780 an hour, so that day of work will cost taxpayers $24,570. In the past five years, Paxton has grown increasingly reliant on pricey private lawyers to argue cases on behalf of the state, rather than the hundreds of attorneys who work within his office, an investigation by The Texas Tribune and ProPublica found. These are often attorneys, like Bash, with whom Paxton has personal or political ties. In addition to Bash, one such contract went to Tony Buzbee, the trial lawyer who successfully defended Paxton during his 2023 impeachment trial on corruption charges. Three other contracts went to firms whose senior attorneys have donated to Paxton’s political campaigns. Despite these connections and what experts say are potential conflicts of interest, Paxton does not appear to have recused himself from the selection process. Although he is not required to by law, this raises a concern about appearing improper, experts who study attorneys general said. Paxton appears to have also outsourced cases more frequently than his predecessors, available records show. And he’s inked the kind of contingent-fee contracts, in which firms receive a share of a settlement if they win, far more often than the attorneys general in other large states, including California, New York and Pennsylvania. Since 2015, the New York and California attorneys general have awarded zero contingent-fee contracts; Pennsylvania’s has signed one. During that period, Paxton’s office approved 13. One of those was with Bash’s firm, Chicago-based Keller Postman, at the time known as Keller Lenkner, which she joined as partner in February 2021 after resigning from her job at the attorney general’s office. Paxton had signed a contract with the company two months earlier to investigate Google for deceptive business practices and violations of antitrust law. A little more than a year later, Bash’s firm won a state contract to work on the Meta litigation, alleging its facial recognition software violated Texans’ privacy. This time, Bash was the co-lead counsel. Meta, which called the lawsuit meritless, settled the case for $1.4 billion in the summer of 2024. It was a windfall for Keller Postman. The firm billed $97 million, the largest fee charged by outside counsel under Paxton’s tenure. Bash’s work alone accounted for $3.6 million of that total. This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Bash, a former U.S. Supreme Court clerk, said in a statement she is honored the attorney general’s office partnered with Keller Postman based on the firm’s “first-rate attorneys and extensive experience.” “We have a record of taking on the most significant litigation in the country against the most powerful defendants in the world,” Bash said. Keller Postman did not respond to a request for comment. There is little to stop Paxton, or any other occupant of his office, from handing these contracts out. The attorney general can award them without seeking bids from other law firms or asking anyone’s permission. Asked to provide competitive-bid documents for the contingent-fee contracts it has awarded, the attorney general’s office said it had none because state law “exempts the OAG from having to do all of the solicitation steps when hiring outside counsel.” Given the high-profile nature of representing an attorney general and the potential for a big payday, many qualified firms would be eager to compete for this work, said Paul Nolette, a professor of political science at Marquette University who studies attorneys general. “I’d be curious to know what the justification is for this not going on the open market,” Nolette said. Paxton declined interview requests for this story. He has publicly defended the practice of hiring outside law firms, arguing that his office lacks the resources in-house to take on massive corporations like tech companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers. “These parties have practically unlimited resources that would swamp most legal teams and delay effective enforcement,” Paxton told the Senate finance committee during a budget hearing in January. A spokesperson for Paxton said in a statement that the outside lawyers hired by the office are some of the best in the nation. With the contingent-fee settlements to date, more than $2 billion, the state “could not have gotten a better return on its investment,” the statement said. Chris Toth, former executive director of the National Association of Attorneys General, questioned why so much extra help is needed. Outside counsel is appropriate for small states, he said, that “only have so many lawyers with so many levels of expertise.” The Texas attorney general’s office, one of the largest in the country, has more than 700 attorneys. “Large states typically don’t hire outside counsel,” Toth said. “They should have the people in-house that should be able to go toe-to-toe with the best attorneys that are out there.” When a Texas attorney general previously made a practice of giving lucrative contracts to private counsel, it didn’t end well. Dan Morales was the last Democrat to hold the office. He became embroiled in scandal after he used outside firms to help secure a $17 billion settlement in Big Tobacco litigation in 1998. Republicans, including then-Gov. George W. Bush, blasted the $3.2 billion payout to the outside lawyers as exorbitant. Their attacks grew more intense when Morales sought to steer $500 million of that sum to a lawyer, a personal friend, who did very little work on the case. Morales pleaded guilty in 2003 to related federal corruption charges. He served 3 1/2 years behind bars. John Cornyn, the Republican who succeeded Morales in 1999, criticized his predecessor’s handling of the tobacco case during his campaign for the office. In an interview for this story, Cornyn said he never hired outside counsel as attorney general because he focused on recruiting talented in-house lawyers that he felt could handle all the office’s cases. Paxton is challenging Cornyn, now a four-term U.S. senator, in next year’s Republican primary. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican who led the office after Cornyn, appears to have rarely used private lawyers. The attorney general’s office was able to produce records for only part of Abbott’s 12-year term because state law allows the files to be deleted after so many years. The office signed nine outside counsel contracts between 2010 and 2014, all pro bono or for hourly rates rather than contingency. Abbott did not respond to an interview request. Paxton also seldom outsourced cases during his first five years in office. Through 2019, he awarded only nine outside counsel contracts, all pro bono or hourly rate. The most expensive contract capped fees at $500,000 — far less than $143 million the state paid to the two firms, including Bash’s, that handled the Meta case. He changed course in 2020. That summer, the attorney general’s office was gearing up to file its first case against Google. It related to allegations that the company monopolized the online advertising market, raising costs for advertisers, who increased the price of their products for average consumers as a result. Paxton initially had no plans to hire outside counsel for the litigation, three former deputy attorneys general told the Tribune and ProPublica. But before the case was filed, the attorney general’s office was thrown into upheaval. At the end of September, seven of Paxton’s senior advisers reported him to the FBI, concerned his relationship with an Austin real estate investor had crossed the line into bribery and corruption. State House members would later impeach Paxton on counts related to the accusations; state senators eventually acquitted him. The federal criminal investigation into Paxton did not result in any criminal charges. Over fall 2020, each of the lawyers in his office who had accused Paxton of wrongdoing quit or was fired. That included Darren McCarty, the head of civil litigation who was supposed to lead the Google litigation before he reported his boss to the FBI. He resigned on Oct. 26. Less than two months later, on Dec. 16, Paxton signed contracts with The Lanier Law Firm and Keller Postman to investigate Google. They filed the lawsuit against the tech giant in federal court the same day. Paxton replaced the lawyers who complained to the authorities. The staffing of the antitrust and consumer protection divisions, which would have handled these cases, remained constant at more than 80 employees in the following years. Yet Paxton continued to outsource lawsuits against large corporations to private lawyers. Under Keller Postman’s contract, the firm would be paid only if it secured a settlement or won at trial. These contingent-fee cases have the potential to be far more profitable for the outside firms than those in which they bill at a regular hourly rate. In a successful case, the contracts say that firms are paid either a percentage of a settlement or the sum of hours billed by the firm times four, whichever is less. In the Meta case, Keller Postman was entitled to 11% of the state’s settlement, a share that totaled $154 million. But because the firm’s fees and expenses totaled $97 million, it billed that sum. In multiple legislative sessions, Paxton has testified that outsourcing was the only way his office could stand toe-to-toe with corporate titans. If Paxton has a shortage of qualified in-house attorneys, Cornyn told the newsrooms, that’s because of the damage the whistleblower scandal did to the reputation of the attorney general’s office as a home for ambitious young lawyers. “He’s a victim of his own malfeasance and mismanagement because people did not want to work for him anymore,” Cornyn said. “And if you run off your best lawyers because you engage in questionable ethical conduct, then you’re left with very few options. But this shouldn’t be a way to reward bad behavior.” Former Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard said he was surprised Paxton began hiring contingent-fee outside lawyers only after the scandal, since those contracts, with their potential for high profits, are tougher to ethically defend. “I would have thought it would have been the other way around — that he got more careful after he got the whistle blown on him,” said Goddard, a Democrat. “But it looked like he got more reckless.” Paxton’s style of procurement also benefited Buzbee, the man who successfully defended him during his impeachment trial, which stemmed from allegations the whistleblowers raised. The attorney general chose to skip most of the proceedings, so for the 10 days of trial in the Texas Senate, his most vociferous advocate was the loquacious Buzbee. The pair sat side by side when the attorney general did attend. A little more than a year later, Paxton hired The Buzbee Law Firm to pursue an antitrust suit against the investment firms BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard that accuses the companies of manipulating the coal market in a way that allegedly increased electricity prices for Texans. The firms deny wrongdoing. Buzbee is a successful litigator and one of Houston’s most famous plaintiffs’ attorneys. Among other victories, he won settlements for victims of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and $73 million for Gulf of Mexico oil drillers in a 2001 antitrust case. But he’s known primarily for personal injury work, not antitrust litigation. His firm, one of two hired for this latest attorney general’s office contingent-fee case, could collect 10% of any judgment or settlement. The case is in its early stages, though the Trump administration in May filed a brief in the case in support of Texas. Buzbee downplayed the potential for a big payday in an email to the newsrooms and argued there is no buddy system at play, noting he believed other law firms also interviewed with Paxton’s office for the job. (The attorney general’s office did not confirm this.) He said his firm has to pay for significant expenses up front, without any guarantee of payment. “The current arrangement may be a good deal for other lawyers, but in all candor, it’s not for me,” Buzbee said, adding that his normal hourly rate is $2,250. “Frankly, the only reason I’m even doing it is that I am proud to represent the state in such a landmark case.” The connections between Paxton and the lawyers he has hired also extend to other firms. The attorney general’s office hired the firm Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the largest in the country with more than 3,000 lawyers on staff, to work on separate Google cases for the state, focusing on consumer protection allegations. The attorney general’s office has awarded three contracts to the firm since 2022 for cases against the tech giant. Three times during that period, Joseph Graham, the firm’s lead counsel on the Google litigation, contributed $5,000 to Paxton’s campaign for attorney general. Twice, the donations came within 16 days of Graham signing one of the firm’s contracts with the attorney general. The firm and its attorneys have contributed $39,500 to Paxton’s campaign since he took office. Neither Graham nor Norton Rose Fulbright responded to requests for comment. Mark Lanier, founder of The Lanier Law Firm, which the state hired to work on a separate Google case, is a large donor to Texas elected officials. He has contributed $31,000 to Paxton’s campaigns since 2015. The largest contribution, for $25,000, came six months after Lanier signed his firm’s Google contract. The Lanier contract is slightly different from the others the attorney general’s office awarded, in that the firm’s payment is partially based on a basic hourly rate but it could also be paid more if it wins the case, as in the contingent-fee model. Lanier noted in an emailed statement to the newsrooms that he took a reduced fee on this case and maintained that the attorney general’s office needed the kind of firepower his team can bring against an opponent like Google. “The Texas AG office and its lawyers are good, but specialists are needed in a war like this. And it is a war,” Lanier wrote. “It would be irresponsible to pursue Google on behalf of Texans without bring[ing] the fullest resources you can.” A competitive, open process for awarding contracts can be a strong defense against accusations of favoritism, Goddard said. Unlike some other states, Texas does not require these contracts be put out to competitive bid. Florida, for example, has one of the most robust laws in the country for procuring outside counsel, requiring the attorney general to explain in writing why a contingent-fee contract is necessary. It also mandates most contracts be put out to competitive bid and caps contingent-fee payouts at $50 million. Texas has no such cap. It also has virtually no method for state lawmakers to truly supervise this kind of practice. State law mandates only that the attorney general notify the Legislature when his office awards a contingent-fee contract, and certify that no in-house lawyers or private attorneys at an hourly rate can handle the task. Paxton has done so in boilerplate two-page letters that all say outside attorneys are needed because of the “scope and enormity” of the cases. If lawmakers are concerned about these contracts, there is no mechanism for them to challenge Paxton’s determination that private counsel is needed. Having lawyers bid for work would eliminate the appearance of impropriety that hangs over Paxton’s hires, Goddard said. “A couple look like paybacks, which is extraordinarily improper, in other words to award a contract to someone who’s a major contributor or has recently left your office,” he said. “All of those would not be allowed in our state.” Officials in other states have said they can still secure big wins for their constituents without relying on private firms. California, for example, reached a $93 million settlement with Google in 2023 over claims that the company was clandestinely tracking users’ locations. A year earlier, in a case with similar allegations, Oregon and Nebraska led a 40-state coalition that won a $392 million settlement against the company. Texas was not part of this suit. The latter agreement required Google to make new privacy disclosures to consumers, restricted its ability to share users’ location information with advertisers and required the company to prepare an annual report detailing how it was complying with the settlement terms. Doug Peterson, the Republican attorney general of Nebraska at the time, said negotiating the financial penalty — Nebraska’s share was $11.9 million — was a secondary goal of the settlement. “The most important thing we’re trying to do is to stop the bad behavior,” Peterson said. McCarty, one of the attorney general employees who blew the whistle on Paxton, said private lawyers can be talented, but they have an incentive to fixate on the financial portion of settlements — which is tied to their compensation — rather than enforcement provisions that may best protect a state’s residents. “Government enforcers, especially in the antitrust context, can focus on more effective solutions,” McCarty said. Norton Rose Fulbright has yet to send its final billing records to the attorney general’s office but is likely to be rewarded handsomely. The firm helped the state secure a $1.38 billion settlement with Google in May. Google spokesperson José Castañeda said the Texas settlement, which has not been finalized, will contain no new restrictions on the company’s practices. Under the terms of its contracts, the firm’s fees could exceed $350 million.

Title: Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels

President Donald Trump participates in the Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Cohon University Center at Carnegie Mellon University on July 15, in Pittsburgh, Penn. Photo by The White House/Wikimedia Commons (Public domain) This story was originally published by Wired and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration AI IS “NOT my thing,” President Donald Trump admitted during a speech in Pittsburgh on Tuesday. However, the president said during his remarks at the Energy and Innovation Summit, his advisers had told him just how important energy was to the future of AI. “You need double the electric of what we have right now, and maybe even more than that,” Trump said, recalling a conversation with “David”—most likely White House AI czar David Sacks, a panelist at the summit. “I said, what, are you kidding? That's double the electric that we have. Take everything we have and double it.” At the high-profile summit on Tuesday — where, in addition to Sacks, panelists and attendees included Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, Google president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat and ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods — companies announced $92 billion in investments across various energy and AI-related ventures. These are just the latest in recent breakneck rollouts in investment around AI and energy infrastructure. A day before the Pittsburgh meeting, Mark Zuckerberg shared on Threads that Meta would be building “titan clusters” of data centers to supercharge its AI efforts. The one closest to coming online, dubbed Prometheus, is located in Ohio and will be powered by onsite gas generation, SemiAnalysis reported last week. For an administration committed to advancing the future of fossil fuels, the location of the event was significant. Pennsylvania sits on the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, which supercharged Pennsylvania’s fracking boom in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The state is still the country’s second-most prolific natural gas producer. Pennsylvania-based natural gas had a big role at the summit: The CEO of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company EQT, Toby Rice — who dubs himself the “people’s champion of natural gas” — moderated one of the panels and sat onstage with the president during his speech. All this new demand from AI is welcome news for the natural gas industry in the US, the world’s top producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. Global gas markets have been facing a mounting supply glut for years. Following a warm winter last year, Morgan Stanley predicted gas supply could reach “multi-decade highs” over the next few years. A jolt of new demand — like the demand represented by massive data centers — could revitalize the industry and help drive prices back up. Natural gas from Pennsylvania and the Appalachian region, in particular, has faced market challenges both from ultra-cheap natural gas from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico as well as a lack of infrastructure to carry supply out of the region. These economic headwinds are “why the industry is doing their best to sort of create this drumbeat or this narrative around the need for AI data centers,” says Clark Williams-Derry, an energy finance analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. It appears to be working. Pipeline companies are already pitching new projects to truck gas from the northeast — responding, they say, to data center demand. The industry is finding a willing partner in the Trump administration. Since taking office, Trump has used AI as a lever to open up opportunities for fossil fuels, including a well-publicized effort to resuscitate coal in the name of more computing power. The summit, which was organized by Republican senator (and former hedge fund CEO) Dave McCormick, clearly reflected the administration’s priorities in this regard: No representatives from any wind or solar companies were present on any of the public panels. Tech companies, which have expressed an interest in using any and all cheap power available for AI and have quietly pushed back against some of the administration’s anti-renewables positions, aren’t necessarily on the same page as the Trump administration. Among the announcements made at the summit was a $3 billion investment in hydropower from Google. This demand isn’t necessarily driven by a big concern for the climate — many tech giants have walked back their climate commitments in recent years as their focus on AI has sharpened — but rather pure economics. Financial analyst Lazard said last month that installing utility-scale solar panels and batteries is still cheaper than building out natural gas plants, even without tax incentives. Gas infrastructure is also facing a global shortage that makes the timescales for setting up power generation vastly different. “The waiting list for a new turbine is five years,” Williams-Derry says. “If you want a new solar plant, you call China, you say, ‘I want more solar.’” Given the ideological split at the summit, things occasionally got a little awkward. On one panel, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, who headed up a fracking company before coming to the federal government, talked at length about how the Obama and Biden administrations were on an “energy crazy train,” scoffing at those administrations’ support for wind and solar. Speaking directly after Wright, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink admitted that solar would likely support dispatchable gas in powering AI. Incredibly, fellow panel member Woods, the ExxonMobil CEO, later paid some of the only lip service to the idea of drawing down emissions heard during the entire event. (Woods was touting the oil giant’s carbon capture and storage business.) Still, the hype train, for the most part, moved smoothly, with everyone agreeing on one thing: We’re going to need a lot of power, and soon. Blackstone CEO Jonathan Gray said that AI could help drive “40 or 50 percent more power usage over the next decade,” while Porat, of Google, mentioned some economists’ projections that AI could add $4 trillion to the US economy by 2030. It’s easy to find any variety of headlines or reports—often based on projections produced by private companies—projecting massive growth numbers for AI. “I view all of these projections with great skepticism,” says Jonathan Koomey, a computing researcher and consultant who has contributed to research around AI and power. “I don't think anyone has any idea, even a few years hence, how much electricity data centers are gonna use.” In February, Koomey coauthored a report for the Bipartisan Policy Center cautioning that improvements in AI efficiency and other developments in the technology make data center power load hard to predict. But there’s “a bunch of self-interested actors,” Koomey says, involved in the hype cycle around AI and power, including energy executives, utilities, consultants and AI companies. Koomey remembers the last time there was a hype bubble around electricity, fossil fuels and technology. In the late 1990s, a variety of sources, including investment banks, trade publications and experts testifying in front of Congress, began to spread hype around the growth of the internet, claiming that the internet could soon consume as much as half of US electricity. More coal-fired power, many of these sources argued, would be needed to support this massive expansion. (“Dig More Coal—The PCs Are Coming” was the headline of a 1999 Forbes article that Koomey cites as being particularly influential to shaping the hype.) The prediction never came to pass, as efficiency gains in tech helped drive down the internet’s energy needs; the initial projections were also based, Koomey says, on a variety of faulty calculations. Koomey says that he sees parallels between the late 1990s and the current craze around AI and energy. “People just need to understand the history and not fall for these self-interested narratives,” he says. There’s some signs that the AI-energy bubble may not be inflating as much as Big Tech thinks: in March, Microsoft quietly backed out of 2GW of data center leases, citing a decision to not support some training workloads from OpenAI. “It can both be true that there's growth in electricity use and there's a whole bunch of people hyping it way beyond what is likely to happen,” Koomey says. Geoffrey Pounder | July 24th 2025, 06:19 am Headline: "Trump and the energy industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels" Make that: "Trump and the fossil-fuel industry are eager to power AI with fossil fuels" It's wrong, misleading, and unhelpful to conflate the energy industry with fossil fuels. As if they are one and the same. The energy industry increasingly includes renewables like solar and wind. Other energy sources include hydro, nuclear, biofuels, etc. The fossil-fuel industry routinely conflates the two. They are not synonymous. Let's help ourselves, not the fossil-fuel industry.

Title: The Rise of Tokenisation: Stablecoins, big banks & the road ahead

Tokenisation has been a buzzword among crypto enthusiasts for years, promising to transform financial markets by moving assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate onto the blockchain. While regulatory support is growing, progress has been slower than expected. (Source: Reuters) Under President Trump’s administration, new laws have relaxed regulations around crypto. This has opened doors for faster development of tokenised financial assets and increased investor interest in the sector. Tokenisation involves converting traditional financial assets into blockchain-based tokens. These tokens represent the original asset and can be stored in crypto wallets or traded on blockchain platforms, just like cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins are tokenised versions of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar. They’re pegged 1:1 with real assets and allow cross-border transfers outside traditional banking. While they face criticism for enabling illicit finance, they also serve populations with weak financial infrastructure. Stablecoins are booming, with the market worth around $256 billion and projected to reach $2 trillion by 2028. However, tokenised stocks, bonds, and other assets still lack scale and secondary market liquidity. Despite years of hype, tokenised assets face hurdles. Many banks are developing private blockchains that aren’t interoperable, limiting trading. Without public secondary markets, these tokens remain stuck in early-stage trials. Proponents say tokenisation improves liquidity for hard-to-trade assets like real estate and lowers entry barriers for retail investors. It could create fractional ownership opportunities and democratize access to complex asset classes. Major institutions like Bank of America, Citi, and BlackRock are exploring tokenisation. Coinbase is seeking approval to offer tokenised equities, signalling growing institutional confidence in this space. New U.S. laws such as the Clarity Act aim to provide a defined legal framework for stablecoins and other tokens. These rules are expected to boost adoption and reduce legal uncertainty around tokenised assets. Despite optimism, risks remain. Critics warn of potential systemic vulnerabilities, especially without audits and strong oversight. The ECB has flagged stablecoins as threats to financial stability, and regulators insist that tokenised securities must still comply with existing laws.

Title: Retail Investors Want In—Just As Private Equity Industry Resets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriemccabe/2025/07/24/retail-investors-want-in-just-as-private-equity-industry-resets/
Time Published: 2025-07-24T07:30:00Z

ByCarrie McCabe ByCarrie McCabe, Contributor. Private Equity Retail investors are increasingly eager to access private equity (“PE”), drawn by the promise of higher returns and diversification. With public markets dominated by a narrow set of tech-driven mega-cap stocks, the appeal of uncorrelated, long-term private market exposure is growing. According to the American Investment Council’s 2025 public pension study, private equity delivered a median annualized return of 13.5% over the 10-year period ending in 2024. It was also the best-performing asset class in public pension portfolios—outpacing public equity, real estate, and fixed income. To date, retail investors have had limited access to burgeoning private assets, an immense marketplace. Private assets, including PE, have tripled in size since 2013 and are projected to reach $65 trillion globally by 2034, according to Bain. And more than 1,500 global startups now carry unicorn valuations, as companies stay private longer. Retail interest is being reinforced by a shift in policy. Congress is weighing legislation to allow defined contribution retirement plans—including 401(k)s—to access private equity. A new executive order is expected to clarify fiduciary protections for plan sponsors, particularly around fees and valuation concerns. However, retail’s arrival comes just as the private equity model is undergoing a profound transition. For much of the past decade, PE thrived on cheap debt, rising valuations, and global dealmaking. That model is under pressure. “Performance levers that were pulled to such great effect during the low-rate era—principally financial leverage and valuation expansion—will lose potency,” notes Future Standard in their recent private markets outlook. Rather today, with borrowing costs higher and valuations compressed, managers must create value through margin expansion, pricing power, and operational efficiency. Meanwhile, the macro backdrop isn’t helping. Current US policies have clouded the M&A environment, where valuation is often negatively correlated to volatility. And timely exits, which underpin PE’s return profile, are becoming harder to achieve. Distributions as a share of net asset value have fallen to just 11%—the lowest in over a decade. And PitchBook estimates there are over 12,000 U.S. PE-backed companies in inventory—enough to last seven or eight years at the current exit pace. Even elite investors are adjusting to this new PE environment. Yale University, long an advocate of PE, is reportedly seeking to sell up to $6 billion in private equity holdings to manage liquidity constraints. As institutional fundraising slows, Wall Street is turning to retail. BlackRock recently launched a target-date fund including private equity and credit, backed by $30 billion in acquisitions to expand its private markets platforms. Certainly, private equity remains a powerful investment engine, but it’s evolving. While institutional investors are equipped to navigate illiquidity, fees, and valuation opacity, the average retail investor may not be. Products reaching individual investors often lack the access or pricing advantages of large institutions. Layered fees—across platforms, managers, and structures—can severely dilute returns. In a lower-return environment, that friction matters more. Successful retail participation will depend on access via sophisticated fiduciary advisors—those bound to act in a client’s best interest and capable of navigating complexity. Policy may soon open the doors wider, but access is not the same as advantage. For retail investors, the PE opportunity is real—but so is the challenge to enter wisely.

ByIan Sayson ByIan Sayson, Forbes Staff. Aboitiz InfraCapital owns and operates the Mactan-Cebu International Airport. BlackRock will buy 40% of Aboitiz Equity Ventures’ privately held infrastructure unit, bolstering Aboitiz InfraCapital’s financial muscle as it steps up spending to modernize the country’s infrastructure. Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), BlackRock’s wholly owned unit, and Aboitiz Equity are in “the process of finalizing a strategic partnership,” the Philippine conglomerate said in a statement, without disclosing the amount of the potential sale. GIP, which was acquired by BlackRock in October, has over $183 billion in assets under management. It has interests in energy, transport, digital infrastructure, water utility and waste management sectors. “The Philippines has compelling growth prospects, which can be further enhanced by developing world-class infrastructure,” Bayo Ogunlesi, chairman and CEO of GIP, said. “We are pleased to have the opportunity to become a strategic partner of the Aboitiz Group.” The Philippine government aims to double infrastructure spending to at least 2 trillion pesos ($35 billion) by 2028 from 1 trillion this year as it accelerates projects such as the 33-kilometer Metro Manila subway that’s estimated to cost 489 billion pesos to build. Aboitiz Equity—the publicly traded holding company of tycoon Sabin Aboitiz and his family—has been scaling up its infrastructure investments in recent years. It has interests in airports, power plants, industrial estates, telecommunications towers and water utilities. Shares of Aboitiz Equity gained 2.3% in late afternoon trading in Manila. “We are honored to explore this opportunity with Global Infrastructure Partners,” Sabin Aboitiz, CEO and president of the conglomerate said. “Together, we aim to deliver projects that improve lives and empower communities.” Aboitiz InfraCapital swung to a 207 million loss in the first quarter even as sales jumped 53% to 2.4 billion pesos amid soaring finance charges on the company’s mounting debt levels. Its total borrowings almost tripled to 45.3 billion pesos as of end-2024 from a year ago. Aside from infrastructure, Aboitiz Equity has interests in banking, financial services, food manufacturing, and real estate. With an estimated net worth of $2.2 billion, the Aboitiz family is among the wealthiest in the Philippines.

The growing intersection between traditional finance and digital asset infrastructure has taken another step forward, as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon announced a joint initiative aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the money market fund (MMF) ecosystem. The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain. The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.

World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture linked to US President Donald Trump, has made another big move into Ethereum. The group converted $13 million worth of USDC into 3,473 ETH, adding to its already large stash of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The move pushes the platform’s total Ethereum holdings to 73,616 ETH—worth about $275 million based on current prices. This latest transaction continues a buying trend that’s gained attention over the past few months. Data from Lookonchain shows that World Liberty Financial is sitting on an unrealized profit of more than $33 million. The project’s average entry price for Ethereum sits around $3,272. With ETH trading higher now, the bet appears to be paying off. Trump’s World Liberty(@worldlibertyfi) just spent 13M $USDC to buy 3,473 $ETH at $3,743 again! World Liberty has bought a total of 73,616 $ETH($275M) at an average price of $3,272, with an unrealized profit of $33M+.https://t.co/0qWkRUhTQb pic.twitter.com/WG1zpl3PJC — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 23, 2025 Last week, World Liberty also picked up over 3,000 ETH for $10 million. In May, they added another 1,580 ETH at a cost of $3.5 million. These steady acquisitions show a clear strategy: accumulate ETH and hold while prices climb. On the market side, Ethereum has responded with more green candles. The token rose 2% in the last 24 hours, hitting a daily high of $3,763. Over the past week, ETH is up 20%. Over the last month, it’s gained 65%. World Liberty Financial is not alone in taking a deep plunge into Ethereum. SharpLink and Bitmine have also boosted their ETH positions. And BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is said to be developing increasing interest in Ethereum, after establishing a strong presence in the Bitcoin arena. The momentum has also fueled the emergence of Ether Machine, a $1.6 billion Ethereum-specific effort. That effort is backed by the likes of Pantera Capital, Archetype, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and Electric Capital. All these moves set the scenario for Ethereum to be a leading option among the major players, not merely independent traders. The surging interest is driving ETH into the mainstream limelight. While new investors are buying in, older Ethereum holders are also stirring. Some dormant wallets recently moved vast amounts of the altcoin. This type of movement is bound to attract notice. It’s not the money—it’s when. And with so many of the major players stepping in, even long-quiet holders may find this the time to do something. Ethereum isn’t merely riding a wave of price activity. Institutions, funds, and political parties are stockpiling it, quietly transforming it into something bigger than another crypto token.

Title: Elon Musk wants more control of Tesla so activist investors can’t boot him—but not so much the board can’t fire him if he goes ‘crazy’

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. Tesla CEO Elon Musk just confessed that he thinks his 13% ownership stake in the electric vehicle manufacturer leaves him vulnerable to activist shareholders who could move to oust him from the $1 trillion company. Still, he admitted he shouldn’t have so much control over Tesla that the board can’t fire him if he goes “crazy,” he said during an earnings call on Wednesday. “It is a big deal—I don’t want to find I have so little control I can be easily ousted by activist shareholders,” Musk said. “That is a major concern to me as I’ve mentioned in the past and I hope that is addressed at the upcoming shareholders meeting.” I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned.Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla. You don’t seem to understand…— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024 Musk owns 13% of Tesla, a stake currently valued around $139 billion. He has previously stated he wants to own 25% of the electric vehicle manufacturer as it further expands into AI with unassisted Full Self Driving and robotics. Such a stake would be worth about $267.5 billion and would eclipse holdings by large institutional investors in Tesla such as Vanguard and Blackrock. Musk has worried in the past about the influence of activist investors or proxy advisory firms steering Tesla down the wrong long-term path at the expense of short-term pressures. However, Tesla currently maintains a defensive position against activists. Its bylaws call for what is termed a supermajority vote requirement, meaning shareholder votes must achieve support from two thirds of all outstanding shares (66.67%) rather than a simple 50% majority in order to pass. The board committed last year to Tesla shareholders that it would eliminate the supermajority vote requirement, but it hasn’t been able to muster enough investor participation. Tesla amended its bylaws in 2023 to provide shareholders with proxy access rights, meaning a shareholder or group of shareholders owning 3% or more of Tesla for at least three years can nominate directors to Tesla’s board. A stake that size would be valued at more than $20 billion. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require activist investors to disclose their stakes in company stock once they reach 5%, which is also the point where an activist can typically gain credibility with the board. A 5% stake in Tesla is worth more than $30 billion. In comparison, legendary activist investor Nelson Peltz took on the Walt Disney board after building a stake valued at about $3.5 billion at its peak. Activist investors often typically target small-cap publicly traded companies. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Musk shared his view on his ownership stake in response to an analyst’s question about how comfortable the CEO was in evolving Tesla in new directions with only the 13% stake. Musk pointed the annual shareholder meeting, which will be held November 6, as a potential issue to get aired out then. “I think that, as I’ve mentioned before, I think my control over Tesla should be enough to ensure that it goes in a good direction, but not so much control that I can’t be thrown out if I go crazy,” he said. Musk has been working without a base salary or annual bonus for years, after the Tesla board granted him a moonshot pay package once valued as high as $56 billion—the highest for a publicly traded CEO. However, that pay package was twice rescinded by a judge and Tesla has announced it formed a board committee to hash out next steps. With the delay in Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, the company has not yet published a proxy report to shareholders, which typically includes executive compensation disclosures. Tesla reported mixed results in its second quarter financials on Wednesday. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year to $22.5 billion, its worst revenue performance in the past decade. Operating income dropped 42% year-over-year to under $1 billion, although Tesla was still profitable with $1.2 billion in GAAP net income. Meanwhile, free cash flow cratered 89% year-over-year to $146 million, compared to $1.3 billion during the same quarter last year. Deliveries were down 13% to 384,122, although there were some major developments noted. Tesla launched its much-ballyhooed Robotaxi pilot in Austin, and it boosted its AI training capacity. Separately, Tesla opened a new diner and drive-in theater at a mega charging station in Hollywood this week. Tesla executives did not address speculation about a Tesla investment in Musk’s xAI, nor did they address questions from retail investors about Musk’s involvement in politics and its impact on Tesla’s value. Retail investors post questions on an open platform for Tesla shareholders called Say in advance of the earnings releases. Many related to Musk had to do with his compensation and the board’s plan to oversee Musk’s future political moves. “Elon the person has freedom of speech,” wrote one shareholder representing 47,000 shares. “The brand ambassador of Tesla does not. What is the board doing to distance Tesla from the private actions of its CEO?” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

When a company issues a token representing a real-world asset, such as a stock, but it doesn’t have any right to the underlying, “what you’re really doing is taking away from the integrity of investing and moving towards a gambling mindset,” he told Decrypt in a recent interview. “This is the meme-coin-ification of equities,” he added. In 2023, Kaplan testified before lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had clearly laid out a path to compliance for crypto firms, provoking scrutiny from Republicans and crypto advocates who argued the status quo is unworkable. With tokenization gaining traction under a crypto-friendly SEC following the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump, Prometheum is trying to reposition itself as a firm specializing in on-chain securities, reprising a familiar tune, but in a slightly different way. “It’s not really a pivot,” Kaplan said. “We've been working with issuers for a long time, and we're very excited for more and more products to come on-chain.” Through a panoply of licenses and subsidiaries, Kaplan said Prometheum can service the “entire lifecycle of a digital asset,” using its transfer agent, alternative trading system, and a special-purpose broker dealer, which also serves as a custodian. Kaplan said Prometheum can currently safeguard a handful of tokens but on-chain securities are coming next. From the beginning, Kaplan said that Prometheum’s goal has been to “to integrate blockchain technology into market infrastructure to just create a better apple cart,” following the same rules but “eliminating the drag that occurs from legacy systems.” The vision parallels BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who predicted tokenization would become the “next generation of markets” by making markets more efficient in 2022. Citadel Securities, one of the world’s largest market makers, urged the SEC in a letter earlier this week to treat tokenized equities in a similar manner to traditional counterparts. “Simply put, while we strongly support technological innovations designed to address market inefficiencies, seeking to exploit regulatory arbitrage for ‘look-a-like’ securities is not innovation,” it argued, calling on the SEC to “resist self-serving requests for broad exemptions.” In a statement weeks ago, SEC Commissioner and crypto task force boss Hester Peirce told firms structuring tokenized offerings to consider meeting with the regulator, noting that tokenization does not provide an exemption from existing rules and regulations. In recent months, crypto exchange Kraken has backed xStocks on Solana, while trading platform Robinhood has introduced “stocks tokens” on the Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum. Robinhood clarified, following criticism from OpenAI, that its tokens represent contracts, and in the case of the ChatGPT maker, they give “indirect exposure to public markets.” Earlier this month, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo argued to Decrypt that the only true form of tokenization is “native,” meaning the asset itself is issued on-chain, as opposed to representing an asset that’s held, managed, and recorded somewhere else. Kaplan agrees, but he thinks not all companies are getting the compliance element. “I think people have started to view tokenization as an alternative to regulation,” he said. “It might be a derivative, but it's a security, and therefore it still has to follow the rules.” CORRECTION (JULY 23, 2025, 4:40 p.m.): Fixes title in headline to Co-CEO.

Title: President Trump Plans to Open 401(k)s to Bitcoin, Crypto, Gold, and Private Equity: FT
URL: https://www.activistpost.com/president-trump-plans-to-open-401ks-to-bitcoin-crypto-gold-and-private-equity-ft/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T20:00:00Z

Editor Crypto Bitcoin Magazine, Oscar Zarraga Perez The executive order, expected this week, aims to unlock the $9 trillion retirement market by allowing 401(k) plans to invest in alternative assets. Financial Times reported today that President Trump is preparing to sign an executive order that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets such as gold, private equity, and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. “Donald Trump is preparing to open the $9tn US retirement market to cryptocurrency investments, gold, and private equity in a move that would spur a radical shift in the way Americans’ savings are managed,” reported the Financial Times. According to Financial Times, the order is expected this week and will direct federal regulators to remove barriers preventing 401(k) plans from including these non-traditional investments in managed funds. This includes digital assets, metals, private loans, infrastructure deals, and corporate buyout funds. “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future,” said the White House in a statement to the Financial Times. “No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself.” Trump’s move builds on his administration’s earlier efforts to ease bitcoin and crypto regulations. In May, the Department of Labor reversed a rule that discouraged bitcoin and other crypto in retirement plans. Trump has also supported recent bitcoin and other crypto related bills passed by the House and credited the industry with helping him win the 2024 election. The executive order could benefit major private investment firms such as Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, reported the Financial Times, which have all pinned much of their future growth on investing money on behalf of retirement savers. “Blackstone has struck a partnership with Vanguard, while Apollo and Partners Group are among firms that will offer investments to Empower, a large 401k plan sponsor. BlackRock has already begun working with Great Gray Trust, a third-party manger of retirement savings plans,” stated Financial Times.

Title: Project Flash update: Advancing Azure Virtual Machine availability monitoring
URL: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/project-flash-update-advancing-azure-virtual-machine-availability-monitoring-2/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Previously, we shared an update on Project Flash as part of our Advancing Reliability blog series, reaffirming our commitment to helping Azure customers detect and diagnose virtual machine (VM) availability issues with speed and precision. This year, we’re excited to unveil the latest innovations that take VM availability monitoring to the next level—enabling customers to operate their workloads on Azure with even greater confidence. I’ve asked Yingqi (Halley) Ding, Technical Program Manager from the Azure Core Compute team, to walk us through the newest investments powering the next phase of Project Flash. Project Flash is a cross-division initiative at Microsoft. Its vision is to deliver precise telemetry, real-time alerts, and scalable monitoring—all within a unified, user-friendly experience designed to meet the diverse observability needs of virtual machine (VM) availability. Flash addresses both platform-level and user-level challenges. It enables rapid detection of issues originating from the Azure platform, helping teams respond quickly to infrastructure-related disruptions. At the same time, it equips you with actionable insights to diagnose and resolve problems within your own environment. This dual capability supports high availability and helps ensure your business Service-Level Agreements are consistently met. It’s our mission to ensure you can: During our team’s journey with Flash, it has garnered widespread adoption from some of the world’s leading companies spanning from e-commerce, gaming, finance, hedge funds, and many other sectors. Their extensive utilization of Flash underscores its effectiveness and value in meeting the diverse needs of high-profile organizations. At BlackRock, VM reliability is critical to our operations. If a VM is running on degraded hardware, we want to be alerted quickly so we have the maximum opportunity to mitigate the issue before it impacts users. With Project Flash, we receive a resource health event integrated into our alerting processes the moment an underlying node in Azure infrastructure is marked unallocatable, typically due to health degradation. Our infrastructure team then schedules a migration of the affected resource to healthy hardware at an optimal time. This ability to predictively avoid abrupt VM failures has reduced our VM interruption rate and improved the overall reliability of our investment platform. The Flash initiative has evolved into a robust, scalable monitoring framework designed to meet the diverse needs of modern infrastructure—whether you’re managing a handful of VMs or operating at massive scale. Built with reliability at its core, Flash empowers you to monitor what matters most, using the tools and telemetry that align with your architecture and operational model. Flash publishes VM availability states and resource health annotations for detailed failure attribution and downtime analysis. The guide below outlines your options so you can choose the right Flash monitoring solution for your scenario. Many customers have emphasized the need for user-friendly monitoring solutions that provide real-time, scalable access to compute resource availability data. This information is essential for triggering timely mitigation actions in response to availability changes. Designed to satisfy this critical need, the VM availability metric is well-suited for tracking trends, aggregating platform metrics (such as CPU and disk usage), and configuring precise threshold-based alerts. You can utilize this out-of-the-box VM availability metric in Azure Monitor. Now you can use the Context dimension to identify whether VM availability was influenced by Azure or user-orchestrated activity. This dimension indicates, during any disruption or when the metric drops to zero, whether the cause was platform-triggered or user-driven. It can assume values of Platform, Customer, or Unknown. The new dimension is also supported in Azure Monitor alert rules as part of the filtering process. Azure Event Grid is a highly scalable, fully managed Pub/Sub message distribution service that offers flexible message consumption patterns. Event Grid enables you to publish and subscribe to messages to support Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Through HTTP, Event Grid enables you to build event-driven solutions, where a publisher service (such as Project Flash) announces its system state changes (events) to subscriber applications. With the integration of Azure Monitor alerts as a new event handler, you can now receive low-latency notifications—such as VM availability changes and detailed annotations—via SMS, email, push notifications, and more. This combines Event Grid’s near real-time delivery with Azure Monitor’s direct alerting capabilities. To get started, simply follow the step-by-step instructions and begin receiving real-time alerts with Flash’s new offering. Looking ahead, we plan to broaden our focus to include scenarios such as inoperable top-of-rack switches, failures in accelerated networking, and new classes of hardware failure prediction. In addition, we aim to continue enhancing data quality and consistency across all Flash endpoints—enabling more accurate downtime attribution and deeper visibility into VM availability. For comprehensive monitoring of VM availability—including scenarios such as routine maintenance, live migration, service healing, and degradation—we recommend leveraging both Flash Health events and Scheduled Events (SE). For upcoming updates on the Flash initiative, we encourage you to follow the advancing reliability series! The future of AI starts here. Envision your next great AI app with the latest technologies.

The product, built with technology developed by Goldman Sachs, will allow fund managers to enable the subscription of shares of MMF via BNY’s Liquidity Direct and digital assets platform that are then reflected with mirrored tokens on Goldman Sachs's Digital Asset Platform (DAP). “As the financial system transitions toward a more digital, real-time architecture, BNY is committed to enabling scalable and secure solutions that shape the future of finance,” said Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral at BNY Laide Majiyagbe in a statement. "Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this first-of-its-kind initiative," she added. The initial launch will have participation from BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, while the official books, records, and settlement will be maintained by BNY Mellon. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” said Goldman Sachs Global Head of Digital Assets Matthew McDermott, in a statement. “We are excited about this strategic collaboration with BNY in our journey towards the longer-term vision for GS DAP and as we continue to lead and innovate in the digital assets space.” Expanding participation in global financial services via tokenized assets is a growing trend among financial firms. Last month, Robinhood announced a tokenized equity platform to provide greater access to American stocks for those in the Europe, and American crypto exchange Coinbase is seeking to offer its own tokenized solution as well. Meanwhile, other crypto exchanges have leaned into offering xStocks, a feature that allows users to trade popular stocks like Meta and Tesla on Solana, which are backed by actual shares in the respective companies.

Title: The DORKs are popular this week. Here's the new class of meme stocks retail traders are pumping to the moon.

The DORKs are popular this week. With stocks at record highs, there's a new class of meme stocks that's grabbed the attention of retail traders. Absent are the OG meme names GameStop and AMC. Those early favorites have been replaced by another group. The DORKs—an acronym being thrown around by bullish traders to refer to the ticker symbols of Krispy Kreme, Opendoor, Rocket Lab, and Kohl's—are spiking in the last few days, with the burst of enthusiasm sparked by a stunning rally in Opendoor stock that's mostly cooled off even as the rest of the group surges. It's looking similar to 2021, when everything from crypto to pandemic-era blank check firms to highly-shorted companies with weak financials were getting pushed to dizzying heights. And with recent legislation proposing to loosen day trading restrictions by lowering the minimum margin account threshold, there's never been a more retail-friendly time in the markets. But there are differences, too, between today's rally and the pandemic-era frenzy. "Today's surge is powered by advances in trading technology, wider use of leverage, and the rapid expansion of the options market. Confidence among retail traders is notably higher, fueled in part by recent gains in crypto markets," Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide, said. "While this activity reflects rising risk appetite, it remains isolated and has yet to challenge the broader market's calm and steady tone." Taking a page from Warren Buffett's book, investors are getting greedy, which also means extra caution may be warranted. Tony DeSpirito, head of US fundamental equities at BlackRock, is sensing some pockets of froth in the market as sentiment continues to rise and meme stocks surge. In particular, stocks with high multiples but low growth are concerning to DeSpirito. "Meme stocks are the epitome of greed," DeSpirito told Business Insider. "If I'm advising an individual, I'd tell them to stay away from the meme stocks and get the stocks that actually have good cash flow, good earnings, etc." Here's what's been moving in the meme stock world. Prior to last week, Opendoor was an unloved penny stock on the verge of delisting from the Nasdaq. After hedge fund manager Eric Jackson shouted out the stock on X and gave it a hefty $82 price target, enthusiasm for Opendoor surged, activating the retail trader cohort who quickly went all-in. The stock has rallied over 440% in the last month alone, going from under a dollar to $2.88, even hitting $4.71 briefly at one point on Monday. The rally has stalled in recent days, with the shares down as much as 28% on Wednesday. The stock is still up 310% in the last month. Kohl's stock jumped 38% on Tuesday, not on the heels of corporate news or earnings, but rather r/WallStreetBets chatter. Retail traders identified a short interest of nearly half of the company's float, making the stock a perfect candidate for a short squeeze. The frenzy caused trading in Kohl's shares to be temporarily paused during Tuesday's session. The doughnut chain Krispy Kreme surged 28% on Tuesday. The stock started 2025 trading at nearly $10 and proceeded to slide downwards in the following months after the company reported disappointing earnings—until this week. The stock soared again on Wednesday, up as much as 39%before paring gains. Krispy Kreme also has a significant short interest level of 33%, making it another target for Reddit short squeezers. Rocket Lab stock has surged amid increased retail interest in space technology. The company provides end-to-end space services and is a rival to Elon Musk's SpaceX. The stock has been a Wall Street Bets favorite for many months now. Rocket Lab has surged nearly 50% in the last month and is up nearly 100% year-to-date, bolstered by news of recent government contracts and scheduled launches. The company's short interest comprises 13% of its float. Digital camera producer GoPro was also swept up in the meme-stock craze. In its heyday back in 2015, the stock traded at $67. A big influx of retail volume has propelled the stock from under a dollar to above $2 immediately upon Wednesday's open. The stock was up as much as 72% on Wednesday before paring the gain to around 40%. Nearly 10% of GoPro's float is shorted. Jump to

Δ The collaboration will see BNY use Goldman Sachs’ blockchain technology to maintain a record of customers’ ownership of select money market funds (MMFs). The companies said in a Wednesday (July 23) press release that the project is “a significant step towards enhancing the utility and transferability of existing MMF shares.” It’s also the first time that fund managers in the United States have enabled subscription for shares of their MMFs via BNY’s LiquidityDirect and Digital Asset platforms, “the corresponding value of which will be represented through mirrored record tokenization utilizing GS DAP,” Goldman Sachs’ blockchain-based platform, per the release. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are all participating in the launch, the release said. “As the financial system transitions toward a more digital, real-time architecture, BNY is committed to enabling scalable and secure solutions that shape the future of finance,” Laide Majiyagbe, global head of liquidity, financing and collateral at BNY, said in the release. “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition, and we are proud to be at the forefront of this first-of-its-kind initiative.” Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets at Goldman Sachs, said in the release that using tokens representing the value of shares of MMFs on GS DAP “would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future.” BNY will continue to maintain the official books, records, and settlements for the funds within approved guidelines while also enabling mirror tokens on GS DAP to create future opportunities, according to the release. Meanwhile, tokenization is transforming the way consumers and merchants think about payment security, Valeri Vanourek, vice president of digital products at Discover® Network, told PYMNTS this month. “The benefits of tokenization haven’t changed,” Vanourek said. “A streamlined checkout process, additional protection as part of the transaction, the account updates in the case of a cardholder’s primary account number being lost or stolen or needing to be replaced, all of those result in a frictionless and secure transaction.” What has changed is that companies that choose to invest in tokenization for their payment architecture could be best placed to flourish in the next wave of digital commerce.

Title: What’s up with… Nokia, AT&T, Comcast, Charter, T-Mobile US

Jul 23, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Currency exchange fluctuations and tariffs force Nokia to issue a profits warning for the full year; AT&T is to pump billions more into its fibre access network infrastructure as it celebrates massive tax savings from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; Comcast and Charter have hooked up with T-Mobile US, and not existing MVNO partner Verizon, for B2B mobile services; and much more! Nokia’s share price slumped by 8.5% to €3.76 during Wednesday trading on the Helsinki stock exchange after the vendor issued a profit warning late on Tuesday, blaming foreign exchange rate fluctuations (a weaker dollar) and “tariff headwinds” that are “outside its control”. While the vendor says its “underlying business performed as expected” during the first six months of the year, the foreign exchange shifts and the impact of trade tariffs have forced the company to lower its operating profit outlook for the full year to €1.6bn-2.1bn from its previous outlook of €1.9bn-€2.4bn), a difference of €300m. The main impact has come from the change in the exchange rate between the euro and the US dollar: When Nokia made its initial full year calculations in January, the €/$ exchange rate was 1.04, but its new calculation is based on a rate of 1.17. That shift has had a €230m negative impact on its operating profit projection, while the “tariff landscape” is expected to have a negative impact this year of between €50m and €80m. Nokia is set to publish its second quarter 2025 results during the morning of 24 July but ahead of that publication it noted that it expects to report revenues of €4.55bn and an operating profit of €300m. Nokia, of course, won’t be alone in taking this kind of hit: Other European vendors that do a lot of business in the US will also be impacted by the same “headwinds”, especially if the US does impose 30% tariffs on EU goods from 1 August, as has been threatened. AT&T expects to benefit from cash tax savings worth between $6.5bn and $8bn during the 2025-2027 period, relative to the financial guidance it provided at its 2024 investor day, due to the impact of the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The telco expects savings of $1.5bn-$2bn this year, followed by $2.5bn-$3bn in 2026 and again in 2027. The news came as the operator reported its second quarter financial results. AT&T says it plans to invest $3.5bn of those expected savings into its network infrastructure to “accelerate its fibre internet build-out to a pace of 4 million locations per year, a run-rate it expects to achieve by the end of 2026.” The telco added: “As a result of this increased pace of organic fibre deployment, AT&T expects that by the end of 2030 it will reach approximately 50 million customer locations with its in-region fibre network,” and more than 60 million fibre locations once it includes: the Lumen Technologies Mass Markets fibre broadband network assets it has agreed to acquire for $5.75bn (and which it plans to expand); its Gigapower joint venture with Blackrock; and agreements with open access fibre broadband network providers. As for the rest of the savings, AT&T plans to pump $1.5bn into its employee pension plan by the end of 2026 and use the remaining savings for “financial flexibility to support additional strategic investments, incremental capital returns and debt repayment, among other potential uses.” For the second quarter, AT&T reported communications services revenues of $29.7bn, up by 3.9% year on year, and communications services operating profits of $7.07bn, up by 0.9%. US cable operator giants Comcast and Charter Communications have struck a joint (and exclusive) MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) deal with T-Mobile US to offer mobile services to their enterprise customers. Mobile services will be offered by Charter and Comcast to US businesses under the Spectrum Mobile for Business and Comcast Business Mobile brands, respectively, noted T-Mobile US in this announcement. Edward Zimmermann, president of Comcast Business, stated: “Comcast Business delivers advanced, converged solutions to business customers by uniting the scale of our nationwide WiFi network, gig-plus speeds, and the integration of top-tier 5G mobile capabilities. Our capital-light partnership with T-Mobile further strengthens our growth strategy in wireless for business customers and provides them exceptional value.” Danny Bowman, executive VP for Product at Charter Communications, added: “Spectrum Mobile for Business offers a truly converged connectivity experience, combining gig-powered internet and superior WiFi service with a premium 5G mobile network. This partnership with T-Mobile will allow us to rapidly and cost-effectively bring even more value to our Spectrum Mobile business customers.” The deal is great news for the wholesale unit of T-Mobile US, which is not shy in telling the world how advanced its 5G network is, but something of a blow to Verizon, which already provides MVNO services to Comcast and Charter for their consumer mobile service offerings – Xfinity Mobile (8.1 million customers) and Spectrum Mobile (10.4 million customers), respectively. The cable companies have stressed that their “existing long-term MVNO partnership will continue to support residential and current business customers”. That’s a small crumb of comfort for Verizon, which will now face even fiercer competition in the enterprise mobile services space from the cable giants. Of course, AT&T and T-Mobile US will also face similar competitive pressure in the B2B market, but at least T-Mobile US will be reaping the rewards of the MVNO fees from Comcast and Charter. Research firm Omdia has taken a look at what Asia’s cloud service providers – including SK Telecom and China’s cloud providers such as Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei and Tencent – are doing in order to meet the rising demand for AI inference from the region’s enterprise sector. By examining which GPUs (graphics processing units), AI accelerators and AI-optimised CPUs (central processing units) these companies have deployed, and the current status of their own AI models and custom chip projects, as well as their AI service and pricing plans, it has come up with an interesting take on the sector. “Despite heavy stockpiling of Nvidia H800 and H20 GPUs during 2024 and early 2025, prior to the imposition of US export controls, these high-performance chips are difficult to find in Chinese cloud services, suggesting they are primarily used for the hyperscalers’ own model development projects,” noted Omdia in this announcement. At the same time, “there are relatively few options that use any of the Chinese AI chip projects; exceptions include Baidu’s on-premises cloud products and some Huawei Cloud services, although they remain limited,” it added. Omdia principal analyst Alexander Harrowell noted: “The real triumph in Chinese semiconductors has been CPUs rather than accelerators. Chinese Arm-based CPUs are clearly in production at scale and are usually optimised for parallel workloads in a way like Amazon Web Services’ Graviton series. Products such as Alibaba’s YiTian 710 offer an economically attractive solution for serving the current generation of small AI models such as Alibaba Qwen3 in the enterprise, where the user base is relatively small and workload diversity is high,” he added. Where “modern GPUs” are deployed, “the strongest offering Omdia found was the GPU-as-a-service product SK Telecom is building in partnership with Lambda Labs,” the research firm noted. Philippines operator Globe Telecom has committed to power 3,000 cell sites in Metro Manila and Calabarzon with 100% renewable power in a move that will lead to the consumption of 80 million kWh of clean electricity and cut its greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 5.5 million kilograms, reports Southeast Asia Infrastructure. Research firm Mobile Experts has taken a broad look at the impact of AI on mobile networks and concluded that “AI assistants and AR [augmented reality] will strain the 5G network, but AI-for-RAN optimization [the use of AI to enhance the performance and efficiency of radio access networks] will create more capacity than consumer applications will use, at least through 2030. The wild card is in automated use of AI for video analysis, in automotive, drone, and industrial applications.” Joe Madden, principal analyst at Mobile Experts, stated: "New applications are coming to your smartphone, taking advantage of on-device AI processing capability. We have been able to identify which apps will run on your phone, and which ones will require network connectivity. The frame rates, resolution, and persistence of video inputs will have a profound impact on the 5G network," added Madden. – The staff, TelecomTV Jul 25, 2025 Jul 25, 2025 Jul 25, 2025 Jul 25, 2025 Jul 24, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

The U.S. hedge fund market is driven by concentrated institutional investor activity, dynamic AI-enabled trading platforms, and robust regulatory infrastructure. The market was valued at USD 0.7 trillion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 1.0 trillion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 3.78%. Continued innovation in digital asset strategies and increased demand for diversified alpha generation will fuel sustained expansion. Get Free Sample Report of the Hedge Fund Market: https://www.snsinsider.com/sample-request/6889 Key Hedge Fund Companies Profiled in the Report: Hedge Fund Market Report Scope Segment Analysis By Type: Offshore Dominates, Fund of Funds Sees Fastest Growth Offshore hedge funds dominated the market in 2024 and accounted for 46% of revenue share, as they offer tax benefits, looser regulations, and are attractive to institutional investors outside of the US looking to maximize returns through multi-jurisdictional strategies. These funds typically operate from a jurisdiction such as the Cayman Islands or Bermuda, offering the practical advantages of lower operating costs and privacy, appealing to both high-net-worth individuals and institutions. The Fund of Funds segment is expected to register the fastest CAGR during the forecast period, as it allows for diversification of risk and access to a wide variety of investments. Such funds enable investors to access multiple hedge strategies in one vehicle, mitigating idiosyncratic manager risk. This model is attractive to new investors and institutions seeking balanced exposure and lowering compliance overhead, increasing its adoption rate, particularly across the Asia-Pacific and European markets. By Strategy: Long/Short Equity Dominates, Global Macro Grows Fastest Long/short equity segment dominated the market in 2024 and accounted for a significant revenue share. Its core allure is its capability to produce alpha during upswings and downturns alike. Fund managers can mitigate risk while still maximizing for absolute returns by going long on cheap stocks and short on expensive ones. Such flexibility across volatile and stable economic cycles makes it appealing and secures its position as one of the leaders among hedge strategies. The Global Macro strategies segment is witnessing the fastest CAGR, driven by geopolitical unrest, inflation fluctuations, and changing interest rate environments. These macroeconomic cross-currency/comodity and sovereign debt arb strategies represent an agile toolbox while capitalizing on global inefficiencies. Increasingly data-driven global macro funds, some of which are aided by AI and machine learning-improved predictive analytics, continue to attract generation Jason Trennert and other sophisticated institutional investors. By Region: North America Leads, Asia-Pacific Surges Forward North America dominated the hedge fund market in 2024 and accounted for 40% of revenue share, supported by its deep capital markets, concentration of institutional investors, and the maturity of its regulatory environment. Earlier, Hedge strategies, fintech integration, and High-frequency trading technologies will continue to call the U.S. home, and thus leadership will be maintained through 2032.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Goldman Sachs and BNY have joined hands to launch digital tokens that mirror shares of money market funds, deepening Wall Street's push to bring blockchain technology into traditional finance. Investors can now buy and sell money market fund shares on BNY's LiquidityDirect platform, with a digital record of those shares created on Goldman's blockchain system, the two financial giants said on Wednesday. The move marks an early step toward modernizing the infrastructure that underpins most of the financial ecosystem. If adopted broadly, it could make it easier and faster for institutional investors to use these assets as collateral and reduce trade settlement times. BlackRock, BNY Investments Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments and Goldman Sachs Asset Management are among the companies participating in the initial rollout.

Due to its 71.6% monthly rise, per CoinGecko, XRP has surpassed drinks company PepsiCo, telecommunications firm AT&T, and taxi app Uber. Ethereum, by comparison, is the 29th largest asset, ahead of the likes of retail company Cotco and medical firm Johnson & Johnson. As for Bitcoin, it currently sits as the 6th largest asset behind Amazon and ahead of Google's creator, Alphabet. However, one expert warns against treating the market capitalization of a public company and a cryptocurrency as the same thing. "It's important that the two concepts are not treated the same," Matej Janež, Head of Partnerships at crypto privacy firm Oasis, told Decrypt. "A public company's market cap counts shares that confer a legal claim on earnings and assets. A crypto market cap is the price multiplied by the circulating token count. Both numbers can reveal speculative appetite, but only one comes with enforceable rights to dividends and residual assets." XRP set a new all-time high earlier this month for the first time in seven years. It came following a five-year legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged that Ripple and two of its executives had participated in the sale of unregistered securities through XRP. The worst of the legal battle appears to be behind the project as President Trump’s pro-crypto administration begins to ease regulatory scrutiny. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse even claimed the battle was over in March, despite some details of the lawsuit—a $125 million penalty—still lingering. Since Trump secured re-election in November 2024, XRP has surged 585.8% from $0.503 to $3.44. That move has seen the cryptocurrency surpass the likes of investment titan BlackRock, aircraft creator Boeing, and sporting giant Nike. “PesiCo, Uber, BlackRock, Google, Uber will remain in the dust because of XRP. [It] will continue to grow and grow because it has real value,” MackAttackXRP, a pseudonymous member of the XRP Army, an avid supporters group, told Decrypt. “XRP is on its way to the top ten. And it might happen sooner than many might think.” For XRP to climb into the top 10, the cryptocurrency would need to jump more than 735% in value—assuming no other assets increase or decrease in value. MackAttackXRP and other XRP Army troopers argue that XRP will become the standard for transactions across the globe, replacing the traditional banking system, because of its low fees and fast processing speeds. Breaking into the top 10 remains some distance away for XRP, however. Looking to a more achievable goal, XRP needs to rise just 5% to surpass fast-food behemoth McDonald’s. Such a move would also see it surpass oil company Shell and banking firm American Express.

Title: Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon to launch tokenized money market funds for institutional investors

Share this article Goldman Sachs and BNY are launching a new platform that allows institutional clients to invest in tokenized money market funds, CNBC reported Wednesday, and it already has backing from titans like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Federated Hermes. Under the initiative, BNY clients, such as hedge funds, pensions, and corporate treasurers, will gain access to tokenized fund share classes recorded directly on Goldman’s private blockchain. Tokenized money market shares promise an alternative to stablecoins. Unlike stablecoins, money market funds generate real returns, making them a compelling on-chain instrument for parking idle capital with low risk and high liquidity. In March 2024, Goldman Sachs, BNY, and other financial institutions participated in a network test on Digital Asset’s Canton Network to facilitate seamless transactions and settlements of tokenized assets. The pilot involved 15 asset managers, 13 banks, four custodians, and three exchanges, demonstrating the potential of enterprise blockchain to reduce risks, optimize capital, and enable more efficient financial processes.

Title: Overnight sensation Thomas Clarkson taking advantage of surprise Lions call-up

If ever there was a five-year overnight sensation it is assuredly Thomas Clarkson. He made his Leinster debut in August 2020 but went into this campaign with less than 20 starts under his belt and as his province’s third choice tighthead. Yet there he was on Tuesday night in the Marvel Stadium mixed zone after the 24-19 win over the Pasifika XV, a bona fide British & Irish Lion. No one seemed more incredulous as well as delighted than the 25-year-old himself, for he freely admitted he wouldn’t have thought all of this was possible when he was named as one of the additional, or development, players to train with Ireland’s squad last November, before making his debut against Argentina off the bench, backing it up against Fiji, and then playing in four Six Nations games, starting against Wales. Clarkson is eligible for Italy on his mother’s side and also revealed he was approached by Italy at the start of last season. “I wasn’t even really expecting to play in that. So, to get a cap I was delighted. “The Six Nations; I was happy enough with how it went. I wouldn’t have said I set the world alight or anything. So, to then play well for Leinster at the end of the season and come in here, it’s pretty mad.” As recently as January 2025, Clarkson was playing an AIL Division 1B game for Blackrock. “I made my Leinster debut five years ago now, so I’ve been waiting a long time. So, the fact that when it has come, it’s all come at once is a bit crazy. Because I went through a good few years of not getting a sniff in at all really.” It’s been a Lions tour of an unprecedented and, frankly, unexpected bounty for Irish tightheads, three of them making the tour. And two of whom are inextricably linked. Had it not been for the calf and hamstring issues which restricted Tadhg Furlong to just seven games for Leinster and one for Ireland, Clarkson would never have had the opportunities that came for province and country. Even so, after adding three more Champions Cup pool games to his one outing before this season, Clarkson didn’t make the Leinster 23 in their European knockout games. But with Furlong sidelined again, Leo Cullen started Clarkson in their round 18 game against Glasgow. “It all kind of just clicked and then kept that momentum going. That was the first game when I thought: ‘That was a proper performance’.” David Humphreys has now lifted his moratorium on the provinces signing props from abroad and although Furlong’s injury woes have been a factor, Clarkson’s own account of his growth this season shows how Irish players can learn from overseas acquisitions like Rabah Slimani. “I’ve been kind of understudy to Tadhg for a good few years now. He’s consistently been probably the best tighthead in the world over the last few years. It’s been unbelievable being there, just around him. “Rabah’s come in and probably offered something a bit different, where he’s 100 per cent scrum. Tadhg obviously has an array of different stuff that he brings to it, whereas Rabah, when you’re scrumming against him in training, it’s all or nothing against him. It’s been a different kind of experience with him, but I’ve felt I’ve come out the other end well.” Clarkson retained his starting place at tighthead in the URC quarter-final, semi-final and final wins, before playing against Georgia and Portugal. That Saturday night in Lisbon, he thought his breakthrough season was done until he received a text from Andy Farrell at 3am. “We were on a night out; I had to go home straight away. But yeah, some text to get. It was like: ‘ring me when you’re awake’, so I said: ‘Oh yeah, grand’. Then Paulie [O’Connell] rang me and was like: ‘Ring him right now’. So yeah, I had to just compose myself and go outside. I told Jack Boyle and then just legged it.” Sadly, social media can be a nasty world, and on foot of the backlash to him and Jamie Osborne being called up, Clarkson opted to ignore it. “I feel like the last few weeks in Leinster, before the semi-final, was fairly negative. I just tried to use that as a bit of motivation. I knew, just because Jamie got called in right before me, there was a bit of backlash to that. So, I knew it was going to be even more when I got the nod. So yeah, I just tried to stay away from it.” “It was a bit of a shock at the start, to be honest. You grow up using social media. It was hard to step away from it. But I just had to get rid of a lot of that.” Clarkson admits that linking up with the Lions at short notice was a good deal easier for him than the late Scottish call-ups given his familiarity with so many players and coaches, not least Andy Farrell and John Fogarty. On Tuesday morning Fogarty told Clarkson that his form for Leinster merited his call-up and encouraged him to continue that form into the match that night, so building up his confidence. “I felt like I was chasing my tail a little bit, but happy enough with the scrum and I made a few tackles. It was a good start.” To make Clarkson’s landmark night even better, his father Finbarr made it out in time for Tuesday’s match. “I think he knew if he was going to be here for any game, it would be this game. So yeah, he legged it down.” All the while in the mixed zone, he still had his Lions cap in his grasp, which had been given to him by Ieuen Evans. “It’s crazy, 886,” he says, of his number in Lions’ playing history. “I didn’t even know they did caps if you don’t play in the Test.” He’s a Lion now all right.

Title: Italian call a distant memory for new Lion Clarkson

Neil Treacy RTÉ Sport Journalist As Thomas Clarkson stood in Melbourne's Marvel Stadium, clutching his newly minted British and Irish Lions cap, he reflected on a sliding doors moment from two years earlier. Fun fact: The 25-year-old's full name is actually Tommaso Clarkson, with his mother Nina Cafolla coming from a small town between Rome and Naples. At the start of the 2023/24 season, the Italians came calling. Clarkson turned down the offer, but with the tighthead prop yet to get his full break at Leinster, his qualification to play for Italy was kept in his back pocket, just in case. "They came looking for me, but I'd just signed a new contract with Leinster," he said, after making his Lions debut against the First Nations and Pasifika XV on Tuesday night. "I thought it could be open at some point down the line, but obviously, this year it's gone very well." It's been a fast 12 months for Clarkson. A run of games to start the season, and injuries elsewhere, saw him brought into the Ireland squad for the first time in November as a training panellist. He was retained after the training camp and impressed in two appearances off the bench against Argentina and Fiji. More big appearances came in the Champions Cup, and four more Irish caps followed in the Six Nations, before he produced arguably his best Leinster performance in their URC final win against the Bulls, a game he says was the moment where he believes he arrived. "It all kind of just clicked [that day] and then kept that momentum going," he said. "That was the first game when I was like, 'that was a proper performance’." He thought he finished the season with two more Irish caps against Georgia and Portugal, scoring a try in the second of those wins, and it was while celebrating that victory with a few beers in the early hours of the morning in Lisbon that he received an urgent message from Andy Farrell. "It was like: ‘ring me when you’re awake’, so I said ‘oh yeah, grand’. Then Paulie [Paul O’Connell] rang me and was like, ‘ring him right now!’ "So yeah, I had to just compose myself and go outside. "I told Jack Boyle and then just legged it." His dream Lions call-up wasn’t met with universal warmth outside of Ireland, mainly due to the him being the 18th Irish international drafted in by Farrell on this tour, and the third tighthead prop. Farrell made a point of namechecking Clarkson (above) after last night’s game, insisting he was very much the "next cab on the rank" when he was called into the group, and the player says that message has been drilled into him by the coaching staff. "It wasn't a kind of ‘nepo’ selection if you’d call it that," Clarkson added. "It was just nice to hear going into it. We were bouncing into the game. "I benefited from Tadhg [Furlong] being injured at the end of the season, definitely benefited from that. "But I'd like to think I took the opportunity. "I've been kind of understudied to Tadhg for a good few years now. He's consistently been probably the best tighthead in the world over the last few years. "It's been unbelievable being there, just around him. "Rabah’s [Rabah Slimani] come in, probably offered something a bit different, where he's 100% scrum. "Tadhg obviously has an array of different stuff that he brings to it. Whereas Rabah, when you're scrumming against him in training, it's all or nothing." While the breaks have fallen his way this season, he served a long apprenticeship at the province, in large part down to playing behind Furlong, as well as Michael Ala’alatoa in previous years. Remarkably, he was lining out for Blackrock College in Division 1B of the Energia All-Ireland League as recently as January 2024. Asked if he though playing for the Lions was on the cards even six months ago, he admitted "not a hope!". "I made my Leinster debut five years ago now, so I've been waiting a long time," he said. "The fact that when it has come, it's all come at once is a bit crazy. Because I went through a good few years of not getting a sniff in at all really. So yeah, it’s mad. "I put a lot of work into getting it, so any time I did get a shot, there was a whole lot of work behind it. So it felt like it just kind of rolled into another. "Once I got a foot in the door, I think I was trying to open it fully." Barring a couple of injuries, it’s likely Clarkson has now finally finished his gruelling, 27-game season, and will head home with something to remember it by. "It’s crazy, 886," he says, repeating the number stitched into his red and gold Lions cap after Tuesday’s win. "I didn't even know they did caps if you don't play in the Test. It's some energy."

Business FILE PHOTO: Representations of cryptocurrencies are seen in front of displayed decreasing stock graph in this illustration taken November 10, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photo NEW YORK :Tokenization has long been a buzzword for crypto enthusiasts, who have been arguing for years that blockchain-based assets will change the underlying infrastructure of financial markets. The technology is seen as rapidly increasing in coming years, especially in the U.S., helped by the passage of three new bills. President Donald Trump's administration has eased regulation of the broader crypto industry, paving the way for a boom in the valuation of companies in the sector and the rapid growth of crypto-related securities.

Title: The stock market is on a hot streak. It’s about to face a huge test | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Six months into President Donald Trump’s second term, a quick glance at the stock market offers a reassuring picture: The S&P 500 just closed above 6,300 points for the first time ever and has notched eight record highs in the past month. If you look at markets halfway into the year, it might not be apparent that there has been unprecedented trade turmoil, conflict in the Middle East and relentless attacks on the Federal Reserve’s independence. The stock market and bitcoin have soared to record highs, while bonds have resumed a steady rally and volatility in oil prices has subsided. Global markets so far this year have been remarkably resilient. The calm mood on Wall Street is an extraordinary change from early April, when the S&P 500 hit its lowest level in over a year and was on the precipice of a bear market after Trump unveiled his initial “Liberation Day” tariffs. “Perhaps the move by US stocks off the early-April lows is emblematic of the age-old adage about bull markets often climbing a ‘wall of worry,’” Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon, investment strategists at Charles Schwab, said in a note. “There is no shortage of things to worry about; but that’s the wall markets often climb.” Markets are floating near record highs despite underlying tariff uncertainty. While investors have begun to shrug off a myriad of concerns, US stocks are trading at historically expensive valuations as Trump’s self-imposed August 1 tariff deadline approaches. As Trump presses forward with his trade war, markets’ momentum will face a tariff test. “What has held stocks aloft … is the premise that whatever tariff increases come on August 1, they will not be permanent,” Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group, said in a note. “The prospect that ‘deals’ will be struck thereafter remains a factor, we believe, in keeping traders from selling stocks more aggressively,” Wizman said. Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist, strategists at LPL Financial, said in a note that the S&P 500’s “unusually sharp and swift ‘V-shaped recovery’” from its low point in early April was “one of the most powerful post-correction rebounds in stock market history.” The ferocity of the market’s recovery has raised questions about whether it is supported by fundamentals — or if underlying weakness could arise. While the market experienced bouts of enormous volatility in recent months, stocks continue to push higher. The S&P 500 is up 5.2% since Trump took office. Trump has acknowledged the market’s rebound. The president earlier this month told NBC News that “tariffs have been very well received,” noting that the “stock market hit a new high.” The “softening” of initial tariff announcements has “removed the worst-case scenarios” for outlooks for economic growth and inflation, investors at BlackRock said in a note, which has supported the market’s rally. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers trading platform, told CNN that the rally has also been driven by momentum and a fear of missing out. “Ever since the president’s about-face in early April that turned the market around, a lot of money has been made basically by investors assuming that these tariffs will be postponed, renegotiated or otherwise watered down,” Sosnick said. “And if there’s a trade that works very well for people over a long period of time, they’re going to keep doing it.” Meanwhile, bitcoin last week surged to a record high above $123,000 as Republicans in Congress pressed forward with landmark legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies. Economists at the consultancy Capital Economics said in a note that they think the “US economy will weather the global trade war,” enabling the S&P 500 to rise further. However, they said, Trump’s “unpredictable approach” to trade and attacks on the Fed’s independence could “trigger” a downturn in stocks. “The widespread assumption among market participants still appears to be that the president will not follow through on threats to raise tariffs much further and that Chair Powell will remain in place, but that may prove too optimistic,” they said. The S&P 500 has not posted a gain or loss of more than 1% since June 24. It’s a sign that momentum has slowed down. Bitcoin traded around $119,000 as of Tuesday. Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, said she thinks markets might be complacent about potential risks, given stocks are historically expensive. While stocks and bonds have emerged relatively unscathed, one outlier is the US dollar, which has continued a precipitous decline. The US dollar index, which measures the dollar’s strength against six major foreign currencies, is down almost 11% since Trump took office. Gold and silver, meanwhile, have continued to serve as hedges against Trump’s trade uncertainty. The yellow and silver precious metals have soared 30% and 35% this year, respectively. The rally in recent months has been driven by retail investors, or individuals buying their own stocks, as opposed to Wall Street institutions, according to Venu Krishna, an equity strategist at Barclays. “Re-risking by institutional money remains muted, making it likely that retail investors were at the helm for the latest leg of the rally,” Krishna said. He estimates retail investors poured more than $50 billion into global stocks across the past month. Investors who bought the dip when markets dropped in April have been rewarded with an extraordinary march to fresh highs. The S&P 500 has gained almost 27% since its low point in April. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has soared almost 37%. Related article Wall Street is calling Trump’s bluff The smaller Nasdaq 100 has gone 62 days without crossing below its 20-day moving average, which is the second longest streak on record after a 77-day streak in 1999, according to Jonathan Krinsky, chief markets technician at investment firm BTIG. And Wall Street money that has been on the sidelines has been creeping back into the market. A survey of global fund managers in July by Bank of America showed the biggest surge in “risk appetite” on record. The survey also showed the most bullish sentiment since February. Ethan Harris, a market watcher and former economist at Bank of America, said in a post on LinkedIn that Trump’s tariff announcements could be characterized as “Trump always tries again,” as opposed to “Trump always chickens out.” “His aggressive announcements are a way to test what he can ‘get away with,’” Harris said. “Hence the steady flow of new threats, partial retreats and then more threats.” As stocks hold near record highs as Trump’s trade deadline approaches, it remains to be seen whether markets will push back on the president’s plan to disrupt international trade. “The bond vigilantes may or may not have started to make a comeback this year,” Harris said. “Will the stock market become the trade war vigilante or remain complacent?” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Strategic Plan for the United States to Accumulate 4 Million Bitcoin
URL: https://erickimphotography.com/blog/2025/07/23/strategic-plan-for-the-united-states-to-accumulate-4-million-bitcoin/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T06:25:26Z

Executive Summary The United States is embarking on a bold, 15-year strategic initiative to accumulate 4 million Bitcoin (BTC) as a national asset. This visionary plan spans short-term (1–3 years) foundational actions, mid-term (4–7 years) expansion, and long-term (8–15 years) consolidation. It mobilizes all sectors – federal and state governments, private corporations, financial institutions, the tech industry, and individual citizens – in a coordinated effort. The strategy is funded through innovative, budget-neutral mechanisms (leveraging existing reserves, redirected budgets, public-private investment, and blockchain-related revenues) and emphasizes ethical, legal acquisition methods (mining, market investment, ETFs, voluntary pooling, and international partnerships). Strategic objectives include enhancing economic resilience, diversifying national reserves, cementing blockchain technology leadership, and strengthening national security. This plan anticipates and addresses challenges such as market impact, global competition, regulatory frameworks, and environmental sustainability. The following report details a roadmap for this initiative, with clear milestones, roles for each stakeholder, and an inspirational vision of American leadership in the digital asset era. Introduction: A New Frontier in National Economic Strategy Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” has matured from a niche experiment into a credible strategic asset on the global stage . With its permanently capped supply of 21 million BTC, Bitcoin’s scarcity and security present a unique opportunity for nations that move early to incorporate it into their reserves . Just as the U.S. historically accumulated gold and foreign currency reserves, the time has come to thoughtfully manage national ownership of digital assets for prosperity . Other countries and forward-looking leaders have begun to recognize Bitcoin’s potential. The United States itself holds a significant amount of Bitcoin from forfeitures, but until recently had no comprehensive strategy to leverage these holdings . A turning point came with high-level proposals and actions in 2024–2025, including calls for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and legislation to acquire substantial BTC for the Treasury . These moves signaled that Bitcoin is entering the halls of U.S. fiscal policy as a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation . Why 4 million Bitcoin? This ambitious target – roughly 20% of Bitcoin’s eventual supply – would position America as the world’s largest Bitcoin holder, securing a dominant stake in the digital asset that could shape the future of finance. Holding such a reserve over decades is envisioned to strengthen the dollar’s resilience, hedge against economic volatility, and even help address the national debt by capitalizing on Bitcoin’s historical growth trajectory . While bold, this goal is in line with America’s tradition of thinking big and leading in new frontiers, from the space race to the internet revolution. Core Values and Principles: This strategy aligns with U.S. values of innovation, free enterprise, and individual liberty. It relies on voluntary, market-driven participation rather than coercion – there will be no forced appropriation of private Bitcoin holdings. Instead, the government will incentivize and inspire collective action. Transparency, rule of law, and respect for property rights will be upheld at every step. By embracing Bitcoin within a legal and ethical framework, the U.S. will demonstrate how democratic societies can innovate responsibly in the blockchain era. The following sections lay out the strategic objectives guiding this plan, the stakeholders involved and their roles, a phased roadmap across short, mid, and long-term horizons, funding sources and mechanisms, and considerations to mitigate risks. This comprehensive approach ensures that by 15 years from now, the United States will have not only accumulated 4 million BTC, but also solidified its position as the global leader in the digital asset economy – fostering prosperity, security, and technological leadership for generations to come. Strategic Objectives 1. Economic Resilience and Inflation Hedge Build a more resilient economy by holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Bitcoin’s provable scarcity makes it akin to a digital commodity that cannot be inflated at will . By allocating a portion of national reserves to BTC, the U.S. can protect wealth against currency debasement and reduce reliance on any single foreign creditor or currency. Over time, Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation (historically averaging ~55% annually ) offers the potential to strengthen the national balance sheet and even help pay down public debt as its value grows . This financial buffer would enhance stability during economic downturns or crises, providing a store of value that is uncorrelated to traditional markets and immune to foreign political influence . 2. Digital Reserve Diversification Complement traditional reserves (such as gold and foreign currencies) with digital reserves. Establishing a Bitcoin reserve diversifies the nation’s holdings into a 21st-century asset class . Just as gold bolsters confidence in a country’s financial footing, Bitcoin – with its decentralized, transparent network – can serve as a trust anchor in an increasingly digital global economy. A U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would be a portfolio diversifier and innovation signal , reducing dependence on dollar-centric systems while positioning the nation for a future where digital assets play a key role in global finance . This diversification is pragmatic: it hedges against potential weakness in other reserves and embraces the evolving monetary landscape. 3. Technological Leadership and Innovation Assert American leadership in blockchain technology and the emerging digital economy. A national effort to accumulate Bitcoin goes hand-in-hand with promoting innovation in the underlying technologies – from cybersecurity and cryptography to financial technology. By actively engaging with Bitcoin, the U.S. signals that it is the best place to develop and deploy blockchain innovations, attracting talent and investment. Strategic Bitcoin accumulation is a “statement of alignment with a digitally native economic future,” providing a blueprint that encourages private sector adoption and innovation . This objective includes fostering a robust domestic cryptocurrency industry, supporting research in energy-efficient mining and scalability, and setting global standards for blockchain use. Ultimately, it’s about ensuring the next generation of tech companies and protocols are made in America, securing our role as the global hub of blockchain development. 4. National Security and Geopolitical Influence Enhance national security by preventing strategic adversaries from dominating the crypto realm and by leveraging Bitcoin as a geopolitical asset. In the 21st century, economic security is national security. If Bitcoin and other digital assets become integral to the world financial system, the U.S. must not fall behind. A substantial BTC reserve gives America greater influence over the future of decentralized finance, much as our gold reserves bolstered our clout in the 20th century. It also acts as a neutral reserve asset that could reinforce alliances (for example, through coordinated accumulation or exchange agreements with allies) and provide options in sanction regimes or international aid (using BTC for humanitarian payments where traditional systems fail). By leading in Bitcoin ownership, the U.S. can help set global norms (for transparency, anti-money-laundering, cyber defense) and ensure that open societies, not authoritarian regimes, shape the rules of digital finance. As Senator Cynthia Lummis noted, Bitcoin’s strategic importance for the country is such that some call it “manifest destiny for the United States” – a new frontier to secure for the nation’s freedom and prosperity. These objectives are interlocking and mutually reinforcing. Economic strength supports security; technological leadership fuels economic growth; reserve diversification aids resilience; and all enhance America’s standing in the world. With the “why” established, we now turn to the “how” – the stakeholders and strategies that will deliver on these objectives. Key Stakeholders and Their Roles Achieving a goal as ambitious as accumulating 4 million BTC requires a “whole-of-America” approach, engaging public and private sectors as well as individual citizens. Each stakeholder group has unique strengths to contribute: All these actors will coordinate under a shared vision. A National Digital Assets Task Force can be established to ensure communication and synergy between federal agencies, state governments, industry leaders, and community representatives. Regular summits and progress reports will keep everyone aligned. The message is clear: every American can be part of this endeavor, and everyone stands to benefit from the innovation, wealth creation, and security enhancements it will bring. Strategic Roadmap by Timeframe The journey to 4 million Bitcoin is mapped out in three phases – short-term, mid-term, and long-term – each with specific initiatives and milestones. This phased approach ensures steady progress while allowing assessment and course-correction at each stage. Importantly, actions are designed to minimize market disruption (accumulating gradually and via multiple avenues) and remain flexible to technological and economic developments. Short-Term (1–3 Years): Laying the Foundation Goals (1–3 years): Establish the legal, institutional, and infrastructural groundwork for large-scale Bitcoin accumulation. Kickstart the reserve with existing assets, enact supportive policies, and galvanize private sector involvement – all while raising public awareness. Early moves are budget-neutral or low-cost, relying on reallocated resources and voluntary participation to avoid burdening taxpayers. Milestones for Phase 1: With the foundation laid and early momentum achieved, the stage is set to accelerate into the mid-term phase. Mid-Term (4–7 Years): Scaling Up and Integration Goals (4–7 years): Rapidly scale the accumulation efforts while integrating Bitcoin more deeply into U.S. economic structures. In this phase, the aim is to go from hundreds of thousands of BTC to millions of BTC under American ownership. The federal government, having proven the concept and established trust in phase 1, can expand its holdings more aggressively (market conditions permitting), and the private sector’s involvement becomes self-sustaining. This phase will likely coincide with greater global attention – both cooperation and competition – which the U.S. must navigate wisely. Milestones for Phase 2: At the end of the mid-term phase, the U.S. should be well on its way to the 4 million BTC goal, possibly around halfway there, and the foundations of a crypto-powered economy fully laid. The final phase will focus on securing the gains and leveraging them for enduring advantage. Long-Term (8–15 Years): Leadership, Preservation, and Prosperity Goals (8–15 years): By this phase, the United States envisions reaching the 4 million BTC target and solidifying the permanence of Bitcoin in its national asset mix. The focus shifts from aggressive accumulation to sustainable management and utilization of the reserve as needed for the national interest (without ever undermining Bitcoin’s ecosystem). America’s leadership in the blockchain space should be unquestioned by year 15, and the strategic Bitcoin reserve serves as a foundation for economic strength, much like gold did in previous eras. This period also involves adapting to any new developments (technological, geopolitical) that could affect our Bitcoin strategy. Milestones for Phase 3: Funding Sources and Mechanisms A variety of funding sources and mechanisms are employed across these phases to finance Bitcoin accumulation in a sustainable, ethical manner. Below is a summary of key funding approaches, emphasizing creativity and public-private collaboration: All these funding sources share a common theme: they are ethical, transparent, and largely voluntary/market-driven. The plan pointedly avoids any coercive measures like forced confiscation or heavy new taxation that would contradict the values of a free economy. By tapping into existing value, future growth, and willing participation, the U.S. can accumulate Bitcoin in a way that strengthens rather than burdens the nation. It’s worth noting that as Bitcoin’s price potentially grows, the dollar cost of reaching 4 million BTC will increase. Thus, early funding (short-term) gets more “bang for buck” in BTC terms, while later on the focus might shift to maximizing value of holdings rather than chasing a numeric BTC total at any cost. Flexibility in funding strategy will be maintained – if Bitcoin’s market is overheated, the U.S. can pause buys and rely more on mining or wait for corrections, for example. Ethical, Legal, and Security Considerations A plan of this magnitude raises important ethical and legal considerations, which are addressed proactively to ensure the initiative upholds American values and the rule of law: In summary, the ethical and legal framework surrounding this strategy is robust: voluntary, transparent, lawful, and responsible. The plan is designed to amplify the best of American capitalism and democracy – using open markets and free choice to achieve a national goal – while putting checks in place to curb excesses or missteps. This strategic journey will be one carried out in the public eye, inviting input and scrutiny, which will only strengthen its execution. Conclusion: A Future-Focused Vision for American Prosperity Fifteen years from now, Americans will look back on this initiative as a pivotal chapter in our nation’s economic story – the moment we seized the opportunity of a digital frontier and made it our own. By accumulating 4 million bitcoins, the United States positions itself not only to benefit from the growth of a revolutionary asset but also to steer that revolution in accordance with our values of freedom, transparency, and innovation. This comprehensive plan harnesses the collective power of federal resolve, state creativity, private sector dynamism, and individual enthusiasm. It is inspirational and optimistic by design: it says that America’s best days are not behind us, but ahead on a new horizon of blockchain technology and digital finance. Just as past generations rallied to ambitious national endeavors – building the transcontinental railroad, landing on the moon, inventing the internet – we too rally to make the U.S. the guiding light in the crypto era. By pursuing this strategy, the U.S. will enjoy a more resilient and diversified economy, new waves of tech entrepreneurship, and a strengthened geopolitical hand. We will have shown that embracing change, rather than fearing it, is the surest path to long-term prosperity and security. The strategic Bitcoin reserve, once a novel idea, will become a cornerstone of national strength – a digital complement to Fort Knox, symbolizing American ingenuity in the 21st century. There will undoubtedly be challenges along the way: market fluctuations, technical hurdles, perhaps political debates. But as laid out, we have plans to navigate these – cautiously, transparently, and boldly when needed. The involvement of all stakeholders means this vision does not belong to one party or administration, but to all Americans. It can and should unite us in common purpose, much like great infrastructure or exploration projects of the past. In conclusion, this strategic plan is more than an economic play – it’s a statement to the world that America remains the land of forward-looking visionaries, unafraid to invest in the future. It invites every citizen, entrepreneur, and public servant to be a part of forging a new legacy. Together, we are not just accumulating coins; we are building a foundation of economic freedom, technological leadership, and national renewal that will support the American Dream for generations to come. Let us proceed with confidence, creativity, and unity on this path. The digital frontier is ours to lead – and in doing so, we will secure the blessings of prosperity and security for ourselves and our posterity, in the true spirit of the United States of America.

Title: Will Bitcoin will soar past $200,000 within five years?

Key points: Bitcoinâs path to $200,000 hinges on sustained buying volume, which analysts say is still lacking. Trumpâs presidency has already accelerated Bitcoinâs adoption through policies favoring crypto and fiscal expansion. Institutional demand via ETFs and geopolitical uncertainty are driving Bitcoinâs appeal as a "digital gold" alternative. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoinâs current cycle may have limited months of growth left before stabilization. The $200,000 question: Patience or pipe dream? James Checkâs analysis cuts through the hype. While Bitcoin breached 120,000 in July 2024, he insists the journey to 200,000 requires "stages of stability," not just spikes. "Trading through air" without solid support risks a nosedive, he cautionsâa reminder of cryptoâs volatile soul. Yet his long-term faith is unshaken: five years out, he envisions Bitcoin "well and truly" surpassing $200,000, a belief mirrored by firms like Bernstein Research and Bitwise. The paradox? Retail euphoria clashes with institutional pragmatism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, have funneled billions into the market, but Check waits for "volume kick-in" before betting big. "No one knows" Bitcoinâs exact path, he admitsâa humble mantra in an industry obsessed with crystal balls. Trumpâs wildcard: Crypto politics meets fiscal fireworks Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply. Based on Kendrick's projections and historical Bitcoin market cycles, hereâs what would likely need to happen: 1. Sustained Bull Market Momentum Bitcoin is in the "euphoria phase" of a bull run, where FOMO (fear of missing out) drives rapid price appreciation. A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2. Supply Shock & Halving Dynamics The 2024 Bitcoin halving reduced the new supply of BTC by 50%. Historically, halvings trigger major bull runs ~12â18 months later due to reduced selling pressure from miners. If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues. Rekt Capital flags 2020âs patternsâif repeated, Bitcoinâs 2024 bull run might exhaust itself by mid-2025. Meanwhile, supply shocks loom. Bitwiseâs Matt Hougan points to institutional demand outstripping new Bitcoin minted post-halving, a recipe for price explosions. Retail investors, burned by 2022âs crash, are tiptoeing back. September 2024 saw ETF inflows revive after Augustâs slump, signaling renewed faith. But as CME futures open interest quadruples in 2024, the question lingers: Is this institutional confidence or speculative froth? Beyond charts and elections, Bitcoinâs saga taps into a deeper hungerâfor financial autonomy amid distrust of centralized systems. The original vision of decentralization battles against Wall Streetâs embrace, a tension Check acknowledges. "The market needs stabilized," he says, voicing a quiet plea for maturity in an adolescent asset class. Whether 2025 becomes Bitcoinâs coronation or another chapter in its volatile epic, one truth endures: in a world of shaky currencies and political turmoil, people crave alternatives. Bitcoin, while it may be more risky than ever, it continues to provide unyielding gains. Will it continue to be the lifeline to combat inflation in the coming years? Sources include: CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com Key points: Bitcoinâs path to $200,000 hinges on sustained buying volume, which analysts say is still lacking. Trumpâs presidency has already accelerated Bitcoinâs adoption through policies favoring crypto and fiscal expansion. Institutional demand via ETFs and geopolitical uncertainty are driving Bitcoinâs appeal as a "digital gold" alternative. Historical patterns suggest Bitcoinâs current cycle may have limited months of growth left before stabilization. The $200,000 question: Patience or pipe dream? James Checkâs analysis cuts through the hype. While Bitcoin breached 120,000 in July 2024, he insists the journey to 200,000 requires "stages of stability," not just spikes. "Trading through air" without solid support risks a nosedive, he cautionsâa reminder of cryptoâs volatile soul. Yet his long-term faith is unshaken: five years out, he envisions Bitcoin "well and truly" surpassing $200,000, a belief mirrored by firms like Bernstein Research and Bitwise. The paradox? Retail euphoria clashes with institutional pragmatism. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, approved in early 2024, have funneled billions into the market, but Check waits for "volume kick-in" before betting big. "No one knows" Bitcoinâs exact path, he admitsâa humble mantra in an industry obsessed with crystal balls. Trumpâs wildcard: Crypto politics meets fiscal fireworks Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply.

If demand remains constant or increases while new supply shrinks, scarcity could push prices toward $200K or higher. 3. Institutional Adoption & ETF Approvals Spot Bitcoin ETF approvals (e.g., BlackRock, Fidelity) would funnel trillions in institutional capital into BTC. Major corporations adding BTC to balance sheets (MicroStrategy-style moves) would further squeeze supply. 4. Macroeconomic Tailwinds A weaker U.S. dollar (due to rate cuts, inflation, or debt crises) would make Bitcoin more attractive as hard money. Geopolitical instability (e.g., currency collapses, wars) could drive "safe-haven" demand. 5. Network & Ecosystem Growth Layer-2 adoption (Lightning Network, Ordinals) increases BTCâs utility, attracting more users. Regulatory clarity (e.g., pro-crypto laws) reduces uncertainty, encouraging capital inflows. History whispers: Cycles, shocks, and the retail reckoning Bitcoinâs past cycles offer cryptic clues. Rekt Capital flags 2020âs patternsâif repeated, Bitcoinâs 2024 bull run might exhaust itself by mid-2025. Meanwhile, supply shocks loom. Bitwiseâs Matt Hougan points to institutional demand outstripping new Bitcoin minted post-halving, a recipe for price explosions. Retail investors, burned by 2022âs crash, are tiptoeing back. September 2024 saw ETF inflows revive after Augustâs slump, signaling renewed faith. But as CME futures open interest quadruples in 2024, the question lingers: Is this institutional confidence or speculative froth? Beyond charts and elections, Bitcoinâs saga taps into a deeper hungerâfor financial autonomy amid distrust of centralized systems. The original vision of decentralization battles against Wall Streetâs embrace, a tension Check acknowledges. "The market needs stabilized," he says, voicing a quiet plea for maturity in an adolescent asset class. Whether 2025 becomes Bitcoinâs coronation or another chapter in its volatile epic, one truth endures: in a world of shaky currencies and political turmoil, people crave alternatives. Bitcoin, while it may be more risky than ever, it continues to provide unyielding gains. Will it continue to be the lifeline to combat inflation in the coming years? Sources include: CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com CoinTelegraph.com Enter Donald Trump and the economic wins since then. A November 2024 victory rewrote Bitcoinâs playbook. JPMorgan notes Trumpâs pro-crypto stanceâpledging to dethrone SEC chair Gary Gensler and embrace "debt debasement" via tariffs and fiscal spendingâmight turbocharge the "debasement trade." Imagine small Bitcoin handouts to citizens or a White House push for a $1 trillion market cap. Such moves could divert attention from gold, reshaping portfolios worldwide. But Trumpâs policies are a double-edged sword. Expansionary fiscal measures might fuel inflation, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more appealing. Yet regulatory clarity could lure institutional players, stabilizing Bitcoinâs notoriously mercurial markets. Reaching a $200,000 Bitcoin Reaching a $200,000 per Bitcoin price would require a combination of technical, macroeconomic, and psychological factors driving demand higher than supply. Based on Kendrick's projections and historical Bitcoin market cycles, hereâs what would likely need to happen: 1. Sustained Bull Market Momentum Bitcoin is in the "euphoria phase" of a bull run, where FOMO (fear of missing out) drives rapid price appreciation. A continuation of this trend for 12â24 months could propel BTC toward $200K, especially if institutional and retail demand remains strong. 2.

Title: ONDO price rallies on 21Shares’ ETF filing and major exchange listing
URL: https://coinjournal.net/news/ondo-price-rallies-on-21shares-etf-filing-and-major-exchange-listing/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T05:27:37Z

Ondo Finance’s native coin signals imminent breakouts despite the broad market cool down, fueled by two key developments. First and foremost, asset manager 21Shares has filed with the US SEC to launch an ONDO exchange-traded fund (ETF). Secondly, Binance US confirmed listing the altcoin, with trading starting today, July 23. ONDO soared from the daily low of $1.0583 to $1.1642, a 10% increase, as the bullish news sparked bullish momentum. ONDO is at the center of Ondo Finance’s goal of bringing traditional assets on-chain. With interest in real-world asset (RWA) platforms skyrocketing, 21Shares and Binance US’ moves could not be better as retail and institutional investors seek Ondo exposure. The crypto has witnessed a surge in institutional appetite, with giants like BlackRock showing interest. MasterCard tapped Ondo Finance as its first RWA provider, while Ripple leveraged the blockchain to launch OUSG on its XRPL. 21Shares increases Ondo’s institutional appeal with the latest ETF application. JUST IN: 21SHARES FILES FOR $ONDO ETF WITH U.S. SEC — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) July 22, 2025 The move confirms that traditional finance (TradiFi) is targeting the tokenization sector seriously. Moreover, seeking SEC authorization underscores the asset manager’s commitment to compliance and innovation in the tokenized sector of RWAs and DeFi. This is more than another cryptocurrency product. Ondo Finance remains at the core of the current trend of bringing real-world assets like US Treasuries, credit instruments, and bonds on-chain. Last week, Ondo Finance collaborated with BNB Chain to introduce tokenized equities in the United States. 21Shares’ proposed exchange-traded fund would offer cryptocurrency enthusiasts exposure to ONDO via licensed platforms, without brokerage sites. A leading crypto exchange in the United States, Binance US, confirmed listing Ondo Finance’s token on its trading platform. It opened deposits on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain yesterday, with ONDO/USDT trading set to start today. The official announcement read: We’re excited to announce that ONDO is now listed on Binance.US! Deposits for ONDO on the Ethereum network are now open. Trading for ONDO/USDT will begin tomorrow, July 23, 2025, at 4 a.m. / 7 a.m. EDT. Deposits for $ONDO are now open on https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS! Trading on the ONDO/USDT pair will begin on July 23 at 7 a.m. EDT.@OndoFoundation is a project that brings institutional-grade financial products onchain by tokenizing real-world assets.https://t.co/oTqaNwyhtO pic.twitter.com/QM5nJpn5hK — Binance.US 🇺🇸 (@BinanceUS) July 22, 2025 The listing is vital as it makes the ONDO token accessible to the massive American retail audience. Moreover, listing on leading exchanges often acts as a Launchpad for many tokens. More US citizens can now trade ONDO without depending on overseas platforms or decentralized exchanges. Ondo Finance’s native coin attracted attention amidst the optimistic developments. It trades at $1.11 after a brief correction from daily highs. Meanwhile, the surging 24-hour trading volume highlights renewed interest in the RWA token, hinting at continued uptrend. Technical indicators support the short-term momentum shift. For example, the MACD on the 3H chart displays green histograms after a bullish crossover, signaling a buyer comeback. Also, the Chaikin Money Flow shows increased ONDO accumulation over the past week. Such trends indicate trust in the token’s near-term performance. Ondo Finance bull target the late January price levels above $1.60. Overcoming this level could catalyze smooth gains to the psychological level at $2.

Title: Grayscale’s ETF chief David LaValle to leave ahead of company’s IPO: Unchained
URL: https://cryptobriefing.com/grayscale-etf-leadership-ipo/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T04:04:15Z
Full Content:
Share this article Grayscale’s global head of ETFs, David LaValle, is stepping down at the end of July, closing out a four-year chapter marked by key milestones in the firm’s crypto ETF push, including the conversion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot ETF, Unchained reported Tuesday. LaValle joined Grayscale in August 2021 when its flagship Bitcoin fund held approximately $25 billion in assets, making it the world’s largest crypto asset manager at the time. In August 2023, Grayscale won a landmark victory over the SEC, which laid important legal groundwork for the eventual approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and opened the door for asset managers to ramp up efforts to bring other crypto funds to Wall Street. But the court victory also set the stage for intensified competition. It allowed fund management giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity, to enter the crypto ETF space with confidence. With the launch of their own Bitcoin ETFs at far lower management fees, these industry titans quickly attracted institutional capital and retail investors. Grayscale’s Bitcoin and Ethereum products, which generate the majority of its income, charge fees of 1.5% and 2.5% respectively. In comparison, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF charges 0.25%. Grayscale has since lost its position as the world’s largest crypto asset manager to BlackRock, which now manages nearly $88 billion in its iShares Bitcoin Trust. GBTC’s assets currently stand at approximately $22 billion. LaValle’s departure comes as Grayscale is gearing toward an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. The company confidentially submitted a draft registration statement to the SEC last week. Apart from going public, Grayscale is also seeking approval to launch numerous spot crypto ETFs, including those tied to Ethereum, Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, Cardano, and other leading digital assets. Earlier this month, the SEC approved Grayscale’s application to convert the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into an ETF through staff’s delegated authority. However, just one day after this approval, the SEC’s commissioners decided to stay the approval for an internal review, effectively halting the fund’s launch temporarily.

Title: Ethereum Off The Hook: SEC Chair Rules ETH A Commodity, Not A Security
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-off-the-hook-sec-chair-rules-eth-is-not-a-security/
Time Published: 2025-07-23T01:30:50Z

According to CNBC, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said the Commission treats Ethereum like Bitcoin. He made it clear that securities laws won’t apply to the digital coin. He also noted that this view remains informal until a formal rule‑making is complete. In his words, “Similar to Bitcoin, the SEC has stated informally more than formally that ether is not a security.” That statement gave many investors relief and drove fresh buying by big firms. Paul Atkins: ETH Is Not a Security, Digital Assets Are Being Embraced by the Market Paul Atkins, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov), stated that the SEC “informally” considers Ethereum (ETH) not to be a security. He noted that, like Bitcoin,… pic.twitter.com/hhomO7SEFf — MetaEra (@MetaEraHK) July 21, 2025 Based on reports, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force has held multiple roundtable talks this year. Industry leaders joined to discuss which federal laws apply to crypto. Under Gary Gensler, the agency probed tokens for possible securities status, but never gave a straight answer on ether. Now Atkins says Ethereum is seen as a commodity. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has long said Ether and Bitcoin are commodities. Yet uncertainty lingers around whether staking rewards count as income or tokens. Major companies are stacking up Ether on their balance sheets. BTCS, SharpLink Gaming and Gamesquare lead the pack. They’ve added millions of dollars’ worth of ETH in recent weeks. One startup, Ether Machine, plans a public debut backed by $1.6 billion in Ethereum capital. That figure shows how confident some treasury teams have become. ETF Flows Break Records And Prices Follow ETH‑focused funds have smashed their daily inflow records. Based on ETF data, new money into ethereum products hit an all‑time high this month. The buzz around these vehicles has pushed Ether’s price to $3,639. It’s up over 24% in the last seven days. Traders say they see more room to grow if regulators stick to Atkins’ remarks. Applications for Ethereum staking ETFs remain on hold. BlackRock filed its proposal months ago, but the SEC has delayed any green light. Some companies worry that staking payouts could be deemed securities or income under tax laws. CFTC head Rostin Behnam continues to back the view of Ether as a commodity. But without clear SEC guidance, players in DeFi and staking pools face unanswered questions.

Title: Why Does Raising the Retirement Age Hurt Young People?
URL: https://www.governance.fyi/p/why-does-raising-the-retirement-age
Time Published: 2025-07-23T00:27:20Z
Full Content:
A friend forwarded me a Twitter conversation he thought I would find interesting. The thread started innocuously enough. Lyman Stone was responding to Moses Sternstein analysis about the COVID "pull-forward" retirement wave: millions of people who retired earlier than planned during the pandemic, creating the "labor shortage" that drove wages and inflation up. "What I love about this is how clearly it reveals a fundamental problem: When retirees KEEP WORKING, the effect on career progress and wages for younger workers is... NEGATIVE! Which is why raising the retirement age will not balance Social Security as much as OASDI predicts." He made an interesting claim: "In fact, virtually all cuts to Social Security work this way: if you reduce Social Security, retirees keep working longer, employers are hesitant to fire senior workers, etc. One of many interactions OASDI does not actually entertain!" Stone had articulated something I'd been sensing but couldn't quite name. The standard rhetoric used to justify Social Security cuts and increase retirement ages completely ignores how those cuts destroy younger workers' careers. When someone asked him for solutions, his answer was blunt: "There's no solution except higher birth rates or rapid productivity growth." The idea of delayed retirement crushes young workers' advancement prospects seems like a no brainer (that somehow never brought up in debates on raising the retirement age of Social Security), but something else is still missing.

Business formation hit records with over 5.5 million new companies registered in 2023 alone. GDP growth remains robust. Young people are told they have options: get a college degree for white-collar work, or skip the debt and go into trades for "more secure" jobs with six-figure salaries, freedom to work for yourself, and hands-on skills that can't be outsourced to AI. The Reality: Workers under 40 report feeling trapped in "career purgatory." We are seeing a rise of long-term unemployment, declining hiring rates, and college graduates struggling to find work even in jobs that don't require degrees. Career advancement feels nearly impossible. Home ownership and family formation rates continue declining among young adults. If you are unemployed, you face Great Recession-level risks of long-term unemployment, and if you become long-term unemployed, the prospects for recovery are dire with a good chance it's just game over. The crisis now affects both paths young people were told to follow. Graduate unemployment has climbed above the overall unemployment rate for the first time on record. Male graduate unemployment rose from less than 5% to 7% over the past 12 months, completely erasing the college employability premium. Recently graduated young men are now unemployed at the same rate as their non-graduate counterparts. But the trades aren't offering refuge either. Despite the narrative about trade jobs being safer, building inspectors, electricians, and plumbers face unemployment rates of 7.2%, more than three times that of (formerly) entry-level office jobs like budget analysts. Trade roles dominate the bottom of rankings for best entry-level jobs, with welders, automotive mechanics, and boilermakers among the least promising career starters. After years of analysis blaming millennials' economic struggles on smartphone addiction and delayed maturity, observers like Jean Twenge now wonder why young people still aren't having families despite 'good' economic indicators, besides blaming it on the phones or whatever excuse to blame someone for not having economic stability. The disconnect suggests these commentators were looking in the wrong place all along. The disconnect suggests we're overlooking a crucial mechanism in how the modern economy actually works. Stone's insight provided the first clue. The COVID-19 pandemic accidentally created the largest unplanned retirement experiment in modern American history, providing crucial evidence for solving our mystery. During the COVID crisis, the Federal Reserve documented over 2.4 million "excess retirees": people who left the labor force above what pre-pandemic trends would have predicted. This wasn't simply early retirement by choice. The pull-forward was heavily concentrated among workers aged 55 and older without college degrees, particularly those in jobs that couldn't be performed remotely. These weren't the highly compensated professionals who could afford early retirement; they were often the most economically vulnerable workers, caught between virus exposure and business shutdowns. The sudden exodus created an immediate labor shortage that drove unprecedented wage growth, especially for the youngest workers. From the fourth quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2023, nominal wages grew by an extraordinary 25% for workers aged 16-19 and 28% for those aged 20-24. This far outpaced the 18% growth for prime-age workers and the mere 13% for workers aged 55 and older. Young workers suddenly had bargaining power they hadn't experienced in decades. The "Great Resignation" saw millions of low-wage workers quit for better pay and conditions. Entry-level positions that had been scarce suddenly offered signing bonuses. But by 2023, the excess retirements had been absorbed back into expected demographic patterns. The dramatic wage growth slowed. The labor market "normalized" except for one puzzling feature: simultaneous low unemployment and low job growth. Who doesn’t get hired if there are no jobs? People currently unemployed, who are disproportionately under the age of 35. The youth labor market reveals the deeper structural problems. While overall unemployment appears benign, the youth unemployment rate in OECD member countries stood at 11.49% in 2024, consistently and significantly higher than that for the adult population, with December 2024, the OECD youth unemployment rate was 7.0 percentage points higher than the rate for workers aged 25 and over. Nine OECD countries reported youth unemployment rates above 20% as recently as April 2024. More troubling is the quality of available jobs. In the European Union, an analysis covering the period from 1985 to 2019 found that the wages of workers over the age of 55 grew nearly twice as fast as those of workers under 35, an increase in the age wage gap of 96%. A 2020 Brookings Institution analysis found that "44% of all U.S. workers (53 million people) earn low wages, with a median hourly pay of just $10.22." Critically, two-thirds of these low-wage workers are in their prime working years (25-54), and over half work full-time, year-round. Young people are disproportionately funneled into precarious employment. Across the EU, a staggering 43.3% of employed 15- to 24-year-olds were on fixed-term contracts in 2015, a figure more than three times higher than the 14.1% rate for the overall workforce. In countries like Slovenia, Poland, and Spain, the share of young workers on temporary contracts exceeded 70%. The COVID experiment revealed how retirement timing affects youth opportunities, but it was temporary. Stone's insight points to a more persistent problem: what happens when retirement is systematically delayed rather than accelerated, especially as countries are pushing for later and later retirements. To understand the full impact, we need to look inside individual companies. Fortunately, detailed firm-level studies provide concrete evidence of exactly how this mechanism works. Firm-level studies from Europe provide concrete evidence for Stone's thesis. When older workers delay retirement by just one year, the effects on their younger colleagues are immediate and severe: annual wage growth drops by 2.3% to 2.5%. More dramatically, the number of younger workers promoted into managerial roles falls by nearly 50%. For white-collar positions, promotions drop by about 21%. This isn't about overall employment levels. This is about the internal architecture of firms. When the person above you doesn't retire, your promotion doesn't happen. When promotions don't happen, wage growth stagnates. When wage growth stagnates across an economy, you get exactly what we're seeing: low unemployment that somehow doesn't feel like a tight labor market. The phenomenon even has a name: "occupational downgrading." Skilled young workers, unable to advance in their chosen fields, take lower-skill positions just to maintain employment. An engineering graduate becomes a technician. A business school graduate takes an administrative role. The human capital that should be driving productivity growth gets systematically underutilized. It accounts for why there are fewer management positions available and why career advancement has become so difficult, why wage growth has been disappointing despite low unemployment, and showcases a significant blind spot in Social Security policy modeling. This explains why young people struggle to advance in their careers, but it doesn't explain why they're also struggling to start careers. Something else is affecting career entry. Promotion bottlenecks shouldn't prevent companies, especially newer companies, from hiring new graduates for entry-level positions. Young workers should still be able to start their careers, even if advancement is slow (or lets be honest here, it’s non existent), because if an economy grows there should be demand for highly educated (cheaper and more disposable, increasingly on contract) workers and technicians. Instead, we are seeing the opposite trend This Substack is reader-supported. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Share If the problem were purely demographic, we should see strong job creation at entry-level positions as businesses expand to meet demand with available younger workers. We should see new businesses forming to take advantage of all that skilled young talent being held back by promotion bottlenecks, especially at cheaper prices and destroyed expectations. The only ones hiring young workers right now are gig apps like DoorDash, Uber, and OnlyFans. These platforms were designed for extra cash, not full-time jobs. When college graduates are driving for Uber or delivering food as their main source of income, that shows how completely the traditional job market has broken down. Instead, we see the opposite. Between 2020 and 2023, new software company formation fell by 86% in the US, 89% in Israel, and 87% in the EU. Something is systematically choking off the creation of new companies, in addition to the current Fed Rates, that would typically absorb young workers eager to start their careers. As former investment banker Darin Soat of How Money Works has documented, this problem becomes clear when examining broader American market data. Despite record business formation in recent years, the number of publicly traded companies has collapsed. In 1996, 8,090 companies were publicly listed on American stock markets. Today, despite the economy being three times larger and markets handling seven times more capital, fewer than 4,000 companies trade publicly. This decline matters because new businesses are the primary engine of net job creation in developed economies. The Census Bureau shows a decades-long downward trend in the establishment entry rate, from around 14% in the early 1980s to about 10% in recent years. This decline in business dynamism directly translates into fewer new jobs per business, slower aggregate wage growth, and a less competitive marketplace. Startups/Scaleups/SMEs don't just create jobs. They create the right kinds of jobs for young workers at all levels of education, from accountants, marketers, customer service, etc etc . New companies typically hire younger workers who are willing to accept lower initial wages in exchange for rapid skill development, promotion opportunities, and equity stakes. Established companies prefer experienced workers for most positions and use their established hierarchies for advancement. When new business formation (besides sole props and gig contractors) collapses, it eliminates the primary mechanism by which young workers enter the professional workforce outside of service industries. Young workers face constraints from two directions: fewer promotion opportunities within existing firms (due to delayed retirement) and fewer alternative career paths at new firms (due to declining business formation). What's happening to all these businesses? They're getting bought before they can grow. The venture capital industry figured out it's more profitable to build companies specifically to sell them than to actually compete. M&A activity fundamentally disrupts workforces. When companies combine, "overlapping functions in areas like human resources, marketing, finance, and administration are deemed redundant," leading to job cuts that "disproportionately affect the employees of the acquired company."¹ More systemically, M&A increases employer market power. A detailed study of takeovers in the Netherlands found that even four years after an acquisition, workers from the target firm earned, on average, 2.8% less in labor market income and worked 7.3% fewer hours. Research on hospital mergers found that in deals that significantly increased market concentration, annual wage growth for skilled workers was suppressed by as much as 1.7 percentage points, i.e. eroding nearly a third of typical yearly wage growth. Just to show why companies acquire smaller companies, a study tracking over 35,000 drug development projects found that "about 6.4% of all acquisitions were killer acquisitions" (deals where incumbents buy competitors specifically to shut them down.) In the technology sector, the five largest tech firms made 175 acquisitions between 2015 and 2017 alone, and subsequently discontinued more than 60% of the acquired products or services. This creates what has been termed "kill zones" around dominant platforms. Potential entrepreneurs and their investors see little point in developing competing products, knowing they will likely be either copied or acquired and buried by the incumbent. The net result is an economy with fewer large employers, a dearth of new employers, and a suppressed rate of innovation. Private equity firms now control vastly more capital than in 2000, keeping promising companies private rather than letting them go public. Seven companies now control 34.1% of the entire S&P 500, up from just 16.2% for the top ten companies in 2015. The same three asset management firms (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) hold major stakes in competing companies across entire industries, using funds from pensions, both public and private, to consolidate control. When your biggest shareholders own all your competitors, competition becomes coordination. The traditional escape route for young workers (jumping to a growing startup) gets systematically eliminated through acquisition before those companies can scale and offer genuine career opportunities. A case study from American Affairs Magazine (Scale-Up Nation: The Role of IP-Transfer Restrictions in Israel’s Industrial Policy by Erez Maggor) provides evidence of this dynamic. Erez Maggor's analysis of Israel's industrial policy shows how the conflict between building domestic champions and optimizing for M&A exits affect young workers. Phase One: Building Industrial Capacity (1970s-1990s) From the 1970s to 1990s, Israel had a simple rule: if you take government money for research, you have to build your factories in Israel and keep your intellectual property here. The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) administered this system with strict conditions: "all products emerging out of OCS-funded projects must be manufactured exclusively in Israel, and the IP created during the R&D stage must not be transferred beyond the state's borders." As former chief scientist Dr. Yehoshua Gleitman explained: "We want to help nurture an industry that will employ workers." The system worked. Given Imaging, which pioneered endoscopy capsule technology, was required to establish manufacturing in Israel and eventually employed close to a thousand workers.⁵ Phase Two: The "Start-up Nation" Model (1990s-Present) Then in 1993, Israel launched Yozma, spending $100 million to create venture capital funds. The new rule was simple: build startups fast and sell them for maximum profit. In 2005, the R&D Law was reformed, lifting "the outright ban on the transfer of IP and replacing it with a fee." The results looked impressive. Israel became the "Start-up Nation" with record $15.8 billion in acquisition deals in 2024. But instead of building the next Intel in Israel, entrepreneurs built companies specifically to be bought by Intel. When Intel bought Mobileye for $15.3 billion in 2017, Israel lost what could have been their first major car technology company. The Employment Impact The employment effects were dramatic. "For each employee of an Israeli high-tech manufacturer, two additional local jobs in nonmanufacturing industries are created. Each R&D center employee, on the other hand, creates only one-third of an additional job." Despite billions in exits, most Israelis didn't benefit from the tech boom. As Dan Breznitz observed: "During the years of extreme high-tech growth, the rest of the economy enjoyed no positive spillovers." Policy Choice, Not Market Forces Israel's experience proves these outcomes are policy choices, not natural market forces. The original OCS model successfully built industrial capacity through government intervention. The Yozma model destroyed it through different government intervention. Both were deliberate policy designs with completely different incentive structures. The same pattern emerges in American data. The collapse in publicly traded companies didn't happen because markets naturally consolidate. It happened because policy changes made private equity more attractive, merger review standards weakened, and tax policies favor quick exits over long-term building. When the same asset managers own competing firms across entire industries, it's the breakdown of competition rather than some market efficiency. The Israeli case study proves that what we call "market outcomes" are actually the result of specific government policy choices about how to structure incentives. Stone's retirement insight and the business formation collapse work together to create a perfect trap for young workers. The Pincer Movement Traditionally, workers blocked from promotion had an escape route: jump to a growing company with rapid advancement opportunities. But that safety valve no longer exists. The same forces that make advancement impossible within firms should create demand for ambitious young talent at new companies. Instead, new companies are systematically eliminated through acquisition before they can scale. The Result You can't advance at your current job because delayed retirement blocks promotions. You can't jump to a growing startup because they're designed for quick acquisition, not independent growth. You can't realistically start your own company because you lack the capital, connections, and safety net required, and even if you could, the venture capital system optimizes for exits, not competition. This explains the central paradox: how an economy can simultaneously produce impressive headline statistics (low unemployment, record business formation) while systematically destroying career pathways for an entire generation. We're measuring business creation while ignoring business elimination. We're tracking job numbers while missing job quality. The economy has been optimized for metrics that look good in policy reports while undermining the mechanisms young workers need to build successful careers. The solution requires practical action, not more measurement. There is a lot to discuss on things, both big and small, which is out of scope for this article. We do need to abandon failed approaches. We can't cut Social Security/public pensions, impose means testing, or raise retirement ages. These worsen promotion bottlenecks. We can't pretend what's happened to young people since 2008 is acceptable. On that note, Blanket forced retirement would be destructive, especially for founder-led companies, which could nasty long term side effects. There is no way getting out of this except by boosting birth rates and achieve rapid economic growth. Not the failed post-2008 methods of financial engineering or wishcasting, but genuine good governance especially in industrial, youth, and familu policies. If I am forced to give you a starting point, it would be with energy. As mattparlmer documents in "America Can Beat China on Energy," Chinese manufacturers pay $0.09/kWh while California companies pay $0.24/kWh. When electrons cost three times more on one side of an ocean, industrial capacity goes to the other side. A massive American energy buildout targeting $0.01/kWh electricity would create millions of jobs across skill levels: electricians, engineers, technicians, project managers. Real careers with advancement potential, not gig work. It requires a lot of political will, YIMBY reforms, the willingness to tax the upper crust until the Fed and bond markets are forced to be reasonable about cost of capital without giving them a tribute of unemployment, and stepping on a lot of other people’s toes. Erez Maggor's Israeli case study shows how government investment can build domestic industrial capacity instead of feeding acquisition targets. When Israel switched from building domestic companies to optimizing for startup exits, each high-tech manufacturer job was replaced by R&D jobs that created one-third as many supporting positions. The country got impressive acquisition headlines but lost the broad-based employment that builds middle-class prosperity. Palmer shows how energy infrastructure creates the fundamental input advantage needed for competitive manufacturing. We need antitrust enforcement to break up consolidated industries (read Matt Stoller and Basel Musharbash for more). We need industrial policy that creates genuine companies with career ladders, not startups designed for quick exits. For workers (white and blue collar) under 40, this helps determines whether you'll afford a house, start a family, or retire with dignity. This Substack is reader-supported.

Share I agree with the ultimate point that it’s all about finding a way to raise birth rates, and investing in clearly useful industries like energy buildout (and on-/friend-shoring those supply chains) makes a lot of sense. (Now if we can just convince the US government to not keep their heads in the sand…) Though on some specifics, RE why startups went off a cliff from 2020-2023, you mention the Fed rates as one factor but not fully explanatory of the decline - doesn’t that explain most of it? As an entrepreneur myself I hear from other founders that it’s hard to raise money these days, along with general worry about not being able to bounce back if they don’t make it - a riskier environment to make a startup. (I’m insulated from this since my company is bootstrapped, outside of the SV tech bubble, and taking a small business early profitability approach, but maybe that’s just another reflection of a more risk-averse approach to business creation 🤷) And I haven’t really heard of people seeing a lucrative acquisition as being a bad outcome for a startup that would drive them to not want to build one altogether (though I agree that it’s not great for the ecosystem of jobs and competition). After all if a company felt that they could get a better outcome by not taking an acquisition, they could just not take it, but they are (especially in this market). RE hiring young people for cheaper with the expectation of growth in the world of software, it seems like the age of LLMs isn’t helping, where an LLM can take a newbie to being a more productive but still junior engineer, whereas it takes a knowledgeable and motivated senior to being a 10x developer—which in my case means getting away with a much smaller and manageable team. Seems nobody wants to hire junior developers anymore, to the industry’s long-term detriment, though I think this has little to do with retirement ages or social security spending, at least in software. Anyway thanks for the post! Wouldn't removing the cap on earnings that are taxed for SS also help a lot for closing the funding gap, or should we just admit that the Congress will never ever go for that and pursue other options?

Title: Bitcoin Acts As A Hedge Against Local Fears And Could Rise To $700,000 – BlackRock CEO

In the ongoing bull market cycle, Bitcoin has been remarkable, as the cryptocurrency becomes a crucial global asset sought after persistently by prominent figures and companies worldwide. Many of these figures and companies are driven by the fact that BTC could serve as a strategic solution to real problems in the financial sector, making it a valuable asset. As local financial instability and economic uncertainty engulf many parts of the world, Bitcoin, often considered as “Digital Gold,” is constantly being pushed into the spotlight as a potential buffer against these negative conditions. This implies that the digital asset is becoming extremely popular among investors looking for protection from inflation and currency devaluation due to its decentralized structure and limited supply. Larry Fink, the chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the largest asset management company, BlackRock, is the latest prominent figure to acknowledge this notion around the flagship asset. The BlackRock CEO made the claims in an interview on Bloomberg. Such claims and statements from well-known figures in the financial sector are an indication of how Bitcoin’s role as a digital gold is now compelling than ever. Fink considers Bitcoin the ideal choice of asset when one is frightened of the debasement of currencies or the economic and political stability of a country. His statement underscores the chairman’s robust trust in BTC’s potential as a notable and reliable store of value during negative periods. According to the CEO, BTC is an internationally based instrument that will overcome and address local fears. As a result, he is confident and believes in the utilization of the crypto king as a key instrument during economic uncertainty. In the event that BTC is generally considered as a strategic internationally based instrument, Fink claims it could be a proper hedge against hope securities and equities. After sharing his insights on Bitcoin’s reputation as an inflation hedge, Fink offered his bullish prediction on the digital asset. The CEO is confident that BTC’s value might soar to untouched territory between $500,000 $700,000 in the foreseeable future. However, this could likely take place if every individual or business allocates 2% to 5% of their capital to BTC investments. Fink noted that this should be a major discussion in the sector as macroeconomic turmoil lingers. Tom Lee, the Head of Research at Fundstrat Global, has also weighed in on Bitcoin’s price potential, predicting a rally to unprecedented levels. In the interview, Lee asserted that a $200,000 to $250,000 per BTC is still reasonable, given that this price range is equivalent to 25% of the entire Gold market. Acknowledging its status as Digital Gold, the chairman believes that BTC should be valued at $1 million if it follows the path of gold. While this forecast may seem over optimistic, Lee is just one of many who believe the asset could reach this value in the next few years. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Institutions Decreasing Real Estate Purchases

Skip to comments. Posted on 07/22/2025 9:41:35 AM PDT by delta7 Investors continue to snap up residential properties, as real estate has evolved into an investment class of its own. New reports show that between 2020 and 2023, investors were responsible for 18.5% of home purchases. In the first three months of 2025, investors composed 27% of all residential properties, marking the highest share in half a decade, according to BatchData. High mortgage rates, coupled with high property values, have caused many would-be buyers to reconsider their purchases. Investors have fewer constraints, leading to the purchase of 265,000 residential properties during Q1, or a 1.2% YoY rise. However, we are seeing a decrease in institutional investments in real estate. The big money is not looking at real estate in this environment. Although investors accounted for 1.2 million homes in 2024, only 20% of the 86 million single-family homes in America are investor-owned. Mom-and-pop investors who own between one and five homes purchased 85% of all investor-owned residential properties, with those owning between six and ten properties securing 5% of the market. Institutions owning 1,000 or more properties account for only 2.2% of investor-owned homes. Purchasing real estate amid record-low rates was a no-brainer for investors, and institutions in particular, who had the liquidity to outbid competitors with cash offers. As interest rates rise, the cost of financing becomes prohibitive even for institutions. Institutions rely on leverage to enhance returns, and when borrowing costs rise, the math simply doesn’t work anymore. Real estate is an illiquid asset. In a world moving toward capital controls and rising geopolitical tensions, institutions are reallocating toward assets with more mobility. Capital is no longer looking at real estate as a long-term store of value. It’s moving into tangible assets that are more liquid—commodities, energy, gold, and equities. The available real estate inventory is at its highest level since the pandemic, but the sector has become stagnant as homes sit on the market for far longer. So while institutions have the capital, interest rates aside, they are not looking at mere rental or flipping income. People investing in real estate in this environment are seeking a modest additional income. Institutions are not interested in buying and holding tangible assets in a volatile environment where returns are not guaranteed. Look at New York City, for example—people are fleeing ahead of an incoming socialist local government that has promised to raise taxes on top earners. Real estate is no longer the safe bet it once was due to a lack of confidence in future regulation. TOPICS: KEYWORDS: housing Another 2008 event on the horizon?

These and the Florida markets are where the big investors like Blackrock and Invitation homes have backed off. The big investors think real estate is technically overpriced. That is why they are not buying. Some are selling or have sold already in places like Austin. Orlando is now in the top ten housing market in the country. That is because a lot of people are moving from the beach inland. Most people cannot afford the insurance on the coasts of Florida anymore. 12 posted on 07/22/2025 11:13:10 AM PDT by woodbutcher1963 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: delta7 IATG 13 posted on 07/22/2025 11:52:33 AM PDT by kiryandil (No one in AZ that voted for Trump voted for Gallego ) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

So while institutions have the capital, interest rates aside, they are not looking at mere rental or flipping income. People investing in real estate in this environment are seeking a modest additional income. Institutions are not interested in buying and holding tangible assets in a volatile environment where returns are not guaranteed. Look at New York City, for example—people are fleeing ahead of an incoming socialist local government that has promised to raise taxes on top earners. Real estate is no longer the safe bet it once was due to a lack of confidence in future regulation. TOPICS: KEYWORDS: housing Another 2008 event on the horizon?

These mom and pop investors who make up 85% of the market have no institutional pull. IMHO that's a good thing. If the real estate market collapses we'll see houses selling for their intrinsic values (how much they're worth to the consumers) instead of their investor market value (how you can sell it to the next investor in the tulip mania). 7 posted on 07/22/2025 10:04:40 AM PDT by Tell It Right (1 Thessalonians 5:21 -- Put everything to the test, hold fast to that which is true.)
