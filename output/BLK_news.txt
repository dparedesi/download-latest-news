Title: Texas Sweetens Pitch to CEOs, Boards With New State Protections

Texas is trying to entice more companies to ditch Delaware and incorporate in the state, just like Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. did last year at the behest of Elon Musk. Governor Greg Abbott is poised to sign legislation Wednesday to clarify rules around corporate decision-making and shareholder resolutions. Backers say the measures will help bolster the state‚Äôs new business courts, which are designed to challenge the supremacy of Delaware Chancery Court as a venue for corporate disputes. The bills underscore Texas‚Äô effort to step into the void as companies from Meta Platforms Inc. to Bill Ackman‚Äôs Pershing Square Capital Management question Delaware‚Äôs status as the gold standard for incorporations and business litigation. Musk received shareholder approval last year to move Tesla‚Äôs incorporation to Texas after a Delaware judge voided his record-setting pay package. The legislation ‚Äúwill establish Texas as a meaningful alternative to legal incorporation in Delaware, whose law has ceased to be predictable and clear in light of growing activism by the Delaware courts and legal community,‚Äù said a consortium of companies and business groups including the Texas Stock Exchange and Texans for Lawsuit Reform. Read more: Proposed Texas Legislation Aims to Accelerate Delaware Exit One bill formalizes a common legal principle known as the business judgment rule, which assumes corporate leaders are making informed, well intentioned decisions for their companies. Under the new measure in Texas, investors seeking to challenge board decisions will now need to prove otherwise. The measures also toughen the requirements for shareholders who want to investigate corporate books or pursue derivative suits. The updated rule enables companies to require a shareholder or group of investors to own as much as 3% of voting shares to take such actions. Abbott also is expected to promote a ballot measure voters will consider in November that would ban financial transaction taxes. Illinois and New York have weighed levies on security transfers in the past, only to roll them back after outcry from exchanges. Texas is strengthening corporate protections as public equity markets converge on the state. The New York Stock Exchange announced plans earlier this year to start an equities exchange in Texas. Nasdaq Inc. said it will open a new regional headquarters in Dallas to serve as a hub for clients in Texas. The upstart Texas Stock Exchange ‚Äì with backing from BlackRock Inc., Citadel Securities and Dallas pipeline billionaire Kelcy Warren ‚Äì plans to start trading next year.

Title: Irish history takes off on TikTok: Meet the people teaching the world about Ireland in 60-second bites

Ireland is a nation of storytellers, with a deep tradition of passing old stories down through generations. As decades go by and society changes, so too does the way we share our sc√©alta. We‚Äôve witnessed the transition from oral to written to visual and now, a new generation of historians are passing on tales of old through short-form videos on social media, namely TikTok. The platform has seen an influx of such videos, with the hashtag #IrishHistory accumulating more than 20,000 posts from comedy creators, businesses and dedicated citizen historians. Some of the more established creators sharing Irish history on the platform include Jane Casey (@janecasey.ie), Brinsley McNamara (@weirdireland), and Gemma Leahy (@theirishgem), all of whom have gone on to grow their online personas on other platforms such as Instagram, as well as creating podcasts and even writing books. Casey, who is 35 and originally from Bray but now lives in Dublin, began her working life in advertising 15 years ago. In the past year, however, she has quit her job to become a freelance social media consultant, while also creating content about interesting historical titbits. ‚ÄúI love history. I‚Äôm that person that drags all my mates to read a plaque on a weekend away. I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòLads, can we just take a detour by this graveyard?‚Äô‚Äù Combining her gr√° of history with her professional experience, Casey can get a message across to audiences in a way that is, as she describes it, accessible. But her transition to becoming a content creator wasn‚Äôt planned. Her very first TikTok was about prehistoric tombs in the Dublin mountains. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect anything [from the video]. I had [done] no editing to it ‚Äì nothing ‚Äì no fancy voice over. I just put it up and I got 10,000 views,‚Äù she says. Ireland is pretty amazing. üìç Tibradden Mountain #hiketok #ireland #irishtiktok #fyp #fypireland #historytime #irishheritagemonth From there her platform grew; she now has more than 20,000 followers. She spends a lot of time researching and exploring interesting, often overlooked, sites mostly in Dublin and Wicklow. Whether it‚Äôs a video about the origins of Irish surnames or castles hidden in plain sight off the M50, her TikToks regularly clock up hundreds of thousands of views. A lover of ‚Äúfun facts‚Äù, she particularly enjoys investigating quirky elements of our social history, like how Club Rock Shandy got its name (the Blackrock swimming club frequently stopped by O‚ÄôRourke‚Äôs pub in the south Dublin town for the beverage after their meets) ‚Äì and is currently on a quest to find why we call the ice cream a ‚Äú99‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhere did that come from? Everyone has a different story around it,‚Äù she says. This blew my mind when I first found this out ü§Ø PS. I'm ready for the Club vs Football Special arguments in the comments. NOTE: In the video I say "expat" meaning someone who lives somewhere other than their native country. I didn't know there was an effort to phase out the term until today. I now understand that "migrant" would have been more appropriate here. I'm glad my unconscious bias was pointed out - when you know better you do better, always an opportunity to learn. #ireland #dublin #history #irishhistory #irishsnacks Often an idea for a video will come to Casey while walking by an interesting building or structure, which she will later do a deep dive on using Google or the Irish Newspaper Archives. ‚ÄúA lot of Irish people want to learn more about their environment,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI want to deepen people‚Äôs appreciation for their surroundings and for this country.‚Äù Around 20 per cent of her video views come from outside Ireland, mainly the US. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs also a massive cohort of people who might have left Ireland years ago, or maybe their parents left Ireland, and they have found my content while seeking a connection to the homeland, which is really lovely too.‚Äù Like Casey, Leahy (35) has found a fan base in the US and Canada; about 70 per cent of her views come from across the pond, with the remaining 30 per cent spread across Ireland and Europe. She has a following on TikTok of 1.1 million. ‚ÄúA lot of Americans have extreme pride about being Irish and they like to learn a bit more about where they‚Äôve come from, their culture. They just like to see someone chatting about the place they‚Äôre proud of. Some of them are nearly more proud than we are,‚Äù says Leahy, who is a learning and development manager for PepsiCo by day. Now living in Leicester in England but originally from Westmeath, Leahy was on furlough from work during the Covid-19 lockdowns and was alone during the day as her partner, a postwoman, was busy delivering letters and packages. Friends began to tag her in videos that reminded them of her and, eventually, this lead to her creating her own content and TikTok page. Irish History Storys-Part 1 Dracula #irishhistory #irishhistory #irishstory #Dracula #irishinventions #irish #irishgem #irishtales #irishdaily #CapCut Her videos typically feature her chatting directly to the camera about Irishisms, presumably directed at international audiences. One of her videos like this, about the origins of Dracula, has more than 1.1 million views; another, about how to pronounce Irish girls‚Äô names such as Caoimhe and R√≥is√≠n, has been watched more than nine million times. She has also made some on-location videos from the likes of Se√°n‚Äôs Bar in Athlone, which dates from AD 900 and claims to be the oldest pub in Ireland. Leahy says she particularly loved making that video because she got to see the old-school interior and learn how to pull a proper pint of Guinness. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve put [the video] up multiple times now and it always does well, because people just find it fascinating.‚Äù History hasn‚Äôt always been Leahy‚Äôs thing ‚Äì in fact, she didn‚Äôt like it much as a subject at school. But her interest has grown since emigrating to the UK. ‚ÄúAs you move away from home, you become more proud to be Irish and, then, you‚Äôre more proud of showing off the stuff that maybe you didn‚Äôt learn in school. Living in England especially, you become extra proud to be Irish. I love to have discussions with people over here,‚Äù she says. Leahy says she particularly loves sharing stories about what the Irish have achieved on the world stage, such as how Kilkenny-born James Hoban designed the White House, how Irish soldier Michael Keogh came close to assassinating Adolf Hitler, and the story of inspirational women such as Lady Gregory and Grace O‚ÄôMalley. Irish Women Part 5- Lady Gregory #internationalwomansday #irishwomen #famouswomen #irishhistory #irishstorys #irishfacts #irishgem #theirishgem #graceomalley #irish #CapCut #Inspiring #CapCut #CapCut McNamara‚Äôs TikToks start off with a distinctive introduction ‚Äì ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm Brinsley McNamara and welcome to Weird Ireland‚Äù ‚Äì before launching into whatever interesting snapshot he has put together for the day‚Äôs video. The 32-year-old started with a page documenting ‚ÄúWeird Westmeath‚Äù, where he is from, widening the focus last year to all of Ireland. He has since gone on to publish a book and start a podcast. ‚ÄúAll the stuff that‚Äôs in [Weird Ireland] is stuff I was looking at anyway, I just wasn‚Äôt taking videos and pictures,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt was just a matter of taking the leap and starting imperfect and getting better. I like going around looking at things. I like making videos of them. And having a page to do that, it‚Äôs great.‚Äù He works off recommendations from viewers these days, but also looks at Google Maps to find interesting sites. Within weeks of starting his page, he noticed a ‚Äútremendous‚Äù reaction to the videos, with views reaching in the hundreds of thousands. Like Casey, he believes it stems back to people‚Äôs connection with their locality. His videos may not be as detailed as other creators on TikTok; McNamara deliberately offers just enough information to engage a viewer but allow them to do further digging on the topic elsewhere, if they want to. He encourages people to visit the sites themselves, take some photos and ‚Äúmake a day out‚Äù of it. While these creators have built a platform based on sharing history with others, none have studied history at university. Does this matter? For professional historian Kerron √ì Luain, who has a BA, MA and PhD, it does not, though he can see how some historians may have an issue with the short-form format of these videos. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm sitting there, picturing older historians or professors, they‚Äôd be saying: ‚ÄòHow can you really deliver, in such a short format, the whole picture or whole context.‚Äô But, personally, I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem with it, as long as [the videos] are direct.‚Äù Diarmaid Ferriter, professor of modern Irish history at University College Dublin and a contributor to The Irish Times, sees social media as a tool for democratising history, which is often kept behind closed doors in academic databases and in universities. Social media can also distort history in a very serious and damaging way because people can decide to be very selective ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point in us being snobbish about it,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not high-priest historians who have some kind of monopoly on the communication of history, or the right interpretation of history, so it‚Äôs not for us to be dismissive.‚Äù For the most part, these ‚Äúcitizen historians‚Äù are acting out of a genuine love and interest for times gone by, but a concern for √ì Luain would be the odd ‚Äúbad-faith actor‚Äù who could use a platform under the guise of Irish history to spread hateful messages, such as anti-immigration ones. As Ferriter says: ‚ÄúSocial media can also distort history in a very serious and damaging way because people can decide to be very selective about what they choose to highlight, if they‚Äôre trying to make a particular case or if they‚Äôre trying to argue around some contentious issue that they are right by pointing to history.‚Äù √ì Luain says the way history is told has changed over time, long before social media. ‚ÄúSomething similar happened in the 1960s ‚Äì prior to that, everything was based on only written history texts. Then, this new thing ‚Äì oral history ‚Äì emerged and there was the same critique: ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt trust what people are saying.‚Äô But oral history developed in its own way over the last 50 or 60 years and it‚Äôs now an established format,‚Äù he says. If historians don‚Äôt move with the times, they‚Äôll be left with a very small audience. ‚ÄúPublic history was a thing going back like 10 or 15 years before the emergence of social media, where some historians say, ‚ÄòWe have to get out and do talks in local communities‚Äô and things like that ‚Äì bring history to the average citizen,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúNow, if you‚Äôre talking to a room of 20 people, you can talk to a room of 20,000 at any given time. It‚Äôs just that on a grander scale. ‚ÄúSome historians only speak to an increasingly narrow demographic. And that‚Äôs the way these things are shifting towards the youth ‚Äì it‚Äôs all about these platforms. So why not use both if you can?‚Äù Capitalising on the trend, TikTok Ireland is launching a hub to bring content together in one place under the hashtag #IrishHistory, which will make the content easier for users to discover, and boost the profiles of the creators making such content. For the creators such as Casey, it‚Äôs a welcome move. As she explains, there are plenty of historical programmes broadcast on the likes of RT√â or Virgin Media, but viewership of traditional media has decreased, particularly among young people. ‚ÄúTikTok is where people are at. The likes of the Irish History Hub is an amazing way to present history in a really accessible way and to encourage creators to get involved too. It‚Äôs a way to bring our heritage to a new audience because the reality is, they‚Äôre not watching TV. They‚Äôre on their phones. TikTok is far more than just dances, as it was a couple of years ago.‚Äù Rebecca Daly is an Irish Times journalist ¬© 2025 The Irish Times DAC

The sale occurred against the backdrop of growing market uncertainty triggered by a wave of U.S. tariffs that rattled global trade and risk assets. Notably, the filing‚Äôs cutoff date‚ÄîMarch 31‚Äîcame just two days before the so-called ‚ÄòLiberation Day‚Äô on April 2, 2025‚Äîa reference to the day the U.S. imposed comprehensive tariffs affecting nearly all its major trading partners. The SEC filing, dated May 15, confirms SWIB sold its Bitcoin ETF holdings ahead of the March 31 reporting date for the end of the first quarter of the year. According to the board's previous filing, dated February 14, the fund held 6,060,351 IBIT shares, worth approximately $321,501,621. Shifting market optics The broader economic landscape also shifted dramatically following President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration, which began an aggressive new trade policy that seeks to reshore manufacturing on U.S. soil and spur domestic growth. The administration announced 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on Chinese imports on February 1. Two days later, the Canada and Mexico tariffs were paused for 30 days, though the 10% tariff on China took effect on February 4. By February 11, President Trump reinstated a 25% tariff on steel imports and raised the tariff on aluminum to 25%. Trade pressure ramped up on March 4, when the U.S. increased tariffs on China to 20%. The tit-for-tat policy spiral of tariffs led to significant market instability, with Goldman Sachs analysts warning the new tariffs could push core inflation to 3.8% this year. The crypto markets were not left unscathed, where Bitcoin fell 2.3% to around $83,200, while Ethereum dropped 4.5%. Amid a retaliatory spiral, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods surged to 145%, while China raised tariffs on U.S. products to 125%, sending Bitcoin below $75,000. Tensions began to ease in May when the U.S. and China temporarily reduced tariffs. The U.S. lowered its rate on Chinese goods to 30%, while China reduced its tariff on U.S. imports to 10%. As of mid-May, President Trump has also paused most reciprocal tariffs on other countries.

Avenir held 14.7 million IBIT shares worth $688 million as of March 31, according to its filing,. That marks a 30% increase from the firm's IBIT holdings for the fourth quarter of 2024. IBIT represents about 86% of Avenir‚Äôs portfolio, according to investment research platform Fintel. The firm made clear its commitment to investing in crypto-focused products in February, revealing that it had acquired about 11,300, then worth $599 million in a press release. The company, which said it had ‚Äúemerged as a major institutional player in the digital asset market,‚Äù held about 52,500 shares of the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC), worth more than $4.2 million, according to Fintel. "This strategic move not only underscores Avenir's confidence in the future of digital assets but also marks a pivotal moment in its brand evolution and business strategy,‚Äù Avenir said in a previous statement on its digital assets-focused initiatives. Decrypt reached out to Avenir for additional comment. Avenir's 14.7 million IBIT shares are worth $863,478,000 based on recent pricing. IBIT was recently trading at $58.74, Yahoo Finance data shows. Bitcoin ETFs offer investors access to the asset without holding it directly. The firm's additional investment into IBIT reflects Hong Kong and other Asian hubs‚Äô strong interest in digital assets. It also comes as institutions increasingly embrace cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, amid the U.S.‚Äôs ongoing pro-crypto pivot. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have generated more than $41 billion in net inflows since the first 10 of these products received SEC approvals in January 2024, despite a recent dip in trading, according to data provider Farside. Their recent resurgence follows U.S. President Donald Trump's issuance of executive orders to protect Bitcoin miners‚Äô rights and authorize the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the U.S. Treasury. The directives underscore President Trump's continued commitment to transform the U.S. into the ‚Äúundisputed Bitcoin superpower and crypto capital of the world‚Äù‚Äîa pillar of his campaign promises to the crypto community. Meanwhile, pro-Bitcoin initiatives have also gained traction at the local level over the past few months, with more than a dozen states evaluating legislative proposals to add the token to their Treasury reserves. Avenir's increased Bitcoin ETF investment forms part of its recent push to deepen its engagement with the digital asset market. The firm launched its Crypto Partnership Program last fall, allocating $500 million for its collaborations with digital asset-focused quantitative trading teams across the world.

Title: Speed And Safety: What Circle‚Äôs IPO Means For Stablecoins

ByEarl Carr ByEarl Carr, Contributor. PARIS, FRANCE - FEBRUARY 16: In this photo illustration, a visual representation of digital ... More cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethernum, Dash, Monero and Litecoin is displayed on February 16, 2018 in Paris, France. Digital cryptocurrencies have seen unprecedented growth in 2017, despite remaining extremely volatile. (Photo Illustration by Chesnot/Getty Images) From minted coins and paper notes to credit cards and electronic transfers, money‚Äôs development has been a march toward greater convenience, efficiency and safety. Stablecoin issuers now view themselves as the latest stage in this journey. With stringent Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering, credit history, and solvency requirements, the modern financial system excludes many individuals and small-and-medium enterprises in the developing world from participating in the global, dollar-based economy. According to Mento Labs, a decentralized stablecoin platform, ‚Äúnearly 2.5 billion people (a credit gap of $4.9tn)...are excluded from formal financial services.‚Äù From Mexican farmers lacking credit histories to cash-strapped Indonesian SMEs, developing consumers‚Äô demand for capital has been walled in by regulatory and technical barriers. Despite stablecoin‚Äôs origin as a liquidity tool for specialized crypto traders, the technology is now billed as an inclusive upgrade to a traditionally Western-dominated financial system. This focus on efficiency and ease-of-access is reflected in many current issuers‚Äô value propositions. Early stablecoins, like BitUSD, NuBits, and TerraUSD, used algorithms and crypto collateral to prop their peg to the dollar. According to Deltec Bank, these pillars collapsed in market downturns, prompting most issuers to shut down, their tokens worth only a small fraction of real dollars. Tether distinguished itself by backing its USDT stablecoin with fiat securities, such as cash and Treasuries, opening the door for the tokens to act like digital dollars instead of a risk asset. Particularly in international transfers, this newfound predictability has fueled significant cost reductions; wire transfers costs of sending USD have long hovered around $44 per transaction. With the advent of USDC (Circle Internet Financial‚Äôs stablecoin), on Ethereum, that cost dropped to $12. Roland Berger reports that on faster and cheaper Layer 2 blockchains like Base, this cost has fallen to below one cent. International transfer costs using stablecoins have dropped by over 97% since 2015. Seizing on this opportunity, investors poured capital into the industry: In 2021, the market cap of the top three stablecoins was $54.66 billion. As of 2025, those top three became ten, and total market cap had quadrupled to $221 billion , according to a Statista report. Notably, traditional finance heavyweights like PayPal and BlackRock entered the industry, signaling broader institutional adoption. Comparison of top 10 stablecoins In this still-growing stage of the industry, issuers are adopting a variety of strategies to attract users and uphold the peg. The aforementioned traditionalists adopt Tether‚Äôs strategy, using U.S. dollar deposits and Treasuries to maintain the 1:1 equivalency. On the other hand, decentralized finance companies like Ethena or Dai favor complex crypto derivative and smart contracts to complement leaner fiat reserves. Across the board, companies grapple with the need to balance efficiency with regulatory compliance and predictability. Despite this difficulty, future market leaders will need to walk this tightrope. The ideal issuer must balance three pillars: a reliably fixed value coin, network connections that maximize potential user base, and an embrace of auditing/regulation. One company that has adopted these three pillars is Circle, whose USDC stablecoin is the second largest by market cap as measured by CoinMarketCap. Their reserves are audited by Deloitte and stored as repos, short-dated Treasuries, and cash. Similarly, Circle's euro-backed stablecoin, EURC, is supported by euro-denominated reserves held as cash in segregated, global bank accounts. Circle's Reserve Fund is an even split between Repos and short-term Treasuries Even after breaking their USD peg amid Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs infamous 2023 collapse, Circle has regained the market‚Äôs confidence by diversifying away from regional banks like SVB assuring investors that reserve deposits would be fully available to them after the collapse, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The company has won further trust by embracing increased stablecoin regulation. Since launching USDC in 2018, Circle voluntarily published monthly reserve reports. Their rival Tether, the largest stablecoin by market cap, has never been fully audited. CEO Jeremy Allaire has led the charge, praising recent legislation like the GENIUS act and calling for all USD-pegged stablecoin issuers to be registered in the US. Circle compounds on their transparency and stability mantra by combining USDC and EURC with a collection of Web3 services designed to increase user flexibility. While minting/redeeming services, smart contract, and developer tools are not unheard of in the industry, the company‚Äôs combination augments the company‚Äôs already robust stablecoins with a convenient, all-in-one package. With its focus on accessibility and transparency, Circle‚Äôs leadership is confident the upcoming IPO is more than a chance to raise capital. Opening Circle to public investment brings the company one step closer to an ecosystem where the "speed, cost, and access" of blockchain commerce unlocks global prosperity.

Readers should conduct independent research before taking any actions related to the project mentioned in this piece. This article should not be regarded as investment advice. The crypto world is constantly expanding, and navigating it can be difficult. Choosing the right asset from a deluge of emerging new tokens as blockchain-based digital assets develop can feel like a gamble. This carefully selected list brings down the best cryptocurrencies worth your attention now, especially for those who want to get in on the trends for Web3 gaming, DeFi evolution, and cross-chain architecture. Top 5 Cryptos: 1. AurealOne (DLUME): Powering the Next Era of Web3 Gaming & the Metaverse AurealOne is changing the decentralized gaming world with a frictionless, high-performance blockchain for the cutting-edge Web3 and metaverse experience. Its native token, DLUME, underpins transactions, governance, and game economies as more and more games and virtual worlds join the ecosystem. Click here to visit AurealOne DLUME Presale and Token Trajectory DLUME is in stage 9 of a 21-phase presale. It is currently selling for $0.0013 and is anticipated to reach $0.0055 at launch. The planned laddered presale, which will go from $0.0005 to $0.0045, provides an opportunity to enjoy the promising upswing before the main net comes alive. Cutting-Edge Tech & Immersive Gameplay AurealOne‚Äôs game-first approach is backed by Zero Knowledge rollups for scalable throughput, with DarkLume (a rich, dark fantasy metaverse) and Clash of Tiles (a tactical PvP battler) added to the mix. With community governance and an evident roadmap, AurealOne is a viable player in blockchain gaming. 2. DexBoss (DEBO): Making DeFi Powerful Yet Simple DexBoss aims to democratize DeFi with intuitive interfaces, cutting-edge trading tools, and scalable cross-chain compatibility. It does not matter whether you are new to crypto or an old hand of DeFi, DexBoss gives strong staking, yield farming, and leveraged trading. DEBO Tokenomics & Presale Status DEBO is now in phase 7 of 17, selling at $0.011 when it opened at $0.01. The token‚Äôs initial value at launch will be $0.0505, with the presale reserving 500 million DEBO of the total supply of 1 billion. It has a deflationary model comprising regular buybacks and burns. Advanced Features DexBoss intends to launch full DEX listings, fiat onboarding, staking dashboards, and multichain support in mid-2025. Its audited smart contracts and deep liquidity pools guarantee security and speed. DEBO is one of the most useful DeFi assets with prospects in the long term. 3. Bitcoin (BTC): The Foundation of DigiFi & Institutional Trust The first decentralized cryptocurrency with a limited supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin, ruled over the digital asset space in 2025. Institutional interest is exploding. BlackRock infused $232.9 million into the BTC ETFs, and Coinbase proclaimed a current all-time-$1 billion BTC outflow in a day, a testament to accumulation. Surrounded by rumours that Coinbase is going to be added to the S&P 500 and technical analysts keeping an eye out for a double-top formation, BTC is still the most liquid, trustworthy, and globally compatible crypto-asset, now adopted by central banks and hedge funds as a strategic reserve. 4. Pi Network (PI): Unlocking Mobile Crypto Adoption Pi Network focuses on crypto for the masses with a mobile-first, energy-efficient strategy. Unlike traditional mining, Pi can be mined via a simple mobile app with mass participation in a low-barrier ecosystem. Pi is unlisted on major exchanges, but with a huge clientele and ecosystem already in place, it is set to roll out peer-to-peer transactions, staking, as well as marketplace integrations in the future. The token is oriented toward everyday use in a decentralized mobile economy. Having over 50 million users globally, Pi‚Äôs community-driven growth strategy and focus on accessibility make it a possible breakthrough in worldwide crypto adoption, particularly in areas with scarce resources for classic money management. 5. Penguiana (PENGU): The Play-to-Earn Penguin Sensation Penguiana is a play-to-earn, meme-driven platform focused on penguins in the Solana blockchain. Its $PENGU token allows players to mint GUIANA NFTs ‚Äì 3D penguin avatars required for playing the game and getting rewards. The game was created using Unity and allows players immersive obstacle courses where they gather points and tokens. Significantly, 80% of the $PENGU used in minting NFTs is destroyed, thus making the token less common. A successful presale and an upcoming game demo prove that Penguiana is committed to merging entertainment with actual utility. In summary! DLUME and DEBO take the frontline in presale ingenuity for Web3 gaming and DeFi, respectively. AurealOne is a next-generation blockchain gaming platform offering lightning-fast transactions, near-zero gas fees, and immersive metaverse experiences powered by its native DLUME token. Bitcoin does not lose its place as the world‚Äôs digital backbone of fintch. Pi Network brings new life to crypto for the average user, and Penguiana combines fun with tokenized rewards in a rapidly developing play-to-earn ecosystem. Each project brings distinct value to the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

Title: These Stocks Are The Biggest Winners From Trump‚Äôs Middle East Trip

ByTy Roush ByTy Roush, Forbes Staff. Major U.S. stocks like Nvidia, Alphabet and Amazon rose amid President Donald Trump‚Äôs four-day trip to the Middle East, which ends Thursday after he announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars that lifted the defense, aviation and AI industries‚Äîthough a broader market selloff earlier on Thursday appeared to slow growth. Trump has announced deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars during a four-day trip to the Middle ... More East. Super Micro Computers: The information tech firm saw its shares rise by nearly 30.6% through the last two trading sessions after reaching a $20 billion partnership with Saudi Arabian data center DataVolt on Tuesday, and Super Micro‚Äôs stock increased slightly (0.2%) by Thursday afternoon. Nvidia: Shares of Nvidia, which increased by 0.5% Thursday, increased by roughly 11% through Tuesday and Wednesday after announcing a deal to supply 18,000 AI chips to Saudi-backed Humain. AMD: The semiconductor firm‚Äôs stock dipped by more than 1% on Thursday after jumping by 7.4% over the last two days after revealing on Tuesday a $10 billion project with Saudi Arabia to supply chips and software for AI data centers. Palantir: As one of the U.S.-based companies to attend the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum this week, Palantir‚Äôs shares rose by roughly 10% over the last two trading sessions before falling nearly 1% on Thursday. Boeing: The aircraft maker achieved a 52-week high on Wednesday after announcing a $96 billion deal to supply 210 jets for Qatar Airways, and Boeing‚Äôs shares rose again on Thursday by nearly 1.2%. Alphabet: Google‚Äôs parent company joined Oracle, Salesforce and AMD, among others, in a $80 billion investment to develop ‚Äúcutting-edge transformative technologies‚Äù in Saudi Arabia and the U.S., the White House said Tuesday, as its shares rose by 3.5% on Wednesday before dipping slightly Thursday. Amazon: Shares of Amazon rose by 1.3% on Tuesday after the company announced a $5 billion partnership to develop an ‚ÄúAI Zone‚Äù in Saudi Arabia, though the stock‚Äôs positive movement was reversed after it dropped by 0.5% on Wednesday and 2.3% on Thursday. Tesla: CEO Elon Musk was among the billionaires to join Trump in the Middle East, a move that appeared to shift Tesla‚Äôs stock up by 8.6% over the last two trading sessions, before the automaker‚Äôs shares fell by just under 1% on Thursday. Each of the three market indexes increased by Thursday afternoon after an earlier selloff, largely driven by Walmart‚Äôs shares dropping by more than 3% and UnitedHealth‚Äôs stock plummeting 14%. The S&P 500, on pace to continue a winning streak for a fourth-straight day, rose by 0.4% as the Nasdaq added 0.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 176 points, or 0.4%. Thursday‚Äôs earlier broad stock decline was likely the result of ‚Äúcautious optimism as recession fears recede, investors told CNBC, with some confidence added after the U.S. and China reached a trade deal earlier this week, . Trump and many major U.S.-based companies announced several deals for projects in defense, aviation, AI and other industries since he arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The White House said Saudi Arabia had agreed to invest $600 billion in the U.S., though some investments were already in the works, with additional deals worth more than $300 billion signed at an investor conference attended by several U.S. billionaires, including Elon Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Palantir‚Äôs Alex Karp, among others. Trump‚Äôs visit has largely focused on economic investments in the U.S. rather than geopolitical strategy, though Trump said Thursday Iran had ‚Äúsort of agreed to the terms‚Äù of a deal with the U.S. to scale back nuclear weapons production.

This story was produced by The Margin in collaboration with The Nation.Please note this article contains mention of suicide, self-harm, and sexual violence. Near gale force winds stretched nimbostratus clouds that resembled alpine peaks turned sideways above the heavily industrialized zone known as the Tacoma Tideflats on a Saturday afternoon in mid-March. Concertina wire spiraled down the top of the chain-link fence marking the western edge of E. J Street. A nearby train engine billowed diesel exhaust, contaminating the wind. Its unmistakable stench stung the nostrils. Reflections of the compound buildings appeared in pools of rainwater and pulsed and blurred with each passing breeze. From the south, a big wind rose, slanting heavy raindrops against a group of some 40 protesters led by La Resistencia. They stood together with protest signs that folded and unfolded in the wind and rain. Inside soaked jackets, members and allies of the activist organization stood in solidarity against the Northwest ICE Processing Center, also known as the Northwest Detention Center, which is owned by The GEO Group and is contracted by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), which is within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The facility houses all genders. The detention center imprisons people who are suspected of violating civil immigration laws. While immigrants detained in the facility are from countries across the globe, many are from Latin America, one of several regions that has felt the brunt of European colonization and American imperialism. The impacts of these forces have made life in the countries unlivable for many, forcing people to migrate. However, when they reach the borders of the countries, including the United States, which have contributed to or caused their displacement, they are met with hostility and immigration policies that turn their plight into profit. The GEO Group acquired Corrections Services Corporation and its detention facility in a heavily industrialized area, allegedly exposing immigrants to numerous sources of pollution. Over nearly 30 years, numerous test pits and groundwater monitoring wells, both immediately adjacent to and beneath the detention facility site, have revealed the presence of petroleum products, including diesel, gasoline, and heavy oil. Furthermore, the detention facility has a notorious reputation due to years of documented human rights abuses. Despite these man-made forces, La Resistencia movement leaders and their allies are standing up to fight the facility and what it represents, mindful of those who‚Äôve been targeted and whose rights have been taken, just as so many of their ancestors‚Äô labor, land, and natural resources were‚Äîand continue to be‚Äîtaken. The GEO Group is paid by the federal government to house people there, and is guaranteed a minimum number of detainees, causing the people detained in the facility to be valued as commodities. As the rain continued to pour, the protesters were quickly drenched, yet they remained, resolute and unified in their demands. Rufina Reyes, director of the La Resistencia, led the group by declaring: ‚Äú¬°No est√°n solo!‚Äù Her voice was amplified loud enough for the sound waves to echo off the detention facility‚Äôs walls. The crowd echoed in unison, ‚ÄúYou are not alone!‚Äù The sound waves of the calls interweaved like a multilingual prayer sanctified by the heavy rain and wind.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre opposed to detentions and deportations, and we don‚Äôt want any more family separation!‚Äù Reyes shouted through an interpreter. The volcanic mountain known as Tahoma towered above the valley and flatlands. Prior to the construction of the GEO Group‚Äôs detention facility, the site was a rich tidal estuary, known by many names, and was the ancestral homeland of the Puyallup people since time immemorial. Following colonization, conflict, and the eventual signing of the Treaty of Medicine Creek in 1854, the land was settled by American immigrants. Still, the Puyallup Tribe retains certain rights over the area as a result of the 1854 treaty and the subsequent Land Claims Settlement Act of 1990. In the immediate area where the detention facility would be built, fill was brought in or dredged from the river estuary to serve as a foundation for a meat processing and packing plant that opened in 1904, a Standard Oil fuel storage and distribution facility that opened in 1905, and a coal gasification plant that opened in 1924. The coal gasification plant operated until 1956 and was demolished in 1966. The fuel storage and distribution facility, later owned by Chevron, operated through 1988 and included 13 above-ground and four underground fuel storage tanks, three petroleum pipelines, and numerous garages. The GEO Group now owns the site and parks its vehicles on it. A metals recycling facility was constructed immediately southeast of the future detention site by 1967. This facility recycled cars and electrical transformers, polluting the area with PCBs and heavy metals. The coal gasification site, the meatpacking site, and the metals recycling site would later be designated as a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The Washington State Department of Ecology has stated that the EPA Superfund site around the detention facility is remediated, ‚Äúcapped‚Äù by layers of supposedly impermeable barriers, asphalt, and crumbled cement from the meatpacking facility. It now resembles an innocuous mound covered, bizarrely, in green grass. But an underground benzene plume exists just below the surface, not far from the southern edge of the property line where the detention facility now stands. In 1988, a 3,500-gallon underground oil storage tank had to be removed, and along with it, 376 tons (752,000 pounds) of petroleum-affected soil and over 8,000 gallons of petroleum-affected groundwater. Yet more remained. Adding to the petroleum contamination, the nearby Standard Oil facility, which Chevron now owns, leaked petroleum products into the soil, contaminating the surrounding groundwater. Washington state Department of Ecology‚Äôs groundwater monitoring wells have detected diesel and heavy oil in wells just outside the walls of the detention facility as recently as November 2024. MTCA Method A Cleanup Levels is a regulatory approach used under Washington State‚Äôs Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA) to establish acceptable levels of contaminants in soil, groundwater, and other environmental media during site cleanups. In 1996, Correction Services Corporation, now owned by GEO Group, began searching for a site to build a migrant detention facility near Seattle. After considering several locations in neighboring towns, they ultimately landed on 1623 E. J Street in Tacoma. Then Tacoma City Council member Kevin Phelps was a vocal supporter of this location, citing economic benefits, specifically business and occupation taxes the city would garner. GEO Group was issued contract revenue bonds by The Washington Economic Development Finance Authority in 2003 for $57,415,000 and in 2011 for $54,375,000 to construct and expand the facility. Washington Representatives at the time, Adam Smith and Norm Dicks worked alongside Tacoma city leaders to persuade GEO Group to seek to build the facility atop the Superfund site. Dick and Smith didn‚Äôt respond to emailed requests for comment. Senator Patty Murray would also support the site‚Äôs construction of this facility on this location as early as 2002. Smith later opposed the GEO Group‚Äôs facility receiving another contract. Murray later scrutinized the facility, but nonetheless had accepted campaign contributions from the GEO Group in the amount of $5,000 in 2016. Senator Murray and her staff didn‚Äôt respond to emailed requests for comment for this story. Along with Representative Pramila Jayapal, Smith wrote a letter in July 2024 to the then-secretary of DHS urging it to move away from the use of private for-profit migrant detention facilities. Jayapal previously founded a non-profit organization that partnered with the Seattle University School of Law to produce a report on the human rights abuses at the facility. The city council adopted a resolution approving the facility on March 28, 2000, stating, ‚ÄúCSC [GEO Group] has an excellent reputation in the communities where it has facilities.‚Äù However, a local news report published in 2004, when the facility was being finished and opened, cited a 1995 riot at another GEO-acquired facility (under the name of Esmor Correctional Services) in New Jersey that led to a federal investigation. ‚ÄúThree guards at the facility were later convicted of misconduct and sent to prison,‚Äù a Tacoma News Tribune report stated as the Northwest Detention Center was about to open. Between 2018 and 2024, GEO Group paid Pierce County, where the detention facility is located, roughly $5,643,100 in property taxes. The city responded to questions about the total amount paid by GEO Group in business and occupation taxes, stating that such information could not be divulged because it is confidential. The GEO Group, Inc., based in Boca Raton, Florida, has received $6.85 billion since July 2009 from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which, since 2003, has included ICE. $995.08 million of this has been obligated to the GEO Group in Washington state. Congress‚Äôs 2025 Trump-supported continuing resolution allocates nearly $10 billion for ICE. The American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) estimated that the continuing resolution allocates approximately $350 billion for immigration enforcement and argues, however, that it does not include checks and balances on Trump‚Äôs mass detention and deportation plans, nor allow for a legal pathway to citizenship. ‚ÄúUnder our legal system, the rule of law also requires fairness and respect for due process, but the Trump-controlled Senate rejected any proposal to inject those principles into the bill passed yesterday,‚Äù stated AILA Executive Director Ben Johnson in a press release. Trump has recently defied court orders regarding the detention and deportation of migrants, invoking a law used to justify the internment of Japanese-Americans, German-Americans, and Italian-Americans during World War II to loosely classify some Venezuelans as members of Tren de Aragua, a gang designated as a foreign terrorist organization by his administration, without due process of law. Trump‚Äôs framing of non-white migrants as criminals and subhuman since his political rise in 2015 has served as the basis for his policies that disproportionately target vulnerable non-white people who once immigrated to the U.S. Meanwhile, those within the financial industry are profiting from the Trump Administration‚Äôs policies‚Äô ‚Äúpotential sea change.‚Äù GEO Group‚Äôs top five shareholders are BlackRock, Inc., Vanguard Group, Inc., Wolf Hill Capital Management, LP, FMR, LLC, and Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. as of December 31, 2024. Pam Bondi, Trump‚Äôs current Attorney General, was formerly a lobbyist for the GEO Group, which has contributed over $2.7 billion to Trump and Republicans from 2016 to 2024, including members of Congress who voted against certifying the 2020 election and promoted the Big Lie that the election was stolen. Two days after Trump‚Äôs re-election on November 5th, 2024, GEO Group Executive Chairman George Zoley told his company‚Äôs shareholders during an earnings call that Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúmore aggressive policy‚Äù toward interior and border immigration enforcement means a ‚Äúpotential sea change‚Äù for the company he leads. ‚ÄúThe GEO Group was built for this unique moment in our company‚Äôs‚Äîcountry‚Äôs history and the opportunities that it will bring,‚Äù Zoley said. He said GEO Group could increase the number of detainee beds from 13,500 to 31,000. In the days following Trump‚Äôs election, the value of GEO Group stock nearly doubled and peaked on January 21, 2025, Trump‚Äôs Inauguration Day. The apparent commoditization of human beings, in addition to allegations that migrants detained are essentially forced labor, is reminiscent of some of the darkest chapters of human history. Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, recently suggested Trump‚Äôs aspirational deportation machine should run more like a business, treating people like products being shipped. Before and between Trump‚Äôs terms, Democrats also sought to expand the role of DHS and ICE. The Biden administration took actions to expand immigration detention prior to the end of his term. Then Vice President and two-time presidential candidate Harris clearly stated her opposition to migration from Central and South America when, in June 2021, she spoke in Guatemala, unequivocally, saying to potential migrants, ‚ÄúDo not come. Do not come.‚Äù La Resistencia has dedicated over eleven years to shutting down the migrant detention center. Its Founder, Maru Mora-Villalpando, grew up in Mexico and was influenced by strong leaders, including her mother and grandfather, a union leader. They taught her the importance of supporting laborers on strike, which, she said, was common in Mexico. She recalled working to support striking workers by getting on a public bus, shaking a can with coins, requesting donations while talking with people about the importance of supporting striking workers, and passing out informational flyers. She also recalled riding with her mother and passing a group of striking workers when she was young. Their flag was grayed from age, and her mother said this was because of how long they‚Äôd been fighting, adding, ‚ÄúWe also need to support them. In order for them to win, we all need to support them.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey end[ed] up winning,‚Äù she said. ICE has allegedly targeted Mora-Villalpando specifically, as well as other activists, including, more recently, Alfredo ‚ÄúLelo‚Äù Juarez Zeferino, a farm labor rights activist who is currently being detained at the GEO Group facility. According to a lawsuit filed, in part, on her behalf as well as on behalf of other activists allegedly targeted by ICE, Mora-Villalpando was surveilled, then explicitly targeted by ICE, which initiated deportation proceedings against her, specifically for her activism defending human and immigrant rights. DHS ultimately dropped deportation charges against Mora-Villalpando. The lawsuit is ongoing. On September 15, 2024, La Resistencia posted on Instagram stating, ‚ÄúURGENT. Yesterday a woman in the women‚Äôs unit at NWDC suffered [a] fainting [sic] and headaches that were caused by a strong smell of gas. #GEO staff failed to address this issue.‚Äù According to Mora-Villalpando, this woman was taken for medical observation and returned an hour later. People detained and impacted said the strong smell of gas and sulfur was unbearable. They thought it was coming from the air conditioning vent, mentioning the door to the yard was left open because of it. According to detained people, one GEO officer said they, too, were suffering from a headache due to the smell of gas. Other GEO officers who later came into the unit stated they couldn‚Äôt smell anything, according to detained persons familiar with the event, who opined it was because they didn‚Äôt want to acknowledge a possible gas leak. Unit B-3 is located in the northernmost part of the detention facility, where groundwater and soil monitoring and tests have revealed for over 30 years the presence of diesel fuel and heavy oil. More recently, on a video posted on March 12, a person detained at the GEO Group‚Äôs facility stated via video chat to leaders of La Resistencia that clothes coming back laundered are still wet, smell like mildew, and ‚Äúsmell like diesel fuel.‚Äù The laundry room is also located in the northernmost part of the detention facility. Mora-Villalpando stated that a fire occurred in this area the previous year, which she and others witnessed while outside in solidarity. According to Mora-Villalpando and Liliana Chumpitasi, leader and community organizer with La Resistencia, these instances weren‚Äôt the first time detainees smelled gas in the facility. The group reported to The Margin that detained people identified the smell of gas when the sinks were clogged, and water was leaking from above the showers. In another incident detailed by the group, detained people communicated to La Resistencia that a gas smell also came from the showers. Per a 2024 lawsuit, the Washington State Department of Health has fielded over 700 complaints in the past year from people detained in the GEO Group‚Äôs facility, including reports that ‚Äúthe water is brown and possibly contaminated.‚Äù The project lead of the state‚Äôs toxics cleanup of the Chevron bulk terminal facility, Thomas Praisewater, stated in an interview with The Margin that while he has not heard about any toxins, it is hypothetically possible these toxins have infiltrated the detention facility‚Äôs drinking water. Praisewater has been working with Chevron‚Äôs consultant, AECOM, on the cleanup of the bulk fuel storage and distribution facility that was once across the street, a site now occupied by vehicles used by ICE and GEO. Another expert has also said petroleum products may have made their way up through the soil and into the detention facility‚Äôs water pipes. Marc A. Edwards, a Distinguished Professor in environmental and water resources engineering at Virginia Tech, told The Margin that gas and other petroleum products can go through or diffuse through porous plastic water pipes. Edwards, who worked on the scientific team that found lead contamination in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan, said, in particular, polyethylene pipes are susceptible to such infiltration. Praisewater made similar statements that if there is, in fact, contamination, it would likely be because of a break or corrosion in the detention facility‚Äôs water system. Furthermore, it is unclear if GEO Group installed vapor intrusion barriers, rather than vapor barriers; the former being designed to potentially prevent infiltration of toxic chemicals. A 2009 toxicological evaluation by the EPA of the NWDC indicated that a vapor intrusion barrier was not installed. The City of Tacoma water department told The Margin that municipal water piped to the facility is clean. According to records from the City of Tacoma in 2009 and 2010, the city approved occupancy permits for renovations to the building based on GEO Group‚Äôs detention facility building permit, which meets the 2006 International Building Code standards, requiring third-party certified plastic pipes that conform to NSF 14 standards. NSF 14 standards include polyethylene pipes. The Margin is waiting for the release of records requested via state open records laws from the city to further determine the potential water contamination. Despite state legislation requiring the Washington State Department of Health to monitor air and water quality in facilities such as the GEO Group‚Äôs detention facility that was signed into law May 11, 2023 as House Bill 1470, the company has fought and denied at least four attempts to inspect the water in all parts of the facility, only allowing access to the lobby and its bathroom. The state health department attempted to test the water in the detention facility but was denied access by GEO facility administrators acting on behalf of ICE supervisors. Joe Wesley Barbee, Jr., the distribution optimization advisor for the operations and training section of the state health department office of drinking water, stated in a declaration included in a lawsuit filed by the state against the GEO Group, that the Department of Health received complaints from individuals detained in GEO Group‚Äôs facility between April 2023 and mid-July 2024. Barbee described these complaints as being about the water‚Äôs temperature, color, smell, and the absence of water from faucets. ‚ÄúDetainees have complained about incidents where there is no water to drink, flush toilets, or otherwise use, and other incidents where the tap water is brown,‚Äù he stated. But when Barbee arrived at the GEO Group‚Äôs facility, he was met by the facility administrator, Bruce Scott, and two unidentified people, who allowed him only to test water from a faucet in a restroom near the front lounge area, apart from the secured part of the facility where detainees are held. ‚ÄúThe testing environment was under intense scrutiny by the facility staff and the supervisor, who asked questions about every step and every chemical/reagent I used,‚Äù Barbee stated in the lawsuit. He added that typically, a water test in a bathroom sink wouldn‚Äôt be acceptable for quality tests. ‚ÄúThe administrator asked for identical samples of any water I took,‚Äù Barbee said.‚ÄúI welcome them to prove us wrong, but they closed their doors even more,‚Äù said Representative Lillian Ortiz-Self (WA-21), who introduced House Bill 1232 in the state legislature that amends parts of House Bill 1470, which a federal judge partly blocked, saying it singled out GEO Group. HB 1232, which amended the law to include other facilities, was passed by the legislature on April 14 along party lines and signed into law by Governor Bob Ferguson on May 12. Part of the current legislation would require the Department of Health to specifically investigate complaints, monitor air and water quality, and publicly report findings on routine unannounced inspections of the facility, and to post these results in multiple languages for detainees and the public. It would also expand the facilities it covers to facilities other than the GEO Group detention facility in Tacoma. GEO Group had argued that HB 1470 was unconstitutional, alleging it violated the Constitution‚Äôs supremacy clause, stating ICE was the authority that denied the state access to the entire facility. ‚ÄúThey have refused to be more transparent, and instead, the complaints have doubled and continue to increase. We continue to have hunger strikes and complaints and suicide attempts,‚Äù Rep. Ortiz-Self told The Margin. ‚ÄúA couple questions come to mind: How much money do you want to make off of people suffering? And you know we‚Äôre looking at you, so do you care that little that you think you can continue to treat people this way? And if you‚Äôre treating them that way, knowing that we have our eyes on you, what‚Äôs really happening inside? We‚Äôre really scared for everyone that‚Äôs in there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat are they hiding?‚Äù Rep. Ortiz-Self asked. U.S. Marshals have recently confirmed a separate GEO Group detention facility in Laredo, Texas, to be exposing detainees to carbon monoxide, which families of the detainees allege sicken detainees without adequate medical treatment. GEO Group previously denied the presence of the deadly gas. The local fire department required GEO Group to take corrective action, according to an April 17th KGNS news report. In addition to having no choice but to drink potentially contaminated water, independent experts have alleged human rights abuses in complaints since the GEO detention facility was first opened in 2004. A 2008 report by OneAmerica and the International Human Rights Clinic at Seattle University School of Law identified major issues, including the unnecessary detention of refugees, conditions violating legal due process protections, especially the forced signing of papers, lack of access to attorneys, and failure to ensure confidential communications. Other concerns included overcrowding and lack of privacy, inadequate emergency medical care and pain management, inhuman and degrading treatment by guards and U.S. Marshals, failure to adequately address mental health issues and punitive segregation of those with mental health problems, extremely poor quality and quantity of food, inadequate visitation time, and long waits and inadequate access to telephones. Several reports by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights (UWCHR) have documented similar abuses since then. These include complaints of being served uncooked or worm-infested food, allegations of medical neglect, extensive use of solitary confinement, COVID-19 response and health standard issues, reports of sexual assault and abuse going unanswered, and complaints about the use of force and chemical agents. Suicide attempts at the facility are another especially significant issue. The UWCHR obtained 911 calls and detailed at least six suicide attempts from January 1 to March 18, 2024, alone. From August 2017 to April 2023, the UWCHR identified at least an additional 12 suicide attempts as categorized by South Sound 911. A man with Russian citizenship who was seeking asylum died following a suicide attempt while detained in segregation (or what UWCHR would define as solitary confinement). Records of 911 calls obtained by The Margin via open records law detail at least an additional eight suicide attempts since April 2023. In one of the most recent attempts on February 9, 2025, a detention facility representative tells a 911 dispatcher that medical assistance is needed for a man who had cut his wrists. A 2024 report by the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman found the detention center did not consistently complete 15-minute checks of detainees on suicide watch, and did not strictly control and collect disposable razors. Another 911 call obtained by The Margin via open records law details a man who had hit his head ‚Äúmultiple times‚Äù on the wall. In yet another recent suicide attempt, on March 12, a man jumped off the upper tier to the lower tier, according to a 911 audio recording obtained by The Margin. This audio contains sensitive material that may be distressing to some listeners, including discussions of violence, trauma, or strong language. 911 Records obtained by The Margin via public records law give a very general description of numerous other incidents, including 17 calls regarding molestation/groping from October 2021 through January 2025, and six calls alleging rape from February 2023 through June 2024. In a report published in 2022, the UWCHR reviewed several data sources from approximately 2012 to 2019 and found 63 reports of sexual assault or abuse. These included allegations by detainees against other detainees, alleged harassment by a GEO Group officer, and alleged sexual assault by medical staff. More recently, on April 24, UWCHR published a report finding the City of Tacoma Police Department failed to respond to allegations of assault and sexual assault made by detainees. A City of Tacoma spokesperson provided the following response via email: ‚ÄúWe are currently reviewing the concerns outlined in the report recently published by the University of Washington. If our review identifies opportunities to better align with our mission in serving those at the [NWDC], we are committed to making necessary improvements and further strengthening our procedures. Our goal is to ensure that safety, security, and respect for rights remain central to our role.‚Äù People detained at the NWDC have also died there. On March 7, 2024, Charles Leo Daniel died while in solitary confinement of undetermined causes. According to UWHRC, Daniel had spent nearly the entirety of his four years at the NWDC in solitary confinement despite being classified as having significant mental illness. La Resistencia told The Margin Senator Patty Murray was touring the facility the day of his death. On October 27, 2024, Jose Manuel Sanchez-Castro also died at the NWDC. According to reporting by The Seattle Times, he was in fentanyl withdrawal. Yet autopsy results have yet to be released. In 2018, another person died by suicide at the NWDC, according to a press release from Rep. Jayapal, who stated that when she visited the facility following Daniel‚Äôs death, she wasn‚Äôt allowed to speak with detained people. Angelina Godoy, Director of the UWCHR, told The Margin there‚Äôs a total lack of accountability regarding the GEO Group‚Äôs detention facility in Tacoma because the systems that are there to provide accountability, such as Congress, have utterly failed, ‚Äúto take any effective action to ensure that conditions within the Northwest Detention Center are even up to ICE‚Äôs own standards, which would fall far below international human rights standards.‚Äù The recent UWCHR report states ‚ÄúConditions are critical within the NWDC today, and outside facility walls, we are all witness to a still-unfolding series of federal government policies that revel in the cruel and public dehumanization of immigrants.‚Äù The state‚Äôs lawsuit against the GEO Group, which seeks to prevent GEO Group from denying the entry of state officials under state law to investigate complaints, states, ‚ÄúAs alleged, these complaints present clear threats to detainee health and safety at [the detention facility].‚Äù The Margin has requested these complaints via state public records law but has yet to receive them. The Washington State Department of Health, currently in litigation with the GEO Group, has declined to provide an interview to The Margin on the matter. A Washington State Department of Health spokesperson stated in an emailed response to The Margin: ‚ÄúThe Washington State Department of Health is aware of many of these and other complaints. We are committed to gain entry to the facility and investigate these complaints. The Northwest ICE Processing Center continues to deny entry to our staff. We are hopeful that the federal courts will bring clarity to the department‚Äôs authority and that the facility will allow entry for investigations, transparency, and the welfare of all people inside the facility.‚Äù A GEO Group Spokesperson provided the following response via email: ‚ÄúThe support services GEO provides at‚Ä¶ the Northwest ICE Processing Center, are governed by ICE‚Äôs detention standards. GEO‚Äôs services are carefully monitored for quality by ICE personnel, who are onsite 24/7‚Ä¶ The locations where GEO supports ICE are also independently accredited by the American Correctional Association, as well as the National Commission on Correctional Health Care‚Ä¶‚Äù A GEO Group spokesperson further stated via email: ‚ÄúGEO strongly disagrees with the allegations that have been made regarding the services we provide at the Northwest ICE Processing Center. These allegations are part of a long-standing, politically motivated, and radical campaign to abolish ICE and end federal immigration detention by attacking the federal government‚Äôs immigration facility contractors. GEO has comprehensive policies in place for the reporting and investigation of all incidents that occur at the Center, including instances of assault and/or sexual assault. These policies are governed by Performance-Based National Detention Standards (‚ÄúPBNDS‚Äù) established by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.‚Äù The GEO Group provided these general responses, but did not respond to The Margin‚Äôs detailed questions. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what detention centers are‚Ä¶ an extension of the prison system.‚Äù Rufina Reyes, director of La Resistencia, hails from Guerrero state, Mexico. She emigrated to the U.S. in 2000 because of a lack of economic opportunity. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Mexican,‚Äù Reyes said through an interpreter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an immigrant. I consider myself undocumented. I‚Äôm a mom, I‚Äôm a wife, and I believe that most of the people that are in La Resistencia are here because we have been affected by the system.‚Äù Reyes has held a work permit for the past two years. Reyes‚Äô brother fled his home in Mexico following his kidnapping by a local organized crime group. Fortunately, he was released, unlike many others, according to Reyes, who have been disappeared. He came to the U.S. and was later detained in the NWDC. She went to find her brother at the detention center, and when she came out, La Resistencia was holding an action outside. She began volunteering with La Resistencia, answering phone calls on the group‚Äôs hotline. Some of the most impactful calls, she said, were those in which the person on the other end of the line said that they wanted to harm themselves or when she found out one person had died inside. This intimacy with despair and injustice catalyzed her, and she realized she had to do something more about it. ‚ÄúI have to continue fighting this, not just for my brother, but because possibly one day also I may be in there, and so I want to keep fighting for every single person that is not able to defend themselves,‚Äù she said. In addition to the violence and corruption of her home state, climate change has brought intensified cycles of drought and flooding that have made it extremely difficult for people to subsistence farm or grow food to sell there. As a result, so many have been forced to migrate, she added. Climate change impacts have been overwhelmingly driven by countries of the Global North, including the U.S. Reyes recounted how Mora-Villalpando reached out to her when she walked out of the detention facility in Tacoma after visiting her brother. ‚ÄúShe told me who she was, she offered support, and she told me a little bit about what the people were talking about, the conditions inside. She said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not alone. Here‚Äôs my number. Call me if anything comes up,‚Äù Reyes said. Reyes has since risen through the ranks of La Resistencia to direct the Organization, as Mora-Villalpando has transitioned to an advisory position. ‚ÄúI call it a detention center because everybody knows them as detention centers, but they‚Äôre cages,‚Äù Mora-Villalpando said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the result of allowing governments to decide who‚Äôs worthy of what. If you are forced to migrate, you‚Äôre already being shaped into what you‚Äôre supposed to be, what you‚Äôre supposed to have, and what you‚Äôre not supposed to have, and what you don‚Äôt have is because ‚Äòyou deserve it,‚Äô‚Äù she said ironically. She said an ideology is formed where people agree that some people deserve to be caged. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what detention centers are,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always said they‚Äôre an extension of the prison system.‚Äù In this case, the private, for-profit prison system.‚ÄúThe idea has been not only how these white invaders took over our continents,‚Äù she added, ‚Äúbut how they continue to be exploiting. They already have our land, they already have our labor, they already have our mind, and now they want to have our bodies to further capital‚Äîby having these cages, these storage places, where you [store] people like boxes, and you still make money off them,‚Äù she concluded.

Nishant Pitti, chairman and founder of travel aggregator EaseMyTrip, has alleged that one of his rival companies MakeMyTrip, has a loophole on their website. Pitti claimed that the company, which is ‚Äòmajorly owned by China‚Äô, compromises the data safety of Indian armed forces who use the platform to book tickets. In an X post on Wednesday, Pitti claimed that Indian Armed Forces personnel who book tickets via this platform using their defence IDs - inadvertently disclose their route and destination to China - since the platform is ‚Äòmajorly owned by China‚Äô. ‚ÄúIndian Armed Forces book discounted tickets via a platform majorly owned by China, entering Defence ID, route & date. Our enemies know where our soldiers are flying. Attaching screenshots exposing this loophole - it must be patched now,‚Äù he said. While Pitti did not name the platform in his post initially, the screenshots and one of his follow-up posts in the comment box suggest that the company in question was indeed MakeMyTrip. According to Pitti's post, Trip.com Group Limited (previously Ctrip.com International Limited) holds a ‚Äòmajority‚Äô stake in MakeMyTrip. The company had acquired a stake in the company in September 2019. The post further claims that Vangard Group Inc. holds a 12.43 per cent stake in the company, while BlackRock Inc. has a 10.85 per cent stake. Fidelity Management and Research has a 7.82 per cent stake, Morgan Stanley has 6.37 per cent stake. Other institutional investors hold 22.53 per cent shares of the company, while public companies and individuals have 44.6 per cent stake. MakeMyTrip, a Nasdaq listed company, has 331 institutional holders who own over 7.6 crore shares in the company, according to the Nasdaq website. Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., Ltd., Baillie Gifford & Co, FMR LLC, GQG Partners LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are the top five institutional investors with MakeMyTrip shares. When LiveMint reached out to MakeMyTrip regarding Pitti's allegations, a spokesperson said that the company is solely Indian with a diverse shareholder base around the globe. ‚ÄúMakeMyTrip is a proud Indian company, founded by Indians, headquartered in India, and trusted by millions of Indian travellers for over 25 years. We are a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq, with a diverse shareholder base spanning the globe," said a MakeMyTrip spokesperson. The company further said that its operations are independent and refused to comment on the accusations. ‚ÄúOur operations are independent, steered by a seasoned team of Indian professionals who bring a wealth of expertise and a commitment to excellence. We adhere to stringent corporate governance standards, fully complying with all applicable Indian laws and data privacy frameworks.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt comment on malicious or motivated accusations and remain focused on offering our best services to our customers as a responsible Indian corporate.‚Äù Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Learn more. ‚Äì Sarah Morton When major financial institutions ‚Äî from Citi and Standard Chartered to Brevan Howard, McKinsey and BCG ‚Äî rally around a once-niche innovation, it‚Äôs a good idea to take note, especially when the innovation is stablecoins, a tokenized representation of money on-chain. What email was to the internet, stablecoin is to blockchain ‚Äî instant and cost-effective value transfer at a global scale running 24/7. Stablecoin is blockchain‚Äôs first killer use case. First introduced by Tether in 2015 and hailed as the first stablecoin, USDT offered early crypto users a way to hold and transfer a stable, dollar-denominated value on-chain. Until then, their only alternative was bitcoin. Tether‚Äôs dollar-backed stablecoin made its debut on Bitfinex before rapidly spreading to major exchanges like Binance and OKX. It quickly became the default trading pair across the digital asset ecosystem. As adoption grew, so did its utility. No longer just a trading tool, stablecoin emerged as the primary cash-equivalent for trading, cash management, and payments. Below is the trajectory of stablecoin‚Äôs market size since inception, a reflection of its evolution from a crypto niche to a core pillar of digital finance. The reason stablecoins have been a hot topic in finance is their rapid adoption and growth. According to Visa, stablecoin on-chain transaction volume exceeded $5.5 trillion in 2024. By comparison, Visa‚Äôs volume was $13.2 trillion while Mastercard transacted $9.7 trillion during the same period. Why such proliferation? Because stable dollar-denominated cash is the lifeblood for the entire digital assets ecosystem. Here are 3 major use cases for stablecoin. 1. Digital Assets Trading Given its origins, it's no surprise that trading was stablecoin‚Äôs first major use case. What began as a niche tool for value preservation in 2015 is now the beating heart of digital asset trading. Today, stablecoins underpin over $30 trillion in annual trading volume across centralized exchanges, powering the vast majority of spot and derivatives activity. But stablecoin‚Äôs impact doesn‚Äôt end with centralized exchanges ‚Äî It is also the liquidity backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi). Onchain traders need the same reliable cash equivalent for moving in and out of positions. A glance at leading decentralized platforms, such as Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and Hyperliquid, shows that top trading pairs are consistently denominated by stablecoins. Monthly decentralized exchange volumes routinely hit $100-200 billion, according to The Block, further cementing stablecoin‚Äôs role as the foundational layer of the modern digital assets market. 2. Real World Assets Real-world assets (RWAs) are tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as bonds and equities. Once a fringe idea, RWAs are now among the fastest-growing asset classes in crypto. Leading this wave is the tokenized U.S. Treasury market, now boasting over $6 billion AUM. Launched in early 2023, these on-chain Treasuries opened the door for crypto-native capital to access the low-risk, short-duration US T-Bills yield. The adoption saw a staggering 6,000% growth according to RWA.xyz: from just $100 million in early 2023 to over $6 billion AUM today. Asset management heavyweights such as BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity (pending SEC approval) are all creating on-chain treasury products for digital capital markets. Unlike traditional Treasuries, these digital versions offer 24/7 instant mint/redemptions, and seamless composability with other DeFi yield opportunities. Investors can subscribe and redeem around the clock, with stablecoin liquidity delivered in real time. Circle‚Äôs facility with BlackRock‚Äôs BUIDL and PayPal‚Äôs integration with Ondo‚Äôs OUSG are just two prominent examples. 3. Payment A major emerging use case for stablecoins is cross-border payment, especially in corridors underserved by traditional financial infrastructure. In much of the world, international payments remain slow, expensive, and error-prone due to dependency on correspondent banking. By contrast, stablecoins offer merchants and consumers an alternative with its instant, low-cost, always-on transfers. According to research from a16z, stablecoin payments are 99.99% cheaper and 99.99% faster than traditional wire transfers and they settle 24/7. The shift is gaining momentum in the West, too. Stripe‚Äôs $1 billion acquisition of Bridge and subsequent introduction of Stablecoin Financial Account signal the start of mainstream global adoption. Meanwhile, PayPal‚Äôs rollout of yield on PYUSD balances highlights stablecoin‚Äôs rise as a legitimate retail payment vertical. What was once a crypto-native solution is fast becoming a global financial utility. - Harvey Li, founder, Tokenization Insight Q. In light of the recent news from Europe regarding stablecoins and Tether, can you explain how stablecoin investment is valuable to an individual? A. In the inherently volatile and highly risky world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins provide individuals with a capital-efficient way to gain exposure to digital assets. Pegged to fiat currencies like the euro or commodities like gold, these digital assets provide stability and a hedge against crypto‚Äôs volatility. Crypto individuals can park their funds safely in stablecoins during times of uncertainty without having to exit the market and deal with TradFi. This is why stablecoins dominate crypto. Their combined market cap has surpassed $245bln, a massive 15x growth over the last five years. Q. Given current market trends in Europe, are stablecoins more or less susceptible to market fluctuations? A. While stablecoins are inherently less volatile than typical crypto assets, they remain sensitive to regulatory developments and issuer credibility. When it comes to Europe, specifically, stablecoins have become less susceptible to market fluctuations due to stringent regulatory measures. This includes the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which provides a clear legal framework that requires stablecoin issuers to maintain adequate reserves and comply with strict governance standards. Such rules reduce the risk of de-pegging and enhance overall stability. However, this leads to market consolidation, a lack of competition, and reduced innovation at the same time. Q. Is Europe becoming a new stablecoin hub as it becomes more receptive to crypto? A. Europe has been signalling a friendly approach to crypto through MiCA, the first comprehensive crypto framework globally that introduces licensing requirements for digital asset service providers and AML protocols. The aim is to create a structured and harmonized regulatory environment for the crypto market, protect customers, and ensure financial stability. Through its evolving MiCA regulations, Europe could certainly enhance institutional confidence and attract more stablecoin issuers. However, that would require overcoming licensing (a lengthy and costly process) issues, effective implementation at national levels, and adapting to the fast-progressing crypto space. Europe is currently not a global leader in stablecoin adoption, but with clearer rules coming into place and its openness to compliant entities, it is well-positioned to emerge as a key hub for compliant stablecoin innovation. - Trevor Koverko, co-founder, Sapien Harvey Li writes about the business of tokenization and help teams navigate the roadblocks that stall adoption.

The Hong Kong firm's attempt to sell most of its port operations to a US-led consortium was first announced in March after weeks of pressure from Donald Trump. The US president has refused to rule out military intervention to "take back" the crucial waterway -- which was handed over to Panama in 1999 -- from alleged Chinese control. Beijing has criticised the sale of the assets to a group led by giant asset manager BlackRock, opening an investigation into the deal to ensure it is handled lawfully. CK Hutchinson underlined on Monday that "the transaction would never be carried out in any illegal or non-compliant manner". Asked about the firm's statement on Thursday, a spokeswoman for China's commerce ministry said that "all parties to the transaction must not attempt to circumvent the review process in any way". No deal may be implemented without prior approval, He Yongqian said at a regular press conference, warning of "legal liability" in the event of proceeding without authorisation. "It is hoped that the companies involved will maintain a clear understanding of this and proceed with caution," said He. The business empire built by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing is registered in the Cayman Islands and the assets being sold are all outside China. Beijing's next moves in scrutinising CK Hutchison may also have far-reaching implications on Hong Kong and its role as China's business gateway to the world, analysts told AFP.

Title: US attorneys general fly free to luxury hotel in Rome thanks to group funded by corporate interests | CNN Politics
URL: https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/politics/attorneys-general-luxury-trips-lobbyists-rome-invs

Follow: As thousands gathered to mourn the pope last month, a group of American state government officials were ushered past a lengthy line to a Vatican museum. They hadn‚Äôt come for a Pope Francis memorial, though. At the museum, Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor snapped photos surrounded by a scrum of lawyers and lobbyists. Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill smiled as she stood next to an attorney from a firm representing a company her office is suing. Idaho Attorney General Ra√∫l Labrador chatted with the head of a corporate consultancy. Those attorneys general had all traveled to Rome for free ‚Äì thanks to an association funded by some of the same companies whose representatives now chatted up the American officials. That group also organized the officials‚Äô stay in an opulent, luxury hotel and their chauffeured sightseeing around the Eternal City. As CNN documented in March, companies have regularly paid to enjoy this kind of special access through the nonprofit Attorney General Alliance, which organizes trips to US resorts and foreign destinations. The AGA‚Äôs Rome trip offers the most detailed evidence yet of the close access corporate powers gain at these junkets ‚Äì and of the potential conflicts of interest that come with that arrangement. Critics say that by accepting luxury trips funded by donations from corporate interests, attorneys general may undermine public trust in their actions, especially their mission to enforce the law against powerful interests. ‚ÄúIt hurts the credibility of the office and the rule of law for attorneys general to use their status to elicit this kind of luxury travel,‚Äù said Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at NYU Law. ‚ÄúIf they really need to meet‚Ä¶ how about Chicago in January?‚Äù In a statement to CNN, AGA said the delegation to Rome included meetings with international law enforcement partners and Vatican officials on a range of issues including human trafficking. The trip also included accredited legal educational sessions for the attorneys general. ‚ÄúThe goal of our meeting was to discuss solutions for stronger enforcement of the law and better protection for those who are trafficked as modern-day slaves,‚Äù AGA‚Äôs general counsel Tania Maestas said in the statement. Maestas said no litigation was discussed during the delegation and defended the attendance of state attorneys general. ‚ÄúTo conflate lawful business travel with a violation of the rule of law is to substitute optics for legality,‚Äù Maestas said. ‚ÄúThe credibility of an office is best preserved not by avoiding all activity that might be perceived unfavorably, but by upholding the rule of law.‚Äù A draft itinerary for the week-long Rome trip lists law enforcement meetings on topics like cryptocurrency and human trafficking in the mornings ‚Äì but also other times blocked off for meals and tourism, like visits to museums and a tour of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica. The schedule for Friday listed only an unspecified ‚Äúoptional excursion‚Äù and a ‚Äúclosing dinner.‚Äù Participants stayed at the five-star Rome Cavalieri hotel, which describes itself as an ‚Äúopulent haven‚Äù and the ‚Äúpeak of prestige.‚Äù A CNN reporter spotted Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown resting with his eyes closed near the hotel pool on a sunny morning. A spokesperson for Brown‚Äôs office said he was honored to participate in the trip ‚Äúto advance critical international law enforcement partnerships.‚Äù Documents show AGA covered business-class flights to Italy for the attorneys general and their guests. For example, AGA reimbursed Attorney General Brown and his wife for tickets totaling over $14,000, according to copies of the flight receipts obtained by CNN. An AGA staffer also booked tickets for Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and his wife, emails obtained through public records requests show. A separate AGA email last year touted the Rome trip as an ‚Äúunforgettable experience.‚Äù AGA did not respond to a question about how many attorneys general attended the conference. CNN asked attorneys general offices in all 50 states whether they planned to participate. Thirty-two offices said they were not attending, and 16 did not answer. Brown‚Äôs office in Maryland confirmed that he was attending, and after the trip, a spokesperson for Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said that he attended with his family and secured a $100,000 grant from AGA to fight human trafficking. New Mexico Attorney General Ra√∫l Torrez also accepted an invitation for the trip, according to an AGA email from November obtained through a records request. A spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James told CNN last month she was not attending. Hours after this story published, her office responded to a public records request with emails that show one of her staffer‚Äôs wrote to AGA in January, ‚ÄúAG James is a yes to Rome.‚Äù Her office did not immediately respond to a question about why she ultimately did not attend. CNN reporters in Rome also observed the attorneys general for Alaska, Idaho and Louisiana. AGA, which pulled in nearly $27 million in sponsorships between 2019 and 2023 ‚Äì the last year of records available in public financial reports ‚Äì largely relies on donations from companies to fund its trips. Attorneys general also pay thousands of dollars per year in membership dues using taxpayer funds. The group has previously granted varying levels of perks to companies based on how much they have contributed, records show. An AGA document from 2023, for example, promised sponsors who contributed $100,000 access to ‚Äúinvite-only events‚Äù and speaking slots at conferences not available to donors who gave $30,000. One donor listed in previous AGA documents is WilmerHale, an international law firm that represents companies across a range of industries. One of the firm‚Äôs partners, Paul Connell, attended the AGA trip to Rome, where he joined at least three state attorneys general and other business representatives for a tour of the Vatican Museums. After exiting the delegation‚Äôs tour bus, Connell stood beside Louisiana Attorney General Murrill at one point. This year, Murrill joined a dozen other Republican attorneys general in a lawsuit against investment companies alleging an anticompetitive conspiracy restricting coal production. Connell‚Äôs firm WilmerHale represents asset management company BlackRock in the case. The defendants in the lawsuit have argued the case ‚Äúspins a farfetched theory‚Äù and fails to offer facts that demonstrate a conspiracy. Connell is not listed in court records as one of WilmerHale‚Äôs attorneys working on the case. Asked what, if anything, Connell discussed with Murrill on the trip, a WilmerHale spokesperson said conversations between firms and clients are privileged and noted that the Louisiana Department of Justice is a firm client. Murrill‚Äôs office did not respond to a question about whether her attendance and interaction with Connell in Rome posed a potential conflict of interest related to the BlackRock case. In an interview on the podcast Legal Speak last month, Murrill encouraged companies to engage with state attorneys general offices, though she seemed to acknowledge that access through AGA comes at a price. ‚ÄúIt also can depend on the size of your business, what can you afford?‚Äù Murrill said. ‚ÄúThe Attorney General Alliance is a membership organization but it has enormous value because you can engage on the front end ‚Ä¶ and you can meet a lot of attorney generals including your own in the states where you do business.‚Äù As the AGA tour group joined the line for the Vatican Museums, other corporate attorneys and lobbyists identified by CNN could be seen standing alongside the attorneys general. Among them was Kia Floyd, the vice president of state and local policy for General Motors, which was listed in a 2023 AGA document as one of the group‚Äôs sponsors. General Motors and Floyd did not respond to requests for comment. In the last year, General Motors was sued in separate cases by Texas and Arkansas over allegations regarding the company‚Äôs handling of private customer data. General Motors has denied the allegations and stated in court it has provided all necessary information for consumers to assess its products. A spokesperson for Arkansas Attorney General Griffin said his boss ‚Äúmet and exchanged pleasantries with Ms. Floyd but did not discuss the lawsuit against General Motors, which we are pursuing aggressively to hold GM accountable.‚Äù The Texas attorney general‚Äôs office did not respond to a question about whether he joined the Rome trip. Others identified in the Vatican tour group include Andrew Cook, a partner at the law firm Orrick, and Preston Baldwin, the CEO of corporate strategy firm, Centerpoint360. CNN confirmed their attendance by reaching their rooms at the Rome Cavalieri. They did not respond to requests for comment. ‚ÄúWhat I often counsel clients is state AGs are enormously important. You can‚Äôt neglect them. You have to go right to them‚Ä¶ having a game plan put in place is really important,‚Äù Cook said during a webinar for the Federalist Society last year. Gillers, the NYU professor, said he doesn‚Äôt fault private companies for seeking to influence state officials. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame them,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI blame the attorneys general for going. They should just say no.‚Äù ¬© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans ‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2016 Cable News Network.

Title: Serious BlackRock Bitcoin Warning Fuels ‚ÄòDisaster‚Äô Fears As The Price Suddenly Dives

ByBilly Bambrough ByBilly Bambrough, Senior Contributor. Bitcoin has dropped back towards $100,000, falling sharply after a sudden surge fueled fears of a U.S. dollar collapse. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes‚Äô CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price, which earlier this week topped $105,000, has swung wildly over the last month as traders brace for further price shocks. Now, as Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly plotting to blow up the bitcoin price and crypto market, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, BlackRock, has quietly added a serious warning about quantum computing to the list of risks to its huge spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex‚ÄîA daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run BlackRock chief executive Larry Fink has become one of the most bullish pro-bitcoin voices on Wall ...

BlackRock, which manages after around $10 trillion worth of assets for investors, spearheaded Wall Street‚Äôs campaign to bring a long-awaited spot bitcoin ETF to market in 2023, with a fleet of funds debuting in January 2024. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT spot bitcoin ETF has since become one of the fastest growing ETFs of all-time helping to push the bitcoin price record highs and riding a bullish wave on the back of Donald Trump‚Äôs election as U.S. president in November after Trump declared himself the first ‚Äúcrypto president.‚Äù The fund now holds almost 3% of the 21 million bitcoin that will ever exist, worth $62 billion at the current bitcoin price, which some have warned could be giving BlackRock outsized control over the network. ‚Äú[BlackRock is] going to highlight any potential thing that can go wrong with any product they list or underlying asset thats being invested in,‚Äù James Seyffart, ETF analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, posted to X, adding such a warning is ‚Äúcompletely standard.‚Äù However, the quantum computing risk to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has exploded recently, with tech giants including Google‚Äôs Alphabet making strides in quantum computing research. ‚ÄúAt this point, no blockchain is ready to withstand a quantum attack when this becomes possible, which could very well be much earlier than 2030,‚Äù David Carvalho, the chief executive of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure blockchain Naoris Protocol, said in emailed comments. ‚ÄúFinance giants know the risk is there‚ÄîBlackRock flagged the risk of quantum computing to bitcoin just this week.

More fears bitcoin could be "sleepwalking into disaster." It has long been feared that if a company or government is able to create a fully-fledged quantum computer, it could be used to bypass the encryption that secures the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, potentially rending the network vulnerable to a devastating hack. Such vulnerabilities could be patched with software updates. In February, Paolo Ardoino, the chief executive of USDT stablecoin issuer Tether, predicted that quantum computing would eventually enable hackers to break into inactive bitcoin wallets and steal dormant coins‚Äîincluding that linked to mysterious, anonymous bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. ‚ÄúAny bitcoin in lost wallets, including Satoshi (if not alive), will be hacked and put back in circulation,‚Äù Ardoino posted to X at the time, calling for development of "quantum-resistant addresses" and adding that "quantum computing is still very far from any meaningful risk of breaking bitcoin cryptography.‚Äù

ByLawrence Wintermeyer ByLawrence Wintermeyer, Contributor. Ethereum Pectra Upgrade May 7, 2025 The much-awaited Pectra upgrade on the Ethereum mainnet arrived on May 7. It will enable enhanced scalability for Layer-2 networks, reduce transaction fees, and increase validator staking limits. Ethereum upgrades are critical for the network to boost scalability and optimize security without compromising decentralization. The Pectra upgrade provides a new opportunity for institutional investors to enter the Ethereum ecosystem. ‚ÄúEthereum continues to cement its position as the institutional blockchain of choice, and the Pectra upgrade only strengthens that narrative," Trevor Koverko, Web3 investor and co-founder of the startup Sapien, told me in an interview. ‚ÄúWith native staking yields, deep liquidity, and a maturing regulatory perception, ETH staking has become an increasingly attractive destination for institutional capital seeking low-correlation, yield-generating exposure to crypto. Ethereum‚Äôs modular roadmap and protocol-level innovation uniquely position it to absorb this next wave of capital with both scalability and trust.‚Äù The Pectra upgrade will better enable traditional financial institutions to deploy capital reserves into native ETH staking for boosted rewards. Since institutional capital has historically preferred Ethereum as a settlement layer, the Pectra upgrade will further enhance the network‚Äôs capabilities to cater to institutional capital‚Äôs demands. The market has responded favorably to the Pectra upgrade. ETH‚Äôs market capitalization was up 42% by May 12, just five days following Pectra‚Äôs implementation. With a market cap of over $322 billion, Ethereum became the world‚Äôs 39th largest asset, in the good company of firms like Coca-Cola and Alibaba‚Äôs stocks. The ETH futures market also recorded a rise in open interest from $21.3 billion to $30.4 billion, signaling increased market activity and trader engagement. Unlike most crypto tokens, ETH‚Äôs price action is bolstered technical upgrades which help set the stage for further improvements and a sustained growth of the network. The Pectra upgrade brings almost a dozen Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) into a single release for an improved Ethereum ecosystem. Thomas Panicker, director of devops at EchoBase, explains ‚ÄúThe Pectra upgrade is another critical step forward in Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing roadmap, combining both the Prague (execution layer) and Electra (consensus layer) upgrades to improve usability, security, and validator operations. A significant improvement in Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra is EIP-7251, which increases the staking limit or maximum validator staking balance from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. Although validators will need 32 ETH to start staking, they‚Äôll be able to earn rewards for up to 2,048 ETH in one validator instead of remaining capped at 32 ETH. Raising the ETH staking limit provides more flexibility to stakers who don‚Äôt hold ETH in multiples of 32. For instance, if someone has 50 ETH, they can now stake it under one validator to earn rewards on the full amount. Earlier, out of 50 ETH, they could stake just 32 ETH, and the remaining 18 ETH would remain idle. Bohdan Opryshko, co-founder and chief operating officer of Everstake, a leading institutional-grade non-custodial staking provider says, "The Pectra upgrade marks a major step toward making Ethereum significantly more appealing for institutional players. Most notably, we're seeing a 64x reduction in slashing risk. By consolidating infrastructure and reducing the number of validator nodes needed, institutions can now manage their staking setups with far greater efficiency and security. In practical terms, this means fewer human touchpoints, less room for operational errors, and dramatically easier infrastructure management." Further, the Pectra upgrade implements EIP-7002 for easier validator withdrawals, enabling validators to unstake directly through a simple Ethereum transaction instead of using the Beacon Chain. Subsequently, it makes institutional staking easier, providing stakers flexibility and lowering barriers even for those who aren‚Äôt technical experts. Earlier, staking service clients had to compulsorily obtain a signed message from staking service providers to exit their position. Since the message generation took about 13 hours, stakers had to wait till that time to exit. With Pectra, the exit delay is reduced to just 13 minutes, enabling quick staking withdrawals. Artemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at P2P.org, says, ‚ÄúThe Pectra upgrade is a major unlock for institutional staking, especially with account abstraction paving the way for smarter, automated strategies. One area gaining traction is the automated calculation of the ideal withdrawal time for staked ETH. Instead of relying on static schedules, this approach dynamically evaluates real-time network conditions, like validator exit queues, churn limits, and forecasted reward rates, to identify the most advantageous withdrawal window. Paired with automated execution, it reduces manual overhead and maximizes returns.‚Äù Opryshko adds, "Withdrawal times are shrinking from up to 13 hours to as little as 13 minutes in some cases. That brings Ethereum closer to the liquidity expectations of traditional finance, where 2‚Äì3 business days is the standard, and even allows it to outperform them. If we can consistently offer liquidity in under a day, it removes a major friction point for large funds exploring on-chain staking. The Pectra upgrade also implements EIP-6110 for faster staking deposits to accelerate validator activation through processing staking deposits directly on Ethereum‚Äôs execution layer. This makes staking seamless, reduces wait times, and improves efficiency, enabling validators to earn faster rewards. Simultaneously, EIP-7685 offers enhanced communication between Ethereum‚Äôs execution and consensus layers, improving validator actions like deposits and withdrawals, thereby making Ethereum staking much smoother. Whereas EIP-7549 makes Ethereum validator voting more efficient, making its staking system scalable and less resource-intensive. Panicker adds, ‚ÄúOne of the most notable enhancements is EIP-3074, which introduces advanced account abstraction capabilities ‚Äî enabling smart contract-style behavior from externally owned accounts (EOAs). This change could significantly simplify user interactions and improve wallet design, potentially helping with broader adoption.‚Äù Regular wallets function like smart contracts through gas fee sponsorship, passkey authentication, and batching transactions, help to reduce friction during transaction processing. The combined benefits of implementing multiple EIPs in the Pectra upgrade make ETH staking conducive for institutional capital. Critics often point out TradFi money doesn‚Äôt flow into Ethereum citing ETH ETFs have just over $5 billion in AUM compared to $115 billion for bitcoin ETFs. It is not a fair comparison, more apples and oranges and conflates the fundamentals. BTC is a store of value, ETH is a utility - the Ethereum network has emerged as the preferred base layer for institutions for transacting digital assets. Major financial institutions like BlackRock, the European Investment Bank, Deutsche Bank, and UBS, use Ethereum for deploying their on-chain strategies. The institutional preference for Ethereum comes from its credibility as a decentralized and secure public network. Ethereum hosts over 58% of tokenized real-world assets, over 52 % of the DeFi industry‚Äôs total locked value, and 95% of stablecoin volume. Wall Street investors prefer Ethereum for its network effects, high liquidity reserves, and composability, unlike other blockchains that have become token islands or private walled gardens, all which fragment liquidity creating inefficiencies and driving usage costs up. Ethereum has also adopted new security token standards like ERC-3643 and ERC-1400 with built-in KYC and AML compliance mechanisms. Subsequently, in March 2025, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, the post-trade market infrastructure that processes $3.7 quadrillion in security transactions, now supports the issuance and management of ERC-3643 tokens. Hatu Sheikh, founder of Coin Terminal, elaborated, ‚ÄúBesides security and decentralization, transparency and seamless user experience are key to deploying successful on-chain products. The Pectra upgrade stands out for making ETH staking simple and attractive for institutional investors with more rewards, faster deposits and withdrawals, and enhanced efficiency. So we can expect more institutions to now participate in ETH staking for generating yields.‚Äù Ethereum‚Äôs native staking yield makes it a lucrative fixed-income instrument within the digital asset space. TradFi players and institutions can leverage the yield from ETH staking to other financial instruments for generating additional income. As Panicker further explains, ‚ÄúFor enterprises and protocol developers, it‚Äôs a signal that Ethereum is not just evolving technically, but maturing toward a more developer-friendly and scalable base layer. While the Pectra upgrade doesn‚Äôt directly impact our business model today, these innovations move the ecosystem toward more modular and abstracted infrastructure ‚Äî something that can eventually benefit wallet providers, custodial services, and L2 integrations by offering more flexibility, especially around permissions and transaction delegation.‚Äù A decade ago, Ethereum transformed the digital asset industry with its smart contract functionalities, making decentralized applications accessible to users. Ten years later, it continues to be the forerunner in technical innovation. The Pectra upgrade will be followed by Fusaka and Glamsterdam upgrades to handle big data and optimize gas. These upgrade will continue to make Ethereum the preferred destination for institutional capital to build products, participate in native ETH staking, and drive future-proof digital RWA and new and innovative product and collateralization use cases.

Title: Trump Smoke and Mirrors on Full Display in Claimed ‚Äú$142 Billion‚Äù Saudi Arms Deal

Given how the spectacle of Trump going to the Middle East and collecting cash and prizes like his much-hyped $142 billion Saudi arms ‚Äúdeal‚Äù, part of a purported $600 billion investment package, and his much-criticized Qatari airplane ‚Äúgift‚Äù, Bloomberg has provided a useful service in picking apart the inflated figures in the arms agreement claim. Even though it‚Äôs important to understand how great the Trump claim inflation is, so that recipients will hopefully apply a large discount any time Trump makes a grand pronouncement, he persists in this behavior because it is an effective form of cognitive anchoring. The public and press will remember the $142 billion, and not any properly haircut figure. Consider another recent example, Trump‚Äôs loud claim that the US acted as a mediator in the India-Pakistan ceasefire talks. Washington Monthly explained how that claim was not only false but actually detrimental: India and Pakistan have reached a ceasefire in their recent conflict, which significantly decreases the risk of a nuclear war this week. However, the amateur-hour way Donald Trump‚Äôs administration handled this crisis increased (if only slightly) the chance of a nuclear exchange down the line. It illustrates why Trump‚Äôs everything-is-about-me style of governance isn‚Äôt just a harmless embarrassment, but a daily disaster‚Ä¶. First, Trump claimed credit for the ceasefire, boasting that the U.S. had ‚Äúmediated‚Äù it. India issued an immediate denial, but the mistake ran deeper than poaching an honor. In diplomacy, words matter. And as everyone in the region knows, the word ‚Äúmediate‚Äù is a diplomatic landmine. Ever since 1947, India has strenuously rejected outside ‚Äúmediation‚Äù of the Kashmir conflict‚Ä¶. Did the U.S. play an intermediary role in helping India and Pakistan reach a ceasefire agreement? Sure‚Äîas did Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and China (none of which rushed to the microphones to seize credit). As India stated in smacking down Trump‚Äôs claim, it was the two parties themselves who reached an accord, not any external actor seeking to impose ‚Äúmediation.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Second, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a far more substantive negotiation than the one approved. Mindful of his boss‚Äôs unquenchable thirst to be seen as a master deal-maker, Rubio posted that the two nations had agreed to ‚Äútalks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.‚Äù A ‚Äúbroad set of issues‚Äù really means ‚Äúlong-term disposition of Kashmir‚Äù‚Äî or at least that‚Äôs how Pakistan wants (and India fears) these words will be interpreted. Did Modi agree to such negotiations, and in response to a terrorist action? Vanishingly unlikely. Did India agree to any talks on any topic? Unlikely, but not impossible, although India immediately denied this, too. So even if Rubio‚Äôs statement contained a kernel of truth, any talks were ones India intended to keep secret. Rubio‚Äôs decision to spotlight them (if they even existed) stroked Trump‚Äôs ego, but at the expense of progress or U.S. credibility‚Ä¶. Another dangerous result of Trump and Rubio‚Äôs statements is that they unwittingly promoted Pakistan‚Äôs agenda, thereby encouraging a replay of the same hazardous behavior. There‚Äôs more where that came from, but you get the drift of the gist: Trump‚Äôs claims were wildly inflated His extreme ego needs are harmful to international security John Helmer has said that the Russians have realized they are negotiating with a cult of personality and have been proceeding accordingly. But there is another implication: look how many words it took to debunk the Trump claim and question the Rubio follow on (as in either its accuracy or its propriety). How many people pay that much attention, let alone have a tolerance for complex arguments? This is the general problem with bullshit. It takes a minimum of 3x the space, and often more than 10x, to disprove it. Similarly, a new article in the Financial Times, What has Elon Musk‚Äôs Doge actually achieved?, takes a harsh look at the many promises made, from cost savings to transparency, and finds them sorely wanting. The pink paper, as many others have, documents among other things how DOGE grossly inflated cost cuts and took credit for reductions that were already baked in. It even contends the DOGE approach was destined to do more harm than good: Doge ‚Äúgot off in the wrong direction because it attacked exactly the wrong thing,‚Äù says Matt Calkins, chief executive of software company Appian, which powers much of government procurement and has worked with the initiative on some cost-cutting measures. ‚ÄúOf all the things you could do to affect the government, it would have been better to go after regulation. It would have been better to go after entitlements. Just blowing up jobs was a good way to make enemies, a good way to cause more disruption than progress.‚Äù But this detailed analysis (the full article is very much worth a read) misses a major, if not the point, of DOGE nevertheless advancing the reactionary libertarian agenda of destroying government services. The Big Lie repetition of ‚Äúfraud‚Äù has been effective. Fraud is a risk in all commercial activity, even one to one dealings. The question for any organization is the cost and effectiveness of fraud prevention and mitigation measures. In just about all instances, having anti-abuse measures that are so stringent as to reduce it to zero is too costly, both in terms of hard outlays like staffing, as well as more complex considerations (for businesses, alienating potential customers; for government, greatly restricting delivering services to target populations). For instance, a long-standing ally of the site casually mentioned of the Trump demolition exercise, that Something (by implication, Something Big) needed to be done. I disputed that contention. With complex systems, like human bodies, even if there is a problem, limited interventions are always preferred to radical ones, so a stent is a better solution (if viable) than a heart replacement. The big reasons include less risk to the patient, lower costs, plus the conservative treatment typically does not preclude more aggressive ones later. But in keeping with the idea that DOGE was at least in part a messaging operation, we‚Äôve had far too many otherwise intelligent readers pump for a teardown‚Ä¶with no real logic as to why, let alone any clue of what comes next. Now to Bloomberg on the Saudi arms deal puffery, politely headlined as US-Saudi $142 Billion Defense Deal Sparks Questions, Few Answers. Key extracts: The Trump administration called its $142 billion defense deal with Saudi Arabia ‚Äúthe largest defense sales agreement in history.‚Äù Critics aren‚Äôt so sure‚Ä¶. But like the broader $600 billion economic deal that it was a part of, the defense agreement lacked any specifics. And skeptics of the administration immediately pointed to questions around the numbers. One is that Saudi Arabia‚Äôs entire defense budget this year is $78 billion, estimated Bruce Riedel, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Yves here. Both the Administration and Congress have a habit of using CBO scoring numbers, which tally total outlays over the next ten years for a particular program or piece of legislation, as the cost, which many news-readers mistakenly treat as expected next-year outlays. But if that was the treatment, there should have been some disclosure, say in a yet-to-be-produced briefing paper. Back to Bloomberg: Democratic and Republican administrations alike have a long history of re-purposing previous deals into sweeping, headline-grabbing agreements for presidents to sign during trips. Trump did it before, during his first-term trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017, when he announced the Saudis would spend $110 billion on US weapons to modernize the kingdom‚Äôs military. That package included deals negotiated under the Obama administration and others that were in the initial stages of a lengthy process requiring congressional approval and negotiations between the buyer and defense contractors. To date, the 2017 deal has yielded more than $30 billion in implemented foreign military sales to Saudi Arabia, according to a State Department fact sheet in January‚Ä¶. If deals do eventually emerge from the White House and Saudi Arabia, experts will start sorting through what was new and what was old. Already, there are more than $129 billion in active military sales to Saudi Arabia from the US, according to the State Department fact sheet. Yves again. So perhaps only $13 billion in incremental commitments? To Bloomberg again, which stresses that the hype has commercial value to the US: ‚ÄúA lot of this is about the optics, but the optics matter,‚Äù said Brian Katulis, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an attempt to send a message of reassurance after several years of uncertainty in the US-Saudi bilateral relationship on defense cooperation.‚Äù The agreement is likely to yield real gains, particularly in the realm of missile defense, where the US has much to offer and Saudi Arabia has significant needs, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on defense strategy and budgeting. At a time when some of the US‚Äôs traditional allies in Europe may be reluctant to purchase weapons from Washington, Saudi Arabia‚Äôs willingness to do so is especially welcome, he said. Regular readers are likely wondering why the Saudis and the Europeans are so keen about US weapons, given not just the way Russian systems have regularly proven to be superior in Ukraine, but even the way the stereotyped sandal-wearing Houthis chased the US out of Middle East waterways. The practical difficulty (aside from the elephant in the room of geopolitics) of integrating disparate systems is large, including training of operators. The Russians make a big point of backwards integration in the operation of major systems like military planes: if a soldier knows an old system, it will be close to trivial for him to learn to manage a new one. By contrast, Ukraine military pilots had grown up flying Soviet planes. Many experts warned that trying to retrain them to operate Western aircraft was an impossible ask. If they had to undertake an action under high pressure, they would default to what amounted to muscle memory in flying the Soviet jets, which would be all wrong for the Western ones. The high level of not-well-explained losses of Ukraine-operated F-16s validates this concern. However, an upside of this Saudi arms buy is that it has the Israels worried. Bloomberg mentions that in passing: Even without specifics, some analysts said the scale and complexity of weapons purchases contemplated by Saudi Arabia could risk compromising Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúqualitative military edge‚Äù in the region, which US presidents for decades have committed to maintain‚Ä¶. But Dana Stroul, director of research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that the categories outlined by the White House have long been part of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs military modernization plans. Absent more detail about particular weapon systems, they don‚Äôt raise alarms about qualitative military edge, said Stroul, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East. A very long article in the Times of Israel, Trump signs deals with Saudis, including biggest-ever $142 billion arms agreement, has a banner above the header laying out a key worry: Expert: Gulf states stronger friends for Trump than Israel? The article weighs heavy on, and is clearly unhappy about, all of the pomp and circumstance during Trump‚Äôs visit. There is an absence of substance about the deals, but a lot not-well-coded whining: Biden had decided to pay a visit to Saudi Arabia as he looked to alleviate soaring prices at the pump for motorists at home and around the globe. At the time, Prince Mohammed‚Äôs reputation had been badly damaged by a US intelligence determination that found he had ordered the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But that dark moment appeared to be a distant memory for the prince as he rubbed elbows with high-profile business executives ‚Äî including Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk ‚Äî in front of the cameras and with Trump by his side‚Ä¶ Saudi Arabia and fellow OPEC+ nations have already helped their cause with Trump early in his second term by stepping up oil production‚Ä¶. William Wechsler, senior director of the Rafik Hariri Center and Middle East Programs at the Atlantic Council, said Trump‚Äôs decision to skip Israel on his first Middle East visit was remarkable. ‚ÄúThe main message coming out of this, at least as the itinerary stands today, is that the governments of the Gulf ‚Ä¶ are in fact stronger friends to President Trump than the current government of Israel at this moment,‚Äù Wechsler said. Admittedly, the Times does land a blow in its brief mention of corruption: The three countries on Trump‚Äôs itinerary ‚Äî Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates ‚Äî are places where the Trump Organization, run by the president‚Äôs two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. They include a high-rise tower in Jeddah, a luxury hotel in Dubai, and a golf course and villa complex in Qatar. Finally, the apparently big, even if again considerably exaggerated ‚Äú$600 billion‚Äù investment pledge counters the idea that the US is no longer a good place for foreign capital, as demonstrated by exits from US stocks post ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù on a scale to seriously weaken the dollar. A final question is what if anything the show of fealty by Middle Eastern states to US means for BRICS. As we have pointed out repeatedly, a big problem for BRICS is the comparative dearth of high GDP per capita states as members. China‚Äôs GDP per capita is less than 1/6 that of the US. Even if you use PPP per capita. China‚Äôs level is less than 1/3 of that of the US. Lower incomes means less economic surplus. Saudi Arabia‚Äôs GDP per capita is roughly 2.5 times that of China‚Äôs, so it has the potential to be a powerful addition to BRICS. But if it continues to maintain relations with both the US and what is perceived to be a China-led sphere, as India has said it intends to do, does that limit how much it support BRICS? And let me remind reader, BRICS so far is much less substantive than most readers imagine. It does not even have a budget, unlike the (perceived to be) much less ambitious ASEAN or Shanghai Cooperation Organization. So this is a long-winded way of demonstrating, frustratingly, how effective hype can be. How to counter it well remains an open question. For someone who has such open contempt for the law, Trump is an ardent and abiding follower of Brandolini‚Äôs law. Also known as the bullshit assymetry principle. Re: India v. Pakistan. John Helmer has a different take on events, talking to Ray McGovern with Nima. He said that while we know India lost several aircraft, we don‚Äôt know about Pakistan‚Äôs losses in the air, but we do know about Pakistan‚Äôs losses on the ground ‚Äî loss of command and control (!) ‚Äî which triggered movement of Pakistan‚Äôs nuclear forces, which triggered movement of India‚Äôs nuclear forces. Helmer thinks that is when Pakistan called Washington begging for mediation. https://youtu.be/rY_pZu_anJU?t=4440 https://archive.ph/jiC8h NYT would agree. There was no mediation. Please do not use that word. The US freelancing and calling both sides does not amount to mediation. Seems the lie served a purpose: selling out Trump branded luxury apartments. https://theprint.in/india/trump-residences-in-gurugram-sold-out-days-after-us-president-claimed-he-brokered-ceasefire/2627053/ Thanks for this breakdown! As always, laughing out loud at the sheer mendacity of it all! LOL #TheKicker > The three countries on Trump‚Äôs itinerary ‚Äî Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates ‚Äî are places where the Trump Organization, run by the president‚Äôs two oldest sons, is developing major real estate projects. Bwaaahahahaha! Yes, strike one blow ‚Ä¶ for corruption. Your comment at the end about BRICS/India/Saudi is something I have thought about a bit. I liken it to API Technology ‚Äì you know, when you have two disparate systems ‚Äì like an old mainframe in a datacenter somewhere, and now it has to talk to some dang new-fangled AI thing in ‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù? Well, you‚Äôre not going to move the mainframe, and it may be too critical/complex to replace/modernize, so you write some code elsewhere to serve as an API that permits your ancient IBM cabinet thingy talk out to modern distributed systems. Well, the US/UK/EU is like that mainframe ‚Ä¶ the emerging Global South is the future ‚Ä¶ Countries like Saudi/India/perhaps-even-Turkey are going to be your API-translator layer ‚Ä¶ ferrying all manner of things between two increasingly different and distant worlds. The ‚ÄúAmerica: For Sale‚Äù tour continues. It is very sad that we have to look to Bruce Springsteen to show leadership and call out Orange Julius. https://www.politico.eu/article/corrupt-incompetent-and-treasonous-bruce-springsteen-lashes-donald-trump/ (I give Bruce credit, he‚Äôs 75 and still going. But where is AOC?) Yea, to show leadership and join ‚Äúa long list of American celebrities who voiced support for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris‚Äù. It looks more like a setup for next Wrestlemania. Springsteen vs Trump, only on pay-per-view! If ratings are good enough, then plebs could get Madonna vs Melania extravaganza. If Bruce had supported Jill Stein, would he have had more credibility in your view? I get it that we‚Äôre a peak cynicism. He would have had more credibility in my view if he did what he is paid for, sing instead of talk. Same apply for most celebrites that are more than happy to be cogs in the machine (instead of raging against it). P.S. Now that I think again, those celebrites are probably paid to talk also, though not by the common people but by the machine. ‚ÄúSame apply for most celebrites that are more than happy to be cogs in the machine (instead of raging against it). It‚Äôs kinda funny, that phrase. Because Bruce and Tom Morello are close friends. Morello toured with them for a while.. Ghost of Tom Joad Bruce doesn‚Äôt seem to understand all those Blue collars he wrote about voted FOR Trump. And They‚Äôre not the ones who are paying $2000 per ticket to see him. ‚ÄúBruce?‚Äù Springsteen is just another musician-celebrity fraud. I love the publicity shots of him and his dear friend Obama (or should I refer to him as‚ÄùBarack?‚Äù) leaning against a nice old car, with the shades on. So cool, those two. The fact is, whether it‚Äôs Bono, or Springsteen, of Jimmy Fallon, the two-Party iron rule remains in place. Remember what ‚ÄúBarack‚Äù said: they‚Äôre playing between the 40-yard lines. And it is indeed play. I‚Äôm familiar with the ‚Äúshut up and sing‚Äù argument. It has merit, however, nature abhors a vacuum. Bruce has been political for a long time, I remember him crying about George W. Bush winning in 2004 ‚Ä¶ it could be a release valve that serves the Donkeys by giving them an appearance of caring, i.e Donkey-adjacent celebs give actual politicians cover to do nothing. All publicly quoted figures of this type are kidology to some extent. Any defence package of any size is complex, staged over many years and usually includes both immediate purchases and options on future tranches. So I would not be surprised if this figure included everything from options taken up for new tranches from past contracts, new contracts for delivery over 5-10 years, options on further packages, spares, support and training packages extending over 25 years (standard for this sort of thing) and upgrades and weapon packages. Bear in mind that these days, what‚Äôs sometimes called Total Cost of Ownership or Through-Life Cost can easily be twice the initial procurement cost. The Saudis will not be greatly concerned about equipment performance as such, and anyway their attempts to use sophisticated weapons have been generally unimpressive. This package is designed to tie the US more closely to them, as has been their policy for decades, by making the US their effective defenders. The package will include lots of US personnel in-country to help with everything from training to operational planning, all of whom will be effectively hostages in the event of a crisis with, say, Iran. Think of the US, if you like, as a giant PMC, providing equipment, training, support and mercenaries to the Saudis. For this reason they are not going for Russian equipment. As you say, there would be great difficulties of integration and operation, and even such basic things as language. The Russians would never agree to the kind of massive presence in the country that really serious arms deliveries would entail, nor could they compete, frankly, with several generations of contact at all levels between US and Saudi officers, together with contacts from other western states, which have produced a military that thinks and fights like the West. I‚Äôm sure the Russians would be only too happy to undermine the US position, but this isn‚Äôt the way to do it. More widely, this is certainly a political, if not military, snub for Israel, not least because the Israelis have a history of trying to manipulate US arms sales to Saudi Arabia. I don‚Äôt think it has much to do with BRICS, which remains, as you‚Äôve often pointed out, a vestigial entity, and one where a defence dimension may well never emerge. In the meantime, the Saudis are playing both sides against the middle, as usual. Government contracting (and accounting) is a very complicated milieu of rules/regs (FAR combined with ASBs) hidden in unnecessary complexity behind ‚Äòsecurity clearances‚Äô. During my own career, my ‚Äòrise‚Äô because of the mere questions I asked. The assumption was that I wouldn‚Äôt play ball. As I watch the front line on the various telegram/youtube channels, I am not surprised to see the live demonstrations (marketing value) of the clips. Most that I watch do not contain the bloodshed, so they are sanitized for the audience. As a former ‚Äòcustomer‚Äô (working for the contractor), I was privy to watching the demonstrations of our products in exercises mimicking war games. It was a marketing tool. Watching the next generation products used in real warfare has helped me understand, with great sadness, the smoke and mirrors we in the West project as superior technology. We are completely fake, like Hollywood. The real question for me? How long will the charade continue? Trump was the perfect selection for the neocons (and the tech titans that prepare to tighten the noose) as consummate salesmen. This is my mere opinion and I admit to that. Apologies for typos. So, the US has sold a lot of arms to Saudi Arabia. What, precisely, are the Saudis going to do with those arms? They obviously can‚Äôt attack Israel. By the time they have been trained in using the arms, the Iranians will know all about them and using them on Iran would be suicidal, and using them on Iraq would be the equivalent of using them on Iran, i.e. suicidal. Their use of arms against Yemen was notably unsuccessful. It seems to me that the US might just as well have saved diplomatic trouble by dumping all those arms in the Atlantic, for all the value they add to the US agenda. How dare you suggest that! Are you not forgetting the shareholders of the defense contractors? The CEOs and their pay packages, options and bonuses? The revolving door for the current and former Generals and assorted personnel and their ability to go into consulting work when they retire. The lobbying dollars and campaign contributions that are all piggybacked on defense spending? How selfish. LOL (Though it‚Äôs not really very funny at all) And I do agree with your comment. Saudi Arabia used those weapons in its long intervention against Yemen (from 2015 onwards). The strong involvement of specialists from the USA, the UK, and France highlighted the fact that the Saudis were not very proficient in the usage of their armament. Knew right off the bat that Trump was lying about how much these deals were worth as, like this post mentions, he did the same exact same thing a coupla years ago when he went to Saudi Arabia and announcing it, had a board or two showing images of the weapons systems that he was selling the Saudis. Only it took time to realize that a lot of this money was already backed into the cake and was part of regular deals. That mention of that Dana Stroul cause me to do a double-take. She‚Äôs a real nasty piece of work and Brian Berlectic has mentioned her several times. Here is a video of him showing who she is- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYbGLynvr4A (4:50 mins) In reference to countering bullshit: Eisenhower‚Äôs speech nailed it that, ‚Äú‚Ä¶an alert and knowledgeable citizenry‚Ä¶‚Äù is a prerequisite. Our attention span is conditioned by media to validate Occam‚Äôs Razor. News-as-entertainment replaced journalism; journalists replaced with Communications Degrees in Mastering Being On TV. The underlying Financial Times article, ‚ÄúWhat Has Musk‚Äôs DOGE Actually Accomplished?,‚Äù comes off as the approved analysis of the Uniparty Daily Truth. Much of the color commentary is from rightwingers, who are miffed because DOGE blew their cover. DOGE stepped in it quickly, when they themselves would have been a tad more daintily patient in destroying the social state, or what is left of it , in the U S of A. Quotes from our betters: ‚ÄòCalkins, the government contractor (sheesh): ‚ÄúOf all the things you could do to affect the government, it would have been better to go after regulation. It would have been better to go after entitlements. Just blowing up jobs was a good way to make enemies, a good way to cause more disruption than progress.‚Äù [Translation: Better office politics, please!] ‚Äò‚ÄúI think that some people, particularly on the right, felt that maybe Doge would be just kind of a catch-all solution,‚Äù says Cato‚Äôs Dominik Lett. [Meaning that he wanted DOGE to wreck the agencies so that his peeps won‚Äôt have to lift a finger.] ‚ÄòBut [Lett] adds that ‚Äúif you want to reassure bond markets, if you want to put the budget on a sustainable path, you need to make spending reductions to Medicare, Medicaid and social security. And for the administration, Doge was never really intended to make significant benefit reductions to those programmes.‚Äù‚Äô Then there‚Äôs this mindless drivel from on high: ‚ÄòSafra Catz, the chief executive of software group Oracle ‚Äî whose founder Larry Ellison has been a Trump ally ‚Äî Doge was simply the long overdue introduction of a business mindset to government. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use things from years ago just because you have always been using them,‚Äù she says of the initiative‚Äôs approach.‚Äô Catz undoubtedly isn‚Äôt aware of the old business axiom: If it ain‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it. I guess that she‚Äôs having some problems with her business mindset. Social Security is much on the minds of our betters, as we see, yet Social Security is lean and efficient. The superiors are in a snit because one more manufactured crisis hasn‚Äôt done in Social Security. Meanwhile, I note today‚Äôs posting here at Naked Capitalism about United Health Care. Financial Times starts off with vox pop: People think that the government is wasteful. Ergo, natch, DOGE. Vox populi, vox dei, vox Silicon Valley. Yet: People know that U.S. health-insurance is a scam and a swamp. Do I see squads of unnamed jamokes showing up to diddle the software of health insurers suspected of gaming the system? Heck, I‚Äôm such a na√Øf. And the upright citizens wonder about the emergence of Saint Luigi Mangione. KSA has been a large user of US high tech gear: E-3 AWACS squadron, F-15 several squadrons, An extensive ground to air surveillance sensor network, Bradleys‚Ä¶.. These systems are 40 years old or more. One thing the KSA does not do is logistics support of these systems and in some it needs US techs to operate them‚Ä¶. A lot of so called arms deals include a large part, maybe 70% of the buy price, as logistics support. That said some of the buys systems are not ordered. IIRC the earlier Trump 45 deal included a number of THAAD ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù, that to my knowledge were not ordered, even if the US could open the lines to make more. Likely the Saudis are implying they put the money as a wedge in a 10 year plan, starting sometime soon. ‚ÄúJohn Helmer has said that the Russians have realized they are negotiating with a cult of personality and have been proceeding accordingly.‚Äù They remember another cult of personality, namely Stalin. And one wonders if his purges are inspired by Stalin. Someone said that wIth Stalin there was a cult of personality, and also a personality behind it. Don‚Äôt forget Jared who also has a company trying to make deals with Arab nations and who apparently seeded the Riviera idea in Trump‚Äôs noggin. Meanwhile the Adelson payoff in favor of Israel is fading since Trump can‚Äôt run again however much bs he spouts on that topic. Perhaps we‚Äôll have world peace if every country has a Trump resort complex. The Man Who Would Be King needs robes and a camel. He has appetittes and visions of sugarplums and sweetmeats, but‚Ä¶.Correct me if I am wrong; 1) isn‚Äôt the US on somewhat short supply of military equipment that actually works ( refer to war in Ukraine), 2) Doesn‚Äôt all that military equipment require refined rare earth minerals which may be hard to obtain from the Chinese peasants; 3) Mastery of aviation products doesn‚Äôt seem to be a DOD forte: three carrier planes lost to the Houthis, a F-35 almost downed, a dozen drones -by-bye the acquisition of a jumbo jet without a plan or budget to retrofit ( and has Boeing changed their management team?) , and now Trump has an aeronautical engineering degree to design combat aircraft. I am soooo..tired of all this winning. I wonder about the claims of such a major group of arms sales. Knowing its hard to ever see if it happens there is one way to watch over time. All major arms sales both Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) have to be notified to congress under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations 22 CFR Part 120-130. The notifications do eventually appear in a couple of places. The Federal Register being the major source, but DDTC publishes DCS sales in News and Events here: https://www.pmddtc.state.gov/ddtc_public/ddtc_public?id=ddtc_public_portal_news_and_events&cat=Report Foreign Military Sales are available here, it is not a goverment website but has some interesting information. https://www.forumarmstrade.org/major-arms-sales-notifications-tracker.html One thing to think about is year over year sales of weapon systems, I usually do a rough percentage of the export of ‚Äúweapons‚Äù from the U.S. including both FMS and DCS sales and generally it is only about 3% of all exports. The Military Industrial Complex hits way above its weight, and arms sales garner a lot of attention but are really not big drivers of export volume. There are big sales from time to time but not every year. e.g. JSF. The kinds of weapon sales it takes to get to the $ 142 B level is years countries don‚Äôt buy major weapon systems on impulse and they normally take many years to deliver.

Dubbed the Trillion Dollar Security Initiative, the foundation hopes to make Ethereum robust enough that billions of people could confidently hold over $1,000 onchain. It's also eyeing participation from companies, institutions, or governments who could be "comfortable storing more than 1 trillion dollars of value inside a single contract or application." The initiative will unfold in three phases, starting with a comprehensive assessment of Ethereum‚Äôs security across areas such as wallet UX, smart contract tooling, and consensus protocol. The next phase will focus on implementing key improvements, followed by efforts to better communicate Ethereum‚Äôs security standards. The Foundation is also soliciting input from users, developers, and institutions to help shape the roadmap. Security luminaries, including research-driven crypto investment firm Paradigm's Samczsun, blockchain security and research firm Sigma Prime co-founder Mehdi Zerouali, and Etherealize co-founder Zach Obront, are set to lead efforts for the new initiative. The Ethereum Foundation said it welcomes community input to ensure diverse views shape its infrastructure development. Ethereum Foundation's protocol security lead, Fredrik Svantes, and Josh Stark from its management team will oversee and co-chair the project. The announcement of the three-phase program comes a week after the rollout of Pectra, sending Ethereum to double-digit highs and sparking renewed interest. Following the upgrade, it became "hard to justify ETH as a relative underperformer," analysts from investment firm Bernstein said last week. But despite the network's latest achievements, Ethereum needs to "keep up with Layer 2 growth," Ulyana Skladchikova, head of product at open-source explorer Blockscout, told Decrypt last week. Layer 2 networks are separate blockchains built on top of Ethereum, which can keep up by upgrading how they handle transactions using the former, making it cheaper and faster by using "blobs" that enhance how data is stored and processed. At the user experience level, Ethereum also needs to enhance "granular control" of its security. "By reducing the need to set up, interact with, and move assets to a smart contract wallet," other use cases could become more viable with Pectra and provide "additional security and flexibility," Skladchikova explained. On the institutional side, Ethereum has also been feeling the pinch among investors, data from CoinGlass shows. Ethereum ETFs have witnessed just three days of positive net inflows in the week since Pectra, driven primarily by BlackRock and Grayscale. Decrypt reached out to the Ethereum Foundation for comment.

Title: Bitwise CIO expects surge in crypto ETP allocations by year-end, foresees 5% portfolio norm

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan foresees a trillion-dollar future for crypto ETPs as institutional interest rises and allocations climb. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan said on May 14 that a ‚Äúbig unlock‚Äù is occurring across the financial advisory space regarding crypto investments. After attending a major advisory firm‚Äôs conference, Hougan shared his expectations that most major firms will enable crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) access by the end of 2025. He added that interest in crypto exposure is intensifying and predicted that the new measure for inflows into crypto ETPs will be ‚Äúmany billions.‚Äù After over one year since their launch, collective daily inflows for US-traded crypto ETPs have surpassed $1 billion in five instances so far, according to Farside Investors data. Hougan also said that portfolio allocation norms for crypto are shifting and ‚Äú5% is the new 1%.‚Äù He further explained that institutions are becoming more comfortable with higher crypto weightings in traditional portfolios. Asset managers have historically advocated modest crypto allocations, citing volatility and risk concentration. In December, BlackRock‚Äôs Investment Institute defined a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation as a ‚Äúreasonable range‚Äù for multi-asset portfolios. That recommendation has since translated into practice. BlackRock incorporated Bitcoin (BTC) into its $150 billion model portfolio offerings via the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), assigning a 1% to 2% weight in target allocations. The launch of US spot Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) ETPs in 2024 provided regulatory-compliant exposure mechanisms at scale for institutional clients, prompting many advisors to reevaluate their crypto positioning. Hougan also reported increased advisor inquiries about Ethereum, stating he fielded more questions on the asset ‚Äúin the past few days than the past six months.‚Äù While Bitcoin remains the dominant product by scale, Ethereum has emerged as a key area of curiosity for professionals, according to Hougan. Bitwise shared in April that US spot Bitcoin ETPs held $93.2 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of December 2024, contrasting with spot Ethereum ETPs that totaled $6.3 billion in AUM. Despite the disparity, ownership of both products is dispersed across key institutional categories. In Bitcoin ETPs, hedge funds (36.97%) and investment advisors (33.11%) account for most institutional ownership. On the other hand, Ethereum ETPs show more balanced exposure between investment advisors (29.79%), brokerages (25.25%), and hedge funds (24.74%), while family offices show a stronger preference for Ethereum. Investment advisors and hedge funds allocated 5.8% and 4.5% of their total crypto allocation to Ethereum, while family offices had 25% of their nearly $173 million crypto allocation targeted to Ethereum. Hougan‚Äôs remarks reinforce industry expectations that professional investment access to crypto is entering a new maturity phase. As product availability widens and allocation norms shift upward, crypto may play a more regularized role in portfolio construction.

Title: Banks Exploring Stablecoin Amid Fears of Losing Market Share, BitGo Executive Says

As the stablecoin competition is heating up with looming regulation in the U.S., traditional finance institutions are taking notice‚Äîlargely out of fear of losing out to digital dollars, said Ben Reynolds, BitGo's managing director of stablecoins, at Consensus 2025 in Toronto. Speaking at a panel discussion, he said that BitGo's recently launched stablecoin-as-a-service has seen ‚Äúincredible inbound‚Äù interest from U.S. and foreign banks wanting to tokenize deposits or issue stablecoins. "A lot of banks are just being defensive‚Äîthey‚Äôre afraid they‚Äôre going to lose their deposits,‚Äù Reynolds said. "They look at stablecoins and say: How do we not get left behind?" Yield-bearing versions of stablecoins and tokenized money market funds have seen rapid growth recently, but still make up only a fraction of the $230 billion stablecoin market. A16z‚Äôs Sam Broner said that while yield-bearing stablecoins are a promising market segment, their primary use case is for payments and transactions where users don't really care about yields. Still, a near-term killer use case could be ‚Äúcollateral mobility‚Äù‚Äîthe ability to instantly move money to meet obligations across different platforms. "You can‚Äôt do a lot of things with a share of a money market fund," Broner said. "You‚Äôve got lock-up periods, business-hour settlement, and contracts that have to be manually reviewed. Crypto gives you programmatic, permissionless flexibility." Yield-bearing stablecoins could also be attractive for institutions, said Matt Kunke, crypto product strategist at BlackRock. "If you're a DAO, protocol, or market maker, moving between crypto holdings on an exchange and your brokerage account is slow and full of friction," he said. "Stablecoins that carry yield just reduce that drag.‚Äù However, regulatory distinctions will shape the market. ‚ÄúA tokenized Treasury fund is a security, and an actual stablecoin is not,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúThey deserve fundamentally different markets." Joseph Saldana, chief financial officer of the Wyoming Stable Token Commission, pointed out that yield‚Äìgenerating tokens have the power to broaden investors' access compared to mutual funds that often have minimum limits of investment that "lock out a lot of people." "We want to service the underbanked and give broader access to instruments the rest of us enjoy every day," Saldana said.

In an interview with Decrypt, the famed computer scientist and Blocksteam CEO said that given all the institutional money flowing into the space, the price of the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency should be higher. Bitcoin was recently trading for $103,300 per coin‚Äîunmoved in the past day but up more than 7% over the past week, according to crypto markets data provider CoinGecko. It is off just 5% from its all-time high near $109,000, despite a late winter, early spring swoon. Back, who holds a computer science doctorate in distributed systems from Exeter University and has long been involved in cryptography, told Decrypt: "I'm thinking this cycle could get quite high, but the cycle stretches out a few years, right? So I was thinking $500,000 to $1 million, because there's a lot going on." He added: "There doesn't seem to be a clear logical reason to me for why we are only at $100,000. That's not very high given all of the things that are different compared to a couple years ago." Back noted the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which have generated more than $41 billion in net inflows, and the crypto-friendly policies of U.S. President Trump. Wall Street's top regulator, the SEC, last year approved Bitcoin ETFs‚Äîfunds managed by the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity‚Äîwhich give investors easy access to BTC with shares that can be bought via brokerage accounts. The approval of the funds has led to a flow of new money into the space from investors previously locked out of the crypto investing sphere. Bitcoin's latest record‚Äîhit in January‚Äîisn't that high compared to previous cycles when looking at the coin's movement following its historical halving events. BTC tends to move in four-year cycles. But Back said that he thought brokers and individual investors tend to buy things that have already risen, so more money will flow into the space as Bitcoin climbs, creating price momentum. "I think if you get a new all-time high, it could quickly become a lot higher," he said. Back is the co-founder and CEO of Blocksteam, a company building Bitcoin infrastructure, like crypto wallets. Back had an email exchange with Bitcoin's mysterious creator‚Äîor creators‚ÄîSatoshi Nakamoto in 2008, the year that the original paper outlining the blockchain network was published. Bitcoin's mining process is derived from Hashcash, a proof-of-work system that Back invented.

Title: Trump gets a jet. But it‚Äôs what he‚Äôs giving in return that should have Americans worried.

Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows By Chris Hayes This is an adapted excerpt from the May 13 episode of ‚ÄúAll In with Chris Hayes.‚Äù For decades, going back to Ronald Reagan, when an American president makes their first visit to a foreign nation, they almost always go to Canada. It makes sense: They‚Äôre our top trading partner; we share a language and a very long border. But in 2017, Donald Trump did not do that. Instead, Trump went to the oil-rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia, where he joined in laying hands on a glowing orb. During that trip, he also forged a close friendship with the nation‚Äôs crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who would later invest $2 billion in a business owned by Trump‚Äôs son-in-law, against the advice of his own economic experts. It‚Äôs worth noting that before that announcement, Syria‚Äôs leader offered to build a Trump Tower in Damascus. Eight years later, Trump is president again. This time around, Trump, once again, decided he wasn‚Äôt going to Canada, the country he openly wants to annex. Instead, the president went back to the Middle East, landing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, with plans to visit Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next. The Saudis, the Qataris and the Emiratis all clearly understood the assignment. Take the crown prince: He greeted Trump on the tarmac and rolled out the royal purple carpet. Not only did the Saudis welcome Trump with open arms, but they also welcomed his co-president, Elon Musk. However, Musk wasn‚Äôt the only billionaire on the trip. Trump and the crown prince joined forces to open a U.S.-Saudi investment forum for big-money players from the two nations, with speakers from U.S. firms like Citigroup, BlackRock and Palantir. The White House claims Trump ‚Äúsecured $600 billion in deals with the Saudi government and firms.‚Äù But, according to The New York Times, ‚Äúthe details the White House provided were vague and totaled less than half that number. And a closer look at the projects the administration provided shows several were already in the works before Mr. Trump took office.‚Äù But Trump claimed a big win, and so the president responsible for the ‚ÄúMuslim ban‚Äù posed onstage in front of a massive Saudi flag and was applauded. Trump had some other big gifts ready, too. The president announced a $142 billion arms agreement to provide the Saudis with U.S. weapons and defense contractors to maintain them. He also announced that he plans to lift sanctions on Syria, which Trump said was at the behest of the Saudis. ‚ÄúOh, what I do for the crown prince,‚Äù he said from the stage. While that announcement was a good one and those sanctions on Syria should be dropped, we should not drop them as a favor to the Saudi crown prince who threw $2 billion at your son-in-law. It‚Äôs also worth noting that before that announcement, Syria‚Äôs leader offered to build a Trump Tower in Damascus and said he would give the U.S. mineral rights contracts in his country, according to several sources familiar with the efforts who spoke with Reuters. Mideast diplomacy is one of the most complicated, fraught areas of American foreign policy, and out of the gate, Trump is basically just going down a list of policies that the Saudis and their allies wanted. Policywise, some of those concessions are better than others; corrupt processes can sometimes accidentally create a decent policy here and there. But they‚Äôre not policies so much as presents for his overseas buddies, and, in return, those buddies are giving him what he wants. Which brings us, of course, to the Qatari jumbo jet. A special Boeing 747 that has been called a ‚Äúpalace of the sky‚Äù and a ‚Äúflying mansion.‚Äù A luxury item worth $400 million and gifted to Trump by the Qatari royal family over the weekend. It is full of leather, gold and burl wood accents. It sports at least three lounges, two bedrooms, nine bathrooms, five galleys and a private office. Trump is palpably stoked out of his shoes about this thing, like a very rich kid on Christmas morning getting the world‚Äôs most expensive toy. Accepting this jet would be the most shockingly corrupt act by a president in the history of the presidency. It violates not only the spirit of the Constitution, but literally the text. However, according to Trump, not taking it would be ‚Äústupid.‚Äù It seems the only thing that unites the policies Trump has announced on his Middle East tour so far is that they are exactly what the Gulf states wanted. The Gulf states don‚Äôt have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. It makes sense, this is the place Trump feels most at home because these countries get Trump in a way they never got any other American president. That‚Äôs because this American president openly admires despots and envies what they have. The Gulf states that are hosting Trump understand that. They recognize he is not there for 330 million Americans. He is there for himself, and they are there to indulge him. It‚Äôs not because Trump is a unique force of nature. He is not special; he is just easy. He‚Äôs not even the first foreign leader to be gifted a 747 by the Qataris. Turkey‚Äôs Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan got a half-billion-dollar jumbo jet back in 2018. But this is the thing: The Gulf states have been doing this forever. They don‚Äôt have huge armies, but they have a lot of oil and a lot of money, and they use it to extend their geopolitical dominance. That only goes so far with a traditional, law-abiding American administration. However, with Trump, a man not just willing but thirsty to trade on the trappings of the office that American voters bestowed on him, the sky is the limit.

Title: Quantum Threat? BlackRock Flags Future Risk In Bitcoin ETF Filing
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/quantum-threat-blackrock-flags-future-risk-in-bitcoin-etf-filing/
Time Published: 2025-05-14T15:00:28Z

BlackRock has added a warning about quantum computing to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing. Based on reports, the asset manager sees a future risk that ultra-powerful machines might crack the math securing Bitcoin. This is the first time BlackRock has flagged this concern in its spot Bitcoin ETF paperwork. According to the updated regulatory filing on May 9, BlackRock now lists ‚Äúquantum computing‚Äù among possible threats to its Bitcoin ETF. The trust holds about $64 billion in net assets, making it the largest spot Bitcoin fund on record. Company lawyers say that if quantum processors become strong enough, they could decrypt private keys and put wallet security in jeopardy. It‚Äôs a standard move in ETF filings to note every conceivable risk, even if it feels far-off. Based on reports, worries kicked up last December when Google unveiled Willow, a chip claimed to solve certain tasks in minutes that would take today‚Äôs supercomputers 10 septillion years. A few months later, Microsoft introduced Majorana 1 to tackle long-standing scaling hurdles. Those announcements set off alarm bells in the crypto world. In theory, a quantum device running Shor‚Äôs algorithm could factor the large numbers behind Bitcoin‚Äôs elliptic-curve signatures. In practice, we‚Äôre still in the early, error-prone ‚ÄúNISQ‚Äù era, so real attacks remain at least years away. Tether‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, surfaced another angle in February. He suggested that once quantum hackers can break old private keys, they might recover Bitcoin from the roughly 3.7 million coins considered lost forever. Ardoino stressed that quantum machines are still distant from cracking 256-bit security, so no coins will reappear anytime soon. Crypto analyst Willy Woo jumped in, asking whether Google, a government agency, or a new startup would be first to seize those dormant assets. He figures the $350 billion in lost coins could spur fresh quantum investment if those keys ever become vulnerable. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in more cash than ever. Data from Farside Investors shows over $41 billion in net inflows since these funds launched in January. On May 8, weekly ETF inflows topped the previous all-time high of $40 billion. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas called lifetime net flows ‚Äúthe hardest metric to grow,‚Äù yet ETFs raced to new highs despite recent market jitters. Investors appear focused on price moves today, not on the quantum questions of tomorrow. In the months ahead, crypto developers and standards groups will work on ‚Äúpost-quantum‚Äù signature schemes. If they stay on schedule, Bitcoin networks could adopt new, quantum-resistant algorithms long before any real threat appears. For now, the market‚Äôs heavy inflows suggest that mainstream buyers aren‚Äôt yet spooked by next-generation computing power.

Title: Next Crypto to Explode as VanEck Launches US Treasury Fund Tokens on Ethereum and Solana

Proving there‚Äôs never a dull moment in the crypto market, yet another US asset manager ‚Äì VanEck ‚Äì is embracing the digital-assets era by launching a tokenized US Treasury fund. That‚Äôs good news for the traditional and crypto finance worlds, as well as the next crypto to explode. The VanEck Treasury Fund (VBILL) is a blockchain-based investment vehicle that provides digital access to short-term US government bonds. So whereas those bonds were traditionally accessed through banks and brokers, qualified investors can now access them with stablecoins, like $USDC. By the way, by ‚Äòqualified,‚Äô we mean large. VBILL requires a minimum investment of $1M on Ethereum, and $100K on the other blockchains it‚Äôs available on. Those include Solana, BNB Chain, and Avalanche networks. VanEck is no newcomer to the crypto scene ‚Äì it already issues spot $BTC and $ETH ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and ETNs (exchange-traded notes). And now it‚Äôs following the lead of BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and other firms by tokenizing traditional assets. In another positive move for crypto, cross-border banking giant Standard Charter is also increasing its crypto activity. Standard Charter is now collaborating with digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX, which will integrate the bank‚Äôs forex services and infrastructure to provide its institutional clients with a broader range of offerings. This comes after the recent announcement of a partnership with OKX that enables institutional clients to use crypto as collateral. According to a Standard Global press release, the collaboration ‚Äòcontinues FalconX‚Äôs efforts to bridge the gap between traditional finance and digital assets with enterprise-grade infrastructure‚Äô. As digital assets are increasingly embraced by the traditional finance sector worldwide, it‚Äôs great news for the crypto market ‚Äì and investors. With the Bitcoin price back up above the $100K mark, the market is looking bullish. And what‚Äôs good for the $BTC is generally good for other tokens. If you‚Äôre looking to invest in what could be the next crypto to explode, here are options well worth considering ‚Äì including the best presale tokens of the year. The Solana blockchain is second only to Ethereum in terms of market dominance and the number of tokens. It‚Äôs fast and has relatively low transaction costs. But Solana is also plagued by network congestion and failed transactions. That‚Äôs where Solaxy ($SOLX) steps up to the plate. This meme coin is introducing the first-ever Layer-2 Solana platform ‚Äì and that‚Äôs a big deal in the crypto world. Solaxy is building on Solana‚Äôs strong points (speed, low costs) and adding to it. The $SOLX project has solid tokenomics, with 30% allocated to development. That will be an important aspect of its long-term success. It‚Äôs also why $SOLX could be the next crypto to explode. Investor interest has so far been impressive. This is one of the best meme coins on presale ‚Äì it has already raised $35.5M in funding. We expect big things to come from Solaxy after the presale ends and it lists on DEXs and CEXs. And that means there‚Äôs no better time to invest in $SOLX, with its current presale price of $0.001724 and 113% staking rewards. Take a look at our complete guide to buying in Solaxy ‚Äì as well as our $SOLX price prediction ‚Äì to find out how to make the most of what has the potential to be the next crypto to explode. In another crypto first, enter BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì the one and only meme coin that tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs price. And when that price reaches a milestone, $BTCBULL holders will be airdropped $BTC as a reward. Considering $BTC‚Äôs recent bull run, there‚Äôs little reason not to expect its price to hit the $150K, $200K, and onwards to $1M in the not-too-distant future. It‚Äôs exactly at those milestones that holders of $BTCBULL will receive their own $BTC in the Best Wallet app. The $BTC rewards will be airdropped each time the price grows by $50K. And in-between ‚Äì at $125K, $175K, and $225K thresholds ‚Äì $BTCBULL tokens will be burned, adding to the scarcity (and potentially the value) of the token. If you‚Äôre keen to ride the $BTC bull run, you may find our full guide to buying the Bitcoin Bull Token helpful. It explains how to buy this top new crypto token ‚Äì $BTCBULL ‚Äì at its current price of $0.00251, with 72% APY staking. ChainGPT ($CGPT) is the native token of the ChainGPT ecosystem. This Web3 platform combines artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to provide AI-powered tools that pretty much anyone can use ‚Äì individuals or businesses ‚Äì without having advanced technical knowledge. Among the ChainGPT AI offerings are a smart contract generator and auditor; NFT generator; trading assistant; Web3 chatbot; and a tool that enables you to build an AI agent (like MIND of Pepe, for instance) without coding. All those features are powered by $CGPT token. $CGPT holders also have voting rights in decision-making. And with growing adoption of crypto as a legitimate asset, this may well mean the $CGPT is among the best altcoins ‚Äì and the next crypto to explode. Unlike $SOLX and $BTCBULL, $CGPT is not on presale. It is currently listed on both CEXs (including Binance, ByBit, MEXC, and KuCoin) and DEXs ‚Äì PancakeSwap and Uniswap. One $CGPT currently costs $0.141, making it an affordable investment with potentially explosive gains. Touch wood, but things appear to be looking up for the crypto market. That sentiment is clear with the likes of the VanEck Treasury Fund being launched, and Standard Global partnering with FalconX. A recovery in the Bitcoin price also signals light on the horizon. And with that, the next crypto with the potential to explode ‚Äì Solaxy, BTC Bull Token, and ChainGPT among them ‚Äì may mean highly impressive gains. As always, though, be sure to DYOR before making any investment. We‚Äôre in the business of crypto news ‚Äì not financial advice. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: Why Catalytic Capital Needs a Better Definition (Blog)

The decline and fall of ESG offers a cautionary tale for social impact financing and highlights the need for the sector to sharpen its understanding of catalytic capital. We propose a potential definitional framework for catalytic capital to drive clarity, measurement, and greater market participation. The decline and fall of ESG offers a cautionary tale for social impact financing and highlights the need for the sector to sharpen its understanding of catalytic capital. We propose a potential definitional framework for catalytic capital to drive clarity, measurement, and greater market participation. By Savannah Baum, Olivia Rosen, Sean Sellers & Billy Silk May 14, 2025 On the heels of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards exploded onto the scene as a way for companies to focus on sustainability in business decisions and for investors to prioritize socially responsible companies. In the years that followed, trillions of dollars poured into ESG funds. But cracks started to emerge. As journalists looked under the hood of ESG funds, they found investments in oil and gas majors. In 2021, Tariq Fancy, former chief investment officer for sustainable investing at Blackrock, the world‚Äôs largest asset manager, penned a scathing essay that the ESG label was being used to dupe the American public with greenwashing. Backlash against the consideration of social factors in investments also began to grow; in recent years, 19 US states have passed 42 anti-ESG laws preventing public fund managers from taking social considerations into account. At its core, ESG‚Äôs problem stems from a lack of clarity. There are, of course, innumerable instances of ESG-focused funds leading important change globally. Many have helped reform operational and governance standards within corporations, and forced internal dialogue and measurement efforts to gauge social progress. But in the absence of clear, value-based standards, it‚Äôs often just a buzzword. Its loosely defined, ‚Äúyes and‚Äù posture allows companies and investors to toss it around to validate their commitment to social good without having to meet specific requirements. Companies‚Äô loquacious race to classify themselves as ‚ÄúESG-approved‚Äù has led to justified attack, with shareholder support for ESG declining and institutional investors citing ESG fatigue. The ESG movement may be too far gone to revive. But its fate can help shape the development of another type of impact financing: catalytic capital. A sharper, shared understanding of this form of risk-tolerant investment, which takes on risk to validate a new business model or market with the aim of ultimately drawing in more capital, can dramatically increase the volume and scope of funding for social impact. Are you enjoying this article? Read more like this, plus SSIR's full archive of content, when you subscribe. To scale promising social enterprises, leaders of social change need access to context-appropriate capital‚Äîfunding that considers and addresses the unique risks and needs (such as limited liquidity and longer timelines) that ventures in challenging markets face. This type of investment is widely known as catalytic capital and is remarkably good at market building. According to Convergence, every $1 of catalytic capital mobilizes $4 of downstream traditional investment for social impact efforts. A compelling example is FarmWorks, a social enterprise that provides farming inputs, finance, training, and market access to smallholder farmers in Kenya. In 2020, the company‚Äôs co-founders Yi Li and Peter Muthee began looking for investors who understood the unique needs of building an agricultural business in the region. FarmWorks‚Äô business model was fundamentally different than the high-margin software businesses typically favored by venture capital. As Li explains, "To sell a kilo of tomatoes, you're growing another kilo of tomatoes," underscoring the methodical nature of agricultural scaling compared to typical venture-backed businesses. Building FarmWorks also meant developing extensive logistics networks, managing relationships with thousands of farmers, and operating warehouses across the region. Like many social ventures in emerging economies, the company also faced limited supply and payment infrastructure, complex distribution channels, and customers with constrained purchasing power. Its path to profitability would be longer, and its exit strategy less defined than what traditional investors typically sought. As Li told us, "For businesses like FarmWorks that are not disrupting a model but are significantly improving the efficiency and scale of possibility [in] a traditional sector, patience is required.‚Äù In 2021, Acumen‚Äôs Resilient Agriculture Fund stepped in to provide pre-seed, patient capital, a form of catalytic capital geared toward longer horizons. This allowed the team to honor their ambitious mission sustainably without short-sighted pressures of quick exits and high returns. The company used initial funding to grow its services into an integrated suite of end-to-end support, including financing for low-cost machinery and reliable access to markets, and became the largest domestic distributor of fresh vegetables in Kenya within four years. Today, it works with 3,000 farmers to bring produce to market, and sells more than 1,000 tons of local staples and high-value crops monthly. A recent $4.1 million, pre-series A funding round‚Äîled by Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund and supported by Livelihood Impact Fund, Vested World, family offices, and angel investors‚Äîsignaled confidence in both the company‚Äôs market opportunity and ability to scale systems-level impact. Estimates vary, but proxies suggest that catalytic capital constitutes less than 0.01 percent of global investment capital. And while the impact investing market has grown to approximately $1.1 trillion, only a fraction of this sum can be considered catalytic capital. This scarcity of flexible funding for early-stage social ventures that are working in challenging but promising markets isn't just about numbers; it represents a tremendous amount of transformative impact left unrealized. On the surface, the definition of catalytic capital may seem clear: flexible financing for impact ventures that investors can tailor to take on unique risks. But go a level deeper, and questions proliferate. What kinds of risk? What kinds of financing? Different organizations perceive catalytic capital differently. For example, some emphasize concessionary returns that trade lower financial gains for social impact, some focus on taking on greater market risk, and some aim to benefit specific groups of people. Some argue that any concessionary instrument (including a loan or a grant) qualifies, while others insist that the investment must pull more traditional financiers into these markets via blended transactions or follow-on investments. During our time as MBA candidates pursuing social impact research, we‚Äôve spoken with many investors and professors experienced with catalytic capital who believe some definitional flexibility is good. Rather than gatekeeping on semantics, they believe maintaining some openness to different forms of catalytic capital helps bring more investors into the market. We don‚Äôt necessarily disagree. But they also recognize the downsides of ambiguity. Inconsistent definitions present a number of problems. For example, it‚Äôs time-consuming and challenging for social entrepreneurs to look across the wide range of impact capital providers to identify who might be the right investor for their unique needs. Catalytic investors meanwhile struggle to collaborate on deal flow to solve market gaps, and follow-on or commercial co-investors struggle to compare deals side-by-side. The result is an inefficient catalytic capital market with limited impact. Delineating catalytic capital by the mechanisms through which it operates, however, can improve everyone‚Äôs understanding, more efficiently match market needs with particular investor flexibilities, and ultimately scale more impact through greater capital flows. For example, a biotech startup developing a maternal health diagnostic may need highly flexible, long-term capital due to high R&D costs, regulatory hurdles, and a delayed path to revenue. This would make it better suited to non-concessionary patient capital. In contrast, a community-owned broadband provider serving rural areas might achieve steady revenue relatively quickly through subscriber fees but operate with intentionally limited margins to keep services affordable. While it can generate cash flow, its social mission caps its returns. This makes it a better fit for concessionary capital that prioritizes impact over market-rate returns. Both models create meaningful impact but require different capital structures to thrive. Catalytic capital is intended to ‚Äúgo first‚Äù‚Äîderisking an asset or market with the goal of attracting additional investments, often from conventional investors who wouldn‚Äôt otherwise participate. It‚Äôs thus important to ensure that conventional investors can compare deals apples-to-apples‚Äîincluding elements like impact metrics, mobilization goals, or market forecasts‚Äîso that they don‚Äôt walk away from the market altogether. As noted earlier, investors aren‚Äôt monolithic. Catalytic and commercial investors have unique preferences; their motivations, risk appetites, and returns expectations differ. One catalytic investor may be willing to seek concessionary returns on loans, while another might sacrifice on return horizons. Co-investors are similarly diverse; what makes an investment too risky for one commercial lender will differ from another. And certainly, investee needs vary widely. In addition, while many impact investors do great work determining the needs of specific markets to close financing gaps, they often do so in silos. No coordinating body actively tracks and shares financing gaps across markets or maps where specific investors are most willing to take on specific risks. Given this, a lot of great deals that aren‚Äôt a fit for one investor likely die when a better-suited capital provider might have carried them forward. Clearer definitions can address these market failures in several ways. For one, they reduce transaction friction for entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are too often left in the dark, unable to determine which capital stacks and investors best match their business needs. Better definitions for the type of risks individual catalytic investors are willing to take on equips entrepreneurs with the knowledge they need to find the right investors. In addition, they improve market efficiency by better matching capital to opportunity. Although the motivations and capabilities of catalytic investors vary widely, they often cluster around similar opportunities while leaving other needs unmet. More clearly distinguishing the different dimensions of catalytic capital can help them identify the right fit. Clearer definitions also enable better investor coordination. When investors can clearly articulate their risk appetites and preferred impact dimensions, they can more effectively combine forces. They help align traditional investors with relevant catalytic investors who have the right tools to sufficiently de-risk specific areas of concern. Given this opportunity to create a more robust and responsive impact capital market, we propose a new framework for defining catalytic capital that has two parts: requisite properties and dynamic attributes. We do not propose this framework with the expectation that it answers every ambiguous question around catalytic capital, or even that this is the ‚Äúright‚Äù set of guardrails for all catalytic market participants. We hope this framework can serve as a starting point for discussion on the anatomy and gradient of catalytic investments, with both traditional and non-traditional dimensions. It also aims to strike a balance between rigor, clarity, and flexibility. The first part, requisite properties, offers a baseline understanding of what catalytic capital ‚Äúmust be and do,‚Äù and includes three criteria: The second part of the framework then proposes that catalytic capital must be dynamic in at least one of five (but usually more) specific attributes: An investment does not need to fall in the leftmost box of every dimension in the chart to be catalytic. Indeed, many catalytic investments incorporate more traditional features across several dimensions. For example, investors might consider an investment that deviates meaningfully from at least one standard commercial norm (the chart‚Äôs rightmost boxes) somewhat catalytic. A debt instrument with conventional liquidity and a standard return timeline might offer concessionary returns and take a first-loss position in the capital stack (the order in which investors are repaid if the company defaults) if the investee defaults. Investors might also consider an investment that is non-concessionary but allows abnormally long timelines for return catalytic. For example, an investor in carbon projects might demand strong returns (say, a 15 percent internal rate of return) but allow investees to repay them over 15-20 years instead of the more traditional 8-10 years. Understanding where an investment falls within this taxonomy enables more effective market engagement, offering a shared language and clearer perspective on what type of catalytic capital is and is not being deployed. In the absence of widely adopted, data-driven approaches or logic-tested theories of change, investor commitment to ESG has proven fleeting. Better definitions and specific language can help catalytic capital avoid the same fate, and provide a more reasoned commitment to market development and systemic change. The framework presented here is not an exercise in dogmatism, attempting to set forth rigid definitions that limit participation. It is an attempt to support the discipline and rigor of like-minded entrepreneurs and investors in pursuit of more effective collaboration. Incremental changes, driven by clearer frameworks and objective standards, will ultimately lead to much greater impact than chasing buzzwords or hype. More stories like that of FarmWorks are waiting to be written, and their chapters can unfold when visionary entrepreneurs align with the right investors and timing. Some may want ambiguity to persist in the name of inclusion, but allowing anyone to call their capital catalytic risks a more troubling exclusion: holding communities back from building and sharing a more prosperous future. Developing a shared understanding in service of better coordination is an important next step in the field‚Äôs evolution. Support SSIR‚Äôs coverage of cross-sector solutions to global challenges.
