We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best widow and orphan stocks to invest in. Investing in the stock market can be a prudent strategy for widows and orphans seeking financial stability and growth. Widow-and-orphan stocks are typically associated with established companies in sectors like utilities and consumer staples. These companies often provide consistent dividend payments, offering a reliable income stream. This stability is particularly valuable during economic downturns, as these stocks tend to exhibit lower volatility compared to high-growth equities. Investing in stable, dividend-paying stocks can aid in preserving and growing wealth over time. The combination of regular dividend income and potential capital appreciation makes these stocks suitable for individuals aiming for sustainable financial growth without excessive risk exposure. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. A study published in July 2024 highlights the critical role of financial literacy in investment decisions and stock market participation. The research indicates that increased financial knowledge enhances investment confidence and decision-making, underscoring the importance of targeted financial education programs to empower individuals to participate effectively in the stock market. Recent trends show that women, particularly baby boomers, are increasingly controlling significant amounts of wealth. As of January 2025, women over 60 control $8 trillion of liquid wealth assets. This shift underscores the importance of financial literacy and proactive investment strategies among women to ensure long-term financial security.

(ABC Kimberley: Mya Kordic) Residents in Western Australia's north are "battening down the hatches" amid the risk of a cyclone forming in the next two days. Emergency services are conducting flood modelling and some residents and businesses are gearing up to evacuate properties if required. The Bureau of Meteorology says there is a high chance of tropical low 18U intensifying and that it could cross the Pilbara coast later this week. Residents, authorities and pastoralists in Western Australia's north are preparing for a potential cyclone to form in the next two days as a tropical low heads towards "cyclone alley". As of 9am on Monday, tropical low U18 is 320 kilometres north of Broome and travelling south-west off the Kimberley coast. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said there was a high chance of it forming into a cyclone by Tuesday night and emergency services warned the community to prepare. The bureau's tracking maps indicate that the system could intensify into at least a category two cyclone and cross the Pilbara coast later in the week. A BOM map of the potential cyclone's projected path released on Monday afternoon. (Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology) Pastoralist David Stoate said preparations were underway at Anna Plains Station 250 kilometres south of Broome in "cyclone alley". "We're just battening down the hatches, tying down the buildings and making sure there's no debris or anything that can blow around the homestead," he said. "It's certainly a feature of living in this part of the world. "We do get cyclones at this time of the year … we know the drills, so we'll hopefully follow that." David Stoate is the owner of Anna Plains Station and said preparations were well underway in "cyclone alley". (ABC Kimberley: Alys Marshall) Mr Stoate said everyone in the region would be preparing in a similar fashion. "You get a little bit nervous — I mean, they can be very destructive as as we know," he said. "But the flip side is we could do with a bit of rain here. "So they do have an upside as well, but yeah, at times like this you're sweating on the updates from [the] bureau." The weather system is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Broome. (ABC Kimberley: Mya Kordic) Department of Fire and Emergency Services Superintendent Phil Brandrett said flood modelling was being conducted north of Port Hedland in the Pilbara communities of Strelley and Warralong. Reducing the impact of a cyclone on your family, your home and your animals means making a plan well before the bad weather arrives. "We're looking at what resources we'll have on hand to actually put in place and be out in those particular communities, even in Marble Bar, for example," he said. "We've had some people doing flood modelling as well as worst-case scenarios. The Hedland State Emergency Services unit opened on Sunday afternoon for public sandbag collection. Blackrock Tourist Park manager Marie Carter said there were about 140 people staying in units and 50 permanent residents at the South Hedland site, where storm preparations were underway. The Hedland SES provided sandbags to residents on Sunday afternoon. (Supplied: Department of Fire and Emergency Services) "We personally go around and speak to everyone — we've got such a diverse group of people, from single mums with babies to workers and retirees," she said. "Some stay, some leave, but caravans get strapped down and they go into one of our cyclone-rated units. "We're such a large park, we start work three days before to make sure everything is covered." The Pardoo Roadhouse in the Pilbara was flattened by Cyclone Ilsa. (ABC News: Cason Ho) Pardoo Roadhouse, which was destroyed after Cyclone Ilsa made landfall in 2023, is again preparing for the potential of extreme weather. Owner Will Batth said lessons had been taken from previous experience. "No amount of preparation is ever enough — we know that now," he said. "We are prepared to evacuate if needed. Meteorologist Jonathan How said the tropical low would strengthen over the next two to three days and could develop into a category three system. "There is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the cyclone may do," he said. "Some of the model guidance is suggesting a land crossing around De Grey area and towards Wallal Downs as soon as Wednesday or Thursday. "Other computer guidance is also suggesting that the system actually remains offshore all the way to the weekend and crosses the coast closer to western parts of the Pilbara, as a category four or five system, around Karratha and down towards Onslow."

Title: AIL round-up: Terenure take down neighbours St Mary’s to go second

Terenure avenged November’s loss away to neighbours St Mary’s with a deserved 27-24 win at a jam-packed Lakelands Park on Saturday in Division 1A of the Energia All-Ireland League. The bonus-point victory elevates them above their rivals into second place behind new leaders Cork Con, who beat Terenure in last season’s final. That followed Terenure’s third successive home semi-final and Saturday’s derby has been described as a semi-final on steroids. In front of a crowd of almost 4,000, Terenure were generally on top and had some standout performances in Will Hickey, Jordan Coghlan and Caspar Gabriel, Leinster’s Austrian academy outhalf, who graced the game with some eye-catching moments, including a couple of brilliant high takes. A quick-fire double toward the end of the first period by hooker Max Russell, from a lineout maul, and Coghlan put Terenure 20-14 ahead at the break. Prolific fullback Conor Hayes kept St Mary’s in touch before Coghlan’s second try effectively sealed the win. A questionable Hayes try did earn the visitors a losing bonus point. A slightly weakened Clontarf were knocked off the top following a 27-14 loss away to Young Munster. The Cookies were 12-0 up inside 10 minutes through tries by winger Ihechi Oji and Ruadhán Quinn, who returned along with fellow Munster players Evan O’Connell, Shay McCarthy and Jake O’Riordan. Quinn’s second try had the home side 19-7 up at the break and a try by Hubert Gilvarry sealed the bonus point. Con lead the table on 47 points, ahead of Terenure on 45, followed by Clontarf and St Mary’s. Clontarf, who have a game in hand, host Con next week. Lansdowne had a vital win in Ballynahinch, who led 14-5 after the first quarter before Lansdowne imposed themselves with tries by Liam Molony and a brace by South African lock Juan Beukes. Kyle Gill’s 56th-minute try put Hinch back in front but Lansdowne’s outside centre Andy Marks capped another fine performance with the match-winning, bonus-point try – his 10th of the season – 10 minutes from time. Ballynahinch are on 37 points, with Lansdowne and Young Munster, who meet next week on the Aviva back pitch, both on 36 points. Cork Con went top with a bonus-point 31-19 victory over City of Armagh, who lost both influential fullback Kyle Faloon and try scorer Matthew Hooks to potentially season-ending injuries. Con outhalf James Taylor converted tries by Rob Jermyn, Joe O’Leary, Daniel Hurley and Jack Kelleher, and landed a penalty. UCD thus moved to within two points of City of Armagh with a hugely significant 26-15 bonus-point win over Garryowen, whose 12th successive defeat leaves them 10 points adrift in 10th place. The students’ hooker Bobby Sheehan maintained the familial liking for the try line with a hat-trick. Old Belvedere took a big step toward automatic promotion from Division 1B with a 30-10 win in Highfield to move eight points clear of second-placed Nenagh after their 24-14 defeat to Queen’s. Old Wesley moved to within four points of Nenagh after sharing 14 tries in an astonishing 44-41 win at home to UCC, for whom replacement hooker Luke McAuliffe scored four second-half tries.

Title: Investors await new inflation data amid tariff concerns: What to know this week

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks ended the first week of February little changed as investors digested corporate earnings from Big Tech companies, a hotter-than-expected January jobs report, and continuing updates on President Donald Trump's tariff policies. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was roughly flat, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.4%. In the week ahead, inflation will take center stage, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set for release on Wednesday morning. Updates on wholesale inflation and retail sales will also be closely tracked. But investors will also be keeping a close eye on Trump's planned announcement of new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, as well as for more details on reciprocal duties across the board. On the corporate front, 78 S&P 500 companies, including McDonald's (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), and Airbnb (ABNB), are set to report earnings. The January jobs report released on Friday showed continued signs of resilience in the labor market as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, wages grew more than expected, and December's monthly job gains were revised higher to show the US labor market exited 2024 on an even better footing than previously reported. This prompted economists to argue the Fed likely won't be cutting interest rates anytime soon. And if anything, it puts more pressure on inflation data to show cooling before the central bank brings down borrowing costs. "The more recent data are indicative of a labor market that has regained its footing," Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a note on Friday. "This suggests that the tail risk of a sharp deterioration in the labor market has diminished, and as a result the FOMC can wait to see how the Q1 inflation data and economic policymaking play out before taking further action on the federal funds rate." Stocks rebounded after dropping initially on Monday as President Trump's 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada were delayed at least a month. But what exactly happens with tariffs remains an overhang on markets as investors debate the potential impact on inflation and, subsequently, monetary policy. On Sunday, Trump said he will introduce a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imported into the US from all countries. He told reporters on Air Force One that he will announce the new metals duties on Monday, but didn't say when they would be implemented. The move puts Canada and Mexico, both top US suppliers of steel and aluminum, back in the hot seat on tariffs. Also stepping up the trade pressure, Trump said on Friday he would announce a plan on reciprocal tariffs on American imports. The comments were made during a meeting with Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Trump said tariffs on Japan were an option. In a research note on Friday, BlackRock Global Fixed Income chief investment officer Rick Rieder said it would likely take two weak jobs reports to prompt discussion about the Fed resuming its interest rate cutting cycle. But he added that the risks surrounding Trump's policies, including tariffs and an immigration crackdown, muddle the outlook. "While we and the Fed are keeping our eyes focused on these payroll (and inflation) reports, we also have to closely watch the news flow, and then the reverberations around these events, to get a sense for when the Fed and market makers can feel confident in rates coming down closer to a long-run neutral level," Rieder wrote. With investors' focus now squarely back on inflation data for hints of interest rate cuts, a fresh update on the pace of price increases is slated for release on Wednesday. Wall Street economists expect January's CPI to show headline inflation of 2.9% in January, flat from the month prior. Prices are anticipated to rise 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, per economist projections, below the 0.4% increase seen in December. On a "core" basis, which strips out food and energy prices, CPI is expected to have risen 3.1% over last year in January, below the 3.2% seen in December. Monthly core price increases are anticipated to clock in at 0.3%, above the 0.2% seen the month prior. The first monthly retail sales report of 2025 is set for release on Friday. Economists estimate retail sales were flat over the prior month during January. But the control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%, down from the 0.7% increase seen in December. With more than 62% of S&P 500 companies done reporting earnings, the year-over-year growth rate for the index keeps moving higher. As of Friday, the S&P 500 was pacing for earnings growth of 16.4% compared to the year prior. This would mark the fastest pace of growth in three years and is well above the 11.8% earnings growth analysts had expected at the start of January. While earnings have been beating expectations, macro factors have continued to create stop-and-go market action as stocks have failed to find clear direction. On Friday, stocks slipped lower after the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed respondents' one-year inflation expectations hit their highest level since November 2023. One-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.3% in February from 3.3% last month, marking the the fifth time in 14 years that the survey reported a rise of 1 percentage point or more in year-ahead inflation expectations. The release noted that the jump in inflation expectations was "in part due to a perception that it may be too late to avoid the negative impact of tariff policy." Stocks reversed course on the news, with all three major averages flipping from green to red. And while that constitutes just a small sampling of the market action, it's a reminder that what tariffs mean for inflation is squarely in focus for markets ahead of a week that's expected to provide updates on both fronts.

Title: Ireland U20’s make light work of Scotland to take opening Six Nations win
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/rugby/2025/02/08/ireland-u20s-make-light-work-of-scotland-to-take-opening-six-nations-win/
Time Published: 2025-02-08T22:31:16Z

Following the disappointment of losing out to defending champions England in the opening round, Ireland captain Eanna McCarthy believes a more clinical attacking edge was the catalyst behind his side’s victory over Scotland in the Under-20 Six Nations at the Hive Stadium on Saturday. After the hurt that was left from their 19-3 reversal at the hands of the English on home soil, Ireland were determined to get their first win of the Championship in the Edinburgh venue. Thanks to a hat-trick of first-half tries from Charlie Molony – in addition to fine finishes over the whitewash by Billy Corrigan and Oisin Minogue in either half - Neil Doak’s visitors emerged from this round two clash in the Scottish capital with a maximum tally of five points. “There was a big week’s training and a few fix-ups from last week. We had nine entries [against England] and we only converted one, whereas this week we had 15 and converted a lot more. I’m very proud of the lads, but it was a fierce physical battle with Scotland. They’re always a good team, so you never want to take them for granted,” McCarthy remarked after Saturday’s game. “We know we’re a good side. We created so many opportunities against England and we just missed out [because of] last ball here, dropped ball there. There wasn’t much getting into it. There was a bit of hurt left from it, but there wasn’t much to say to the lads. They were fairly well motivated themselves.” After spectacularly touching down with just over 90 seconds gone on the clock, Molony got on the end of a delicate crossfield kick by Sam Wisniewski for his second try of the action on 13 minutes. The hard-working Corrigan added his name to the scoresheet by rounding off an enterprising attack just shy of the first-quarter mark, before Molony wrapped up his hat-trick and an Ireland bonus point in ruthless fashion on 22 minutes. Scotland finally opened their account with a five-pointer from Fergus Watson just four minutes later and even though Ireland established a comfortable 26-5 interval lead, there were some nervous moments after Joe Roberts added a second Scottish try on the restart. Yet the introduction of Munster hopeful Minogue (nephew of the late Anthony Foley and son of former Ireland women’s international Rosie Foley) proved to be a masterstroke by Irish head coach Doak as he dived over off an intricate lineout move mere seconds after his introduction as a 59th minute replacement. A resolute Scotland dotted down once again via scrumhalf Hector Patterson inside the final quarter but while Ireland came up short in their quest for a sixth try in the closing moments, they had already done more than enough to earn an emphatic victory. After kick-starting the tournament with two games in the space of nine days, Ireland will now be able to enjoy an extended build-up to their third round encounter with Wales at Rodney Parade in Newport on February 21st. Now that they have some points on the board, McCarthy is hopeful they are in a good position to push on for the remainder of the Six Nations – albeit there will be some tough challenges ahead for the Irish. “A bonus point win is hard to get wherever you go. Five points on the table now, we just work on from here. There’s a lot of things to work on for next week now. We’ll go back and train hard next week, and the week after it we’re into Wales away then. Which will be another tough game,” McCarthy added.

Title: It’s easy to conclude the era of DEI is over — but it’s not

It’s easy to conclude that the era of diversity, equity and inclusion — the practice of using race and so-called intersectionality like gender preferences in hiring — is dead. But it’s not. In fact, DEI is likely headed for the Supreme Court, where it might get an odd reprieve from the bench’s conservative majority. It’s the reason why there are still plenty of companies — including Microsoft, Apple, Costco, JPMorgan and BlackRock — hanging on to this progressive shibboleth even if it’s destroying what’s left of a functioning meritocracy in the workplace. I know all this runs counter to the prevailing narrative that companies that go woke, will go broke. I wrote a whole book on the subject. Companies are now making headlines announcing no more DEI in hiring. The Trump administration has ended DEI in government and federal contracting. SCOTUS in 2023 ruled that racial preferences in college admissions are illegal. Major brands that went woke — like Bud Light when it ran an ad featuring a trans activist sipping the beer, half-naked in a bubble bath — still haven’t recovered from the consumer backlash. They’re now changing course. And yet, DEI is muddling along, and at some companies, it remains as strong as ever. One reason: Corporate managers remain significantly woke. Another: Lawyers are telling them there is a strong legal rationale for keeping DEI as a corporate mandate, my reporting shows All of this is why DEI’s defenestration often reflects a change in semantics. Many companies are simply dropping the “E” in DEI because equity can be construed with hard-and-fast quotas, which are legally dubious. Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, made headlines when he announced he ditched DEI; he even got rid of tampons in the company’s men’s room. Yet with a simple Google search I found a “diversity and inclusion” section on the company website. A Meta spokeswoman tells The Post when alerted about the discrepancy that it will be removed, adding “in no ambiguous terms — we’ve ended our DEI program.” Meanwhile, there are some big companies where DEI remains as strong as ever. One JPMorgan official told me, Jamie Dimon, the voluble CEO of the nation’s largest bank, believes DEI is a corporate necessity because it’s good for society and good for business, thus totally legal. Jonathan Turley, a constitutional law professor at George Washington University, explained this legal rationale for keeping DEI comes down to some vagaries in the interpretation of the civil rights laws. SCOTUS — even with a conservative majority, he noted — could be hard-pressed to end it completely when it hears several upcoming reverse-discrimination employment cases. It just might agree with Dimon that there is a business rationale to maintain DEI after listening to arguments that preferences in hiring aren’t quotas. Rather, they help companies sell stuff to different minority groups, and don’t really violate the color-blind interpretation of the civil rights laws that led to SCOTUS’ canceling affirmative action in college admissions. “On one level, it is not clear why educational institutions cannot use race in admissions, but corporations can use race criteria in hiring and promotions,” Turley said. “Some corporations are likely to argue that racial diversity has a direct market value with customers.” Again, a fair reading of the civil rights act would suggest race cannot be used even for a market benefit.

Never miss a story. As one corporate lawyer advising clients on how to deal with DEI told me, the SCOTUS affirmative action precedent plus past rulings upholding affirmative action suggested a high bar for upholding preferences. “The only time the courts have favored race being used is to address past racial discrimination and if that past discrimination can be remedied only in that way. It’s very narrow, and it’s hard to see how that applies to people working at big companies,” the legal expert said. But who knows how the Roberts Court, led by chief Justice (and Bush II appointee) John Roberts, considers a fair reading. Yes, it is regarded as among the most conservative SCOTUS’ ever with a seemingly impenetrable 6-3 conservative majority. A closer look at the personalities involved shows it can make some left turns. Roberts himself voted against striking down ObamaCare, and has rendered opinions that have angered conservatives. Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, often votes with Roberts on controversial issues. Neil Gorsuch, another Trump appointee has disappointed conservatives on various rulings, as has Trump appointed Amy Coney Barrett. Judicial restraint — a legal philosophy that looks askance at overturning precedent — is key to understanding the Roberts Court despite its rulings on affirmative action and overturning Roe v. Wade, legal experts tell me. Let’s just say this is a crew that doesn’t want to keep upsetting the old apple cart; it might view tearing down the final vestiges of DEI in the corporate ecosystem as overreach after it nixed college affirmative action. That’s the betting at least at those companies keeping the DEI faith. It’s also the rationale at many large companies that are merely ditching the term DEI, cleverly disguising the hiring and firing policies that continue to employ intersectional preferences.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/08/2025 9:57:03 AM PST by DallasBiff Staffers and allies of Elon Musk’s U.S. DOGE Service have fanned out across Washington in recent days, seeking access to sensitive data and disrupting operations in at least 14 government agencies in pursuit of a dramatically smaller federal government. DOGE, which stands for the Department of Government Efficiency, has not disclosed the names of its staff. But The Washington Post has identified more than 30 people working for or closely with it by examining the internal directories of multiple agencies and interviewing numerous federal workers, virtually all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Title: Mutual funds eye a chunk of ₹50,000 crore tax incentive showered in Budget

Iyengar Comments READ LATER Buoyed by growing investor interest, the mutual fund industry is gearing up to attract most of the ₹50,000 crore tax sops extended by the government to the middle-class in the Budget by promoting systematic investment plans and selling the India growth story. The Budget has exempted tax on salary income of up to ₹12.75 lakh per annum through a rebate and standard deduction of ₹75,000. Sundeep Sikka, ED and CEO, Nippon India Mutual Fund, said SIP is a convenient tool for small savers over the long run and the fund house believes the potential tax savings can be channelised through this route. “Our focus has always been to be a wealth creator to every Indian and the fact that one in a third mutual fund investor invests with us is a testimony to it,” he added. It is not just the investors, about six new fund houses are expected to jump into MF business this year. Among them, Angel One and Unifi Capital have filed papers with SEBI to launch their new products even while Jio BlackRock, Capitalmind, Choice International and Cosmea Financial Holdings are waiting in the wings. Akhil Chaturvedi, ED & CBO, Motilal Oswal Asset Management Company, said the fund house’s key focus is to expand the share in SIPs even while offering unique alternative investment products. Equity investors have matured, and despite market volatility, mutual fund investments continue to gain momentum as investors seek to capitalise on the recent market downturn for long-term gains, he added. Capital market regulator SEBI has recently laid norms to halve minimum SIP limit to ₹250 a month. About 225 million investors currently invest SIP but a majority are from big cities. Introducing SIPs in sachet size would help take financial investments to smaller towns. As an added advantage, SEBI is considering to allow MFs to offer insurance cover for SIP investors. For FY25, SIPs have more than quadrupled to ₹2.10 lakh crore so far from 2016-2017, per Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) data. Aashish Somaiyaa, CEO, WhiteOak Capital AMC, said the ‘Mutual Fund Sahi Hai’ is a household adage in today’s world with both investors and MF distributors are meritocratic. The recent market volatility has amply demonstrated relative safety and outperformance of mutual funds against the benchmark indices and more so MF performance against the direct equity holdings of retail investors, he added.

Title: Is Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) the Best Stock to Invest In for Grandchildren?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks To Invest In For Grandchildren. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks. In an era where financial literacy is increasingly recognized as a crucial life skill, teaching children about stock market investing can provide them with a significant advantage. Studies show that early financial education leads to better money management, long-term wealth accumulation, and greater financial security in adulthood. By introducing children to investing at a young age, they can develop a mindset of patience, risk assessment, and the power of compounding—principles that can shape their financial future. A 2023 study by the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) found that a lack of financial literacy costs the average American $1,819 per year. Teaching children about investing early can help reduce this financial gap and equip them with the necessary skills to navigate economic challenges. Introducing children to stocks helps them understand concepts like risk and reward, diversification, and market fluctuations. Learning how companies operate and grow their revenue also fosters a deeper understanding of the economy. This knowledge can prevent common financial mistakes such as emotional investing, excessive debt, and poor money management. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. One of the most compelling reasons to teach children about investing is the power of compound interest. If a child begins investing at age 10 instead of waiting until age 30, they could amass significantly more wealth by retirement, simply by starting early. Teaching children about stocks encourages critical thinking and discipline in financial decisions. Instead of seeing money as something to be spent impulsively, they learn the value of investing for the future. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 82% of parents who teach their children about finances believe it leads to greater financial independence. Additionally, teaching investment concepts through real-life experiences, such as monitoring a stock portfolio, fosters engagement and practical learning. With advancements in AI, automation, and digital finance, future generations will need financial acumen to navigate an evolving economy. Experts suggest that children who understand investing will be better prepared for retirement, homeownership, and entrepreneurship.

For this article, we scoured investing forums, analyst reports, and advice from money managers and billionaires and compiled a list of stock options that are deemed the best for a child in the modern world. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

It is a cost-effective, easy-to-manage solution that encrypts all data as it moves between servers and storage. Jeff Hoogenboom, vice president and general manager of the Emulex Connectivity Division at Broadcom, stated that the Emulex Secure Host Bus Adapter would meet the needs by providing an elegantly simple solution that, once installed, encrypts all data across all applications. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company achieved record semiconductor revenue of $30.1 billion, with $12.2 billion coming from AI. The 220% surge in AI revenue year-on-year was fueled by the company’s advanced AI XPUs and Ethernet networking solutions. Overall AVGO ranks 7th on our list of the best stocks to invest in for grandchildren. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Has Friedrich Merz, the man who would be chancellor of Germany, really opened the ‘doors to hell’?

No one closes rank quite like Germany’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Two weeks before 59 million Germans choose a new parliament – and, most likely, start a power transfer back to the CDU – the centre-right party is anxious to send a signal of unity. Standing ovations with slow, rhythmic applause are the order of the day at each campaign appearance of CDU leader Friedrich Merz. The lanky, bespectacled lawyer will turn 70 in November. After a 36-year wait, he has never been closer to power. A fortnight from the election, however, many think Merz’s influence has more to do with polarisation than politics. Last week the CDU leader performed a taboo-breaking rightward pivot on migration and asylum in the Bundestag, relying on votes from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). Though the CDU migration proposals were of no concrete consequence, they were highly symbolic. [ The Irish Times view on the German election: a worrying rightward shiftOpens in new window ] Bundestag rivals accused him of “opening the doors to hell” in the vote, with echoes of conservative pacts with the Nazis that ended prewar German democracy. On Sunday 160,000 outraged protesters braved the cold to gather outside Berlin’s CDU headquarters. One sign captured the mood: “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas 1933”. Even former CDU chancellor Angela Merkel broke her self-imposed political silence to call the AfD-backed Merz migration motion “wrong”. A decade ago her open-border politics and “we can manage this” refugee mantra drew popular support – and attracted global praise. But Germany is in a very different place a decade later. Even back then, resistance to her strategy was palpable. The eastern state of Saxony, for instance, saw marches organised by the “patriotic” civil rights group Pegida. The Saxon AfD was the first to tap migration as a more sustainable political calling card than EU bailouts. This week the Merz campaign tour stopped in Saxony, now an AfD heartland, where the far-right captured 30.7 per cent in last September’s state election – just one point behind the CDU. Growing migration fatigue – anger at criminal asylum seekers and a fumbled state response – has shifted Germany’s political centre. Less multicultural Berlin and more conservative Saxony: Merz is hoping to catch that wave, reshaping the CDU as centre-right party with a stronger conservative, law-and-order profile. In Dresden, the Saxon capital, Merz conceded that the AfD’s rise is a reflection of others’ political shortcomings. “Me and my party carry a big part of the responsibility,” he said. Amid growing applause, he urged Saxon voters not to “waste” their vote this time around on the AfD. “I want to make sure that the politics of my party is corrected to a point where the so-called Alternative for Germany is no longer needed,” he said, to whoops and cheers. In Dresden, and other campaign appearances, he promised new rules to “limit” migration – but remains vague on whether this correction will include turning back asylum seekers at the border. [ Bundestag MPs reject migration bill by Christian Democratic Union and backed by far-right Alternative for GermanyOpens in new window ] That was a demand in last week’s nonbinding proposals backed by the AfD, which triggered a wave of protest. In Dresden, some 3,000 demonstrated near the Merz event, many carrying signs that simply read: “Disgrace.” “Many people were very unsettled by that vote, particularly those who would have voted for the CDU under the assumption they wouldn’t ally themselves with the AfD,” said Albrecht Pallas, a Saxon MP for the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), which leads Germany’s ruling coalition. “People out here today are worried about the future of our democracy.” Saxon CDU voters – traditionally on the conservative end of the political spectrum – worry about democracy, but for different reasons. “It’s important that democracy survives against growing anti-democratic tendencies,” said Tilo Höhne, a 56-year-old Dresden CDU supporter. “On the other hand, you cannot exclude a quarter of voters from democratic processes indefinitely, or else they will reject democracy itself – which only survives with broad public support.” The party’s current support is steady, but not stellar, nearly three points behind Merkel’s worst election result. Last week’s rebellion of 12 CDU MPs against the migration motion, analysts suggest, reflects wider dissent. “He doesn’t have his party completely behind him,” says Prof Klaus Schubert, political scientist at the University of Münster. “The irony of all this is how Merz, a self-anointed economic expert, has trapped himself with the migration topic when the economy should be the biggest election issue.” Aware of that, Merz is working to shift attention in the last fortnight of the campaign. With Germany heading for a third year of flat growth – a postwar first – the CDU is promising a nine-point action plan for its first 100 days. It wants lower income tax and corporate tax, simplified bureaucracy and a push for higher investment in research and infrastructure – potentially with a reformed debt brake to allow greater borrowing. Critics say the plans are unfunded and lacking detail, unlike the CDU’s detailed plans to undo welfare reforms of the Olaf Scholz coalition. Merz says Germany must be “ready to take on leadership responsibility” in Europe by renewing frayed ties to Paris and Warsaw – in particular to provide a coherent EU response to the Trump administration. On the campaign trail, he has toned down his previous robust rhetoric on arms deliveries to Ukraine. Merz was born in 1955 into a Catholic family in the western Sauerland district. He battled tuberculosis aged 10, went on to study law and was a 33-year-old district court judge in 1989 when he won a seat for the CDU in the third directly elected European Parliament. After one term in Strasbourg he returned to Bonn as one of many young disciples around Helmut Kohl. When Angela Merkel snatched the CDU leadership in 2000 she appointed Merz as her deputy. Sensing his ambition, she dropped him after two years. The animosity was so great that, when she stepped out as leader in 2018, she tried to thwart – twice – his ambition to be CDU leader. [ Angela Merkel thwarted Friedrich Merz’s ambition to succeed her. Now they have buried the hatchetOpens in new window ] He succeeded on the third attempt, to ongoing despair of Merkelist CDU centrists. While Merz hopes his conservative stripes are back in fashion, rivals inside and outside his party never tire of skewering him as an ageing Tory Boy. After he was ousted by Merkel, Merz became a millionaire corporate lawyer who advised the BlackRock investment fund. He described himself as “upper middle class” in an interview, yet flies his own private jet. In the cockpit of his €1 million Austrian-built Diamond DA 62, his call name – in line with aviation rules – is “Foxtrot Mike”. Merz allies insist the rightward shift of the CDU didn’t start last week. Nor, they say, is he turning back the clock entirely. Its new party programme from last May is open to “diverse families” and multiculturalism, but has declared as unwelcome “an Islam that doesn’t share our families and rejects our free society”. The Merz campaign is high-risk and fluid: a centre-right cocktail that is being remixed on a daily basis, with no certainty it will appeal to voter tastes. German political analysts disagree on whether his migration shift was an act of madness – alienating centrist voters and complicating coalition talks – or a master stroke to pull in one third of German voters who are still undecided. For now, fears that Merz damaged the CDU with its Bundestag migration motions appear unfounded. A week on, a Thursday poll showed the CDU had gained one point to 31 per cent in polls – but so, too, had the AfD. It remains in second place on 21 per cent. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michelin Guide 2025: Will Ireland finally get its first three-star restaurant?
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/food/restaurants/2025/02/08/michelin-guide-2025-will-ireland-finally-get-its-first-three-star-restaurant/

The Michelin Guide Great Britain & Ireland 2025 will be revealed on Monday, February 10th, at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery & Museum in Glasgow, an event that can make or break reputations overnight. While British restaurants have long secured three-star status, Ireland remains on the outside looking in. With speculation building, will this finally be the year an Irish restaurant claims the ultimate accolade? Understanding the Michelin system requires some decoding. Not every restaurant listed in the guide holds an award – many are simply included as part of Michelin’s curated selection, a recognition in itself but without the same prestige. Beyond a listing, Michelin has three key distinctions: the Bib Gourmand, the Michelin Star, and the Green Star. The Bib Gourmand, introduced in 1997, is awarded to restaurants that offer particularly good food at moderate prices. It can, on occasion be a stepping stone to a Michelin star, as was the case with Bastible in Dublin, which was awarded a Bib in 2017 and went on to secure a Michelin star in 2022, but that is the exception rather than the rule. [ Ireland’s first Michelin star: ‘It made the front page of the London Times, but only got a mention in the Examiner’Opens in new window ] Michelin stars are awarded in three tiers based solely on food. A single star denotes high-quality cooking “worth a stop”; two stars indicate excellent cooking “worth a detour”; and three stars, the most coveted award, are reserved for “exceptional cuisine worth a special journey.” These broad descriptions leave room for interpretation. Awards ignore service, decor and ambience – a food shack is as eligible as a fine-dining restaurant. The final distinction, the Green Star, introduced in 2020, highlights restaurants leading the way in sustainability. In Ireland, only Kai in Galway holds one. Michelin inspectors, working anonymously across 39 destinations, log more than 250 meals a year, documenting each in detail. They book under aliases and pay their own bills to maintain impartiality. With at least a decade of industry experience, they must possess a refined palate, assess cuisine objectively, and have deep knowledge of global culinary traditions. Restaurants are assessed based on five criteria: ingredient quality, culinary technique, flavour harmony, the chef’s personality in the dishes, and consistency across visits. Decisions are made collectively by the inspection team, ensuring uniform standards globally. Michelin stars are awarded unanimously, with additional visits conducted if opinions differ. [ Michelin-starred restaurants in Ireland, 2024: The complete guideOpens in new window ] Each year there are notable absences due to restaurant closures or significant changes. Wild Honey Inn in Co Clare, long regarded as one of Ireland’s best gastropubs, has now shut its doors and will no longer feature. Eipic in Belfast, which previously held a Michelin star, has also closed. Another possible loss is the Cliff House in Ardmore, Co Waterford, which would have required a further inspection following the departure of chef Tony Parkin, and the time frame to do this may have been too tight. Michelin is known for re-evaluating restaurants following key personnel changes, and if they find standards have slipped, the star could be removed. Lignum in Bullaun, east Galway, has been drawing increasing attention from the Michelin Guide this year, particularly for its focus on wood-fired cooking. Built around a fire-driven approach using embers from kiln-dried birch, ash, and oak, it offers a €145, 10-course tasting menu showcasing seasonal Irish and Italian ingredients. Since opening in 2017, it has been widely tipped for a Michelin star. Lignum is led by Danny Africano in the kitchen and his wife, Molly Keane, running front of house. It pairs its ambitious cooking with a beautifully designed diningroom. With Enda McEvoy’s Loam now closed, JP McMahon’s Aniar is Galway’s only remaining Michelin-starred restaurant. Galway is primed for a second one, and this could well be the year that Lignum claims the accolade. There is considerable speculation about who else might secure a Michelin star, particularly restaurants that have had a change of chef. Ballyfin received three Michelin Keys, a new award that places it among the world’s top hotels. Chef Richard Picard-Edwards, who has extensive Michelin starred experience, joined Ballyfin as executive head chef in April 2023 from the Mandarin Oriental Bittescombe Lodge, and is serving benchmark Michelin-level food on a €145, eight-course menu. When I visited, the Jerusalem artichoke cream was a standout dish, with precisely cut pickled artichoke, caviar, gold leaf, micro herbs, and croutons sitting on top of a silky cream, with umami-rich chicken jelly. [ Two Irish hotels awarded highest honours in new Michelin key awardsOpens in new window ] The listing on the Michelin website describes Ballyfin as offering an exceptional dining experience that matches its luxurious setting, highlighting the kitchen’s technical precision and consistently high standards. With polished, attentive service completing the picture, things are looking very positive for them. Another stunning restaurant and strong contender is the Morrison Room at Carton House, where Adam Nevin (ex The Grill at The Dorchester, The Hand and Flowers and The Westbury in London) delivers a textbook Michelin experience. You’ll find plenty of luxury ingredients on his €110, eight-course tasting menu. The barbecued lobster tail was a highlight when I visited. Jonathan Farrell, formerly of Bastible in Dublin, spent time at top Copenhagen restaurants – including Amass and Relæ – before working at Simon Rogan’s three-star L’Enclume in England’s Lake District. Since taking over as head chef at Gregans Castle last year, he has been firmly on Michelin’s radar. With The Wild Honey Inn now closed, there’s one star fewer in Co Clare, which could well be heading his way. However, there has been little talk of it on the guide’s social media, so maybe it won’t be this year. [ 100 great restaurants, cafes and places to eat in Ireland 2024Opens in new window ] Meanwhile, Alex Greene and Bronagh McCormick, formerly head chef and general manager of the defunct Eipic, have taken the helm at The Buck’s Head Inn in Dundrum, Co Down. With their combined expertise, they are elevating the offering, pairing Greene’s skill with top-quality local produce on an a la carte menu that reflects his talent. This is one to watch. There are a few restaurants that have been receiving increased attention from Michelin inspectors. Mae in Dublin has had multiple visits, which has speculation going, and not surprisingly, Alta, known for its focus on wood-fired cooking, has also been added to the Michelin listings. Landline at Park Hotel in Kenmare is another possibility. It was recently added to the guide. One of the biggest questions leading into this year’s announcement is whether Chapter One by Mickael Viljanen can achieve three-star status. London’s Ledbury, which had long been seen as one of the city’s best restaurants, finally secured three stars last year. Chapter One is in a similar position – highly respected, extensively visited by Michelin inspectors, and widely praised by top chefs. However, Michelin has yet to award three stars to any Irish restaurant, and whether this will be the year they break that pattern is uncertain. Last year, Michelin’s chief inspector revealed little but confirmed that Chapter One remains under close scrutiny, with inspectors closely monitoring its evolution. He hinted that once everything aligns, it will join the ranks of three-star restaurants. “To become a three-star restaurant is to basically say that this is one of the best restaurants in the world. It’s a restaurant that is going to provide an incredible experience. Not only just the sophistication and originality and personality of the cuisine, but there’s also everything else that goes with it,” he said. “So when we make these decisions – and the inspectors absolutely love seeing a new restaurant join the family of three-star restaurants – we have to be very, very sure of our decision.” [ Forget TripAdvisor and Google reviews: How leading Irish chefs find the best restaurants when travelling abroadOpens in new window ] Terre in Castlemartyr, which was awarded two stars last year, may also have its sights set on the highest accolade. Given the difficulty of making the leap from two stars to three, it may take another few years of sustained excellence before it reaches that level. Similarly, Liath and Dede, both currently at two stars, are undoubtedly aiming for the ultimate accolade. However, the bar for three stars is extraordinarily high, and securing the award requires consistently superlative cooking. While some restaurants are widely expected to receive a Michelin star, others seem to be repeatedly overlooked. Library St, Dax, Uno Mas and Forest Avenue are four of the most talked-about omissions. Many in the industry argue that if these restaurants were in London, they would already have a star. Michelin’s choices often spark debate, and if these names remain absent again this year, it will only add to the perception that certain deserving restaurants are being ignored. While the focus tends to be on new one-star recipients and potential three-star elevations, the step from one to two stars is also a significant achievement. Adare Manor and Mount Juliet are two establishments that may be in contention for a second star, though they remain outside bets. Michelin’s decisions in this category are often difficult to predict, as the criteria for moving from one to two stars involve an extra level of finesse and consistency. [ Ten restaurants around Ireland worth travelling to for a unique experienceOpens in new window ] Despite its critics, the Michelin Guide remains a powerful influence in the restaurant industry. A star, or even a listing, can drive bookings, raise a restaurant’s profile, and draw international attention. While some dismiss it as outdated, its influence is undeniable. Even those who claim indifference feel its impact – whether through a surge in reservations after an award or the frustration of being overlooked. Michelin is famously secretive about its process, and surprises are always possible. However, one thing is certain – on February 10th, the future of Irish fine dining will take another step forward, and the country’s top chefs will be watching closely to see who is in, who is out, and who has finally reached the pinnacle of culinary recognition. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Per a report by news agency Reuters, US President Trump has delayed tariffs on Canada and Mexico by one month, fueling wild swings in currency, bond and share markets. Despite the turmoil, stock-picking hedge funds that take bets based on company fundamentals recorded an average 2.6% return, their best month since February 2024, given a broader market rally, the report claimed.

Title: The Irish Times view on Dublin’s disappearing buses: time to banish the ghosts
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorials/2025/02/07/the-irish-times-view-on-dublins-disappearing-buses-time-to-banish-the-ghosts/

The incidence of ghost buses – scheduled services that fail to show up – is a cause of understandable frustration to the travelling public and Dublin commuters. The explanations advanced to date by the two operators in the Dublin market – state-owned Dublin bus and the privately-owned Go Ahead – are plausible but don’t seem to account adequately for the extent of the long-running problem which has become acute in recent weeks. Go Ahead attributes it to a shortage of mechanics while Dublin Bus points to problems with a 15 year old real-time passenger information system which does not always provide accurate information on bus arrivals. It is to be replaced over the next two years at a cost of €68 million. The elephant in the room is traffic congestion in Dublin and its impact on buses in general, including those introduced as part of BusConnects, a multiyear project to redesign the bus network around a series of spine and radial routes. Dublin is one of the most congested cities in Europe .The consequences for bus timetables are obvious and can only be exacerbated for the long cross-city and radial routes at the heart of the BusConnects project. Delays in rolling out bus lanes are another factor. It is perhaps not a coincidence that one of the worst performing route for ghost buses is a radial route across south Dublin introduced as part of BusConnects. The S6 runs from Blackrock in South Dublin via UCD to Tallaght in West Dublin and is the most featured on an app which irate passengers use to report ghost buses. BusConnects is an important and necessary project and part of the wider effort to reach our national climate goals. The question as to whether it may have underestimated the consequences of traffic congestion is one that the Minister for Transport Darragh O’Brien could usefully bring up with the National Transport Authority when he meets them next week to discuss the issue. So is the slow progress on rolling out the whole project and the need to speed up the introduction of the new real-time information system. © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: XRP ETF Launch: Ripple Bulls Eye $50 Billion Inflow As Institutions Show Massive Interest In XRP

Amidst the current positive mood in the market, a noteworthy event has sparked discussion and expectation: the potential for an exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by Ripple’s XRP to enter the fray. The interview that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had with Bloomberg had become the focal point of this discussion. Throughout the interview, Garlinghouse expressed cautious optimism about the potential of an XRP ETF. He did not share specific ideas but indicated that he was receptive. Though speculation about possible partnerships has been rife, Garlinghouse didn’t acknowledge nor deny that it is in talks with significant asset management companies such as BlackRock. Remarkably, a leaked document from November 2023 raised rumors about BlackRock’s potential investment in an XRP ETF. But a later investigation refuted this rumor. SCOOP: @BlackRock has no plans for a spot $XRP ETF, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter story developing European investors can purchase XRP exchange-traded products (ETPs) from companies like CoinShares and 21 Shares; however, no XRP ETF is available in the US market. Nevertheless, the process of introducing an XRP ETF in the US is hampered by legal obstacles and market conjecture, which were made worse by the legal dispute between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After news about the possibility of an XRP ETF, social media platforms lit up with conversations from people from all walks of life sharing their thoughts. An exciting tweet posted by John Deaton caught attention. It’s worth noting that he announced his Senate candidacy on the same day Brad Garlinghouse broached the topic of an XRP ETF. Former Ripple director Sean McBride also shared his observations, projecting the release of an XRP ETF by 2025 in addition to a 2025 Ripple IPO outside of the United States. Amidst the excitement, a user started fabricating stories about FOMO (fear of missing out) that emphasized the alleged chances to amass cash. This tweet and others like it advise followers to stay on their assets, predicting large returns and hinting that selling now could mean losing out on future income. Such speculative claims must be carefully considered, considering the inherent dangers and uncertainties of the crypto market. Recent months have seen a rush of activity and conjecture surrounding the Ripple v. SEC legal battle, with significant developments suggesting the likelihood of a complete resolution. Notably, after a closed meeting on November 30, the SEC did not make any motions and instead remained silent, which stoked rumors of a likely settlement between the SEC and Ripple. Legal expert Fred Rispoli has drawn attention to the SEC’s absence of motions, suggesting that there may be an unwritten understanding between Ripple and the agency that might result in a settlement following the evaluation of the requested information. After ten years of development, the first Bitcoin spot ETF was finally approved in January 2024, highlighting the regulatory obstacles and cautious approach to financial products based on cryptos. The path to an XRP ETF is challenging to navigate in light of these obstacles, reflecting the larger difficulties the crypto sector faces in getting new financial products approved by regulators. Given the SEC’s attention to Ethereum ETFs, it is clear that more established assets will probably be prioritized over XRP and other options. Therefore, Ripple’s future will be shaped by the changing regulatory landscape, which will also impact broader market developments such as XRP ETFs, Ripple’s IPO, and the state of the crypto industry as a whole.

Title: RWA Tokenization Is Going to Trillions Much Faster Than You Think
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/02/07/rwa-tokenization-is-going-to-trillions-much-faster-than-you-think
Time Published: 2025-02-07T18:59:25Z
Full Content:
What if I told you that the experts are wrong? Over the years several prestigious consulting firms and financial institutions have put out forecasts about the growth of tokenization by the end of the decade. It’s interesting how between all that “expertise,” their ranges vary between $2 trillion (McKinsey) and $16 trillion (BCG). Fourteen trillion dollars is a heck of a lot of spread! Since 2017, there have been trials to tokenize assets all around the world. Along the way we’ve seen almost every asset class brought on-chain. Today there are more than $50 billion in tokenized stocks, bonds and real estate, with some of the world’s biggest financial institutions, like BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and Apollo starting to invest serious resources into tokenization. Add in over $200 billion in stablecoins (or what we can call tokenized dollars) and we’ve got one quarter of a trillion dollars in RWAs. What will it look like when the faucet actually turns on? We believe it looks like going from $250 billion today to $30 trillion in 2030, all thanks to the new crypto clarity in the U.S. Whether it’s the Fed, the new Crypto Czar, both houses in Congress, or the President himself, this new administration has understood and embraced the benefits of stablecoins to further improve the dollar dominance in the world. If the U.S. dollar is the world reserve currency for the Web2 world, why not also for the Web3 world? Simply put, the more people that buy stablecoins, the majority of which are in dollars, the better it is for the U.S.A. With the right attitude on crypto, we should see market clarity on token classifications (an official taxonomy) and stablecoin market structure in new legislation coming before Congress. Passing such a bill will offer a green light for blockchain to be used in capital markets in the U.S. Previous prediction reports did not factor in this new wave of clarity and government-wide support for crypto, stablecoins, and RWAs. Stablecoins and yieldcoins (treasury backed tokens) are set to grow significantly from their current $220 billion position, potentially up to $3 to $5 trillion by 2030 if you factor in commercial adoption, digital assets growth, and the demand for yield on-chain. This RWA use case has not only found product-market fit by crypto users, but it will also become a settlement solution and payment rail for capital markets in general. All assets can now transact on a new, nearly-instantaneous financial operating system using blockchain to go in and out of any tokenized Real World Asset (RWA) or crypto asset using stablecoins. The tokenization revolution is inevitable. Which is actually what the CEOs of BlackRock and JP Morgan have been openly saying and acting on. Most critics will laugh at the notion that the over one hundred trillion in stocks or hundreds of trillions in real estate, or trillions in private companies, or trillions in commodities, or trillions in bonds and credit could all be tokenized. In a few years those critics will be saying tokenization is a necessity and that it's the innovation of the century for finance (because it is). The answer is yes, it can all be tokenized. It’s more of a question of how fast will each asset class take advantage of migrating on chain. Some assets will feel more pressure to adapt while other assets are so large it doesn’t take much to move the needle to suddenly get to trillions either via new asset issuance, tokenized asset growth, or simply legacy assets migrating on-chain. My conversations with banks, asset managers, crypto exchanges, and industry leaders tells me that there is a renewed spirit for asset tokenization with the difference being that the traditional finance sector and regulators now better understands the benefits of blockchain technology, implying that the growth of asset tokenization will happen faster than previously forecast. Here are some other reasons our forecasts are higher than previous estimates: When we look at some of the past forecasts, some of them like HSBC and Northern Trust use a methodology that relies on calculating the size of the asset class and applying a nominal percentage of adoption or in their case a range of 5-10% of total assets. Others like Standard Chartered allude to specific asset classes growing faster than others or in their case citing 14% of $30 trillion of assets by 2034 coming from trade finance. STM’s methodology breaks down the eight largest asset classes in the world and considers regulatory and government support as a key factor of growth. Imagine if California’s title registry went on-chain. That’s a residential home market of $10 trillion that could be put on a blockchain virtually overnight. Thanks to new market clarity in the U.S. and the success of stablecoins, we expect faster blockchain adoption around the world, leading to $50 trillion in RWA annual trading by the end of the decade. It’s time to open the faucet. Happy tokenizing! Please see the full report here.

Title: Large Whale Dumps 8,500 Ether Amid Surging Institutional Demand

Time Published: 2025-02-07T18:48:16Z
Full Content:
In a sharp turn of events, a crypto whale has sold 8,500 ETH, raising speculations about the asset’s direction. In recent weeks, sideways traders dominated crypto assets within the ETH price outlook, slipping below resistance levels. However, Ethereum bulls saw buying opportunities like most market dips, making new low entry points ahead of anticipated inflows. At the time of writing, ETH’s price crashed 3% to $2,742 in the last 24 hours, extending weekly exits above 15%. In the last 24 hours, a whale moved $23.2 million worth of Ethereum at around $2,736 per coin. This was followed by other sales from retail holders, wiping off the momentum gained the previous day. Most traders suggest that the grip on the wider market’s correction on top altcoins might be short-term. However, its impact lowered institutional demand, wiped off gains, and slowed decentralized financial (DeFi) numbers. Today, Ethereum’s trading volumes sit slightly above $30 billion after its market capitalization fell below $131 billion. The leading altcoin has struggled to replicate previous gains in recent times as sentiments move to other assets. Altcoin repositioning became glaring after spot Ethereum ETFs failed to attract inflows like Bitcoin products. Despite the milestone, ETH price struggled suggesting the asset was overbought. This led to a change in sentiments from Ethereum to XRP and Solana, altcoins now described as institutional investor favorites. Last year, SOL outpaced ETH growth without spot ETFs leading to surging optimism of the former’s products awaiting approval. XRP spiked in the same period to the third largest crypto asset by market cap. Trading above $3 at the start of the year, analysts tipped a spike to $6 during the altcoin season as funds move out of Bitcoin. However, the market’s correction led to a sharp 22% weekly decline. Amid the crippling downturn, crypto whales took advantage to ramp up ETH holdings. On Feb 6, the asset broke $2,800 after BlackRock purchased 100,535 ETH worth approximately $284 million. This large investment, alongside others, boosts trader confidence, as seen in hourly trading data. Furthermore, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Finance added to its ETH holdings following the last correction caused by U.S. trade disputes. Recent acquisitions and on-chain factors led analysts to raise projections for the assets. Renowned trader Ali Martinez wrote on X that Ethereum is gearing up for a breakout above $4,000.

Title: Ethereum Price Could Be Primed For Another 100% Move After Printing Capitulation Candle
URL: http://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-primed-for-100-move/
Time Published: 2025-02-07T17:00:02Z
Full Content:
Ethereum’s price action in the past seven days has led to the creation of a capitulation candle that might send it on another surge within the next eight to twelve weeks. This capitulation candle caught the attention of crypto analyst Ted Pillows, who noted an interesting repeating capitulation pattern for Ethereum. According to technical analysis by Ted Pillows, Ethereum has printed a capitulation candle in early 2025, just as it did in the first quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. TedPillows’ analysis highlights that the Ethereum price has undergone three major capitulation events in the past two years, all of which led to substantial price rebounds. Particularly, these capitulations have taken place in the weekly candlestick timeframe, where the Ethereum price witnessed intense selling pressure throughout the week. However, historical price playout shows that these capitulations have often marked the bottom before a massive price rally. The first of such capitulations occurred in Q1 2024 and eventually led to a 100% rally over the next three months, with the Ethereum price reaching $3,950. The second capitulation took place in Q3 2024, leading to a similar upswing. With Ethereum now experiencing another capitulation moment in early 2025, the analyst suggests that the pattern is set to repeat. He believes that Ethereum is once again forming a market bottom, setting the stage for an aggressive upward move. If Ethereum follows its previous trajectory, the next eight to twelve weeks could bring a significant price increase, even as the leading altcoin currently struggles around $2,700. A 90%-100% pump after the recent capitulation would push the Ethereum price past key resistance levels and above its current all-time high. TedPillows’ analysis suggests that Ethereum’s ultimate price target following this capitulation could reach as high as $8,000. However, it is likely to encounter significant resistance near $3,950, a level that has historically triggered rejections in past capitulation cycles. Should Ethereum struggle to break through this barrier again, a temporary pullback could be on the horizon before any sustained move higher. Meanwhile, Spot Ethereum ETFs are attracting heavy inflows despite Ethereum’s price downturn. Institutional investors appear to be capitalizing on the dip and increasing their ETH holdings in anticipation of a broader market rebound. Spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded $513.8 million in inflows in the last six trading days, with BlackRock leading the charge by acquiring $424.1 million worth of ETH. This steady accumulation from institutional holders suggests growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and could lay the foundation for the projected 100% surge in the next eight to twelve months. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,725, down by 4% in the past 24 hours.

Title: Weekly Recap: Crypto Debanking in the Spotlight
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2025/02/07/weekly-recap-crypto-debanking-in-the-spotlight
Time Published: 2025-02-07T16:59:39Z
Full Content:
It was a busy week in crypto featuring important product launches, fevered debate around Ethereum, movement on stablecoin legislation, and high-profile Congressional hearings on “debanking.” David Sacks, the Crypto and AI Czar, held a high-profile press conference with Senate leadership, as Senator Hagerty, of Tennessee, introduced a new stablecoin bill. The proposal, which outlines an oversight regime for stablecoin issuance, builds on a bill that passed the House last year but fell in the Senate. It’s more likely to pass this year, now that Republicans are in control. CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton had the news. The Senate also held hearings on the co-ordinated policy of institutions like the FDIC to deny financial services to crypto companies during the Biden years (aka debanking). Nathan McCauley, CEO Anchorage Digital, an institutional custodian, testified (and also wrote about his experience on CoinDesk). Consensys founder Joe Lubin said his company had been debanked twice as well, Ian Allison reported. Ondo Finance introduced a new tokenization blockchain, in readiness for an expected wave of institutional interest in RWAs. Kris Sandor and Helene Braun had the story. Trump-backed World Liberty Financial immediately bought $470,000 worth of ONDO, the platform’s governance token. Kris Sandor and Francisco Rodrigues reported on that. The week’s other big launch came from Berachain, which debuted a mainnet and a 79 million-strong airdrop, Shaurya Malwa reported. At the time of writing, BERA’s market cap was already more than $800 million. Shaurya also provided a prescient analysis of XRP price, well ahead of its decline by analyzing trading patterns. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy rebranded, dropping the “Micro” but not the commitment to purchasing as much bitcoin as possible. Soon, James Van Straten reported that BlackRock had taken a 5% ownership in the company. News around Ethereum was less rosy, as has been the case for a few months now. JPMorgan said ether has underperformed because of competition from rivals like Solana, and because it lacks a compelling narrative (like bitcoin), Will Canny reported. But Ethereum did move forward on its Pectra upgrade and its cheerleaders run deep, even on Wall Street, Margaux Nijkerk said. So better days may be ahead (Eric Trump certainly tweeted an endorsement). Bitcoin is called "digital gold" by some, but outside of it, the actual precious metal moves cryptocurrencies too. Gold's historic run has seen prices outperforming the traditional market, taking gold-backed crypto with it. Francisco Rodrigues highlighted how and why tokens like PAXG and XAUT were among the best-performing tokens this year, outperforming even the "digital gold," due to the bullion's rally. Finally, in an important case for internet privacy, Alexey Pertsev, one of the developers of Tornado Cash, an Ethereum mixer, was released from jail pending an appeal. He had been sentenced to 64 months inside last year. Happy weekend, all. Benjamin Schiller is CoinDesk's managing editor for features and opinion.

We recently compiled a list of the 35 Chip Stocks In Focus Amid Tech Selloff. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against the other chip stocks. The semiconductor industry is on a trajectory of rapid growth, with global revenues expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2030. According to a report on the industry by professional services firm PwC, this expansion is fueled by advancements in memory technology, the rise of automotive semiconductors, regional self-sufficiency initiatives, purpose-built silicon, and the increasing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Per the report, Memory integrated circuits (ICs), particularly DRAM and high-bandwidth memory (HBM), have been the fastest-growing semiconductor segment. In 2024, DRAM is projected to contribute 14% of total semiconductor revenue. HBM, essential for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), is expected to grow at a 64% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in bit growth and a 58% CAGR in revenue through 2028. As big companies leverage HBM for AI workloads, closer collaboration is required between foundries and memory firms to integrate logic and memory components effectively. Read more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and AI News You Should Not Have Missed. PwC highlights that the automotive semiconductor market reached $76 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow to $117 billion by 2028, driven by electric vehicle (EV) adoption and software-defined vehicles (SDVs). Power semiconductors, particularly those utilizing silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), are expected to reach $6 billion, comprising 18% of the market by 2028. Meanwhile, automotive system-on-chip (SoC) revenue was $7 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a 17% CAGR through 2028, supporting real-time data processing, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and infotainment. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, prompting major economies to pursue self-sufficiency. By 2027, approximately $400 billion in government funding is expected to be allocated to semiconductor initiatives. The US has already awarded $29.5 billion in grants and $25.1 billion in loans, with total investments projected to reach $348 billion by 2030. The European Union has allocated $46 billion for incentives, while China has invested over $190 billion through its National Integrated Circuit Investment Fund and local initiatives. South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan have also introduced tax incentives and subsidies to boost domestic semiconductor production. The demand for custom ICs tailored to specific applications is surging, especially in data centers, video processing, and network security. By 2028, the market for data center custom ICs is expected to reach $24 billion. AI is a critical growth driver for the semiconductor industry, requiring GPUs, accelerators, and HBM. The AI-specific silicon market is forecasted to reach $150 billion by 2028.

A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) operates as a visual computing firm. JP Morgan recently reiterated its Overweight rating on Nvidia, noting that past innovation cycles suggest that efficiency and technology improvements drive further adoption and innovation. Analysts led by Harlan Sur said that after the launch of the DeepSeek R1 large language model last week, investors were concerned regarding the intermediate and long-term effects for AI semiconductor spending given the Chinese startup's claim regarding their compute efficiency in terms of cost and performance for training/inferencing AI models. However, the analysts noted that despite the impressive cost efficiency of DeepSeek’s training and inference, several questions remain unanswered, including the complete training costs for R1 and the extent of reliance on larger open-source foundation models developed earlier. Overall NVDA ranks 1st on our list of the chip stocks in focus amid tech selloff. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Tether's brain-to-text initiative promises digital communication solutions for people with neurological conditions. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Stablecoin issuer Tether is advancing its AI initiatives with a focus on translating brain signals into speech. In a Feb. 6 post on X, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that Tether Data’s research and development (R&D) team has built an electrocorticography (ECoG) plugin. This technology interprets neural signals, forming the foundation for brain-to-text communication. Initial tests confirmed its ability to generate syllables from brain activity. The next step is the development of a model that can construct complete sentences. Tether’s AI models aim to assist individuals with speech impairments. Through ECoG implants, users could communicate digitally by converting brain signals into text. The models will also run on edge devices such as smartphones, ensuring data remains private. According to Ardoino: “These models will serve as backbone for future system that would allow someone who has lost speech and has an ECoG implant to speak digitally once again.” Last year, Blackrock Neurotech, a company backed by Tether, restored speech in a patient who had nearly lost communication ability. Ardoino said that brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) could evolve into mainstream consumer products within two decades, potentially offering life-changing solutions for those affected by paralysis and neurological conditions. These initiatives are part of Tether’s growing involvement in AI. Earlier this week, the company introduced several AI-powered applications, including a Bitcoin wallet assistant, a translation tool, and a voice assistant. These solutions prioritize user security and privacy by operating directly on personal devices. Beyond AI, Tether’s USDT stablecoin has reached a major milestone. Ardoino revealed that the digital asset now serves 400 million users in emerging markets, including Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, and Brazil. According to him: “USDt reached 400 million users across emerging markets. Digital dollar and financial inclusion.” CryptoSlate data shows that USDT remains the dominant stablecoin, with a market capitalization exceeding $141 billion. According to DeFillama data, it controls roughly 63% of the stablecoin market. Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential.

Title: Even US Messaging Outlet RFE/RL Having Trouble Prettying Up Trump Planning to Buy Ukraine Rare Earths Empty Bag

It’s amusing to see a US influence operator, RFL/RL, trying to preserve an image of accuracy while carrying official water. Here, the case in point is Trump’s promotion of the idea that the US could continue to arm Ukraine if Ukraine mortgaged its future by paying the US via ownership or other concessions of its rare earths deposits, or as Trump put it, “rare earth” and one presumes other strategic materials. Here we have Trump again proving himself to be the truest follower of the Kamala Harris exhortation, “What can be, unburdened by what has been.” Here the “what has been” includes what is. In this case, it’s that Ukraine has bupkis in the way of rare earths. Worse, the media has been simply parroting what Trump said as if Ukraine really had these goodies, as opposed to engaging in some throat clearing. So it sure looks like Trump is prepared to send Ukraine more arms in return for an empty bag. Yours truly is not expert in these matters.Yet it was pretty obvious Trump and press transcriptionists were out over their skis on “rare earth”. One has to think the Chinese and Russians and many many others are sniggering at yet another display of imperial incompetence. In fairness to RFE/RL, they did go to the trouble of making clear that Trump scheme and mainstream media amplification are barmycakes, and even found a source that could thinly dignify the Trump, erm, misapprehension. We are reposting the entire RFE/RL piece in full below, but here are the key bits. Please note we’ve posted charts and links in comments from Statista that come to essentially the same findings as the RFE/RL source: Those who are not math challenged may have noticed that the Thailand deposits are a full four orders of magnitude smaller than those of China. As Dima of Military Summary is wont to say, “That’s a lot!” And of course, that Ukraine is nowhere on this list. RFE/RL also kindly provided the production ranking: It’s surprising to see the US rank as #2, particularly after all the handwringing about the US having abandoned rare earths mining and processing. For instance, from a 2019 article in Mining.com, How the US lost the plot on rare earths: Unfortunately, the United States Military and dozens of high-tech North American companies are as dependent on China for their rare earth elements as the United Launch Alliance is on Russian-made rockets… Without rare earths mined and processed in China, America would be unable to manufacture military hardware – rare earths are great multipliers they are used in making everything from computer monitors and permanent magnets to lasers, guidance control systems and jet engines. There is no substitute and no other supply source is available other than China. Civilian uses of rare earths would also be put in jeopardy. This includes rare earth elements incorporated into electric vehicle motors, computer chips, fiber-optic cables, flat-screen televisions, wind power turbines and nuclear power, just to name a few uses. In 2010, we posted US Faces Substantial Obstacles to Increasing Rare Earths Production. It discussed both MIT Technology Review and New York Times articles on why the US had ceded rare earths production to China despite having adequate supplies: In fact, the while the [MIT] article does discuss US versus foreign engineering expertise in rare earths mining, it describes in some detail how difficult rare earths mining is in general (more accurately, not the finding the materials part, but separating them out) and the considerable additional hurdles posed by doing it in a non-environmentally destructive manner. Thus the rub is not simply acquiring certain bits of technological know-how, but also breaking further ground in reducing environmental costs. And this issue has frequently been mentioned in passing in accounts of why rare earth production moved to China in the first place. It’s nasty, and advanced economies weren’t keen to do the job. China was willing to take the environmental damage. For instance, the New York Times points out: China feels entitled to call the shots because of a brutally simple environmental reckoning: It currently controls most of the globe’s rare earths supply not just because of geologic good fortune, although there is some of that, but because the country has been willing to do dirty, toxic and often radioactive work that the rest of the world has long shunned. Forgive this digression, but it seemed useful to provide a mini-primer in case this Trump proposal has a longer half-life than it ought to. I am mystified at the US production figures being as high as RFE/RL shows in light of the upset about the US abandonment of the market as recently as 2019. Was there indeed a technology breakthrough? Did Biden provide an environmental waiver that went under the radar? So back to RFE/RL, which provided an almost deadpan statement after the first of the two rare earths charts: Ukraine has substantial amounts of rare earth minerals, according to the Ukrainian Geological Survey. So the same Ukraine propaganda machine that brought us the Ghost of Kiev and most recently, the Trump-amplified claim that Russia has suffered a million deaths in the Ukraine war has apparently been treated as truthful when as far as I can tell, no reputable source on mineral reserves is buying what it is selling. Many commentators have tried to burnish the Trump remarks by saying he likely meant lithium (which is not a rare earth) and other strategic minerals. Wellie, as various commentators have already pointed out, Ukraine has four major lithium deposits, two of which are under Russia’s control. The severity of gnashing of teeth when Russia recently captured the second of these two areas suggests that it represents the largest supply. Readers are encouraged to pipe up. Ukraine has a lot of frackable gas, but over 80% is in Kharkiv or other eastern oblasts. Iron ore and coal are presumably mainly in the east since that’s where the Donbass heavy industry grew up. Ukraine’s black earth (its famed fantastic soil) is both east and west of the Dnieper, but looking at the distribution and type of crops farmed, my impression is that it’s disproportionately in the east (as in the land area east of the Dnieper is roughly a third of the country, but the black earth concentration in the east could plausibly be 50% of the total). And any Ukraine mortgaging of these assets is subject to prior claims, such as nearly 30% of the farmland being owned by oligarchs and/or the likes of BlackRock and Vanguard. And if you think Westerners will come out ahead in a tangle with Ukraine’s oligarchs and the Banderite muscle they hire (as in specialists in the worst sort of torture), I have a bridge I’d like to sell you. Another aside: it’s curious how Trump’s inexact patter repeatedly leads observers to interpret what he must have meant, as if trying to make sense of what a non-native speaker of the language is saying. This turns Trump communication into what Marshall McLuhan called a hot medium, like radio, where you hear words and then often add your own visual images. Hot media are active and engaging. Cold media like TV are passive because little is left to the imagination. But to the big question of where Trump might be going with this “arms for minerals” talk. Here I have to differ with the Duran duo of Alexander Mercouris and Alex Christoforu. If I am representing them correctly, they see proposed bargain as Trump reducing his Ukraine dealings to a transaction. They contend that is being a big downgrade from the Collective West “we’re all in because democracy” patter. That may have been the US position but it was never Trump’s position. Trump campaigned on the claims that the war would never had happened had he been re-elected in 2020 and he could do a deal to wind it up within 24 hours of assuming office. He never was on board with the “Zelensky as Churchill” and other conflict sales patter. Trump’s willingness to entertain continuing to supply Ukraine with more materiel, even on supposedly paid basis, contradicts the former Trump promise to end the war quickly. And it’s a bastard cousin of the Ursula von der Leyen scheme to fund the war by floating bonds backed by the frozen Russian assets. It’s a a very shaky pretext for pretending to lend to Ukraine when the security interest, as they say in the business, can’t be perfected. In reality, any “loans” are subject to eventually being substantially or entirely written down. But the fact that Trump floated this idea does not mean he is serious. It may simply be an effort to create another option, that the US still has a way to continue to supply weapons to Ukraine that Trump can make look palatable to the American public. The reason for doing that would be to try to bolster the weak US position in bargaining with Russia. That’s consistent with the NBC report of divisions in the Trump ranks on Ukraine: that some Trump insiders, like Mike Waltz and Keith Kellogg, want to double down on the failing Biden strategy of pumping more arms into Ukraine to achieve the Mission Impossible of improving their battlefield position before sitting down to talk. By RFE/RL staff. Cross posted from OilPrice There’s already a flurry of diplomatic wrangling, backchannel talks, and public posturing ongoing between Washington, Moscow, and Kyiv, to figure out how to halt the nearly 3-year-old all-out Russian war on Ukraine. Now add this to the mix: U.S. President Donald Trump wants to condition future U.S. aid to Ukraine on getting more access to the country’s valuable “rare earth” minerals — minerals that are in increasing demand for batteries, computers, smart phones, and electric cars, not to mention weaponry. “We’re looking to do a deal with Ukraine where they’re going to secure what we’re giving them with their rare earth and other things,” he told reporters on February 3. “I want to have security of rare earth. We’re putting in hundreds of billions of dollars. They have great rare earth. And I want security of the rare earth, and they’re willing to do it,” he said. The reaction from Ukraine? We’re not opposed. “We are open to the fact, that all of this can be developed together, along with our partners who can help us protect our lands,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Kyiv. “This is absolutely fair. I talked about this in September when we met with President Trump.” So What Is A Rare Earth Mineral, Anyway? Rare earths are a class of about 17 minerals — for example, yttrium, cerium, lanthanum — that are found in trace amounts throughout the Earth’s surface. They’re in increasing demand because of their use in high-tech products. The ongoing race to make batteries smaller and lighter, and more powerful and longer-lasting, involves the use of rare earth minerals. Defense industries also need the minerals for weaponry and related technology. Other rare earth minerals are used as chemical catalysts in magnets, computer drives, or generators. The biggest hurdle for rare earth extraction is that you have to dig up a lot of soil to get an adequate amount of the minerals because they’re in such trace amounts. And then you have to separate out and refine them before you can employ them in technology or machinery. Ukraine has substantial amounts of rare earth minerals, according to the Ukrainian Geological Survey. It also has less-rare, more abundant minerals that are also coveted for use in technology and cutting-edge industries: lithium, for example, which is used widely in batteries of all sorts, and titanium, which is used in airplane manufacturing. Some estimates say the country’s lithium deposits could be valued at billions of dollars. Trump may also have been referring to these minerals; he did not make that clear. For the record, Ukraine also has far greater deposits of other, more common mineral resources — coal, iron ore, oil and gas – which provide major revenues for the country and also major investment opportunities. Many of those resources are located in parts of Ukraine that are occupied by Russian forces — and may ultimately end up under total Russian control. So Why Does Trump Want Them? The race to locate, secure, develop, and monetize rare earth minerals has been accelerating for years now. Estimates of the minerals in North America stand at about 3.6 million tons in United States and more than 14 million tons in Canada, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, and the United States is the second-largest producer in the world after China. Australia and Burma are other major producers. But in 2023, China, which produces about 60 percent of all rare earths in the world and processes nearly 90 percent, rattled global markets when it announced a ban on rare earth extraction and production. That set off alarm bells in the West, where lawmakers and policymakers worried that Western technology would be crippled by a lack of supply of rare earth minerals. China further jolted the discussion on February 3 — the same day Trump spoke to reporters — when it slapped tariffs on a range of U.S. goods in retaliation for tariffs announced over the weekend by Trump. Beijing also imposed export controls on tungsten, tellurium, ruthenium, and molybdenum: critical minerals that are important in high-tech manufacturing but are not categorized as rare earths. Can Trump Really Condition Aid To Ukraine On Access To Rare Earths? Probably. Ukraine is heavily dependent on the United States for the weaponry and equipment that has kept Kyiv in the fight against the Russian invasion. As of September, Congress had appropriated $174.2 billion for Ukraine-related purposes, with the majority of that going to Defense Department and defense-related accounts, according to the Congressional Research Service. Trump, who has made ending the Ukraine conflict a top priority, and his advisers have signaled that part of the negotiations will include enticements and pressure to get Kyiv and Moscow to the negotiating table. Conditioning future U.S. aid on Ukrainian concessions is key to that; convincing Kyiv to give U.S. investors more access to rare earths and critical minerals could be a big part of the calculus. Without U.S. weaponry, Ukraine’s military would buckle amid the grinding onslaughts from the bigger and better-equipped Russian troops. How long before its defenses would collapse outright is unclear. It’s not the first time that Trump conditioned U.S. weaponry on concessions from Ukraine, specifically President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. During his first presidency, Trump was impeached by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives after a phone call with Zelenskyy. In the call, Trump appeared to say he would unfreeze U.S. aid if Zelenskyy reopened an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company whose board included the son of Joe Biden, at the time a former vice president. Lawyers argued a U.S. president has no legal right to withhold funding that has been appropriated by Congress. Trump, who denied any wrongdoing and described the conversation as a “perfect phone call,” was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. This time around, Republicans control both chambers of Congress so it’s unlikely there will be strong congressional pushback on conditioning U.S. aid. Moreover, Trump and his advisers have embraced a more muscular approach to White House decision-making, arguing Congress has less involvement in executive branch decisions. What Does The Kremlin Think About All This? Russia also has substantial rare earth and critical mineral reserves, though its production capacity lags substantially behind China and other countries. Broadly speaking, anything that complicates life for Ukraine is seen as a good thing for Moscow, which knows U.S. weaponry has kept Kyiv in the fight. Russia, which has the upper hand on the battlefield, is doing its own positioning ahead of potential peace negotiations. That includes flattery from President Vladimir Putin. One of the Trump White House bargaining chips has also been the threat to flood Ukraine with even more U.S. weaponry — which would be bad for Russian troops and the Kremlin. Asked by reporters about Trump’s rare earth comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it appeared the White House was looking to make Ukraine pay for aid from Washington. “This is clearly an offer to Ukraine to buy U.S. assistance,” he said. Trump is potentially making another huge blunder here. The first was the awful “Trail of Tears” plan for the Gazans. Any further aid to Ukraine after the last tranche of Biden’s expires (probably in a month or so) ties Trump to this debacle. It will be his baby, and the Dems can rightfully point the finger at him when the videos of helicopters leaving the US embassy with natives clinging to the landing gear come out in 2028. True with a sorta of kaviat – knowing a lot of Trump supports from family, IMO the “what’s in it for us” mentally is noticeable among those I know. Meaning they could care less about ending the war in Ukraine because millions are dead and dying, but because Ukraine has gotten hundreds of billions, while they got nothing from it. But if they get something out of it or at least think they benefit (oil from Syria in return for American boots on the ground thats smart!) they tend to be generally OK with that. So Trump being able to say America will get Lithium as payment for continued support, they might see as shrewd vs the dumb Dems. One possible explanation, and I only researched a little, is that the US is deficient in many of the 17 rare earths, except two https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/critical-metals-investing/rare-earth-investing/rare-earth-metal-production/ states all the US production is “neodymium and praseodymium” from one California mine. The original source is: https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/rare-earths-statistics-and-information which says, for example, that US scandium production has been zero since 1969. Never mind the exotic stuff, recent Chinese moves about tungsten supply will limit the shell production of the west permanently. In the 70’s I met people picking up sugar bags of wolfram up Cape York and this should make it viable again if China persists. Many commentators have tried to burnish the Trump remarks by saying he likely meant lithium (which is not a rare earth) and other strategic minerals. Wellie, as various commentators have already pointed out, Ukraine has four major lithium deposits, two of which are under Russia’s control. The severity of gnashing of teeth when Russia recently captured the second of these two areas suggests that it represents the largest supply. Readers are encouraged to pipe up. I don’t think Trump really knows, or cares, much about Ukrainian lithium, rare earth, or other mineral reserves (except that they exist, and are worth XYZ bucks). I believe he just used the term as buzzword. He likes to sound smart, and this surely made him sound smarter than his “super-hypersonic” improvisation. The four oblasts (and Crimea) annexed by Russia contain an estimated 50% of all mineral wealth in the Ukraine. Another 20% to 25% is in the Dnipropetrovsk oblast. I don’t expect Russia to detour but they could get an easy 5% of the mineral wealth in the form of metal deposits by just taking a bite out of the east side of that oblast. Getting to the Dnieper/Dnipro river and/or besieging Dnipro would net them another 10%. The only other oblast that Russia might end up controlling wold be Kharkiv but that is mainly gas reserves Found this. Ukraine has commercially viable deposits of 117 of the 120 commercially most used metals and 32 out of 34 classed as critical by the EU. 117 out of 120 metals. Biggest commercially viable rare earth deposits in Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Cherkasy. Only Cherkasy is not territory that Russia gets to control (unless it takes over the entire Ukraine). (original url and then to the archived version) https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/28/ukraine-war-russia-resources-energy-oil-gas-commodities-agriculture/ https://archive.ph/mOZ1k 32 out of 34 critical: https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/01/17/ukraine-economy-reconstruction-war-investment-united-states-europe/ https://archive.ph/Dqb2j The United States ranked #2 for rare earth “mineral production” ma be based how production is defined. In this case it appears to be mined as ore, not processed to finished product. The data source for the graph is found here on document page 168: World Mining Data 2022 The data are actually Rare Earth Ore-Content. Once ore is mined it may be ground and processed in a mill with chemicals to produce concentrate. It’s not uncommon for ore concentrate to be sold internationally for final processing. More effort needed to confirm, but this appears to align with Yves’ statement about the US not wanting the environmental damage associated with rare earths (while being deceiving about what’s being produced). I remember being in a department head (head of the whole depot on the Navy base) meeting where when the department head queried a senior lead engineer about getting a robotic painting project done on time, on cost (to which the engineer replied, sure!), he stated that he had higher odds getting his cat to to stack wood on his wood pile. I think that cat will stack multiple wood piles and then randomly type out some Shakespeare before Ukraine makes any refined REE for Trump. Researchers at WVU have developed a process to extract rare earth elements and critical minerals from acid mine drainage. Right now it is a very small scale operation but there is a lot of acid mine drainage throughout the nation that this process might be useful at remediating. https://wvwri.wvu.edu/news/2023/09/13/wvu-s-water-research-institute-receives-additional-11mm-for-rare-earth-research My already probably a year old prediction of how the conflict will end: triumphantly liberated West Ukraine, to be looted till nothing’s left by the West; and the triumphantly protected new Russian People’s Republics of the east, to be looted till nothing’s left by Putin & Friends. In that context it doesn’t matter which and how much resources there really are for Zelenskyy to give up – the deal will be “all known, presumed, and possible” in perpetuity. The local oligarchy will be paid to keep the status quo (… reminds me of Afghanistan and that chopper that couldn’t take off because of all the cash weighing it down…) and whatever’s left of the local plebs will have the sovereign choice of either working for minimal wage for the new bosses, or not working at all (and starving to death). In other words the difference between the Western and the Eastern parts will be only in the wallpaper and western media coverage (West good! East evil!). As such, I’d welcome any and all arguments why and how things can turn up less bleak and medieval… I just don’t see any. Your email address will not be published.

Title: The secretive world of Wall Street technology is opening up like never before
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-open-source-wall-street-technology-ai-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-07T09:01:01Z

Software developers at Morgan Stanley are accustomed to pushback when pitching to build something new. "I tell technologists all the time, if you're building something and it is not a source of competitive advantage, you have to wonder: 'Is this already outside? Should I be using it if I'm not using it? Is there something or a gap that I should be improving and contributing back my improvement?'" Dov Katz, a managing director helping oversee the bank's tens of thousands of developers, told Business Insider. "And only then should you build something net new," he said. Katz was talking about prioritizing open-source technology, which is nonproprietary software that allows developers from all over, including rival companies, to view, collaborate on, and modify the code behind it. The open source-first approach and collaborative attitude is a departure from the hypercompetitive and proprietary nature that Wall Street has come to be known for. But Katz's stance is part of a sea change in the industry as banks, hedge funds, and asset-management firms find more reasons to open up. While revealing secrets is alien to the Wall Street DNA, finance firms have been shedding those conservative notions over the past few years. In that shift, financial institutions are growing to become contributors to open source, not just consumers. As such, the amount of intellectual property flowing into open-source hosting platforms and the number of contributions from financial services professionals continue to rise. Last year, financial services workers contributed more than 750,000 commits, or changes, to GitHub, one of the main platforms for hosting open-source projects, the Fintech Open Source Foundation, an open-source nonprofit for financial services, found. That's a 55% increase from 2021 levels. Around the same time, financial companies from JPMorgan to BlackRock and Man Group also released internal platforms for open source. Wall Street's embrace of open source could be coming at a good time. Global technology spending in banking ballooned to $650 billion in 2023 — roughly the GDP of Belgium or Sweden — an October report from McKinsey said. Despite the steady 9%-a-year average increase in spending, bank shareholders and analysts are still questioning when they're going to see quantifiable value, the report said. Scrutiny comes as finance firms carve out even more resources for artificial intelligence, which can be a costly endeavor. One of the main upsides to leveraging open source is cost efficiency: sharing the burden of development while freeing up engineers to work on other tasks. It could allow firms to be nimbler in the long run, cutting down on their yearslong road maps because outside contributors can make fixes to codebases and introduce features. "Otherwise, you're just building tech debt forever. You're going to have to support something forever if you're building it yourself," Katz said. Goldman Sachs' chief data officer, Neema Raphael, has witnessed this cultural shift over his more than two decades at the bank. Attitudes went "from almost very secretive, we're going to keep everything within" to accepting the benefits of open source with some caution, he said. "Then finally, to like, 'OK, we should actually be a player in this space in the sense that we should also contribute to open source'" and get leverage from that, he added There's momentum at senior levels, Katz said, for engineers to work together to solve common industry problems, and more diverse contributor pools can lead to better solutions. The reasons are not all altruistic, of course. Open source can lower the cost of development and ownership, help with scalability, and even provide some regulatory insulation. It's helped banks speed up integrations with technology vendors and made it easier to share data with clients. There are even ripple effects to engineering retention and job satisfaction, Raphael said, adding that: "Contributing to open source and having your name out there in open source is almost like table stakes." It's hard to talk about Wall Street's adoption of open source without talking about the cloud. Wall Street largely held out on adopting the public cloud, with regulatory uncertainty and security concerns being two big reasons. But that started to change around 2019 and 2020, when the cloud became the place for data and analytics, faster experimentation, and a breeding ground for launching businesses. To reap the benefits of speed and cost efficiency, companies had to adopt a different tool kit and approach compared with developing software on physical servers. That brought many finance firms face-to-face with open-source technologies, like Kubernetes and Docker, which are cornerstones of cloud-native software development. While it's tricky to distill the exact number of commits financial services workers have made on GitHub — company policies and restrictions push developers to use their personal accounts rather than ones tied to their work emails — FINOS's low-ball estimate shows a steady increase. The latest data shows a 26% jump in the number of commits between 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, FINOS last month topped 100 members in a group that includes the four biggest US banks, the hedge fund Point72, American Express, and vendors like public-cloud providers and Nvidia. At the company level, finance firms have also been open-sourcing platforms that were originally developed internally. JPMorgan open-sourced its design platform, Salt, in 2022, Morgan Stanley contributed its Morphir platform that helps business and technology teams collaborate in 2020, and Citi open-sourced GitProxy, a risk and controls tool, the same year. Other examples include Goldman Sachs' key data platform, Legend, and Aladdin, the crown jewel of BlackRock's tech. "Eventually, people, they evolve toward a standard, and competitors realize the benefit of having the standard outweighs being different," Katz said. In many cases, the things being open-sourced are software-development utilities, like methods for writing log files, ways to connect to networks, formulas for linking datasets, or frameworks for testing applications. Katz described them as "trivial commodity capabilities" that aren't core to business or drive value. "You want to test your application? Your IP is the application. How you test it? Much more commodity," he said. At Blackstone, a project is underway to build an open-source library for its portfolio companies in the realm of data management, data engineering, and generative AI, the firm's chief technology officer, John Stecher, told BI. The private equity giant was already spending a considerable amount of its own engineering resources on its own data and AI ambitions. The project, which started about a year ago, aims to give portfolio companies a head start on the engineering legwork while allowing them to pivot engineers to spend time on more meaningful work. Blackstone also benefits since portfolio companies can contribute back to the effort by fixing coding bugs and developing features and functionalities, Stecher said. While there are no direct savings for Blackstone, it should allow portfolio companies to be more effective with fewer engineering resources, he said. The ethos of redeploying engineering talent is one that Stecher prioritizes. "As we go through discussing open source, the more I can pivot engineers away from building functionality that is nonproprietary and duplicative on the Street and just have a smaller set of those engineers build that collaboratively, I can have them focus on delivering much-higher-value work for our clients at the end of the day," he said. Using open source doesn't come without risks, however. One challenge is around licensing, Goldman's Raphael noted. Open-source software is released under specific licenses that have their own set of requirements, like disclosing modifications or not being able to use it for commercial purposes. "We have a full formal governance of what projects are allowed to be in, what vetted licenses are allowed, to make sure that we're not using things inappropriately," Raphael said. Another issue is that because open-source libraries are available to anyone, it's possible for people to try to sneak in bad code that could lead to far-reaching cyberattacks, in what's known as supply-chain attacks. "We take the supply chain of what's actually being used where and which libraries we're using from open source, tracking that also really at a detailed granular level to make sure we know where all the software providence comes from," Raphael said. Now finance firms are even looking to bring the open-source approach to the latest technology frontier on Wall Street: AI. The intersection of generative AI and open source has been on full display ever since the Chinese AI lab DeepSeek rolled out its AI models that are as good as, or even better than, the best products from OpenAI. DeepSeek's offerings have sharply undercut OpenAI on price, shaking up Silicon Valley and Wall Street. The budding rivalry between the two companies has thrown a spotlight on open-source models (like DeepSeek's) versus proprietary approaches (like OpenAI's). Last year, FINOS launched an AI-readiness group that's attracted firms like Citi, Morgan Stanley, and the London Stock Exchange. The effort is designed to create a collaborative environment to develop frameworks and policies around generative AI, related to concerns like mitigating bias in models and adopting new tech. "That's very much an industry problem, not an individual company problem," Katz said. "What better thing than to mutualize it and try to tackle it together." Jump to

Title: Morningstar Discussion about The State of Vanguard in 2025 (Highlights)

My Money Blog As a follow-up to my thoughts on Should I Stay with Vanguard? and their recent expense ratio drop announcement, I recently listened to this 30-minute Morningstar video with Daniel Sotiroff and Susan Dziubinski about the current state of Vanguard in 2025. I think it provided some good additional context. Here are some highlights and brief commentary. Vanguard funds brought in another net $222 billion last year, with the ETFs up $306 billion but the mutual funds losing $84 billion. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF brought in $117 billion all by itself. Vanguard holds over $10 trillion in assets total. Overall, they are not struggling at all. However, with the mutual funds following the industry trends and still losing assets, mutual fund holders should be wary of them being forced to sell positions and create capital gains distributions. This includes foremost their actively-managed mutual funds but possibly eventually their Target Retirement 20XX Funds. Vanguard is rolling out a lot of new bond ETFs. Vanguard Core Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VCRM), a broad US muni-bond ETF. Vanguard Short Duration Tax-Exempt Bond ETF (VSDM), a short-term US muni-bond ETF. Both ETFs launched November 2024. Coming in 2025 are the low-cost index ETFs that hold T-Bills: Vanguard 0-3 Month Treasury Bill ETF (VBIL) and the Vanguard Ultra-Short Treasury ETF (VGUS). Then there is Vanguard Short Duration Bond ETF (VSDB), which is actively-managed and will hold short-term bonds across multiple bond sectors. Vanguard is splitting off their Wealth and Advice division entirely. It will now be completely separate from the Personal Investors division, showing how important it is to the current company. Heading this division will be Joanna Rotenberg, most recently employed at the wealth advice division of Fidelity Investments. As an everyday Vanguard customer, I’m constantly seeing their advice ads to meet with an advisor, but I’m still waiting for them to actually make the product useful. With all these new executives, I guess I’ll have to give them at least another year or two to figure it out. Count me as hopeful on this one. The new CEO from BlackRock, Salim Ramji, has also stated a desire to focus on helping retires to create income from their portfolios. The drawdown period is another big problem in the industry, which I don’t think anyone else has solved yet either. In fact, creating a stable paycheck is even harder than just growing your portfolio over time and accepting the volatility. Count me as skeptical on this front. There is an upcoming virtual Joint Special Meeting of Shareholders on February 26, 2025. Sounds like a good example of “Oh, the fund holders own the company and get a say in things!”, but after looking at the fund proxy vote , it looks like the usual nothing-burger. There’s only one real question on the proxy vote card (the second one is “You gonna go to the meeting?”). They’ve already picked the replacement trustees that they want; it’s not like it’s an election where people are running with different platforms. You basically vote for them all, or withhold your vote against them all. Given the huge institutional holders, I don’t even know if every retail investor voted “against all” that it would actually prevent any of their chosen picks from joining the board. Image credit to Canva AI “HMS Vanguard on hopeful seas at sunrise” I agree with your comments on Vanguard. I’m still with Vanguard (25% of portfolio) and plan to stay unless something negative happens. I liked that Vanguard lowered fees but I’m only in the S&P fund which wasn’t affected. Vanguard lost its way when Tim Buckley took over!!! Their customer service is horrible. I am slowly closing accounts and can’t wait to be out of there. I agree with you 100% about Tim Buckley! Good riddance! I hope the new CEO can repair some of the damage and get Vanguard back on track and restore the level of service. Name * Email * Website Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

Bitcoin would need to match its 2024 surge for that $500K bet to become a reality. What are the odds? While Bitcoin [BTC] faces a bearish pullback driven by macroeconomic uncertainty, Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Asset Research sees a brighter future. In fact, he’s in the news today after he set a bold $500k target for the leading crypto asset before the end of Trump’s presidency. AMBCrypto unpacks the key drivers that could make—or break—this bold prediction. 2025 kicked off with bold predictions – Bitcoin strategic reserves, banks offering BTC services, and a $150k price target. Two months in, BTC’s still under $100k. Clearly, the market’s gone the other way, with investors playing it safe and chasing quick profits. In this environment, a $500k prediction from Standard Chartered might sound a bit too ambitious. However, what grabbed AMBCrypto’s attention? This target was made under Trump’s administration – and there’s a reason behind it. Since November’s elections, BTC has surged by over 30%, with $90k as the average market bottom. To hit $500k, Bitcoin would need a 455% jump before 2028. Source: TradingView (BTC/USD) Looking back, BTC registered gains of 156% in 2024. If it pulls off similar growth in the next few years, Standard Chartered’s bold prediction might just hit the mark. Additionally, Trump’s regulatory shake-up, the SEC overhaul, his dislike of high interest rates, the DOGE cabinet, and a new crypto task force are pushing big targets forward – calling the current volatility as just a “temporary dip.” A big chunk of BTC’s 156% YTD jump is thanks to U.S Spot ETFs, which have pumped billions into Bitcoin. BlackRock (IBIT) alone saw its Bitcoin holdings jump by a staggering 726%, now sitting at 585,393 BTC at press time. Source: BitBo And, it doesn’t stop there – BlackRock is set to launch a Bitcoin ETP (Exchange-Traded Product) in Europe, bringing even more global exposure and a flood of new capital into the market. With all these factors at play, Standard Chartered’s bold Bitcoin prediction is starting to look more like a calculated bet on strong fundamentals, not just speculation. Read Bitcoin’s [BTC] Price Prediction 2025–2026 So, a repeat of the 2024 pump doesn’t seem too far off. But now, it all comes down to whether Trump’s promises are executed swiftly as 2025 plays out. The market is watching closely, especially as the ongoing trade war has already driven many into “extreme” fear.

Will BlackRock replicate the remarkable success of its U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF in Europe? BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager with over $11 trillion in AUM (assets under management), plans to expand its Bitcoin-related exchange-traded products to Europe. According to a Bloomberg report, the fund is likely to be domiciled in Switzerland, and the marketing efforts for the product could kick off as early as this month, per close sources interviewed by the publisher. Commenting on the update, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst noted that the U.S. and Asia currently dominate the BTC ETF market. The analyst also said that Europe isn’t much into ‘hot’ trends. “Europe barely on leaderboard of spot bitcoin ETFs by size.. US spot ETFs only year old and have 91%(!) share of world…If BlackRock brings even some of the US Terrordome over there, should see success, although keep in mind Europeans much less into ‘hot sauce’ than US and certain Asian countries.” Source: X As of this writing, details on the product’s fees were not public yet. That said, BlackRock was among the first issuers to get approval to launch a U.S. spot BTC ETF in early 2024. The product, iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), has been most successful both crypto scene and across traditional markets, too. As of the 4th of February, IBIT had amassed over 585.3K BTC, worth nearly $58 billion based on press time market prices. Source: iShares Interestingly, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink has also doubled down on BTC. He reiterated that it was the best asset of choice for anyone seeking refuge from fiat debasement (inflation) or political instability. In fact, during the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, he stated, “If you’re frightened of the debasement of your currency, or… of the economic or political stability of your country, you can have an internationally based instrument called Bitcoin that will overcome those local fears.. BTC could be $500k, $600k, $700k” Disclaimer: AMBCrypto's content is meant to be informational in nature and should not be interpreted as investment advice.

The layer-1 Ondo Chain—a product of Ondo Finance, which works to tokenize assets—will work “to accelerate the creation of institutional-grade financial markets on-chain,” according to a statement. And Team Trump immediately jumped on the bandwagon: Data from Arkham Intelligence showed that a wallet linked to the President Trump-backed World Liberty Financial project scooped up $470,000 worth of the project’s native ONDO tokens. 1/ Today, we’re thrilled to announce Ondo Chain, our new Layer 1 blockchain purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs. Design advisors for the chain include new members of the Ondo Ecosystem: Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, WisdomTree, Google Cloud, ABN Amro, Aon,… pic.twitter.com/a35GHB7OFW — Ondo Finance (@OndoFinance) February 6, 2025 World Liberty Financial is a crypto project providing borrowing and lending services. It has the heavy backing of the Trump brand; the president’s son announced its launch back in August, and the president himself has promoted the project. Following the purchase, Donald Trump Jr. was announced as the surprise closing speaker at Thursday's Ondo Summit event. Ondo Finance said that top asset managers will be able to tokenize their assets leading to more transparency, less fraud, and the opportunity for clients to earn yield. It added that Franklin Templeton, Wellington Management, WisdomTree, and Google Cloud served as “design advisors” for the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chain. We’re delighted to announce our surprise closing speaker at the Ondo Summit: Donald Trump Jr.(@DonaldJTrumpJr)! 🇺🇸 The future of RWAs in the US is bright, and new leadership has the potential to make the US the global center for crypto. We look forward to hearing Donald Trump… pic.twitter.com/Pl4G4aWdZg — Ondo Finance (@OndoFinance) February 6, 2025 “We believe that Ondo Chain represents a significant step forward in the evolution of institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure,” Thursday’s statement read. The Ethereum-based ONDO is now the 33rd biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $4.3 billion, CoinGecko shows. Institutions in the traditional finance world have been banging the RWA drum for some time now. BlackRock boss Larry Fink praised Ethereum for how it would lead to the tokenization of financial markets, while Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson has said that the technology of securities will change thanks to the blockchain. “[Blockchain] technology is going to open up a lot of really interesting types of investment opportunities,” Johnson said last year.
