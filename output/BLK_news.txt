In the transaction, CoreWeave's existing stakeholders are selling shares to outside investors. Bloomberg reported last month that CoreWeave was targeting a $23 billion valuation for the deal, up from $19 billion in a $1.1 billion investment round announced in May. CoreWeave is going head-to-head with large cloud infrastructure providers, such as Amazon and Google in providing Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, to companies for AI workloads. The startup got a big boost last year, when Nvidia made an investment, and another stamp of approval after Microsoft enlisted the company as a third-party cloud provider. Investors have been eager to sink money into companies that are enabling generative AI, which can create text, images and videos in response to a few words of human input. The frenzy began after Microsoft-backed OpenAI's ChatGPT went viral in late 2022 and led to soaring demand for compute power. "We are a company that is one of the few companies in the world that's able to bring on this kind of infrastructure at the scale that's required to actually make a difference," CoreWeave co-founder and CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC's "Squawk Box" in July. The following month Nvidia said its H200 GPUs had become available through CoreWeave, meaning the startup was the first cloud provider to reach general availability with the graphics cards. CoreWeave has raised $14 billion, a spokesperson said. In May, the company said it had raised $7.5 billion in fresh debt. In October, it announced a $650 million credit line. Last week, bitcoin mining company Core Scientific said CoreWeave had signed up for 500 megawatts worth of data center capacity in a deal that could be worth up to $8.7 billion over 12 years. In addition to Cisco and Pure, investment firms including BlackRock, Coatue and Fidelity participated in CoreWeave's secondary sale.

Title: ‘Recipe for Ethereum to reach $10K’ – How ETFs can help ETH soar

Bankless’ co-founder believes that buy pressure on ETH from ETFs has yet to materialize. On the 12th of November, Ethereum [ETH] ETFs broke new ground, finally tipping total net flows into positive territory—for the first time since their launch. Source: SoSo Value Data from SoSo Value revealed a daily net inflow of $135.92 million, pushing cumulative inflows to $94.62 million. Trading activity also ramped up, with a total value of $582.18 million traded and total net assets climbing to $9.67 billion. Of the nine ETFs, five saw inflows. Meanwhile, only Grayscale Ethereum Trust [ETHE] recorded outflows, with the remaining funds showing no new inflows. The latest development caught the attention of industry leaders on X (formerly twitter). Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, highlighted the net positive flows mark a significant milestone for ETH ETFs given they have, “Overcome $3.2bil in outflows from ETHE.” Additionally, Geraci pointed out that 19 of the top 50 ETF launches this year are linked to Bitcoin [BTC], ETH, or MicroStrategy, with 12 among the top 18—an impressive figure out of 610 total launches. Furthermore, iShares’ Ethereum Trust [ETHA] ranked as the 6th top ETF launch of 2024 Bankless co-founder Ryan Sean Adams also commented on the development. He noted that ETHE’s dominant outflows essentially offset any upward pressure from ETFs. However, as inflows turn positive for the first time, this might signal a shift. Adams even forecasted that this shift is a “Recipe for an ETH rocket to $10k.” This latest milestone comes a day after the ETFs experienced a record-breaking day on 11th November, registering $295 million in inflows. This influx, led by industry giants like Fidelity and BlackRock, marked nearly triple the previous peak of $106.6 million recorded on launch day. Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst, noted on X that ETFs were, “Trending in right direction.” The analyst further anticipated a positive trend for the ETFs, stating, “Sunny days ahead, although still several country miles behind BTC ETFs.” Meanwhile, BTC ETFs also hit a record of their own. Balchunas revealed on X that Bitcoin ETFs crossed the $90 billion mark in assets under management, following a substantial $6 billion increase. This comprised $1 billion in new inflows and $5 billion in market appreciation. This surge means that Bitcoin ETFs were now 72% of the way toward surpassing gold ETFs in total assets. Source: Eric Balchunas/X In a further sign of demand, IBIT reached $1 billion in trading volume within just 25 minutes—faster than the previous day, when it went on to break an all-time record. Balchunas described the sustained interest in BTC ETFs as a “feeding frenzy” that shows no signs of slowing down.

Title: Are You Not Entertained
URL: https://twincities.eater.com/2024/11/13/24284793/eatertainment-boom-success-restaurants-entertainment-pickleball-smash-park

Bad shots and deep thoughts on the pickleball courts, mini golf courses, and axe-throwing pitches of the new eatertainment If you buy something from an Eater link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics policy. I learned too late that axe throwing is a serious game — in my mind it had always been a concept; a bit of lumberjack cosplay. But there I was at Smash Park in suburban Roseville, Minnesota, knee-deep in an arduous lunge, arcing a dull-edged hatchet behind my head; eyes narrowed. To my left, our assigned coach, Wolfgang, was lunging beside me, rocking back and forth in his fat-tongued hiking boots, demonstrating the art of a devastating throw. My axe hit the outer rings of the bullseye, a red-and-white screen image projected onto a sensor-calibrated plywood board. My avatar, a lion wearing a red flannel shirt, flashed onto the screen: two points. Smash Park offers far more than axe throwing: At 30,000 square feet, it’s a multiplex of duckpin bowling, party darts, shuffleboard, karaoke, cornhole, and pickleball. It’s one of the emergent brands in the “eatertainment” sector, a growing category of venues that offer both entertainment and (variably) restaurant-caliber food: Smash Park, for example, distinguishes itself from bowling alley burgers and the like with considered dishes like Frito pie, barbecue sampler platters, and Bang Bang Shrimp. Eatertainment has taken off nationally in the past few years, and in the Twin Cities, it’s having somewhat of a hyper-local boom: In the past year and a half, we’ve welcomed Smash Park; Puttery, a labyrinthine, adults-only mini-golf bar in the North Loop; and now Puttshack, a high-tech mini-golf complex freshly open in Edina, with another planned for Minneapolis. It’s a fair bet that more will follow: Eatertainment brands from Dave & Buster’s to Chicken N Pickle to Pinstripes are rapidly expanding, reshaping our eating, drinking, and entertainment landscapes as they inch toward ubiquity. Smash Park’s flagship is in Des Moines, Iowa. Its founder, Monty Lockyear, is a former marketing executive and early pickleball prospector. Pickleball, of course, is the brand’s main attraction: The evening I visited, Smash Park was hosting a reunion for former players of the Minnesota Vikings and their families, and a quartet of graying ex-football players were deftly dinking back-and-forth across the nets in the indoor gymnasium. The building has the cavernous feel of a waterpark, but is partitioned into areas for eating, drinking and playing: There’s a small bowling alley; a narrow, neon-lit arcade packed with teenagers; an all-season cornhole green abutting a plush lounge area, where couples were mingling and clutching cocktails; a vast outdoor space with yard games where a happy hour crowd gathered. Kelly Sims, vice president of marketing at Smash Park, told me that the company’s target demographic is pretty broad, though it has three main archetypes: the athlete, the “21-plus” customer, and the family. Private events like bachelorette parties and corporate team-building are a big hit, too. Eatertainment isn’t a new phenomenon: Its roots lie in the frenetic arcade ethos of Dave & Buster’s and Chuck E. Cheese; even the misty, fantastical universe of the Rainforest Cafe. But today’s eatertainment has an accelerated, self-serious feel, perhaps driven by increasing competition in the sector to up the ante — to offer an experience more flashy, more distinctly marketable than the next. Take the food: Level 99, a 40,000-square-foot puzzle room complex in Providence, Rhode Island, has a built-in “scratch kitchen” that serves, among other dishes, a brown-butter three-cheese popcorn. Simulated auto racing venue F1 Arcade offers an entire raw bar, including a $129 seafood tower. Even casual eatertainment menus have a studied feel: Puttshack, promising a “culinary journey of global flavors,” has an encyclopedic appetizer list of Lebanese hummus, poutine, Persian chicken skewers, Thai fried chicken, Korean barbecue buns, and chorizo empanadas. As far as entertainment goes, new-wave eatertainment seems to either lean into a garden-of-delights approach, like Smash Park, offering a slew of activities, or to augment classic games with technology: Puttshack, which comes from the founders of Topgolf, uses a similar “Trackaball” technology that automates scorekeeping; Hijingo in the U.K. offers “multi-sensory futuristic bingo” with light shows and live dancers. At ping pong social club Spin, customers can compete against a robot named “Spinny,” an AI opponent with an unfailing serve. An astonishing amount of money has poured into eatertainment in the past few years: Investors run the gamut from nascent venture capital firms to restaurant industry executives to behemoth investment companies like Blackrock. Even pro athletes are cashing in: Puttery received a $10 million investment from pro golfer Rory McIlroy; Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes invested in Chicken N Pickle. Like the rest of the hospitality industry, eatertainment was majorly disrupted by pandemic shutdowns, but it has ballooned in the years since: Take entrepreneur Robert Thompson, who dipped out as CEO of Punch Bowl Social shortly before the business filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020. Three years later, he secured no less than $200 million for his new pickleball venue, Camp Pickle. Then there’s the Emerging Fund, a growth capital fund backed by 30-some hospitality veterans that funds “early-stage” eatertainment and restaurant tech brands. After launching in March of 2023, it raised $52 million in its first six months. What makes eatertainment such an attractive investment? There are the stats: People are dining out less these days, and eatertainment offers two-for-one brand appeal, giving consumers (ostensibly) more bang for their buck by pairing food with entertainment. There’s growing interest in the sector, with certain brands seeing anywhere from 20 to 50 percent traffic increases in the past few years, as Restaurant Business Magazine reports. Other factors make eatertainment a particularly viable business model: Some brands, like Puttshack and Pinstripes, manage to leverage deals with landlords, who are enticed by the venues’ large footprints and high foot traffic potential; others, depending on their model, are able to lower labor costs by employing counter service or self-serve models like beer walls. And, as Restaurant Business Magazine and Restaurant Dive have reported, eatertainment brands often benefit from a relatively high profit margin on the activity portion of the venue, augmenting the revenue earned from food and drink. Puttshack, for example, charges just $14 per person for a round of mini-golf, but Susan Walmesley, the company’s chief operating and marketing officer, confirmed for me that about half the brand’s revenue comes from the game. These factors give eatertainment an edge over traditional restaurant models, helping to facilitate their expansion into new markets. But there’s more to eatertainment’s success than enviable profit margins. The prevailing narrative I found in my reporting is that consumers, having emerged from the isolation and social misery of the pandemic, are craving experience: They want to feel, to connect, to “get a little weird and playful again” after a somber few years. The project of eatertainment, then, is to create an “experience economy,” or even, as Camp Pickle CEO Robert Thompson puts it, a “joy economy.” Eatertainment venues are more than destinations for date nights and office parties; far more than the rudimentary arcades and bowling alleys of eras past: Resting on three axes of pleasure (food, drink, and play), they offer a seamless, satisfying, and bonafide human “experience.” Sims and Smash Park operations director Kristin Kroeger, for example, emphasized to me that Smash Park’s true appeal lies not just in pickleball but in the brand’s combined activities, full bar, “scratch-made kitchen,” and premise of social interaction, all of which alchemize into a single “legendary experience.” I saw what they meant — Smash Park was bumping Bruno Mars as we wandered past the bar and the cornhole green, carpeted with emerald turf; we sipped idly on boozy pink slushies and peered into the private karaoke rooms. The games seemed to me like an absurd and decadent assortment of candy; a manufactured sugar rush. When our axe-throwing time slot arrived, we were ushered to our designated lane. Hurling the axe at the target gave me a thrill at first — I hit a bullseye and screamed — but it waned to a lull as my arms tired; as my aim grew methodical and labored. Between throws, I found myself hypnotized by the flat screen TVs posted around the room, flashing through a Rolodex of event advertisements: Game of Thrones trivia; ’90s name-that-song; a glow-in-the-dark “Dink and Drink” party planned for Saturday night. A queasy feeling began to set in, an emptiness I remembered from playing The Sims as a kid — the sense that I, myself, had set foot in the game. On the outdoor pickleball court, we squinted against the hazy sunshine and batted the ball back-and-forth across the net, debating whether to order the “Big Mule,” a 192-ounce Moscow mule served in a pumpkin-sized copper mug. I realized, gazing above the edge of the pickleball fence at the flat, powdery sky, that what unsettled me about Smash Park — about the eatertainment concept as a whole — was exactly the thing it advertises: its promise of fun; of play; of joy so seamlessly orchestrated, less an “experience” than the simulation of one. If eatertainment has boomed post-pandemic, I find it less likely that we are reimmersing ourselves in the world and more likely that we are retreating further from it, escaping into realities more palatable, more entertaining, than our own. That Friday night, we sat outside and listened to the live music provided for the evening: an affable, dad-aged guy with a guitar, a quarter-zip, and a honeyed voice. We hummed along to Pure Prairie League and munched on our garlic fries. Then he played Van Morrison’s “Brown Eyed Girl” and made a lyrical substitution: “And whatever happened / to Tuesday and so slow / going down to Smash Park with a / transistor radio.” He was being funny, and we laughed, but in my periphery I saw the sky cave a little; hardening like the edges of a snowglobe. At Smash Park, all roads lead to the same place. Additional photo illustration credits: Mini golf image by Puttshack Sign up for our newsletter. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops.

Title: Zelensky’s nuclear option: Ukraine ‘months away’ from bomb

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/13/2024 8:52:37 AM PST by marcusmaximus Ukraine could develop a rudimentary nuclear bomb within months if Donald Trump withdraws US military assistance, according to a briefing paper prepared for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. The country would quickly be able to build a basic device from plutonium with a similar technology to the “Fat Man” bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945, the report states. “Creating a simple atomic bomb, as the United States did within the framework of the Manhattan Project, would not be a difficult task 80 years later,” the document reads. With no time to build and run the large facilities required to enrich uranium, wartime Ukraine would have to rely instead on using plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods taken from Ukraine’s nuclear reactors. Ukraine still controls nine operational reactors and has significant nuclear expertise despite having given up the world’s third largest nuclear arsenal in 1996. The report says: “The weight of reactor plutonium available to Ukraine can be estimated at seven tons … A significant nuclear weapons arsenal would require much less material … the amount of material is sufficient for hundreds of warheads with a tactical yield of several kilotons.” Such a bomb would have about one tenth the power of Fat Man, the document’s authors conclude.

Seriously. Russia has the same reputation as China when it comes to honesty, and when it comes to proper maintenance of older equipment. Russia doesn't have any new nukes, and their military budget is one eleventh the size of ours. AND they've been losing men and materiel for 2 years now, while failing to take Kiev. They need to spend money on maintaining and replacing those losses, they need to spend money and resources on pretending to have a military that compares to ours, AND they're going to maintain the largest number of warheads on earth??? (5500 to our 5000). On only 9% of our budget??? Color me highly skeptical that they have more than a handful of VIABLE nuclear missiles. They seem a lot more like a paper tiger thees days, while getting their tails kicked by an unarmed Ukraine. 17 posted on 11/13/2024 9:19:28 AM PST by Teacher317 [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 14 | View Replies] To: marcusmaximus A bomb 1/10 the power of the WWII bombs is hardly outside the range of bigger conventional weapons.

The report says: “The weight of reactor plutonium available to Ukraine can be estimated at seven tons … A significant nuclear weapons arsenal would require much less material … the amount of material is sufficient for hundreds of warheads with a tactical yield of several kilotons.” Such a bomb would have about one tenth the power of Fat Man, the document’s authors conclude.

What a sad indictment of the Ukraine. 80 years after Americans invented the nuclear bomb with slide rules with no guarantee that the science was sound in the middle of WS2 and the Ukes can only build a dirty bomb with 1/10th the power of the Fat Man bomb? What a shortbus country. They and you are ridiculous. Those with your mentality have us closer to WW III and nuclear war than we ever were during the Cold War.

As far as I am concerned this would be the best and quickest resolution. Ukraine as a country is already destroyed because the men are gone, the only thing left is for it to be divided up between the Russia and Blackrock. If so, the little GloboHomoPedoNazi Faggot will detonate it in downtown Kiev. If so, the little GloboHomoPedoNazi Faggot will detonate it in downtown Kiev.

No - they will bomb the bejeezus out of Ukraine so that they CAN’T do it again. Ever. Needless to say, MANY people will die. And each of the several Russian missiles fired in response to this single futile effort would be much more powerful than the Fat Man with thousands of missiles still held in reserve. Unless the Russian response is extraordinarily disproportionate, the Western response is likely some stern talk to the Russians and a statement to the Ukraine saying that was a stupid move on your part and you'd be wise to end this war now.

LOLOL!! What Kuks doink? It looks like the security assurances have been violated, so why shouldn't Ukraine get nukes back? Are we SURE about that? Seriously. Russia has the same reputation as China when it comes to honesty, and when it comes to proper maintenance of older equipment. Russia doesn't have any new nukes, and their military budget is one eleventh the size of ours. AND they've been losing men and materiel for 2 years now, while failing to take Kiev. They need to spend money on maintaining and replacing those losses, they need to spend money and resources on pretending to have a military that compares to ours, AND they're going to maintain the largest number of warheads on earth??? (5500 to our 5000). On only 9% of our budget??? Color me highly skeptical that they have more than a handful of VIABLE nuclear missiles. They seem a lot more like a paper tiger thees days, while getting their tails kicked by an unarmed Ukraine. Color me highly skeptical that they have more than a handful of VIABLE nuclear missiles. They seem a lot more like a paper tiger thees days, while getting their tails kicked by an unarmed Ukraine. A bomb 1/10 the power of the WWII bombs is hardly outside the range of bigger conventional weapons. It would not be a game changer against the entrenchments and armor of the enemy on the battlefront (being comparable to the mine the Germans blew up a ridge with in WWI that hardly moved the front line), and would only do enough damage against a Russian city to piss them off and horrify the rest of the planet. This is what desperation sounds like. The article says “develop” a bomb, not USE one. Ukraine had the 3rd largest stockpile in the world just 30 years ago. And we are obligated by treaty to use nukes against anyone that uses nukes against Ukraine. The US did not want nukes in Ukrainian hands for very good reasons. We also violated Budapest by meddling in Ukraine’s internal affairs and via economic coercion.

Title: ‘If I look back to my teenage years, there’s definitely an introvert there’ – Brian O’Driscoll opens up about his childhood

Full Content:
Ireland legend Brian O'Driscoll Brian O’Driscoll has opened up about being "anxious” and not confident” as an introverted teenager and being “on the bench” as a teen before becoming the captain of the Irish rugby team. The former Ireland star has also spoken about what it’s like being on the sidelines with his former teammate Leinster Jonny Sexton at their children’s rugby games. He has revealed he was “anxious” and “not confident” as a teenager and was more of an introvert than his peers and becoming a team captain was a “major shock” to him. "I was the quiet one, happy to never be a ringleader. And that’s why the captaincy was such a weird part to be thrust upon me because I never saw myself in that role,” he told Roasted with Mark Moriarty. “I never captained any underage teams and all of a sudden it was kind of from obscurity that I was chosen to be national captain having no experience previously. "It might have been a shock to everybody else but it was a major shock to me – I definitely didn’t feel I had the qualities or attributes needed to be a good captain and there was so much to learn when I started out. “You've got to find your own way in everything you do. It was a real work for me to understand who I was going to be as a captain, as a leader. “I didn’t make school teams at 15, I was on the bench at 17 in Blackrock. Different things happen for people at different times,” he added. The Dubliner described himself as a “skilful” and “talented” child but his “nervousness” was a challenge for him. However, the rugby star thinks his middle son is braver than him on the rugby field. "I probably would have been afraid of my own shadow as a 14 or 15-year-old. My middle child, who's a keen rugby enthusiast, he's a lot braver than me. “He must have his mother’s toughness because I was nervous about making tackles,” he said. He said that his dad Frank O’Driscoll and himself are “dissimilar in some way” and that his dad is “probably more outgoing than him”. “If I look back to my teenage years, there's definitely an introvert there,” he said. "That then came out as a result of captaincy around rugby, about being projected into the public domain and so all of a sudden, there's another part of your personality comes out or has to come out.” O’Driscoll and his friend and fellow former rugby player Johnny Sexton stand on the sidelines together as their children play in the same club of St Mary’s. Both former rugby stars like to keep quiet while watching their sons play. “I'm not my dad in that regard, my dad was so vocal, I used to be like: ‘Please, be the second loudest dad’. You can still do your thing. "I am very conscious I don’t say anything. What makes it even more challenging is that myself and Sexton’s boys are on the same team so the two of us are on the sideline together. "Neither of us say a whole lot. We just watch and see what’s going on, let them enjoy it. There’s so much: ‘Would you like your son to be a professional rugby player?’. Let them enjoy it, see where it goes,” he added.

Title: BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF hits $40 billion, sets new record in 211 days

BlackRock has done it again. This time its IBIT spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has hit a record of over $41 billion in net assets in 211 days. News of the milestone comes two weeks after BlackRock reached $30 billion in net assets in 293 days at the end of October. Posting on X in October, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, said what BlackRock has achieved is an “all-time record,” adding “the old record was $JEPI which did it in 1,272 days. $GLD took 1,790 days. Unreal.” With BlackRock’s new achievement, it’s surpassed the previous record of 1,253 days held by iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, according to Balchunas. In a post on X, he said: “[BlackRock’s] now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years.” JUGGERNAUT: $IBIT has hit the $40b asset mark (a mere two wks after hitting $30b) in a record 211 days, annihilating prev record of 1,253 days held by $IEMG. It's now in Top 1% of all ETFs by assets and at 10mo old it is bigger than all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past TEN years. pic.twitter.com/WTATlpShUq — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) November 13, 2024 Now, BlackRock holds more than 467,000 Bitcoin, valued at $41.8 billion, according to iShares data. The new record comes as Bitcoin reached an all-time high of over $93,000 on November 13 in a continued rally that’s showing no signs of slowing. The upward trajectory is partly due to Donald Trump being re-elected as US President earlier this month. Following news of his win, Bitcoin broke the $75,000 mark. It then passed $82,000, and continued to $84,000, before pushing to $87,000 earlier this week. In September, Bernstein analysts predicted that Bitcoin would surge to between $80,000 and $90,000 if Trump won the US election. With that prediction having now passed, Bernstein analysts believe Bitcoin could reach $200,000 in 2025, urging investors to “buy everything they can.” It remains to be seen how far Bitcoin will go, but for now, it’s showing no signs of slowing down.

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed $40 billion in assets under management just 211 days after its launch. The fund has ascended to the top 1% of all ETFs in terms of assets, outpacing all 2,800 ETFs launched in the past decade, said Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The achievement shatters the previous record of 1,253 days held by the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, a BlackRock-managed fund that tracks the investment results of an index composed of large-, mid-, and small-capitalization companies in emerging markets. At just 10 months old, IBIT has also grown larger than its Gold ETF counterpart, the iShares Gold Trust (IAU), which currently holds around $32.3 billion in assets. Since its January debut, IBIT has netted approximately $29 billion in net inflows, Farside Investors data shows. The surge in Bitcoin’s price, fueled by factors like Trump’s election victory and potential regulatory changes, has driven demand for IBIT, as well as other Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin just set a new record high of $93,000 at the time of reporting, per CoinGecko. The leading crypto asset has surpassed Saudi Aramco to become the world’s 7th largest asset, according to Companies Market Cap. The latest achievement comes just days after Bitcoin overtook silver’s position. The pace of Bitcoin ETF accumulation has accelerated following Trump’s reelection, with a massive $2.8 billion being poured into IBIT in the last four trading days. The group of US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively attracted over $4 billion in net inflows. In a Tuesday statement, Balchunas suggested that these funds are nearing the estimated Bitcoin holdings of Satoshi Nakamoto, potentially surpassing the creator of Bitcoin by Thanksgiving. Market analysts expect continued inflows into Bitcoin ETFs, supported by the positive sentiment surrounding the crypto markets and potential future developments.

Election 2024 coverage presented by BlackRock, the world's largest asset-management company, said it is bringing its tokenized real-world asset fund to five more blockchains, taking it beyond Ethereum and expanding access to the largest money-market fund token. The BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), issued in partnership with tokenization platform Securitize, is now accessible on the Aptos, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism's OP Mainnet and Polygon networks, the company said on Wednesday. Tokenization of real-world assets is one of the hottest trends at the intersection of crypto and traditional finance. Digital asset firms and global financial heavyweights are racing to put instruments such as government bonds, private credit and funds on blockchain rails, aiming to achieve faster settlements and operational efficiencies. "We wanted to develop an ecosystem that was thoughtfully designed to be digital and take advantage of the advantages of tokenization," Securitize CEO and co-founder Carlos Domingo said in a statement. "With these new chains we'll start to see more investors looking to leverage the underlying technology to increase efficiencies on all the things that until now have been hard to do."

The BUIDL token is backed by short-term U.S. government bonds and its price is anchored to $1. Institutions and protocol treasuries use the product to park their on-chain cash to earn a yield or as collateral for trading, while other decentralized finance protocols such as Ondo Finance build their products on top of it. BUIDL has raked in over $520 million of deposits, becoming the largest product in the $2.3 billion tokenized U.S. Treasury market, rwa.xyz data shows. BUIDL's management fee on Ethereum, Arbitrum and Optimism is 50 basis points. It is cheaper — only 20 basis points — on Aptos, Avalanche and Polygon. Ecosystem development organizations Aptos Foundation, Avalanche (BVI), Inc. and Polygon Labs BD Investments (Cayman) Ltd. each agreed to pay BlackRock a quarterly fee. Edited by Sheldon Reback.

Yesterday, gardaí, assisted by members from the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau, as well as colleagues from Europol, executed a search warrant at an address in Blackrock. The investigation relates to a large-scale operation of alleged money laundering and follows a number of international complaints into various forms of alleged online fraud. An investigation team was established in the DMR East garda district as a result and suspicious activity was identified in a number of bank accounts. This included money transactions from hundreds of bank accounts from over 15 countries across Europe, suspected to be the proceeds of crime and ‘money mule’ transactions. A ‘money mule’ is a person who allows their bank account to be used for the transfer of another person’s stolen or illegal money.

They mean more neoliberalism through more social spending cuts and privatizations due to lack of funds and more war on the working class. Any threat posed by Trump (and the Biden administration or whoever comes after Trump) is the result of the very real crises of Europe’s overdependence on the US and energy prices hurting industry, but those are deemed necessary to deal with the fake crises. Has the reemergence of the bad orange man caused any rethink about the EU strategy to “de-risk” from Russia and China and put itself at the mercy of Washington? Or are Europeans falling over themselves with pledges to increase defense spending? It’s the latter. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, as usual, takes the cake. She managed to come up with a plan that would shoot the EU in both feet with her idea to buy even more gas from the US. This would increase dependence on the US while simultaneously doing even more to wreck the economies of EU states. Here’s Politico with the details: Stressing that the EU still buys significant amounts of energy from Russia, von der Leyen asked: “Why not replace it by American LNG, which is cheaper for us and brings down our energy prices? It’s something where we can get into a discussion, also [where] our trade deficit is concerned.” During the first Trump term, Juncker avoided more tariffs by assuring the U.S. president that Europe would facilitate more imports of liquefied natural gas (and more American soybeans.) In fact, the European Commission has no real power in determining European companies’ purchases of LNG and soybeans, but Trump was happy to accept the political theater of parading data that European purchases were going up. There is no evidence that American LNG is cheaper, as von der Leyen is quoted as saying. It’s actually a lot more expensive than the pipeline Russian gas Europe used to get. And the European Commission does have some power in determining European companies’ purchases of LNG through its sanction powers. And the Commission doesn’t have the power to dictate purchases yet. Due to recent crises, EU member states added new instruments to Ursula’s toolbox during her first five-year term, such as the Foreign Subsidies Regulation, International Procurement Instrument, an Anti-Coercion Instrument, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, and the EU Critical Raw Materials Act. Maybe the latest Trump crisis will add another tool to her toolbox. One gets the feeling that Ursula is intentionally trying to do economic damage to bloc nations in order to increase the odds she gets her coveted eurobonds. If there’s another crisis — or series of crises — she might get the chance. Countries having to throw more money at the energy crisis and shrinking GDPs could struggle to pay more for defense, which would lead to more calls for joint borrowing. Some background on the idea from Euractiv: This miracle happened during the eurozone crisis when the EU created a legal instrument, the European Financial Stability Facility, able to issue bonds and with a lending capacity of €440 billion. And with the COVID pandemic, the miracle was repeated as the EU adopted a recovery fund with a firepower of €750 billion, financed through common debt issuance. The same line of thinking has inspired politicians to imagine defence bonds – to finance a major boost of the EU’s defence capabilities, after years of neglect when it was assumed that war was a thing of the past or that Uncle Sam would always come to the EU’s defence… Speaking at the European Defence Agency annual conference on 30 November, [European Council President Charles] Michel said EU member states should pool what could amount to €600 billion in defence investment over the next 10 years… A couple of weeks later, French President Emmanuel Macron returned to the topic, telling investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos that Europe should resort to joint debt to finance its priorities, including defence. In the ensuing months the argument for joint debt has come to include remedies for other EU problems. European heads of state met in Budapest last week with a focus on competitiveness. That’s the buzzword these days. Europe isn’t competitive enough. Mario Draghi was there pushing his sham solutions from the standard neoliberal playbook. Just consider the following. If you are worried about competitiveness do you: Of course none of this was discussed in Budapest. National leaders instead opted for minor measures and slogans like “ensuring industrial renewal and decarbonization,” “increasing preparedness and defence capabilities,” and “putting Europe at the forefront of global research and innovation.” They’re all empty phrases without the money and some semblance of a strategy to back them up. The EU is, however, planning to redirect billions to defense from its social cohesion funds. How much remains to be seen, and there are tradeoffs. That money used to be earmarked to reduce economic disparities and promote development. EU capitals will now have more “flexibility” to spend the funds to support their defense industries and military projects. According to the FT, only about five percent of the 392 billion euros allocated for 2021-2027 has been spent to date. While Ursula and company didn’t get common EU debt yet, the crises are only picking up steam. And it should be noted that redirected social cohesion funds is considered one of the final emergency steps before turning to the joint EU debt. Ursula is unlikely to let it go as it’s the top goal of her second term. It was only in March of this year that the idea of joint borrowing for defense was considered “radical.” Now surrounded by fake crises and self-inflicted real ones, the idea is gaining trans-Atlantic traction. Let’s not forget that international finance is a big fan of the joint debt for defense plan. Since member states are running into budgetary constraints, investors are using the fiscal rules imposed by Brussels to push for an EU-wide bond program that would bring them big-time profits while allowing the bloc to ramp up military spending without individual nations incurring more debt. Much of Europe supports joint borrowing because in theory, there could be benefits to common debt, especially for countries like Italy which face higher borrowing costs, but going down that road to pay for the US empire ain’t it. The two staunchest opponents to joint debt are Germany and the Netherlands. Are they prepared to withstand the pressure from financial powers, the Trump administration, and much of Europe? The signs aren’t encouraging. The Dutch are currently killing Europe’s most valuable tech firm at the behest of the Americans for some pyrrhic and temporary victory against China. Germany might soon be led by a former board member of BlackRock, Friedrich Merz, which will be a nebulous plus, according to Politico: Scholz’s woes may have a silver lining for some: In Budapest, some diplomats suggested that the collapse of Germany’s ruling coalition and Merz becoming chancellor might not be a bad thing. Merz “is a former MEP so more engaged on European affairs,” said one EU diplomat who was granted anonymity to speak freely. “He’s also from the EPP, so the same family as the dominant force in [the European] Parliament, also the same family as von der Leyen, which can help at a time like this. The Logic Behind More Defense Spending As the FT notes, and all the media stories do the same, ‘Trump warned Nato allies earlier this year that as president he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” if alliance members failed to meet their defence spending target.’ Yet even if Moscow wanted to invade Europe (there’s no sign it does nor any reason it would want to) what are all these extra billions going to do that all the billions and all the West’s military hardware in Ukraine couldn’t do? So the EU argument is as follows: Trump says we must spend more, there’s nothing we can do because orange man bad and we need the US because we cut ourselves off from Russia and China. Meanwhile real economies are imploding, and more forced austerity coming — although there has been talk about a carve out in the spending limits for defense spending. It was always going to end this way due to a political class that sees themselves as faithful servants to the US empire and transnational capital and have nothing but scorn for the local peasants. They’re all groveling now before Trump. It’s easy to see why: Two percent of GDP on defense spending isn’t enough, says German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. President Duda said in his Independence Day speech that all NATO states must increase their military spending to a minimum 3%, an increase from the 2% spending target agreed on in 2014. Trump recently also said that 3% is needed for NATO. Poland will spend 4.7% next year 🇵🇱🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/CuWDaGWPNf — Visegrád 24 (@visegrad24) November 12, 2024 The thing is Europe has been spending more. In many ways Europe’s bureaucracy has already changed in small but fundamental ways in order to redirect money towards the military-industrial complex. From Equal Times: “In 2023, there was a very significant increase in military spending worldwide, but especially in Europe. In Spain, for example, it grew by 24 per cent and in Finland by 36 per cent. If we compare it with 2013, the European countries in Nato are spending 30 per cent more,” says Pere Ortega, a researcher at the Barcelona-based Centre Delàs for Peace Studies, which is critical of measures adopted by the European Commission to promote military spending, such as the VAT exemption for the purchase of armaments or the change in the regulations of the European Investment Bank (EIB) to allow it to finance industrial projects in the military sphere. And according to the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), the number of countries meeting the two percent target has risen from 3 to 23 since 2014: IN Germany, much has been made about the government’s scaling back of support for Ukraine, and how the cabinet’s approved military budget only increased by 1.25 billion euros to 53.25 billion this year but as WSWS points out: …the government is actually spending far more on armaments and war. A government overview of the budget states that “taking into account the relevant shares of other individual plans,” the NATO target of military spending of at least 2 percent of gross domestic product will be achieved. With a GDP of €4.122 trillion, this means at least €82.4 billion in military spending. The sum is probably even higher, as Scholz has already boasted of defence spending of €90 billion to NATO. In addition to the central defence budget, the government has already announced “defence-related expenditure” of €14 billion from other budget areas in the current year. Further projects totalling €20 billion will be paid from the Bundeswehr “special fund,” which totals €150 billion…In 2028, when it is expected the Bundeswehr special fund will be exhausted, the defence budget is set to rise by a huge increase of almost €30 billion to around €80 billion. Where has it gotten them? In the case of Germany, not much, at least according to a September report from the Kiel Institute: … the build-up of German capacities is progressing slowly. We document Germany’s military procurement in a new Kiel Military Procurement Tracker and find that Germany did not meaningfully increase procurement in the one and a half years after February 2022, and only accelerated it in late 2023. Given Germany’s massive disarmament in the last decades and the current procurement speed, we find that for some key weapon systems, Germany will not attain 2004 levels of armament for about 100 years. When taking into account arms commitments to Ukraine, some German capacities are even falling. The Plan All Along? The funny thing about all the gnashing of teeth over Trump and the danger he poses to NATO, is Europe shouldering more of the American empire’s load in the Russian periphery has long been the stated goal. If we look at what neocons, the real movers and shakers in the plutocrats and their think tanks on both sides of the Atlantic, and European politicians say, this was the plan. Here’s a September report from the Munich Security Conference, commonly referred to as “Davos with guns”: Russia’s aggressive revisionism has underscored NATO’s primacy in European defense. However, the real possibility of Donald Trump returning to the White House means that Europeans may soon have to seize a much larger share of the burden, both in supporting Ukraine and deterring Russia. A strong European Defence Union, based on the EU’s regulatory powers, ability to pool resources, and large single market, can become an important enabler of a more robust European pillar within NATO. Here is a team from the influential Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) writing earlier this year in Foreign Affairs about how Europe must lead in the fight against Russia so the US can focus on China: That complicated reality requires U.S. allies, especially in Europe, to take on a larger share of directing the containment of Russia. Europe has shown its political and economic resilience in the face of Russian aggression. Yet militarily, the continent remains dependent on the United States. This dynamic must change, in part because the United States must commit more of its resources to Asia. The growth of European defense spending since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is an encouraging step. In 2023, 11 NATO members hit their spending target, allocating at least two percent of GDP to national defense, up from just seven members in 2022. The rest need to follow suit. Europe must also resolve the problem of coordination. Right now, the United States coordinates more than 25 militaries in Europe. While it must continue to do this in the short term, it must push individual European countries and the European Union to take over this role and to create a stronger European pillar in NATO. The Centre for European Policy Studies with more: Against this backdrop, the EU’s true ‘Hamiltonian moment’ in defence would be a decision to issue joint debt to properly fund the ambitions set out in its Defence Industrial Strategy. Based on Art. 122 TFEU and implemented in accordance with Articles 173-174 TFEU, such bonds—possible under the EU’s Financial Regulation—could provide the backbone for grants to Member States to bolster the Union’s defence production capacity if paired with existing incentives for joint capabilities research, development, production, and procurement. This would avoid the two-speed logic and weaker conditionalities surrounding proposals to use the European Stability Mechanism (excluding key countries such as Poland, Sweden and Denmark) to issue loans to EU Member States for defence spending. Like how the Covid-induced Recovery and Resilience Facility stabilised European markets and sustained demand during and after the pandemic, Euro-defence bonds are a potential game-changer for the EU’s defence ambitions due to the potential speed and scale of resource mobilisation, and the potential impact on market de-fragmentation. And, fortunately, the German Constitutional Court should have nothing to object to this time around. And you can read the same in Scholz’s Zeitenwende, and in the speeches by Baerbock that Germany will lead the fight in Europe for the “rules-based order” while the US focuses on China. So what’s the problem with Trump telling them to get a move on? That they actually need to do it now rather than just talk? That Trump is more crass where someone like Biden would extol the trans-Atlantic alliance while shoving the knife in? Whatever Trump’s motivations, the faction of ascendant neocons who favor an American exit from Ukraine while making the Europeans spend more so that Washington can focus more on Iran and China are following a path long laid out. This is part and parcel of the neocon plan to use European vassals in an effort to preserve and expand the US empire. And the European political class is so far more than happy to go along. They don’t have much of a choice anymore: How much longer will the bloc’s citizens cooperate? To say Europe is in free fall would be an insult to gravity. And yet despite the endless stream of awful economic news, the political class’s complete detachment from reality, the embarrassing servility to the US, there isn’t yet a major threat to Europe’s willful vassalage. Germany’s upcoming election will be interesting to see how the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) perform. The two parties come at it from different angles, but both oppose bending the knee to Washington. They are currently polling at around a combined 24.5 percent, and barring an improvement, are likely to remain out of any ruling coalition. Until someone like the AfD or BSW can take charge, all the “crises” will continue working to the advantage of the few. Over the turbulent past few years in which real wages plummeted and deindustrialization took hold, the wealthiest added to their fortune and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen amassed more power that she uses for interests of the Western plutocrats centered in the US. With this being what the EU leaders of the “center” want and with the big bad orange man insisting upon more, they seem to compliment each other quite nicely. Many thanks for this article. Over the last day (following the temporary goods news about Haley and Pompeo) the Trump transition team have announced what has been arguably the most astounding list of cabinet level appointments in US history. They would appear to mark a total rout of the Carlson wing of the GOP by the Likudnik wing, with the most ‘advanced’ neocons taking control of the diplomatic, military and security levers of what we must now presumably call the Adelson/Musk Administration. As others have noted, a pathologically deluded Europe is going through a Morgenthau moment, and is almost anxious to help the US press it towards geostrategic perdition. It therefore seems to me that Ukraine, and most especially the Ukraine reconstruction bill, will be passed to the Europeans, but this is presumably chiefly so that the US can concentrate its fire upon the embers of Palestine (by proxy), and more especially upon Iran and China. If so, it would seem that Trump and his acolytes sincerely believe Russia can still be separated from China and/or Iran. Do they want another 1914 moment, this time with nuclear weapons, simply to prove the point that separating Russia from China may not now prove possible? Or is it that they wish to use nuclear brinkmanship to prise Russia from China? Or am I just being totally hysterical? There was a saying in Germany towards the end of WWII: enjoy the war, peace will be terrible. That is were our leaders are now. Not the nitwits like Baerbock and her green comrades. They are to stupid to understand that the war was lost from day one. But opportunists like the leading politicians from the legacy parties. They understand very well what beckons once the war is over. People will ask what it was all for? And why did it not end sooner? They will also have to somehow come to terms with Russia again. They are all in the same boat with Selensky in that they want this terrible day as far off as possible. And if this day will come at least they want it to be at a time when there are no elections soon. I believe that is why the German government finally disintegrated. They know very well that the end is nigh and they want it to happen after the elections when they have four more years for people to forget this disaster. As to Washington I follow Doug Mcgregor who evidently believes the new DefSec will finally acknowledge reality. Reality being that the US is way over its head militarily. The only conclusion can then be that the Ukraine war must be wount down. There´s fear and loathing at the prospect in the EU but it can´t be helped. The big question is whether the political system in Western Europe can survive this moment of truth. To me it feels like 1989 just before the break of the Berlin wall. The above sounds like what Tuchman called The March of Folly. The revival of oligarchy means they are back to a “whose is bigger” competition between owners of Dreadnoughts. The fact that a century after WW1 Europe is in the same antagonistic mess merely shows that human events revolve around competition between biological beings rather than economic algorithms. Only when the disaster becomes severe enough will we revert to another Age of Reason. However I’d say we need to wait and see what happens before assuming Trump is onboard with this. It could be he is indeed transactional and merely playing the part of the strongman to sweeten The Deal. I haven’t read his book so maybe it is all in there. Thank you and well said. I note your quip about the “likudnik wing”. Likud organises in the UK and has done since the 1940s. At first, it was called Herut until Herut and Likud merged four decades later. This is quite separate from the Conservative and Labour Friends of Israel. Modi’s BJP and RSS are beginning to organise in the UK and ally with Likud and CFI and LFI. The Zionist formations welcome such organisation as a means of beefing up numbers and influence. Great introspection into the false choices chicken hawks present to expand and continue their profitable wars and sanctions.. Vietnam, Iraq, Afgan, Ukraine, Israel, Syria. etc. None of the choices are peace. Trump may be forcing Britain and Europe (and of course Russia) to settle their own problems of security, terrorist attacks and mass killings. With those Eurobonds there will be a kicker. They just can’t be created out of thin air but will need to be backed by something as a form of collateral. And according to the guys at The Duran, this will be a EU tax that will be levied across every member state in the EU. All that money will be siphoned out of all those countries where it will be sent to Brussels where we can assume that it will be wisely spent and none of it pilfered. Maybe at first it will only be a very small tax but if there is one thing about taxes we know it is that it always goes up. And typing this I wonder if this might be turned into another tool in that “favoured” countries may get a rebate (Germany? France?) while everybody else has to pay full freight (Hungary? Slovakia?). The opportunities here for corruption are endless. Most of that money will end up in the US, to buy US weapons systems, LOL. Ursula’s plan, particularly the next 6 year budget proposal has not yet been disclosed so IMO it is too early to say what is at stake. EU budget is just 1% of EU GDP and most of it goes to the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy). If it is true that part of the CAP and cohesion funds are to be reduced and diverted to defence spending i believe the political discussion is going to be fierce. Also, the EC having no competence in defence, as per the treaties, i believe that finding those “holes” in the treaties for the EC to have its own defence budget would need a lot of overstretching of EU rules to the brink of rupture. IMO, it is almost certain this would require modifications of the treaties signed by each and all EU members. I might be mistaken but this has the same probabilities as the Eurobonds (null). Not to mention that the potential amounts to be directed to defence spending would not have probably any meaningful effect in defence capabilities in the EU to start with. So, this, I believe, so far doesn’t go beyond neocon dreams aired in loud voice by the neocon FT and balloon probes to test the waters. No covering any particular defence objective, if there is any it is only bureaucratic, risking disputes and discontent, what is the point here? I think the “road” to EU defense spending is through NATO. The likely story is that the EU and NATO will blend informally at first and more formally eventually. I believe the future belongs to militarism and permanent war (a cheap way to “unite” subject populations, i.e., the Europ public). It has worked in the USA despite losing every war every decade. The point is never to “win” but to keep the movement towards the ruling-classes dream of a neo-Orwellian world order. We’ll just have to see if that works–but that’s the agenda in my view. A big reason why I like ‘Naked Capitalism’ is that the comments are usually, not always, intelligently stated even if I don’t agree and which is a big difference compared to other sites so thanks much, Mike Liston Thanks for the kind words! Thank you! And your colleagues. Excellent piece, thanks! >”How much longer will the bloc’s citizens cooperate?” For another 2 decades for sure. Until critical wealth has been spent on trash. Right now German society is still too rich to experience a revolutionary moment. How much expense on 9/11 wars and social rollback were necessary for the GOP under Trump to be able to take WH & both houses with a popular vote? And considering that top 50% of US income starts at $100,000 annual wage – that´s still a rich country. The antisemitism resolution passed German parliament without a peep. Most educated will not vote for BSW because they are too anti-immigration. Putin & Xi are dictators and the Uyghurs are forced into camps and there is an Axis of Evil. As long as such narratives hold sway you won´t get political change. I’m not sure about “two decades” but you are, more or less, correct. As long as Western intel is in charge of the news media (IMHO) Europeans who are becoming as befuddled as North Americans with the “too much information age” are looking for narratives that work and that they can follow without disordering their lives with thinking for themselves and can continue to pursue empty lives of radical materialism (Euro people are prone to this). People who are confused crave meaning and crave to be ruled rather than rule themselves. Great comment Chris! Are you thinking of this USA election as a revolutionary moment? In true spirit of these times, I’ll bet the inequality continues to expand. It’s revolutionary times for billionaires…still. “Revolutionary,” as the word is often applied to the turmoil in the late Roman Republic. The oligarchy had become split into two main factions, the boni and the populares. These rivals were mostly drawn from the same class (Caesar, Clodius, Catiline were all aristocrats), but the populares appealed to the poorer citizens in order to gain an edge. When the boni were finally defeated, there was little fundamental change in the class structure of Roman society. Nevertheless, there was a considerable turnover in terms of the actual personnel composing the dominant class; a lot of Darwin Awards got handed out. Is there a parallel to the declining Romans “allying” with the Goths? Potential heirs to empire? Does the EU population want ascendant Germans? Russia and China are watching. My later observations about the PRC naval challenge is: how can the US Navy be more relevant and get some ships*? Resurgent Plan Orange, and Alfred Thayer Mahan’s thesis! A major naval force engagement concentration and mass! The US Navy needs 16 aircraft carriers, while they extend the lives of DDG (aegis destroyers) bc can’t get new ones out of build. *After squandering years and billions on the little crappy ships (LCS). Of course I’m just an simple peasant, but it seems to me that an investment in a ‘Manhattan Project,’ or a ‘moon shot’ of diplomacy around the world to resolve the issues that facilitate this destructive militarism, would be magnitudes cheaper, and much better for the planet and it’s inhabitants than the continual flogging of the ‘peace through strength’ strategy which historically has been quite counterproductive. In the words of the immortal Rodney King, “Why can’t we all just get along.” There is no interest in the Western Empire for “peace” because the need by the oligarchs is to maintain and enhance their control over their subject populations. How else are they going to maintain the rule of the corrupt and the ideology of hedonism and radical materialism? War is the answer to all their dreams and peace the major threat to the Imperial regime. Especially since the current concept of ‘western style democracy,’ has evolved into a system where the ability of politicians to get their name on a ballot, is primarily determined by which candidate is able to raise the most money by the advance selling of favors to billionaires whose interests don’t align with the majority of the electorate. Yup, that about sums it up. I feel like Matthew Modine in Altman’s “Short Cuts”, forced to sit through a dinner party with a vapid couple minutes after an argument with my wife in which she confessed a casual adultery like it was nothing. Sheer madness and I must endure. Sigh. Sometimes the simple ideas are always the best. George Orwell’s character in 1984–Emmanuel Goldstein–gave the best explanation for perpetual war: “The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink), is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living.” The European people are our last hope. Putin may have overestimated his military capabilities when he attacked Ukraine. He certainly understands now that he could not invade Europe with any hope of victory or profit. However, the Russians may feel it necessary to fight in self-defense. The US has been lost now to militarist factions and ideology. Our only hope for the future seems to be European alliances, economic and military, with Russia as equals. What other hope is there. Europe cannot fail. Good idea, but it does it Exclude lid the US view of its importance? Which Would make it fail,or more accurately, forced onto failure . Definitely agree, we (UK and Europe) would be well rid of the US and their bullying. However they have so much printed money to spend and we know how greedy people are… Putin doesn’t have any military capability, unless you can count some judo by +70 year old. Russia, on the other hand, has one of the most powerful and capable military on Earth. That said, many (real) experts and commentators have stated that it will take a generation or two until Russia will even bother to piss on the rest of Europe* if it was on fire. EU and NATO have build a new Iron Curtain and it’s those two who will have to tear it down to have any significant role in the world. Or even survive. * Russia covers 40% of Europe, it’s the biggest country of the subcontinent. This smells a bit of western centrism. There are other modes. China is not doing too bad, nor Japan… This doesn’t meen europeans need to become Chinese… Does Europe intend to get into a hot war with Russia? Is that the purpose of the increased military spending? If not, it all seems silly from a capitalist perspective. Acquiring tens of billions of dollars of military hardware and then not using it means lots of expensive items collect dust and, more importantly, the arms merchants don’t have repeat sales which is anathema to capitalists everywhere. Europe is playing a very dangerous game arming up. The temptations to use the weapons will increase, and so will the risk of nuclear confrontation. There are lots of nice cultural icons across Europe. It would be a shame to lose them all. This extra ‘American LNG’ will also be Russian except bought via America. (They haven’t enough of their own fracked gas and it’s expensive for them.) Anyway, They dropped their own sanctions against Russian gas last week in preparation for a nice deal with Russia where they both profit. The Euros are such suckers! Why at least Germany does not sign a peace deal with Russia and turn on the remaining Nordstream is beyond me. Are you saying EU elites are DUMBER than the American voters? Yeah, well, I guess that’s not surprising, American elites (say about 90%) are dumber than American voters too. I’ve never seen a whole subcontinent of elites stick their head in the oven and turn on the gas this way. Crazy to watch. Sorry the rest of the EU gets to go along for the ride.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) stands against the other AI stocks investors are paying attention to. The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI, now the most valuable private firm in the world, back in November 2022 had widespread implications for the technology industry. In the two years since the release, technology valuations, which had hit a snag due to broader inflation and slowing growth concerns, have jumped back up. Technology giants have surpassed multi-trillion dollar valuations and OpenAI itself has crossed $150 billion in value. In this environment, technology firms have been pushing for greater capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, telling investors that adding more data and computing power will consistently lead to improved AI models.

However, news agency Reuters reports that new techniques being used by AI firms to train their AI models could reshape the AI arms race, and have implications for the types of resources that AI companies have an insatiable demand for, from energy to types of chips. For example, Ilya Sutskever, a Canadian-Israeli computer scientist who was one of the founders of OpenAI, has said that results from scaling up pre-training have plateaued. The computer scientist claims that the 2010s were the age of scaling, and now we're back in the age of wonder and discovery once again. Everyone is looking for the next thing, and scaling the right thing matters more now than ever.

For this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting. Market Capitalization: $2.2 Trillion Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a California-based technology company that owns and runs the internet search engine Google. On November 9, tech website Android Authority reported that the AI-capable Tensor processors developed by Google for the Pixel line of smartphones had failed to meet financial targets. The report highlights that the financial goal for the tech titan is about $65 per chip to make the business viable. For additional context, the tech website claims that Qualcomm’s latest flagship chips cost around $150. Google released the latest Pixel phones earlier this year. The phones feature the on-device artificial intelligent assistant Gemini Nano and an array of generative AI features. Overall GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks investors are paying attention to. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

On the listing day, Swiggy shares ended the trading session at ₹454 on NSE, nearly 17 per cent premium over IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium. Swiggy’s ₹11,300-crore-IPO was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The shares got listed on bourses at nearly 8 per cent premium.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 122343.png (NSE data show) Swiggy’s diversification strategy Swiggy’s revenue model spans multiple verticals, including its core food delivery service, Swiggy Instamart (grocery delivery), and Swiggy Genie (parcel delivery). This diverse service portfolio has helped Swiggy generate a gross revenue of ₹5,705 crore in the fiscal year 2023, representing a year-over-year growth of 40%. Swiggy Instamart alone contributed over ₹1,500 crore to Swiggy’s overall revenue, showcasing strong traction in the quick-commerce grocery sector. However, this broad approach comes with challenges. Swiggy’s operational expenses reached ₹7,280 crore in FY 2023, resulting in a net loss of ₹1,575 crore, a slight improvement from ₹1,850 crore in FY 2022. While Swiggy’s diversified model spreads risk, it also requires heavy capital investment, and the quick-commerce segment, in particular, has yet to show consistent profitability. Zomato’s focused business model Zomato, on the other hand, has opted to maintain a streamlined focus on food delivery, while experimenting selectively with quick-commerce following its acquisition of Blinkit. In FY 2023, Zomato reported a revenue of ₹6,300 crore, marking a 68% increase from ₹3,750 crore in FY 2022. Despite exiting grocery delivery early on, Zomato’s recent acquisition of Blinkit has contributed to its revenue and may provide additional growth potential if it successfully scales. Zomato’s net loss in FY 2023 was ₹450 crore, a notable improvement from ₹1,200 crore in FY 2022, reflecting its commitment to reducing operational inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. Unlike Swiggy, Zomato’s operating expenses were more concentrated, allowing it to streamline costs in food delivery. For investors, Zomato’s focused approach, coupled with this reduced net loss, demonstrates potential for achieving profitability earlier than Swiggy. Profitability remains a major concern for both companies, though they have made strides toward improving their unit economics. Know more Quick commerce refers to the delivery of consumer items in 10-30 minutes. Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and Flipkart Minutes are among the top quick commerce platforms in India. Read here Swiggy shares declined 2.62% on the NSE to ₹444.05 as at 11.50 am. Swiggy shares dropped 1.96% on the NSE to ₹447.05 as at 10.58 am. Screenshot 2024-11-14 110145.png (NSE data) Swiggy Stock Listing by Bajaj Broking Research “Swiggy’s listing on the Indian stock market has stirred up notable excitement, but early trading volatility reveals investor caution. While there’s optimism about Swiggy’s potential to capture further market share in India’s Android evolving food delivery and quick commerce segments, the road to profitability may be bumpy. Swiggy has shown impressive growth potential, yet persistent losses over recent fiscal years signal challenges ahead. Investors may need to brace for a dynamic journey as the company seeks to balance expansion with sustainable financial performance.” Swiggy shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹454.35 as at 10.21 am after a fresh high at ₹489.40. Swiggy shares ​ended the listing day trading session ​at ₹464 on NSE, an 18.97 per cent premium to the IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium. Swiggy’s ₹11,300-crore-IPO was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The shares​ got listed on bourses at nearly 8 per cent premium.​ Swiggy shares rallied over 10 per cent to close at ₹454 and ₹455.95 on the NSE and BSE, respectively. The stock ended the day’s trade 18.97 per cent and 16.8 per cent higher over the issue price of ₹390. ​Swiggy shares​ closed at ₹464.55 on the BSE, higher by 12.75 per cent over the listing price of ₹412.

Swiggy shares jumped 6.43% on the NSE to ₹447 as at 3.02 pm. On the BSE, the stock rallied 8.56% to ₹447.25. With Swiggy listing on the stock exchanges on November 13 at a premium, the debate intensifies over whether Swiggy or Zomato offers the better investment in India’s booming food delivery market Investors are keenly comparing Swiggy to its main competitor, Zomato, which has already experienced two years in the public market. Both companies are key players in India’s food delivery industry, valued at approximately $4.5 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next five years. This analysis compares the financials, growth potential, and strategic directions of Swiggy and Zomato, shedding light on which platform may offer stronger returns. Market position and financial performance Both Swiggy and Zomato have carved out significant shares in the Indian market, with Zomato accounting for approximately 55% and Swiggy for about 45% of the market by 2023. However, the companies differ significantly in revenue composition and business models, which influence their respective investment potential. Track bl’s stock market live updates here Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow: We see immense growth potential in Instamart given QC is essentially a play on the broader retail market, which was sized at ~USD 1trln in CY22. While Swiggy tested the dark store-led business model first, sudden rise in competition and better execution by competition did lead to market share erosion. Despite that, in GOV terms, we estimate Instamart was only behind Blinkit as of FY24, with a market share of ~28%. Moreover, the QC channel penetration within the broader retail market even today is barely ~0.35%, compared to ~5-6% e-retail penetration. Even assuming the QC channel penetration will reach only 1.5-2% over the next 5 years, the market can expand at >50% CAGR. This will ensure exponential GOV/Revenue growth for Instamart over the medium term. Moreover, the QC business model has enough operating leverage to turn self-sustainable, when operating at scale. Screenshot 2024-11-13 143942.png Swiggy shares traded at ₹443 on the NSE, higher by 5.48% as at 2.17 pm. On the BSE, the stock climbed 7.91% to ₹444.60. Swiggy’s listing underscores the dominance of short-term subscribers, evident in the lukewarm participation from Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) and subdued retail interest. This can be attributed to the company’s higher valuation when compared to its only listed peer, making it challenging for investors to justify any frantic applying in IPO Despite this, I feel, Swiggy’s sectoral opportunity, its market share, and readiness are undeniable. In principle, the company’s potential warrants attention. However, considering the prevailing stock market dynamics with respect to Swiggy, it’s advisable to allow the dust to settle. The scrip is currently dominated by traders lacking a clear opinion on the company’s value proposition. The modest listing gain supports this assessment. Long-term investors should await an opportune time to accumulate Swiggy shares. The company’s December quarter performance will be crucial in backing the issue with tangible numbers. A decent financial reporting will validate Swiggy’s potential as a good long-term hold. - Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities Swiggy.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.jpeg GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.’s shares climbed in their Mumbai debut, signaling a vote of confidence for large initial public offerings in India. The food-delivery firm listed at 416.20 rupees, about 7% higher than the selling price of 390 rupees, the top of the marketed range. The shares traded at 444.65 rupees at 11:47 a.m. local time, valuing the company at just under $12 billion. The $1.3 billion sale, the nation’s second-largest listing this year after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion IPO, comes as global funds are dumping local shares on concerns over earnings growth. Initial demand for Swiggy’s IPO was subdued, but institutional demand on the final day drove it to a strong close. Swiggy’s IPO was seen as a test of investor appetite for the country’s burgeoning quick-commerce sector. The debut pits the company against larger listed rival Zomato and privately-held Zepto in India’s rapid delivery space. According to CLSA, these firms are set to top $78 billion in combined gross orders within a decade. “These companies already have a good presence and people have gotten used to ordering,” said Pranav Bhavsar, a co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. “It is hard to do away with that once you get used to it. That makes quick commerce a good theme to invest.” The listing defies the recent trend of weak performance among large first-time offerings in India. IPOs raising over $1 billion since 2019 have fallen by an average 3% on their first trading day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 19% gain for all listings in the country for the period. Hyundai Motor India’s shares dipped on debut last month, and remain 12% below the IPO price. A handful more big listings are in the pipeline: state-backed NTPC Green Energy Ltd. is set to take bids for its up to $1.2 billion IPO next week. The Indian unit of LG Electronics Inc. and HDB Financial Services Ltd. are also gearing up for their debuts. “The India IPO market faces a cautious outlook following Hyundai’s underwhelming post-listing performance,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management in Singapore. “Investor skepticism is heightened, especially for startups with high valuations but uncertain profitability.” While Swiggy’s IPO attracted global funds including Fidelity International, the loss-making company faces challenges. Competition among quick commerce firms has caught the attention of India’s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating the company and Zomato for alleged unfair practices. Both the firms have said no final order has been issued. Fierce competition means increased spending on small-sized warehouses while “regulatory actions, such as welfare scheme for gig workers will be inflationary,” Macquarie Group analysts including Aditya Suresh wrote in a note. They initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a target of 325 rupees. Despite these hurdles, Swiggy’s growth is backed by strong online demand in one of the fastest-growing major economies. Its market share stood at about 37%, just behind Zomato’s 39% as of March 31, according to Chryseum Advisors, which tracks unlisted shares. “We see immense growth potential given quick commerce is essentially a play for the broader retail market, which was approximately $1 trillion in 2022,” JM Financial Institutional Securities Pvt. analysts wrote in a note. JM began coverage on Swiggy with a buy rating and a target of 470 rupees. The company was priced at about 40% discount to Zomato’s 12-month forward enterprise value to sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Zomato shares have more than doubled this year, with nearly all the 27 analysts covering the company recommending the stock as a buy. “Zomato trading up is providing a strong backdrop to Swiggy’s performance,” said Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV have more than doubled the value of their investments in Swiggy’s listing price. Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its debut. Bloomberg input Swiggy, India’s pioneering on-demand convenience platform backed by Prosus, has today listed on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges of India (NSE and BSE), valuing the company at US$11.3 billion. Prosus sold shares worth more than US$500 million as part of the IPO. Prosus has been a cornerstone investor in Swiggy since 2017. Following the IPO, Prosus holds a c25%1 stake and maintains its two seats on the Board. Fabricio Bloisi, CEO of Prosus, said: “Everyone at Prosus extends huge congratulations to the Swiggy team on today’s IPO. We have supported the management team since our first investment in 2017 and have seen the company flourish in the post-pandemic era. It has diversified into new areas, expanded into new cities, and built an iconic consumer brand – placing Swiggy on a strong trajectory as a public company. Our investment in Swiggy highlights our commitment to building transformational companies and delivering returns for our shareholders by actively managing our portfolio. “India remains a key growth market for Prosus given the country’s impressive digital transformation in the consumer and enterprise sectors. We are excited about the region and see huge opportunity for value creation including a strong IPO pipeline within our current portfolio. Swiggy debuted at ₹420, marking a listing gain of 7.6%, which outpaced its grey market premium (GMP) estimate of just 0.26%. Retail investors showed modest interest, subscribing only 1.14 times, indicating low confidence. Current market conditions have kept many investors on the sidelines, especially as numerous high-quality companies remain 15-20% below their all-time highs. However, for those with a higher risk appetite, Swiggy could be an opportunity to capitalize on the valuation gap between Zomato and Swiggy, with potential gains hinging on Swiggy’s ability to enhance operational efficiency over time. - Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg (Source: X/@NSEIndia) According to Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd., the listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. “However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term,” Nyati added. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, advised allotted investors to hold for long-term despite knowing short-term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. Global brokerage Macquarie has initiated coverage on Swiggy with an underperform rating at a target price of ₹325. Meanwhile, domestic brokerage JM Financial has initiated coverage on the stock with ‘buy’ call at a target price of ₹470. The brokerage emphasised that a duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits. JM Financial says it would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments, while on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside. Madhu Balaji of businessline writes | ​Click to read​ Anand Daniel, Partner at Accel “As Swiggy hits the public bourses today, we at Accel reflect on the remarkable journey that Harsha, Nandan, and Phani, along with the Swiggy team, have undertaken. Being one of Swiggy’s first partners, when food delivery in India was still emerging, makes today especially meaningful. Guided by our thesis-led approach to food delivery, we were introduced to Harsha and his founding team in 2014—a connection that has since fueled countless innovations. This IPO is a testament to the grit, innovation, and consumer focus that Swiggy has consistently brought to the market. From ultra-fast grocery delivery with Instamart to ensuring safety and access during the pandemic, Swiggy has continually adapted to consumer needs with agility. Today’s IPO marks not only a milestone for Swiggy but a pivotal moment in India’s digital economy, impacting the daily lives of millions.” Swiggy shares rallied to hit day’s high at ₹449 on the NSE after listing at ₹420 today. Currently, as at 12.46 pm, the stock trades at ₹441.05, higher by 5.01%. While on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments. We, however, suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names and could, therefore, outperform the broader market returns. Despite subdued market mood and sluggish response from overall investors, Swiggy listing surprised the market participants. Positive listing and price holding above its issue price of 390 should be seen as strong demand for the company. This shows investors are positive on the space and fear of missing out factor is holding investors not to miss the sector growth story, similar to ZOMATO post listing trend. Post Listing: For allotted investors, HOLD FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit to buy near issue price if we get due to market selloff pressure. Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. ​​Swiggy shares​​ surged 6.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹447.65 as at 11.38 am.

Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. have invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its stock market debut in India on Wednesday. The food delivery firm is targeting an initial public offering valuation of up to $11.3 billion. Prosus will sell down shares in the IPO and retain 25% of Swiggy, similar to its stake in Tencent, Prosus’s Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu said an interview. The share sale is expected to generate a return of more than $500 million for Prosus, he added. “We expect to benefit from the upside of the business, and the tailwinds of the fast-growing Indian market in future,” Tu said, noting that Prosus has invested in several Indian companies that could list on public markets. Bloomberg report Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” Track bl’s stock market live updates here Food tech major Swiggy’s IPO is set to unlock wealth to the tune of ₹9000 crore in employee stock ownership plan (Esop) wealth for its current and former employees, making it one of the largest wealth creation exercises of its kind in India’s startup ecosystem. Nearly 5,000 current and former employees are set to benefit, with around 500 Swiggy employees to enter the ‘crore-pati’ club when the firm makes its stock market debut, according to sources. Till date, Swiggy has has distributed ₹500 crore in Esops. In July this year, the company had announced its plan to buy back stocks worth up to $65 million. This kind of wealth creation by a new-age company is unmatched at this scale apart from Flipkart which hich has undertaken bigger scale of buyback or payouts in the past. In 2023, Flipkart had paid out a total of $700 million to 17,000 employees. Overall, Flipkart had over five share buybacks worth $1.4-1.5 billion in total over the past years. Swiggy’s founders and top management of Swiggy were allocated Esops worth nearly worth $271 million in its latest stock ownership plan. Investors probably won’t give a standing ovation for the e-commerce major’s market debut as they did when rival Zomato went public in 2021. Still, Swiggy can learn from Zomato’s epic stock meltdown the following year and an equally dramatic comeback since then. The best way for Swiggy to close the valuation gap with Zomato is to set clear profitability timeline and stick to the milestone targets. Investors love a good story, but Swiggy should bear in mind that these days, they’re quick to hit the sell button if earnings don’t meet estimates. Bloomberg input Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. Shares of food delivery and grocery major ​Swiggy ​will be listed at the bourses today. The company has fixed the IPO price as Rs 370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an​ oversubscription of 3.60 times​, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. ​KS Badri Narayanan of businessline writes​ Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

On the listing day, Swiggy shares ended the trading session at ₹454 on NSE, nearly 17 per cent premium over IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium. Swiggy’s ₹11,300-crore-IPO was subscribed 3.59 times primarily driven by interest from institutional investors. The shares got listed on bourses at nearly 8 per cent premium.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 122343.png (NSE data show) Swiggy’s diversification strategy Swiggy’s revenue model spans multiple verticals, including its core food delivery service, Swiggy Instamart (grocery delivery), and Swiggy Genie (parcel delivery). This diverse service portfolio has helped Swiggy generate a gross revenue of ₹5,705 crore in the fiscal year 2023, representing a year-over-year growth of 40%. Swiggy Instamart alone contributed over ₹1,500 crore to Swiggy’s overall revenue, showcasing strong traction in the quick-commerce grocery sector. However, this broad approach comes with challenges. Swiggy’s operational expenses reached ₹7,280 crore in FY 2023, resulting in a net loss of ₹1,575 crore, a slight improvement from ₹1,850 crore in FY 2022. While Swiggy’s diversified model spreads risk, it also requires heavy capital investment, and the quick-commerce segment, in particular, has yet to show consistent profitability. Zomato’s focused business model Zomato, on the other hand, has opted to maintain a streamlined focus on food delivery, while experimenting selectively with quick-commerce following its acquisition of Blinkit. In FY 2023, Zomato reported a revenue of ₹6,300 crore, marking a 68% increase from ₹3,750 crore in FY 2022. Despite exiting grocery delivery early on, Zomato’s recent acquisition of Blinkit has contributed to its revenue and may provide additional growth potential if it successfully scales. Zomato’s net loss in FY 2023 was ₹450 crore, a notable improvement from ₹1,200 crore in FY 2022, reflecting its commitment to reducing operational inefficiencies and enhancing profitability. Unlike Swiggy, Zomato’s operating expenses were more concentrated, allowing it to streamline costs in food delivery. For investors, Zomato’s focused approach, coupled with this reduced net loss, demonstrates potential for achieving profitability earlier than Swiggy. Profitability remains a major concern for both companies, though they have made strides toward improving their unit economics. Know more Quick commerce refers to the delivery of consumer items in 10-30 minutes. Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart, and Flipkart Minutes are among the top quick commerce platforms in India.

Screenshot 2024-11-14 110145.png (NSE data) Swiggy Stock Listing by Bajaj Broking Research “Swiggy’s listing on the Indian stock market has stirred up notable excitement, but early trading volatility reveals investor caution. While there’s optimism about Swiggy’s potential to capture further market share in India’s Android evolving food delivery and quick commerce segments, the road to profitability may be bumpy. Swiggy has shown impressive growth potential, yet persistent losses over recent fiscal years signal challenges ahead. Investors may need to brace for a dynamic journey as the company seeks to balance expansion with sustainable financial performance.” Swiggy shares trade flat on the NSE at ₹454.35 as at 10.21 am after a fresh high at ₹489.40. Swiggy shares ​ended the listing day trading session ​at ₹464 on NSE, an 18.97 per cent premium to the IPO price of ₹390, and at ₹455.95 on BSE, a 16.9 per cent premium.

With Swiggy listing on the stock exchanges on November 13 at a premium, the debate intensifies over whether Swiggy or Zomato offers the better investment in India’s booming food delivery market Investors are keenly comparing Swiggy to its main competitor, Zomato, which has already experienced two years in the public market. Both companies are key players in India’s food delivery industry, valued at approximately $4.5 billion in 2023 and projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25% over the next five years. This analysis compares the financials, growth potential, and strategic directions of Swiggy and Zomato, shedding light on which platform may offer stronger returns. Market position and financial performance Both Swiggy and Zomato have carved out significant shares in the Indian market, with Zomato accounting for approximately 55% and Swiggy for about 45% of the market by 2023. However, the companies differ significantly in revenue composition and business models, which influence their respective investment potential. Track bl’s stock market live updates here Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow: We see immense growth potential in Instamart given QC is essentially a play on the broader retail market, which was sized at ~USD 1trln in CY22. While Swiggy tested the dark store-led business model first, sudden rise in competition and better execution by competition did lead to market share erosion. Despite that, in GOV terms, we estimate Instamart was only behind Blinkit as of FY24, with a market share of ~28%. Moreover, the QC channel penetration within the broader retail market even today is barely ~0.35%, compared to ~5-6% e-retail penetration. Even assuming the QC channel penetration will reach only 1.5-2% over the next 5 years, the market can expand at >50% CAGR. This will ensure exponential GOV/Revenue growth for Instamart over the medium term. Moreover, the QC business model has enough operating leverage to turn self-sustainable, when operating at scale. Screenshot 2024-11-13 143942.png Swiggy shares traded at ₹443 on the NSE, higher by 5.48% as at 2.17 pm. On the BSE, the stock climbed 7.91% to ₹444.60. Swiggy’s listing underscores the dominance of short-term subscribers, evident in the lukewarm participation from Non-Institutional Investors (NIIs) and subdued retail interest. This can be attributed to the company’s higher valuation when compared to its only listed peer, making it challenging for investors to justify any frantic applying in IPO Despite this, I feel, Swiggy’s sectoral opportunity, its market share, and readiness are undeniable. In principle, the company’s potential warrants attention. However, considering the prevailing stock market dynamics with respect to Swiggy, it’s advisable to allow the dust to settle. The scrip is currently dominated by traders lacking a clear opinion on the company’s value proposition. The modest listing gain supports this assessment. Long-term investors should await an opportune time to accumulate Swiggy shares. The company’s December quarter performance will be crucial in backing the issue with tangible numbers. A decent financial reporting will validate Swiggy’s potential as a good long-term hold. - Tarun Singh Founder & MD, Highbrow Securities Swiggy.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.jpeg GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg Swiggy Ltd.’s shares climbed in their Mumbai debut, signaling a vote of confidence for large initial public offerings in India. The food-delivery firm listed at 416.20 rupees, about 7% higher than the selling price of 390 rupees, the top of the marketed range. The shares traded at 444.65 rupees at 11:47 a.m. local time, valuing the company at just under $12 billion. The $1.3 billion sale, the nation’s second-largest listing this year after Hyundai Motor India Ltd.’s record $3.3 billion IPO, comes as global funds are dumping local shares on concerns over earnings growth. Initial demand for Swiggy’s IPO was subdued, but institutional demand on the final day drove it to a strong close. Swiggy’s IPO was seen as a test of investor appetite for the country’s burgeoning quick-commerce sector. The debut pits the company against larger listed rival Zomato and privately-held Zepto in India’s rapid delivery space. According to CLSA, these firms are set to top $78 billion in combined gross orders within a decade. “These companies already have a good presence and people have gotten used to ordering,” said Pranav Bhavsar, a co-founder of Trudence Capital Advisors Pvt. “It is hard to do away with that once you get used to it. That makes quick commerce a good theme to invest.” The listing defies the recent trend of weak performance among large first-time offerings in India. IPOs raising over $1 billion since 2019 have fallen by an average 3% on their first trading day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with an average 19% gain for all listings in the country for the period. Hyundai Motor India’s shares dipped on debut last month, and remain 12% below the IPO price. A handful more big listings are in the pipeline: state-backed NTPC Green Energy Ltd. is set to take bids for its up to $1.2 billion IPO next week. The Indian unit of LG Electronics Inc. and HDB Financial Services Ltd. are also gearing up for their debuts. “The India IPO market faces a cautious outlook following Hyundai’s underwhelming post-listing performance,” said Manish Bhargava, chief executive officer at Straits Investment Management in Singapore. “Investor skepticism is heightened, especially for startups with high valuations but uncertain profitability.” While Swiggy’s IPO attracted global funds including Fidelity International, the loss-making company faces challenges. Competition among quick commerce firms has caught the attention of India’s antitrust watchdog, which is investigating the company and Zomato for alleged unfair practices. Both the firms have said no final order has been issued. Fierce competition means increased spending on small-sized warehouses while “regulatory actions, such as welfare scheme for gig workers will be inflationary,” Macquarie Group analysts including Aditya Suresh wrote in a note. They initiated coverage with an underperform rating and a target of 325 rupees. Despite these hurdles, Swiggy’s growth is backed by strong online demand in one of the fastest-growing major economies. Its market share stood at about 37%, just behind Zomato’s 39% as of March 31, according to Chryseum Advisors, which tracks unlisted shares. “We see immense growth potential given quick commerce is essentially a play for the broader retail market, which was approximately $1 trillion in 2022,” JM Financial Institutional Securities Pvt. analysts wrote in a note. JM began coverage on Swiggy with a buy rating and a target of 470 rupees. The company was priced at about 40% discount to Zomato’s 12-month forward enterprise value to sales, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Zomato shares have more than doubled this year, with nearly all the 27 analysts covering the company recommending the stock as a buy. “Zomato trading up is providing a strong backdrop to Swiggy’s performance,” said Devi Subhakesan, an independent analyst from Investory Pte. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group Corp. and Prosus NV have more than doubled the value of their investments in Swiggy’s listing price. Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its debut. Bloomberg input Swiggy, India’s pioneering on-demand convenience platform backed by Prosus, has today listed on the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges of India (NSE and BSE), valuing the company at US$11.3 billion. Prosus sold shares worth more than US$500 million as part of the IPO. Prosus has been a cornerstone investor in Swiggy since 2017. Following the IPO, Prosus holds a c25%1 stake and maintains its two seats on the Board. Fabricio Bloisi, CEO of Prosus, said: “Everyone at Prosus extends huge congratulations to the Swiggy team on today’s IPO. We have supported the management team since our first investment in 2017 and have seen the company flourish in the post-pandemic era. It has diversified into new areas, expanded into new cities, and built an iconic consumer brand – placing Swiggy on a strong trajectory as a public company. Our investment in Swiggy highlights our commitment to building transformational companies and delivering returns for our shareholders by actively managing our portfolio. “India remains a key growth market for Prosus given the country’s impressive digital transformation in the consumer and enterprise sectors. We are excited about the region and see huge opportunity for value creation including a strong IPO pipeline within our current portfolio. Swiggy debuted at ₹420, marking a listing gain of 7.6%, which outpaced its grey market premium (GMP) estimate of just 0.26%. Retail investors showed modest interest, subscribing only 1.14 times, indicating low confidence. Current market conditions have kept many investors on the sidelines, especially as numerous high-quality companies remain 15-20% below their all-time highs. However, for those with a higher risk appetite, Swiggy could be an opportunity to capitalize on the valuation gap between Zomato and Swiggy, with potential gains hinging on Swiggy’s ability to enhance operational efficiency over time. - Gaurav Garg, Research Analyst at Lemonn Markets Desk GcPTWYyasAEYQAT.jpeg (Source: X/@NSEIndia) According to Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth, Swastika Investmart Ltd., the listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. “However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term,” Nyati added. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, advised allotted investors to hold for long-term despite knowing short-term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. Global brokerage Macquarie has initiated coverage on Swiggy with an underperform rating at a target price of ₹325. Meanwhile, domestic brokerage JM Financial has initiated coverage on the stock with ‘buy’ call at a target price of ₹470. The brokerage emphasised that a duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits. JM Financial says it would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments, while on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside. Madhu Balaji of businessline writes | ​Click to read​ Anand Daniel, Partner at Accel “As Swiggy hits the public bourses today, we at Accel reflect on the remarkable journey that Harsha, Nandan, and Phani, along with the Swiggy team, have undertaken. Being one of Swiggy’s first partners, when food delivery in India was still emerging, makes today especially meaningful. Guided by our thesis-led approach to food delivery, we were introduced to Harsha and his founding team in 2014—a connection that has since fueled countless innovations. This IPO is a testament to the grit, innovation, and consumer focus that Swiggy has consistently brought to the market. From ultra-fast grocery delivery with Instamart to ensuring safety and access during the pandemic, Swiggy has continually adapted to consumer needs with agility. Today’s IPO marks not only a milestone for Swiggy but a pivotal moment in India’s digital economy, impacting the daily lives of millions.” Swiggy shares rallied to hit day’s high at ₹449 on the NSE after listing at ₹420 today. Currently, as at 12.46 pm, the stock trades at ₹441.05, higher by 5.01%. While on an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments. We, however, suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names and could, therefore, outperform the broader market returns. Despite subdued market mood and sluggish response from overall investors, Swiggy listing surprised the market participants. Positive listing and price holding above its issue price of 390 should be seen as strong demand for the company. This shows investors are positive on the space and fear of missing out factor is holding investors not to miss the sector growth story, similar to ZOMATO post listing trend. Post Listing: For allotted investors, HOLD FOR LONG TERM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit to buy near issue price if we get due to market selloff pressure. Swiggy, the leading food delivery and e-commerce platform in India, made a decent debut on the stock market, listing at around Rs 420, a 7.6% premium over its issue price of Rs 390. This performance is better than expected, considering the moderate subscription of 3.59 times and the initial muted investor response reflected in the low grey market premium. The listing reflects a degree of optimism about Swiggy’s long-term growth prospects, driven by its strong brand recognition, extensive network, and dominant position in the food delivery market. However, the company’s continued losses and the challenging market conditions may temper investor enthusiasm in the long term. Investors should approach Swiggy with a balanced perspective, considering the potential for future growth and the associated risks. Those who are holding it may keep a stop at around the issue price. ​​Swiggy shares​​ surged 6.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹447.65 as at 11.38 am. On the BSE, the stock climbed 8.65% to ₹447.65 JMFinancial on Swiggy Initiate Buy with TP of Rs 470 Food delivery – duopoly structure should ensure steady growth and profits Instamart essentially a play on broader retail; has immense potential to grow On an absolute basis Swiggy offers decent upside, but we would prefer Zomato if asked to pick only one Zomato over Swiggy due to its superior execution in the past and market leadership across key segments Suggest that investors play both (preferably with higher weightage for Zomato), as in any case both are likely to be amongst the fastest growing consumption names Initiate U-P, TP Rs 325 India’s no-2 consumer app(FD, Quick Com, Out-of-Home), has a clear path to catch up with leader Zomato Quick Com more complex, with no sustainable economic profits Expect Group EBIT breakeven in FY28E even with 23% core rev CAGR Swiggy shares climbed 4.58% on the NSE to trade at ₹439.25 as at 11.05 am.

Prosus and its controlling shareholder Naspers Ltd. have invested $1.3 billion building a 31% stake in Swiggy ahead of its stock market debut in India on Wednesday. The food delivery firm is targeting an initial public offering valuation of up to $11.3 billion. Prosus will sell down shares in the IPO and retain 25% of Swiggy, similar to its stake in Tencent, Prosus’s Chief Investment Officer Ervin Tu said an interview. The share sale is expected to generate a return of more than $500 million for Prosus, he added. “We expect to benefit from the upside of the business, and the tailwinds of the fast-growing Indian market in future,” Tu said, noting that Prosus has invested in several Indian companies that could list on public markets. Bloomberg report Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” Track bl’s stock market live updates here Food tech major Swiggy’s IPO is set to unlock wealth to the tune of ₹9000 crore in employee stock ownership plan (Esop) wealth for its current and former employees, making it one of the largest wealth creation exercises of its kind in India’s startup ecosystem. Nearly 5,000 current and former employees are set to benefit, with around 500 Swiggy employees to enter the ‘crore-pati’ club when the firm makes its stock market debut, according to sources. Till date, Swiggy has has distributed ₹500 crore in Esops. In July this year, the company had announced its plan to buy back stocks worth up to $65 million. This kind of wealth creation by a new-age company is unmatched at this scale apart from Flipkart which hich has undertaken bigger scale of buyback or payouts in the past. In 2023, Flipkart had paid out a total of $700 million to 17,000 employees. Overall, Flipkart had over five share buybacks worth $1.4-1.5 billion in total over the past years. Swiggy’s founders and top management of Swiggy were allocated Esops worth nearly worth $271 million in its latest stock ownership plan. Investors probably won’t give a standing ovation for the e-commerce major’s market debut as they did when rival Zomato went public in 2021. Still, Swiggy can learn from Zomato’s epic stock meltdown the following year and an equally dramatic comeback since then. The best way for Swiggy to close the valuation gap with Zomato is to set clear profitability timeline and stick to the milestone targets. Investors love a good story, but Swiggy should bear in mind that these days, they’re quick to hit the sell button if earnings don’t meet estimates. Bloomberg input Food delivery and grocery major Swiggy’s initial public offering has been oversubscribed by 3.59 times after a tepid response in the first two days. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times — the highest, NII portion was booked 41 per cent and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. The ₹11,300-crore IPO comprises fresh capital raise of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹6,828 crore. Swiggy IPO price band has been set at ₹371-390 per share. The food delivery giant has raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors, including Fidelity and Blackrock, with sizeable participation from domestic investors. Shares of food delivery and grocery major ​Swiggy ​will be listed at the bourses today. The company has fixed the IPO price as Rs 370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an​ oversubscription of 3.60 times​, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. ​KS Badri Narayanan of businessline writes​ Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Elastic N.V. (ESTC) Unveils ‘Better Binary Quantization’ to Enhance Elasticsearch for AI and Machine Learning Data Processing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 15 AI News That Should Not Be Ignored. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) stands against the other AI stocks that should not be ignored. Artificial Intelligence is driving an unprecedented expansion in the potential market size for hardware and software products. According to Bain & Company, the market for AI-related hardware and software will witness annual growth rates of 40% to 55% over the next three years, potentially reaching a valuation between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027. Companies investing in artificial intelligence know exactly how big of an opportunity this is and are determined not to miss it. Keshav Murugesh, Group CEO of WNS, a global business process management company, talked about its significance at the “CNBC Connect” event in Bangkok. According to Murugesh, many companies are underprepared for AI’s impact, particularly in areas such as government regulation. As such, there is clearly an upside to investing early in the technology. “Three years from now, if you are investing significantly in generative AI, you might be disappointed, right? As we have seen in many technologies, sometimes the hype is much bigger than the reality. But, three years from now if you are not investing in generative AI, you are going to be terrified. Because those companies that made the investments now, will be far ahead of you”. READ ALSO: 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 8 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Invest in Now Let’s look at the latest developments in artificial intelligence to assess how they are helping businesses, customers, and society to reach the next level of success. In its first, Chinese scientists have developed the first AI-powered robot lifeguard to stand watch over the riverside site in Luohe city. Using artificial intelligence, big data, and navigation and tracking technologies, the robot will operate without any human intervention. While it is not the first robot lifeguard, it is the first to be fully automated and needs no intervention, South China Morning Post reported. In other news, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged more than $65 billion of fresh support for the nation’s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector. The move comes in hopes of narrowing the gap between Tokyo and global powers on chip support. Ishiba notes that he wishes to spread positive examples of regional revitalization like TSMC’s chip plant in Kumamoto across the nation. Speaking of artificial intelligence, it seems that artificial intelligence companies are no longer scaling at the pace they were initially and that the outcomes from scaling up pre-training—the stage in AI model training where large volumes of unlabeled data are used to learn language patterns and structures—have seemingly reached a plateau. To overcome this plateau, researchers are now exploring “test-time compute,” a technique that enhances existing AI models during the so-called “inference” phase, or when the model is being used. This shift has the potential to reshape the AI landscape and impact the demand for hardware, challenging Nvidia’s dominance in training chips as the focus moves to the inference market. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A group of software engineers working in an open, futuristic office. Market Capitalization: $9.24 billion Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) is a search artificial intelligence (AI) company that delivers hosted and managed solutions designed to run in hybrid, public or private clouds, and multi-cloud environments. The company leverages AI across its product offerings, particularly within its “Elastic Stack” comprising Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and Logstash (also known as the ELK Stack) and more. On November 11, Elastic N.V. (NYSE:ESTC) introduced a new feature called Better Binary Quantization (BBQ) for Elasticsearch, the company’s open-source search and analytics engine. The BBQ tool will make it easier to store and work with complex data types known as vectors, which are often used in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The development of BBQ is a significant step toward data processing and storage, enhancing the capabilities of Elasticsearch. It is available as a tech preview for both self-managed and cloud users of Elasticsearch and will be contributed to Apache Lucene, an open-source Java library used as a search engine. Elasticsearch is built on top of Lucene. “Elasticsearch is evolving to become one of the best vector databases in the world, and we see our users wanting to put more and more vectorized data in it. Better Binary Quantization is our latest innovation to reduce the resources needed to store vectorized data and provide freedom to our users to vectorize all the things.” Overall ESTC ranks 13th on our list of the AI stocks that should not be ignored. While we acknowledge the potential of ESTC as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ESTC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Chinese EV firm swoops on German flying taxi start-up

An aircraft from the Baden-based air cab manufacturer Volocopter with the ADAC logo is parked on the airfield in August. Photo: Getty Chinese conglomerate Geely is in advanced talks to take control of Germany’s Volocopter in a deal that would save the flying taxi start-up from potential bankruptcy, according to people familiar with the talks. Zhejiang Geely Holding Group has discussed taking a majority stake in Volocopter by leading a consortium that will inject fresh capital into the company, said the people, asking not to be identified discussing private matters. The funding round would be about $95m (€89.6m) in exchange for roughly 85pc ownership, said one of the people. The family office of German industrialist Gerhard Sturm would also participate in the deal, the person said. If completed, the deal would slash the start-up’s valuation from a peak of $1.9bn in 2022 to about $110m. The Geely group is working through due diligence and aims to finish next month. Volocopter has also held discussions with other potential bidders. No final decisions on the terms have been made and the deal could still fall apart. Volocopter’s financial troubles show the fraught effort to make flying cars a reality in the US and Europe, where start-ups often collapse before they’re able to sell a single ride. In China, however, the government has made boosting the “low-altitude” economy a priority, along with an electric vehicle industry that is bombarding Germany’s automakers with competition. A Geely spokesperson declined to comment. Sturm’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. “Due to ongoing financing and contractual obligations, we will not disclose investor names, amounts raised, or any predictions for the future,” a representative for Volocopter said. With the Geely deal, Volocopter is weighing moving the manufacturing of its future aircraft to China, the people said. Its current, smaller model is being built in Germany. The Volocopter representative said it considers the German facility a “reference facility” for working out efficient production practices. That will give the company a blueprint for scaling up as it expands overseas, she added. Formed in 2011, Volocopter was among a raft of start-ups developing electric vertical take-off and landing, or what the industry called EVTOL. It raised $600m from German firms and global investors, including Mercedes-Benz Group, DB Schenker, Blackrock and Neom, Saudi Arabia’s futuristic city project. The start-up burned through cash and swapped out its chief executive in 2022. Volocopter planned to debut its first commercial aircraft, a two-seater called the VoloCity, at the Olympics this summer in Paris. But it missed the deadline.

On a chilly and crisp autumnal day, mourners at the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook, south Dublin, heard about “a truly remarkable woman” who had a “speaking voice of silk”. Tribute was paid to the talented broadcaster, writer and musician, who died at the age of 90 last Friday. It came five years after her famous husband’s passing on November 4, 2019. Kathleen Watkins at the InterContinental Hotel in Ballsbridge. Photo: Steve Humphreys As was fitting for someone renowned for her love of the arts, her funeral mass included classical music pieces chosen by Kathleen herself, along with extracts from her favourite poems. Among those in attendance were RTÉ figures such as Marty Whelan, Mary Kennedy, Dave Fanning, Joe Duffy, Ray D’Arcy, Mike Murphy and Olivia O’Leary. Kevin Bakhurst, the RTÉ director-general, was also in attendance, alongside Riverdance co-founder Moya Doherty, film producer John McColgan and presenter Pat Kenny. Suzy Byrne (second from left) with family members including her sister Crona Byrne (right) after their mother’s funeral. Photos: Steve Humphreys During the funeral mass, officiated by Fr Leonard Moloney, daughter Suzy told the congregation how her mum was “a lady”. “She was full of grace, gentility and love. Her life was dominated by four words – family, friendship, faith and fun,” she said. A mother to Suzy and Crona and grandmother to five, she had died peacefully at Blackrock Clinic at her favourite time of the day, which was dawn. Kathleen had many monikers over the years but her fondest one was that of ‘Nana Kit’. Suzy said that when she told her parents she was pregnant, Gay said her mother was “speechless for the first time in her life”. “Then she spoke. ‘From today, I will answer to all as Nana Kit.’ I laughed, saying, ‘Mum, I have seven months to go’. Her only response: ‘I am Nana Kit now.’” As soon as her first grandson Cian arrived, she was “besotted”. He was joined by grandchildren Sadhbh, Kate, Saoirse and Harry. She had a “magical place in her heart” for children, Suzy said. Joe Duffy (left) outside the church with fellow mourners. Photo: Steve Humphreys Being a grandmother inspired her to create a series of popular children’s books, Pigín of Howth. “It was through piglet that Nana Kit educated our children on so many levels, by making it fun and telling them stories. It’s hard to illustrate how precious these Sundays were “We watched in awe as the children hung on her every word. Through Pigín and co, Nana Kit was a grandmother to a nation of children. Our children shared her as Nana Kit, just as myself and Crona shared both Mum and Dad as we grew up.” Most treasured of all were those lazy Sundays with Suzy’s family at their old home in Howth, having moved to Sandymount in recent years. “It started off as a late lunch but quickly became all day,” she said. “It’s hard to illustrate how precious these Sundays were. Their visits defined our week as a family. We slipped easily into the tradition of the full Sunday roast, the ritual of sitting around for hours, just chatting.” John McColgan and Moya Doherty at the funeral of Kathleen Watkins. Photo: Collins Kathleen placed an emphasis on her friendships. After the loss of her “soulmate” Gay, she turned to her circle of pals who “welcomed her with open arms”. Having asked one of them for a memory of her mother, she recalled it was “one of beauty – beauty of face, beauty of demeanour, of action and reaction”. “Today, we remember with love and gratitude our mother, our Nana Kit and your friend,” she said. “Mum had great faith. She knew without question that she would be reunited with Dad when she left us. Spiritually, she believed first and foremost in love. If you have love, you will have joy. With those, you have enough. “Today, I say goodbye to my mother and my closest friend. I never knew a day without her in it. How lucky I am to be able to say that. God granted her a peaceful death at the end of an incredible life. She gave us all such joy and love. We will have that forever.” Fr Leonard said she was a “woman of empathy and compassion” and spoke of her long marriage of 55 years. They were loved, both of them “Ireland doesn’t do monarchs. But if we did, I do think Gay and Kathleen would have been contenders for the crown. They were loved, both of them,” he said. As well as being RTÉ’s first continuity announcer, she was also a talented harpist and folk singer and inspired granddaughter Sadhbh to take up the harp. Former presenter Pat Kenny. Photo: Steve Humphreys You could hear a pin drop as Sadhbh played a tribute to her grandmother with a rendition of Eleanor Plunkett. As was her wish, as indicated in her last-ever interview with the Sunday Independent, Frank McNamara performed Pie Jesu during Communion before Gabriel’s Oboe. Grandson Cian brought the mass to a close with a final reflection on his esteemed grandmother. She had advised him to “always give people your time”. “It is the most precious gift of all and you should always give people the benefit of the doubt as you never know what anyone is going through,” he said. Her remains were taken for a private burial before mourners were invited to toast her eventful life at her and Gay’s favourite spot, the Intercontinental hotel.

The company has fixed the IPO price as ₹370, at the upper end of the price band ₹371-390. The issue, which struggled on the first two days, sailed through with an oversubscription of 3.60 times, thanks to QIB investors. Given the faltering of large IPOs such as LIC and Hyundai India, marketmen expect only a muted listing from Swiggy. The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) portion was booked 6.02 times—the highest, and the retail investor’s portion was subscribed 1.14 times. The employees’ book was subscribed 1.65 times. However, wealthy individual investors (NIIs) remain lukewarm to the issue as the portion reserved for them remained undersubscribed at 0.41 times. Prashanth Tapse, Senior VP (Research), Mehta Equities Ltd, said: “We believe the majority of the investor especially NII’s & retail stayed back on few reason like Negative cash flow business model followed by concern on high competition and ongoing negative market mood. Considering low subscription demand from NII’s & Retail investors followed by market sentiments, there is a very high possibility of flat to negative listing in the range of +or - 5-10% on its issue price.” The Rs. 11,300-crore IPO comprised a fresh capital of ₹4,499 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of 17.51 shares worth ₹ 6,828 crore. The food delivery major raised ₹5,085 crore from institutional investors through the anchor book. Among the investors who were allocated shares are New World Fund Inc, Government Pension Fund Global, Nomura Funds Ireland Public Limited Company, Fidelity Funds, BlackRock, Allianz Global Investors Fund and Schroder International, according to a circular uploaded on BSE’s website. ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund (MF), SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd were also allotted shares in the anchor round. Swiggy’s upper price band valuation is estimated at around ₹95,000 crore. In comparison, rival Zomato, which went public in July 2021, currently has a market valuation of ₹2.25 lakh crore. Swiggy plans to use the IPO proceeds to fund investments in the Material Subsidiary, Scootsy, technology and cloud infrastructure investments, brand marketing and business promotion expenses to enhance the brand awareness and visibility of its platform across segments, and inorganic growth through unidentified acquisitions and general corporate purposes. “Post Listing: For allotted investors, one should not expect any kind of listing gains. Hence, only risky investors should consider the company to HOLD FOR LONG TREM despite knowing short term volatility and competitive pressures in the sector. For non-allottees, we advise to wait and watch for the price to settle and revisit the space with better discounted opportunity,” said Tapse. Swiggy is an online food delivery platform that emerged in India in 2014. It offers a convenient solution for ordering food from various restaurants. The company operates five business units: Food Delivery, out-of-home consumption, including restaurant visits and events; Quick Commerce, offering on-demand delivery of groceries and household items; supply chain and distribution, providing B2B deliveries, warehousing, logistics, and distribution for wholesalers and retailers; and platform innovation, introducing new services like Swiggy Genie and Swiggy Minis. Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, Citigroup Global Markets India, Jefferies India, Avendus Capital, J.P. Morgan India, BoFA Securities India, and ICICI Securities were the book-running lead managers of the IPO. Comments BACK TO TOP Comments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

Title: Is Block, Inc. (SQ) the Best Cryptocurrency Stock to Buy According to Wall Street?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) stands against the other cryptocurrency stocks. Post Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections, the price of bitcoin rose above $80,000 for the first time ever. Other cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin which is the favorite coin of Elon Musk, a strong Trump supporter, are also posting gains, as reported by BBC. On November 12, Bitcoin neared a record $90,000. While Trump has revealed his plans to make America the crypto capital of the world, he has stated that he would be sacking the current chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, who has led the SEC's crackdown on the crypto market. Gensler tried to regulate the market which he believed, was at least partially made up of securities trading illegally. Market analyst at StoneX Financial, Matt Simpson, emphasized that bitcoin prices could go as high as $100,000 in case the Trump administration deregulates crypto. Although Trump was once railing against cryptocurrencies, he later embraced crypto as he started a new crypto business called World Liberty Financial in September. While commenting on the crypto industry, he said “It’s very young and very growing” and that he believes in it. He has also expressed support for domestic Bitcoin miners saying that if crypto is going to define the future, he wants it to be mined, minted, and made in the US. Bitcoin has surged more than 26% since election day on November 5. As reported by CNBC, Mike Colonnese, an analyst at H.C. Wainwright, stated: “Bitcoin is now in price discovery mode after breaking through all-time highs early last Wednesday morning when it was officially declared that Trump won the election. Strong positive sentiment is likely to persist through the balance of 2024 and [we] see bitcoin prices potentially reaching the six-figure mark by the end of this year.” As the crypto market anticipates a positive and bright regulatory climate under the Trump administration, crypto-focused stocks also surged post-election. Vice President and General Manager of Robinhood, Johann Kerbrat, appeared on CNBC and referred to the post-election scenario as a big moment for the firm on the crypto side considering bitcoin was not even a fraction of its current price two years ago. The firm saw a lot of activity on the crypto volume. While the company has faced scrutiny from the SEC under the Biden administration, Kerbrat is hopeful to see more crypto-friendly policymaking. Bitwise’s Matt Hougan seconded this stance when he appeared on CNBC Crypto World on November 12. In his opinion, Trump’s economic policies should be positive for crypto. He referred to the prevailing market as a golden age of crypto and that it’s right to be bullish. While he thinks that crypto has been fighting with one hand tied behind its back during the past four years and has faced a lot of regulatory unclarity, the scenario has shifted 180 degrees with a positive regulatory environment to look forward to. Finally, Hougan calls the market a win-win post-election. Regarding the future outlook for Bitcoin, he states that there is a clear path right up to $100,000 by 2024’s end while $200,000 is completely reasonable for 2025, considering that the trend is up and is going to stay intact for a while. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 12 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street, we first utilized stock screeners, ETFs, and online rankings to make an extended list of the major crypto companies. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 12 stocks from our list which had the highest upside potential, as of November 12. The 12 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street have been arranged in ascending order of their average upside potential. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). People using the Cash App paying for goods and services, highlighting the impact the of the company's payment tools. Average Upside Potential: 8.25% Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) is a technology company that focuses on financial services and helps expand access to the economy. Block comprises Square, Cash App, Spiral, TIDAL, and TBD. Square offers an integrated ecosystem of commerce solutions, business software, and banking services for sellers to grow their business while Cash App allows sending, spending, or investing money in stocks or bitcoin. Spiral advances the use of Bitcoin by building and funding free, open-source projects whereas TIDAL is a platform for musicians and their fans. TBD eases access to Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies. Block, Inc.’s (NYSE:SQ) growth remains at scale with rising profitability. The core businesses are robust with adjusted operating income margins growing significantly for both Square and Cash App. The firm has also expanded its addressable market over time. With Square representing a nearly $130 billion gross profit opportunity and Cash App representing a nearly $75 billion gross profit opportunity in the US, the market potential is strong. The strong profitable growth across Block depicts that its ecosystems are efficiently delivering differentiated value to its customers. The firm has also shifted to a functional organizational structure to improve collaboration across ecosystems. In the third quarter, the firm’s gross profit rose 19% year-over-year to $2.25 billion. Square generated a gross profit of $932 million, up 16% year-over-year, due to strength in its software and integrated payments and banking products. Cash App generated a gross profit of $1.31 billion, up 21% year-over-year, driven by strong performance across Cash App Card, Cash App Borrow, and BNPL platform. Overall, the firm delivered year-over-year improvement across all profitability measures including adjusted EBITDA. The company’s potential for continued growth and profitability across its key businesses, its ability to generate substantial free cash flow, and its strategic shift to a functional organizational structure make it attractive to investors. Overall SQ ranks 11th on our list of the best cryptocurrency stocks to buy according to Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of SQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than SQ but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Search, Blackrock, iBit, BTF, Bitcoin ETF fund surpassing their gold one?

Written by in . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has recently surpassed its iShares Gold Trust (IAU) in assets under management (AUM). As of November 7, 2024, IBIT’s AUM reached $33.17 billion, slightly exceeding IAU’s $32.96 billion. This milestone is notable given that IBIT was launched in January 2024, while IAU has been available since 2005. The rapid growth of IBIT reflects increasing investor interest in Bitcoin as a digital asset. The surge in IBIT’s AUM coincides with a significant rise in Bitcoin’s price, which has recently reached new all-time highs. This trend suggests a growing acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs among investors seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies through traditional financial instruments. In comparison, ProShares’ Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), which invests in Bitcoin futures contracts, has also experienced growth but remains smaller in AUM compared to BlackRock’s IBIT. The surpassing of BlackRock’s gold ETF by its Bitcoin ETF highlights a shift in investor preferences toward digital assets. This development underscores the evolving landscape of investment strategies and the increasing prominence of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. I’m the number 1 idea supplier!

Title: Kathleen Watkins: Funeral Mass remembers a woman whose life was a ‘hymn of love’

Kathleen Watkins lived “the wonderful life”, her daughter told her funeral Mass. Ms Watkins, a broadcaster, harpist, singer and children’s author, died at the age of 90 last week. On Tuesday, her remains journeyed from Howth, where she originally lived with her late husband Gay Byrne, to the Church of the Sacred Heart in Donnybrook, next door to the RTÉ campus where both had groundbreaking careers. Her life was dominated by the four Fs, her daughter Suzy O’Byrne told the congregation: family, friendship, faith and fun. She was known as Kathleen to her husband and to the wider public; Kit to her friends and family; and Nana Kit to her five grandchildren, a title she bestowed on herself when she became a grandmother in 2004. [ Róisín Ingle on Kathleen Watkins: She loved life, poetry and Gaybo. Conversation flowed from her like musicOpens in new window ] “It is this wonderful life we celebrate today – a life truly lived to the full, a woman who developed all of her talents, but remained interested in learning,” Ms O’Byrne said in her funeral eulogy. She was first and foremost a wife and mother. Gay Byrne “quite simply adored mum”, Ms O’Byrne said. She had created a sanctuary for him at home and did the lion’s share of the parenting. Their lives together were “relentless” and her support for her husband “unwavering”. “‘You must understand,’ she told us. ‘Everybody wants a piece of your father.’” She had persuaded him to come out of retirement and start broadcasting again. She had a huge interest in children and always gave her time to them. She had been in and out of the Blackrock Clinic for the past year but was always cheerful and she valued her friendships to the end of her life. In his sermon, Fr Leonard Moloney, the Irish Jesuit Provincial who had also been the chief celebrant at her husband’s funeral Mass in 2019, said Ireland had no monarchy but if there had been one, it would have been Gay Byrne and Kathleen Watkins. [ Kathleen Watkins, broadcaster and author, has died aged 90Opens in new window ] They had been a beloved fixture of Irish life for decades. They had made friends the length and breadth of Ireland, many of whom joined them on holidays in Donegal, he explained. The Mass booklet featured the now well-known photograph of her in the car driving off from her husband’s funeral in 2019 applauded away from the steps of the Pro-Cathedral in Dublin by a large crowd led by President Michael D Higgins and then taoiseach Leo Varadkar. She was the first female broadcaster on RTÉ, and the first and only woman to present the Rose of Tralee. Yet, she was an “ordinary” woman, Fr Moloney said, “but only in the best sense of that word. She was so talented, but she was not egotistical or egocentrical.” That extended to her dying wish that no symbols of her life be placed on the altar other than a crucifix and a Bible. [ Kathleen Watkins: ‘Occasionally I find myself talking to Gay in my head’Opens in new window ] “Why? She didn’t want anything to distract from the Mass. In her being ordinary, she really was extraordinary. Her life was a hymn of love. She was a woman of empathy and compassion.” Her grandchild Cian O’Byrne said Nana Kit had lived under two abiding principles. One was to give people time “which is the most precious gift at all” and to always give people the benefit of the doubt because you do not know what they are going through. “We take this opportunity today to thank Nana Kit for her time, her joy and her unconditional love and support and most of all her friendship,” he said. Music was provided by Frank McNamara, a long-time music director of the Late Late Show, the soprano Claudia Boyle, the oboe musician David Agnew and the Lassus Scholars. The harp was played by her niece, Sadhbh O’Byrne, Ms Watkins having been a harpist before she met her husband. In the congregation, RTÉ was represented by director-general Kevin Bakhurst. Broadcasters Joe Duffy, Dave Fanning and Mary Kennedy were present alongside John McColgan and his wife, former RTÉ board chairman, Moya Doherty; the entrepreneur Harry Crosbie; and Ballymaloe founder Darina Allen.

A psychiatrist has told a High Court jury she diagnosed a woman with “severe” post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) some two years after being allegedly sexually assaulted by Conor McGregor. Dr Ann Leader said she formed that opinion in December 2020 in relation to Nikita Hand, who has alleged Mr McGregor sexually assaulted her on December 9th 2018. Her opinion was based on reading Ms Hand’s 150-page statement to gardaí, notes of counselling sessions with Ms Hand on several dates during 2019 and 2020, Ms Hand’s medical records and examining Ms Hand herself. Ms Hand provided an account of rape, constant nightmares, panic attacks, detachment from friends, was worried photos of her bruised body may be circulating on line, and felt her daughter and partner were also suffering, the witness said. Ms Hand had said she had no memory of alleged consensual sex with a second man on the day of the alleged rape and described feeling “like a lump of meat”. Dr Leader gave evidence on Tuesday, the fifth day of the civil action by Ms Hand (35), a hair colourist, against Mr McGregor and James Lawrence, of Rafters Road, Drimnagh. Ms Hand is seeking damages for alleged separate sexual assaults of her by both men in Dublin’s Beacon Hotel on December 9th 2018. Both respondents have denied her claims. The jury has heard Ms Hand drank alcohol and took cocaine while at her Christmas work party on the night of December 8th 2018 and continued partying into December 9th. CCTV footage showed Ms Hand, a female friend, Mr McGregor and Mr Lawrence arriving at the Beacon hotel about 12.30pm, Mr McGregor leaving with her friend around 6.13pm, and Ms Hand and Mr Lawrence leaving around 10.30pm. In evidence on Tuesday, Dr Leader said, having carried out a mental state examination of Ms Hand in December 2020, her opinion was Ms Hand was traumatised. She diagnosed Ms Hand with severe PTSD, a psychiatric condition. Ms Hand, she said, had pronounced symptoms of PTSD including nightmares, flashbacks, wanting to die, inability to function normally and feeling dirty, ashamed and guilty. She needed, and was getting, appropriate treatment for PTSD. On review in March 2024, she considered Ms Hand had improved but still had fluctuating symptoms of PTSD. In cross-examination, Dr Leader agreed with Remy Farrell SC, for Mr McGregor, she did not have regard to CCTV when forming her opinion. Ms Hand had anxiety symptoms about 2018 in relation to lifestyle/work stresses for which she was prescribed medication and had counselling, she said. She did not have PTSD then, Dr Leader added. The court also heard evidence from Eithne Scully, a paramedic, said she examined Ms Hand on the morning of December 10th 2018 before she was taken by ambulance to the Rotunda hospital sexual assault unit. Ms Hand’s chief concern was about a tampon “that had been pushed up way too far”. She had a small cut on her chin, there appeared to be some bruising around her lower neck and bruising around her chest, abdomen, buttocks and thighs. “I had not actually seen someone so bruised in a long time.” Ms Hand told her she had been grabbed around the neck and said something about fighting somebody off and there was a threat made, Ms Scully said. Ms Hand did not name her attacker, she said. Dr Frank Clarke, a GP at Walkinstown medical centre, said Ms Hand was a patient there over some 20 years. She had a history over many years of being an anxious person and was treated with serotonin medication. He certified her as unfit for work from May 5th 2019 and provided reports following the alleged assaults. Ms Hand had suffered serious physical and psychological injury and has significant ongoing distressing symptoms due to PTSD which will require ongoing treatment, he said. In cross-examination, he agreed with Mr Farrell, in relation to most cases of PTSD, doctors rely on a patient’s reporting of an event. Detective Sergeant Peter Woods told Ray Boland SC, for Ms Hand, he was stationed at Blackrock Garda station in 2019 and involved in investigating the alleged assault of Ms Hand. She gave him certain information on January 11th 2019 and he took possession of a black jump suit she had worn on December 9th 2018. The jump suit was shown to the jury. He agreed Conor McGregor was arrested by arrangement at the Garda station on January 17th 2019 for the alleged rape of Ms Hand on December 9th 2018. At that point, the judge asked the jury to go out while discussion on legal issues took place. When the jury returned, the judge asked them to return to court on Wednesday when he said it was expected, after some further evidence, the plaintiff’s case would close and the next stage of the case would begin.

Title: Jim Cramer on Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR): ‘This One Will Do Best’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer was talking about. Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the market’s reaction to the election results. He noted that the trading session on November 6 was largely influenced by a collective sigh of relief from traders who were glad the election was over. With President-elect Donald Trump set to take office, many were preparing for the shifts his administration could bring. Cramer pointed out that the market responded positively to Trump’s victory, stating: “The market likes Donald J. Trump and it loves a peaceful transition to the next president. We got both and we had a monster-buying celebration. It was a bull jailbreak and the bears never knew what trampled them.” Cramer reflected on the uncertainty leading up to the election, with many investors fearing a prolonged and contentious process. But with the winner now clear, Cramer argued that the market is better off knowing what lies ahead. He remarked: “Let’s understand that many people thought we’d have a contested election, which would cause tremendous uncertainty. The fact that we already know the winner is a huge win for the stock market in itself, which makes it a magnet for new money. This election, with its vicious maelstrom of hate and fear, is finally over.” READ ALSO Jim Cramer Says These 10 Stocks Can Do Well Regardless of Who Wins and Jim Cramer’s Latest Game Plan: 15 Stocks to Watch One of Cramer's main focuses was Trump's proposed tax cuts, which he believes will have a substantial impact on corporate profits. Cramer emphasized that the tax cuts are expected to boost earnings, particularly by lowering corporate tax rates, which would directly increase profit estimates and earnings per share. Cramer also highlighted the importance of maintaining low interest rates for these benefits to materialize. He cautioned that while the current environment might feel like a party, there could be risks down the line, especially as debt continues to grow. Despite these concerns, Cramer seemed optimistic, suggesting that the market could continue to rally as long as interest rates stay low and corporate tax cuts come to fruition. However, Cramer also pointed out a potential complication and commented: “We also have to accept that we will have another earning season right at the time of the inauguration. So we'll have to worry about those earnings too, but not yet.” Additionally, Cramer suggested that there could be more significant market moves in the near future, especially if President-elect Trump makes comments about the Federal Reserve that investors find unsettling. He said that such remarks could trigger a negative reaction from the market, potentially leading to a downturn before things settle again. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 16 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 6 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A software engineer manipulating a vast network of code on virtual monitors. Cramer acknowledged that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) is a popular stock and commented that it will perform well. “There's a sense that a Trump presidency will bring more hacks. Probably won't, though. This one will do best, Palantir. It's upending the Pentagon procurement process and making it possible for us to play offense when it comes to cybersecurity. President-elect Trump's gonna have a lot of fun with Alex Karp, the co-founder and CEO of Palantir… [It] can go much higher, I don't care about the valuation. I know it's a popular stock. It can go higher.” Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is a prominent developer of software platforms specializing in complex data integration and decision-making. The company primarily serves government agencies, particularly in the intelligence sector, as well as commercial clients. Over the years, the company has made significant strides in positioning itself as one of the key beneficiaries of the growing demand for AI technologies, largely through its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). This focus on AI innovation has helped the company gain recognition as a leader in the field. For the third quarter, CEO Alex Karp credited Palantir’s (NYSE:PLTR) success to the continued and "unwavering" demand for its AI products, which he sees as a promising indicator of future growth. The company’s performance was especially strong in the U.S., where revenue rose 44%, reaching $499 million. The U.S. commercial segment was a particularly bright spot, showing a 54% jump in revenue to $179 million. Overall PLTR ranks 14th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer was talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PLTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: New Dublin brewery backed by some of Ireland’s top publicans, with two beers in initial launch

A new €1.8 million brewery backed by the families behind some of the country’s best-known pubs has been launched in Dublin. Changing Times Brewery is based in Glasnevin, along the banks of the Royal Canal, and will initially employ nine people, with two full-time positions and seven other roles. Its backers include Dublin publicans Willie Aherne and Paul Sheehan of The Palace Bar on Fleet Street and Sheehans Pub on Chatham Street respectively, as well as Benny McCabe, who owns a number of popular bars in Cork, and brewer Shane Long. The backers said the idea for the brewery came from listening to feedback from customers over a number of years, which led to conversations between the publican families, and eventually detailed discussions on creating their own brewery. [ Electric Picnic vs craft beer: how Irish microbreweries are fighting back against the industry’s biggest playersOpens in new window ] The brewery’s products will be stocked in The Palace; The Long Hall; The Swan; The Bankers; Arthur Maynes in Donnybrook; Devitts; Doheny & Nesbitts; Sheehans; Lemon and Duke; The Bridge 1859; The Blackrock; The Bank; McSorleys; Darkey Kelly’s; and The Ferryman. The brewery will initially provide two products – Daydreamer Lager and After Hours Pale Ale – but hopes to expand its product range early next year. The products are also expected to be expanded to additional pubs in the coming weeks. Mr Aherne of The Palace said the brewery was set up to “give pub goers something new and something locally brewed”. “Our customers were saying they were in the mood for change and that we should be brewing our own range of beers,” he said. “We listened and took note. This led to conversations with other families of publicans, whose customers were saying the same things and eventually we decided to create this brewery so we could make those customer suggestions a reality. [ Roe & Co toasts Palace Bar bicentenaryOpens in new window ] “Effectively, the concept for Changing Times Brewery was born over the pub counters. We look forward to giving our customers a taste of that something new, that change they have been looking for.” Speaking of the concept behind the name, Mr Sheehan of Sheehans Pub said: “Change has been good for modern Ireland. We’re no longer a country that is stuck in our ways or who does things just because that’s the way they have always been done. That is the spirit behind Changing Times – there’s always time for something new. We wanted to address those changing tastes with this brewery.” Brewer Shane Long said the products were brewed using “quality Irish ingredients from the best producers”. “Combining high-calibre hops, barley, malt, yeast and more with the insights of our customers, we’ve been able to develop draught with a great taste that we believe will help change people’s minds and become their regular pint,” he added.

Title: Bitcoin rally slows as it nears $90,000 — now with a bigger market cap than silver

Time Published: 2024-11-12T12:59:00Z
Full Content:
On the heels of a rally sparked by Donald Trump’s presidential election win, Bitcoin’s price is finally moderating — but not before beating out silver to become the eighth largest asset in the world. As of Tuesday morning, the leading cryptocurrency was valued at about $86,900, giving it a market capitalization of $1.72 trillion. That gives it a lead on silver’s $1.71 trillion market cap, but still falls well short of gold’s estimated $17.52 trillion. Bitcoin’s price had risen 5.6% over the prior 24 hours, adding to a rally that saw its value surge 30% in less than a week and hit several new record highs. Bitcoin is expected to continue barreling forward as investors’ optimism and enthusiasm grows on Trump’s return to the White House. Some analysts say Bitcoin could even cross the $100,000 threshold as a result. That seems increasingly likely as it nears the $90,000 mark, with six weeks to go before year’s end. Starting in January, crypto fans and investors will — for the first time ever — have a friendly face in the Oval Office. Throughout his campaign, Trump took an unprecedented pro-Bitcoin stance, championing the digital currency as a symbol of financial independence and an alternative to traditional banking. Labeling himself as the “crypto candidate,” Trump fully embraced digital assets, even accepting donations in a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and Solana. Trump also attended and addressed a Bitcoin conference in July, where he touted a commitment to positioning America at the forefront of the crypto revolution. Among other promises to the crypto industry on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to create a national Bitcoin reserve, as well as a “Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council.” “The rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,” he said. Following Trump’s election win last week, investors began pouring cash into spot Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds. On Thursday alone, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs recorded unprecedented inflows of $1.3 billion. BlackRock (BLK+2.21%), the world’s largest asset manager, led with more than $1 billion directed into its Bitcoin ETF, while Fidelity’s FBTC saw an inflow of $190 million, according to data from Farside. Bitcoin’s new all-time highs have lifted the entire cryptocurrency market, driving significant gains across a number of other digital assets. Ether, the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, was priced at more than $3,200 as of Tuesday morning, and Dogecoin jumped 30% in the past 24 hours. Others, including Solana and Cardano, have taken a tumble. All together, the global crypto market has a valuation of $2.91 trillion, a 4.09% increase in the past day, according to CoinMarketCap. — Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article.

Title: Bitcoin bull run could continue for 200 days before possible US recession – Report

As Bitcoin reaches day 554 of its cycle, Copper.co suggests a peak is aligned with potential mid-2025 US recession forecasts. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitcoin’s current market cycle indicates a potential peak in about 200 days, coinciding with forecasts of a possible US recession by mid-2025. According to recent research from Copper.co, this alignment emerges as Bitcoin reaches day 554 of its cycle. Historically, Bitcoin’s market cycles average 756 days from the point when the annual average growth of its market capitalization turns positive until it hits a price peak. Copper.co assesses that the present cycle began around mid-2023, shortly before BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Bitcoin could peak around mid-2025, approximately 200 days from now, if the pattern holds. Copper.co uses JPMorgan’s estimate of a 45% chance of a US recession occurring in the second half of 2025 to showcase a potential overlap of Bitcoin’s peak with economic downturn predictions, adding a layer of complexity to market expectations. Investors may find this intersection significant when considering portfolio strategies amid macroeconomic uncertainties. Realized volatility for Bitcoin currently stands at 50%, reflecting the standard deviation of returns from the market’s mean return. Implied volatility, which gauges market expectations for future volatility, recently hit its highest level of the year. This suggests ongoing market turbulence as 2025 approaches, with a possible bullish undertone influencing trading behaviors. Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 60, significantly lower than previous bull market highs. Copper.co’s report highlights that by extending the RSI’s look-back period to four years—a timeframe that reduces short-term noise—the indicator shows substantial room for growth. This metric implies that Bitcoin could build momentum into the new year, potentially reaching higher valuation levels. Inactive Bitcoin supply, representing coins held without movement for extended periods, is increasing amid record prices. This trend indicates that long-term holders maintain their positions, but vigilance is advised. Should these investors begin to move assets, it could signal shifts in market forces or profit-taking activities. Per Copper.co’s analysis, combining these factors paints a nuanced picture of Bitcoin’s trajectory. The interplay between market cycles, volatility measures, and macroeconomic forecasts illustrates the importance of monitoring multiple indicators.

Title: Ajay Banga

Ajay Banga didn’t like the existing decor, so when he took over as World Bank president he gave his grand two-story corner office a makeover. Old-school leather furniture? Gone. Dark lighting that made the space feel like a dungeon? Replaced. And a depressing painting? Swapped out for three framed motivational quotes: “Question everything always,” “Done is better than perfect,” and “Fail harder.” “They are kind of my philosophy of working,” he tells me only moments after my walking in the door. My conversation with Banga at the World Bank’s Washington, D.C., headquarters dug into the wonkiest details of climate finance, from the role portfolio guarantees can play in reducing credit risk to the investment challenges posed by volatile currencies in emerging markets. But his quick office tour offered just as much insight about his approach to running the world’s most important development bank: seemingly small tweaks can make a huge difference. Banga entered office in 2023 after his controversial predecessor, David Malpass, was forced to resign following controversial remarks that seemed to doubt the science of climate change. Many environmentalists called for a full-scale revamp of the 80-year-old World Bank and other international financial institutions. The bank’s most powerful members—including and especially the U.S.—have also pushed for a greater focus on climate while stopping short of endorsing some of the boldest efforts to remake the institution. Banga has approached the task judiciously. Under his leadership, the bank has added climate to its mission statement. To implement his agenda, he has pursued a range of seemingly small reforms that can have a big impact accelerating global climate action and intertwining it with the bank’s long-standing development agenda. He has tweaked the rules about how much the World Bank can lend, freeing up space to finance more climate projects. He has sought to integrate climate change into other development programs, from agriculture to education. And he has worked closely with the private sector in hopes that companies will step up to invest the lion’s share of the trillions of dollars needed to pay for expanding clean energy in the Global South. “There’s a whole Rubik’s Cube to be solved,” he says. “If it begins to make sense numerically, money does flood in.” This work comes as the focus of the global climate conversation increasingly turns toward finance—both for the energy transition and the adaptation needed to prepare communities around the world for the increasingly dire effects of rising temperatures. Research has found that emerging markets and developing countries need to spend upwards of $2 trillion annually to meet global climate goals. And at the annual U.N. climate conference—this November known as COP29 and held in Baku, Azerbaijan—diplomats from nearly 200 countries are working to hash out a climate-finance deal that lays out how much countries in the Global North will give to help their developing counterparts. The most ambitious proposals call on wealthy nations to provide upwards of a collective $1 trillion each year to the Global South. Banga knows that the World Bank’s work is a critical part of the picture, but he tries not to dwell on it. Getting the small things right first will eventually lead to big changes, he says. “Rather than get bogged down by the trillions,” he says, “work on solutions, and let them build at scale.’” In late October, as finance ministers from around the world flocked to Washington, D.C., for the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Banga darted between conversations on agriculture, gender, and jobs. From a quick glance at his schedule, climate change barely seemed to come up. But actually listening to him talk paints a different picture. At an agriculture dialogue, his announcement to double the bank’s agriculture-finance commitments to $9 billion annually by 2030 included programs for smallholder farmers to incentivize greener practices. His gender strategy links gender inequality with growing weather extremes; simply put, more fragile societies lead to increased risk of gender violence. And he frames investments in jobs and education as a pathway not just to growing economies but also to climate resilience and the deployment of clean energy. In a way, this is a unique feature of how Banga envisions the bank working on climate. He tells me the approach is born of his travels to member countries around the world where he saw how climate change was exacerbating other challenges on the ground, from migration to educational attainment. “It’s intertwined,” he says. “You can’t segregate it.” There’s an element of practicality to this approach too. The World Bank was first founded after World War II to help finance the reconstruction of Europe, and, along with the IMF, has since become a central node in a group of international financial institutions meant to help developing countries grow their economies and get through tough times. And, while the effects of climate change are of dire concern to leaders in the Global South, that’s not the only thing on their minds. Citizens still expect their governments to deliver development—from better roads and bridges to new jobs. And that has been especially challenging in the post-COVID-19 period when strained budgets have left many countries in deep debt. Read More: How to Avoid A Climate Backlash Banga has had to thread a difficult needle—showing member countries that he is committed to the bank’s tried-and-true mission while advancing climate efforts. And so many of his efforts have focused on using existing mechanisms rather than creating new, exclusively climate-focused ones. He adjusted the so-called equity-to-loans ratio, which determines how much the bank can lend, to allow it to lend an additional $30 billion over the next decade. He streamlined bureaucratic processes to cut average project approval time from 19 months to 16. And he used the bank’s profits to start a new Livable Planet Fund, which will be used to cut the costs of financing projects. The results have been significant. The bank’s climate finance deployed neared $43 billion in the last fiscal year. That’s a 10% increase over the prior year and brings it close to reaching its 2025 target of devoting 45% of its financing to climate. And all that money can go even further as it attracts private capital on its coattails. Still, it doesn’t take a math Ph.D. to see that the World Bank won’t be able to fill the massive climate finance gap on its own. The bank manages hundreds of billions of dollars in investments; climate change requires annual investments that measure in the trillions. “There is no way that any amount of financial engineering that I do with the balance sheet ... can get there,” he says. “The reality is everybody has fiscal constraints.” Banga’s solution is private finance. The owners and managers of trillions of dollars in capital have said they want to invest in the energy transition, but a flurry of risks have held them back. “This idea that you can wave a wand and get the private sector to come in ... it’s not how it works,” says Banga. But Banga thinks he can bridge the gap. It makes sense. Before leading the World Bank, Banga had a storied career in the private sector, most notably as the CEO of Mastercard but also in banking and in growth equity. Since taking office, he has launched a Private Sector Investment Lab working with the CEOs of BlackRock, HSBC, and other big financial institutions to work through the biggest challenges holding back private investment, from currency risk to a lack of regulatory certainty. In October, he launched a set of solutions tailored to address those risks. “He fundamentally understands that to take on these big, bold aspirations and actually execute them on a timeline, you have to work outside of your own institution,” says Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which in September joined a World Bank program to provide electricity to 300 million people across Africa. Every World Bank president faces their share of critics. And Banga is no exception. Some fear that his climate initiatives veer too far from the bank’s original mission. Others say his climate work is too piecemeal and too reliant on the private sector. A re-envisioning of the postwar international financial system with new institutions focused solely on climate would better serve us, they say. Banga is aware of all the challenges the bank must navigate, particularly as countries face populist revolts in parts of the world that aren’t too happy about multilateralism. Without my prompting, Banga addresses widespread concern that now-President elect Donald Trump may not like his agenda, saying that his work at the bank is “common sense” and “has nothing to do with politics.” “Smart management of money… Who's going to say no to that?” he asks almost incredulously. “The fact that I'm willing to do more work with the private sector, you really think President Trump will say no to that?” Still, the long-term future of the bank is clearly on his mind. Along with his IMF counterpart, he’s convened a working group to think through some of the big questions. But when I ask him about what the bank may look like in 30 years, he pivots right back into the programmatic changes he’s making today. “Forecasts are not destiny,” he says. “You can change destiny, but you have to work at it.” Write to Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.com

Title: Seven wild moments from the turbulent story of Bitcoin
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqj0wkwv1x2o
Time Published: 2024-11-12T11:05:15Z
Full Content:
Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election has helped push the price of Bitcoin to a series of record highs. Backers of the digital currency are celebrating, and wondering how much more valuable it could become - with some suggesting it could reach $100,000 per coin. Its price is rocketing because the president-elect has vowed to make the US "the crypto capital of the planet" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a "scam." He even started accepting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as donations to his election campaign and raised millions from the industry. But that is just one of the many twists and turns in the jaw-dropping story of Bitcoin, which continues to captivate people worldwide and has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes. Here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history. 1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto. They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email. Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers. But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out. In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be false lead caused by some mistranslated information. Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi. Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him. 2. Making history with pizza Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza. On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas. A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day. A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online. Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin. The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars! 3. Becoming legal tender In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender. Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country. While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped. He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country. As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years. The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country. It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value. A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value. 4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions. These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part. Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves. At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment. But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts. Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth. Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact. 5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (£78m) - and then accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details. That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline. Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him. He told the BBC: "It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling." 6. Crypto King fraudster No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community. FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days. Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research. Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: "I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was." After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years. 7. Investment bank boom Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies. In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any. Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs. It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined. Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold. Tigran Gambaryan, a US citizen arrested in February, will be allowed abroad to seek medical treatment. Habibur Rahman was charged with running the machine without registration from the FCA. The agreement will put an end to a saga that started when the firm went bankrupt in November 2022. The collection was considered a virtual asset and could not be released, Guernsey Post says. Crypto currency firms are waiting to see how November's vote will impact upon them. Copyright 2024 BBC.

Title: Trump hurls bitcoin near $90,000 — will the rally endure?

Since Donald Trump’s election victory, the cryptocurrency bitcoin has surged without restraint. The President-elect intentionally courted the bitcoin community. But can he make good on his promises? The oldest and best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was trading above $90,000 (€85,000) this week hitting a fresh all-time high amid a relentless rally that began on November 4 after Republican candidate Donald Trump was elected the next US president. Jonas Groß, chairman of the Digital Euro Association — an organization that promotes digital payment systems — says Trump has declared himself to be the "crypto president" who will "lead the US to a pioneering role in bitcoin." Such promises have been made so far only by presidents of smaller countries, like [President Nayib Bukele of] El Salvador, Groß told DW. "It's no surprise that the crypto community is celebrating." Though Trump had previously harbored a negative opinion about the cryptocurrency, he suddenly made a U-turn during the 2024 election campaign. At a major bitcoin conference in Nashville, for example, he promised to keep the crypto market largely unregulated and to make energy cheaper for the power-hungry mining of cryptocurrencies. Generating new bitcoins and maintaining the so-called blockchain network on which all transactions are recorded requires significant energy. Co-Pierre Georg, director of the Blockchain Center at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, attributes bitcoin's price surge primarily to "structural factors amplified by the US election." Georg told DW that the approval by US market regulators in January of so-called exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in bitcoin made investing in the coin and other cryptocurrencies much easier. With ETFs, investors can profit from price movements by buying shares without owning bitcoin directly. Georg noted that since regulatory approval, huge amounts of money have flowed into such ETFs, indicating that mainly institutional investors, like the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, are fueling the rally. He said that direct purchases of bitcoin via crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Bitpanda, or Kraken haven't fundamentally changed so much recently. Jonas Groß believes, however, that bitcoin's new all-time high mainly reflects sentiment and trust, similar to other publicly traded assets. While financial fraud dominated the headlines regarding bitcoin in the past, "it just needed a reason to lift spirits and get the machinery running again." Trump's soft regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies has "brought positive sentiment back," he added. Bitcoin's most prominent foe in the US administration is Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) head Gary Gensler, a staunch advocate of sweeping cryptocurrency regulation. Therefore, Co-Pierre Georg expects Trump to try to reorganize the agency overseeing US financial markets but said the incoming president can't simply replace Gensler without proving specific errors. Georg also sees Trump's win as a victory for the crypto industry lobby. "At the moment, it appears that the industry has bought influence over the government and the new Congress," he said in a reference to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The world's wealthiest man has proven an ardent fan of both cryptocurrencies and Donald Trump, whose campaign he supported with millions of dollars. According to news agency Reuters, the crypto industry spent nearly $120 million on support for Trump and Republican candidates, with a significant portion of the funding dedicated to unseat Senate Banking Committee chairman and crypto critic Sherrod Brown from the Democrats. The campaign of Brown's Republican opponent, Bernie Moreno, was reportedly supported with industry donations of about $40 million. While in the past, bitcoin broke records mainly in the wake of major companies accepting it as payment, such as PayPal in 2020, Georg sees "no such reasons" at the moment. "Bitcoin is completely unsuitable for payments, and it's also not reliable as a stable investment. The only real reason to buy bitcoin is speculative." Jonas Groß is less skeptical, seeing some market fundamentals currently favoring the asset. "Bitcoin has established itself as a new asset class. The first pension funds are already investing, and in my view, it's only a matter of time before the first sovereign wealth funds enter the space. And then we're talking about an entirely different scale," he said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Noting that markets have already "priced in Trump's promises," he warned, however: "If it turns out he doesn't deliver, prices could of course fall again." For Co-Pierre Georg, predicting if the rally will continue under Trump is "like reading tea leaves." With bitcoin, he said, "you should only invest what you're prepared to lose completely." Moreover, he's wondering about the crypto industry and what it says that it "so strongly supports the election of a convicted criminal and political firebrand like Donald Trump, and then massively profits from his win."

Title: Welcome to the Donald Trump Era of Crypto

On Monday morning, the research firm Bernstein came out with some advice about crypto for its Wall Street clients: “Buy everything you can.” Ever since the invention of bitcoin 15 years ago, this would be the kind of bloodshot, crazy-eyed call you could ignore because it was coming from a fanatic. But Bernstein is not some crypto-pilled boiler-room operation. Rather, it is part of the staid French investment bank Societe Generale and traces its history back to the 1960s, when the U.S. was still on the gold standard. The paper immediately ricocheted around the finance industry. When I started writing this column, bitcoin was testing new highs above $82,000; by the time I finished, it had eclipsed $88,000. When you look at the sheer volume of trading, it was probably crypto’s biggest day ever. Welcome to crypto’s Donald Trump era. It has hardly been a week since Trump won election, but it looks increasingly likely that the next four years in cryptoland are going to make the time when Sam Bankman-Fried was the industry’s fuzzy-headed mascot appear tame by comparison. What happened? It is not that there was some mass conversion event among Wall Street’s most cynical moneymen to the utopian promises of the digital future. There has been no new invention, no new use discovered that would make bitcoin or any other digital currency more likely to be a part of your everyday life. The calculus here is that all the insanity of the pandemic-era boom can come back in force — and this time, like Trump, the industry is emboldened to get even bigger, richer, and more unabashed than it ever has before. There’s no guarantee that bitcoin, or any other digital token, will be worth more tomorrow than it is right now. Volatility and sky-high risk is a central part of investing in crypto, and that didn’t change on November 6. But crypto in 2025 is looking like it is the industry’s best chance to make itself into something bigger than just a financial sideshow — for the next four years, the industry is absolutely looking to make itself institutional. The coming Trump economy, if it looks anything like the last one, is going to be very good for business, with lower taxes and interest rates, freeing up more money for people to speculate. And the industry has already made it as easy to buy crypto as anything else available on the New York Stock Exchange. Which, broadly speaking, has meant more money coming into the space, bringing rising prices and dampened volatility. Ever since this winter, when regulators allowed 401(k) money to flow into bitcoin ETFs, giants like BlackRock have been acting as a bridge between the traditional and digital worlds of finance — which has, in turn, only served to make crypto that much larger. The biggest break from the Biden administration, though, is likely going to be how much the industry is going to police itself. That is at least partly a function of an extremely aggressive lobbying campaign. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase — the largest U.S. crypto exchange — made a wager that he could marshal more than $100 million from his industry to elect a crypto-friendly government — and he ended up with a historic streak of wins that rivals some of the all-time great Wall Street trades. Bloomberg tallies that out of the 48 races where crypto money was backing a candidate, the industry has won every single won. (There are eight remaining, and all but three seem to be breaking toward the industry). Washington, D.C.’s most powerful bulwarks against the industry, including Democratic Ohio senator Sherrod Brown and Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, are losing their jobs. The winners, like Brown’s successor Bernie Moreno, are openly pushing for crypto to get the laissez-faire treatment. One senator, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, has introduced a bill that would require the Treasury to buy and hold onto a “strategic reserve” of 1 million bitcoins for 20 years — putting the U.S. more in line with El Salvador, which has tried, and mostly failed, to integrate the asset into everyday life. It’s not just lawmakers. Howard Lutnick, who is overseeing Trump’s personnel staffing, is the CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald — which just happens to be where Tether, the lifeblood stablecoin of the crypto industry, keeps its money. Elon Musk, who bankrolled at least $119 million of Trump’s get-out-the-vote operations, is a major crypto proponent — especially the joke dogecoin — and Tesla owns vast stores of bitcoin. (His vow to oversee a Department Of Government Efficiency to root out public spending is, I am sorry to say, a crypto joke). Of course, the first Trump administration oversaw a wild crypto bull market in 2017 and, at the time, prosecuted plenty of scams and frauds. What the crypto industry complains the most about these days is that the federal government doesn’t make crypto-specific rules, and that it uses the courts to set policy. Nevermind that this practice originated under Trump, back when he wrote he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” But since July, when Trump promised at the annual bitcoin conference to ax Gensler and make the U.S. the global center of crypto, his late-in-life conversion was accepted by the industry without much of a second thought. This is essentially what Bernstein and many others on Wall Street are excited about: putting money into a relatively new asset class now that regulators and federal prosecutors seem ready to let it grow. Coinbase and MicroStrategy, a tech company that holds $10 billion in bitcoin, went vertical on Monday. The total market for all of crypto was within a breath of reaching $3 trillion — about the size of France’s economy. In fact, the only digital asset to lose money among the largest 100 was Monero — a cryptocurrency favored by the likes of North Korea because it is so useful for laundering large sums of money. (The first Trump administration had prosecuted a multi-decade low of white-collar crimes, after all, so it’s not clear that money laundering would be much of a priority.) Last year, the Bloomberg journalist Zeke Faux (who’s a friend of mine) published a book called Number Go Up about the various scams and frauds that crypto facilitates. The title of the book comes from a quote by Dan Held, an executive at a crypto exchange, who was quoting — in earnest, apparently — a sarcastic meme about crypto. “Number go up technology is a very powerful piece of technology,” he said, according to the book. “It’s the price. As the price goes higher, more people are aware of it, and buy it in anticipation of the price continuing to climb.” Of course, what he’s describing has paved the way for many of the Ponzi-esque schemes that have defined the crypto industry so far, not least of which was the collapse of SBF’s crypto empire. (Not for nothing, FTX, his exchange, was based in the Bahamas, which has notoriously hands-off and crypto-friendly laws. They’ve since backtracked.) Crypto’s doubters have continued to make the same case against it over and over again: that digital assets make for a slow and expensive form of money, and that their best use is either in speculation or crime. Perhaps, over the long run, all this speculation will make for another FTX-like crash — this one even bigger than the last one. But for now, the crypto bros are going to go absolutely ape.

Ever since this winter, when regulators allowed 401(k) money to flow into bitcoin ETFs, giants like BlackRock have been acting as a bridge between the traditional and digital worlds of finance — which has, in turn, only served to make crypto that much larger. The biggest break from the Biden administration, though, is likely going to be how much the industry is going to police itself. That is at least partly a function of an extremely aggressive lobbying campaign. Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase — the largest U.S. crypto exchange — made a wager that he could marshal more than $100 million from his industry to elect a crypto-friendly government — and he ended up with a historic streak of wins that rivals some of the all-time great Wall Street trades. Bloomberg tallies that out of the 48 races where crypto money was backing a candidate, the industry has won every single won. (There are eight remaining, and all but three seem to be breaking toward the industry). Washington, D.C.’s most powerful bulwarks against the industry, including Democratic Ohio senator Sherrod Brown and Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler, are losing their jobs. The winners, like Brown’s successor Bernie Moreno, are openly pushing for crypto to get the laissez-faire treatment. One senator, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, has introduced a bill that would require the Treasury to buy and hold onto a “strategic reserve” of 1 million bitcoins for 20 years — putting the U.S. more in line with El Salvador, which has tried, and mostly failed, to integrate the asset into everyday life. It’s not just lawmakers. Howard Lutnick, who is overseeing Trump’s personnel staffing, is the CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald — which just happens to be where Tether, the lifeblood stablecoin of the crypto industry, keeps its money. Elon Musk, who bankrolled at least $119 million of Trump’s get-out-the-vote operations, is a major crypto proponent — especially the joke dogecoin — and Tesla owns vast stores of bitcoin. (His vow to oversee a Department Of Government Efficiency to root out public spending is, I am sorry to say, a crypto joke). Of course, the first Trump administration oversaw a wild crypto bull market in 2017 and, at the time, prosecuted plenty of scams and frauds. What the crypto industry complains the most about these days is that the federal government doesn’t make crypto-specific rules, and that it uses the courts to set policy. Nevermind that this practice originated under Trump, back when he wrote he was “not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.” But since July, when Trump promised at the annual bitcoin conference to ax Gensler and make the U.S. the global center of crypto, his late-in-life conversion was accepted by the industry without much of a second thought. This is essentially what Bernstein and many others on Wall Street are excited about: putting money into a relatively new asset class now that regulators and federal prosecutors seem ready to let it grow. Coinbase and MicroStrategy, a tech company that holds $10 billion in bitcoin, went vertical on Monday. The total market for all of crypto was within a breath of reaching $3 trillion — about the size of France’s economy. In fact, the only digital asset to lose money among the largest 100 was Monero — a cryptocurrency favored by the likes of North Korea because it is so useful for laundering large sums of money. (The first Trump administration had prosecuted a multi-decade low of white-collar crimes, after all, so it’s not clear that money laundering would be much of a priority.) Last year, the Bloomberg journalist Zeke Faux (who’s a friend of mine) published a book called Number Go Up about the various scams and frauds that crypto facilitates. The title of the book comes from a quote by Dan Held, an executive at a crypto exchange, who was quoting — in earnest, apparently — a sarcastic meme about crypto. “Number go up technology is a very powerful piece of technology,” he said, according to the book. “It’s the price. As the price goes higher, more people are aware of it, and buy it in anticipation of the price continuing to climb.” Of course, what he’s describing has paved the way for many of the Ponzi-esque schemes that have defined the crypto industry so far, not least of which was the collapse of SBF’s crypto empire. (Not for nothing, FTX, his exchange, was based in the Bahamas, which has notoriously hands-off and crypto-friendly laws. They’ve since backtracked.) Crypto’s doubters have continued to make the same case against it over and over again: that digital assets make for a slow and expensive form of money, and that their best use is either in speculation or crime. Perhaps, over the long run, all this speculation will make for another FTX-like crash — this one even bigger than the last one. But for now, the crypto bros are going to go absolutely ape.

Rising Bitcoin ETF investments signal institutional FOMO and market confidence. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have attracted $3.4 billion in inflows over the past four days, according to Farside data. Major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, reported significant investments in their Bitcoin ETFs, indicating heightened institutional interest. On Nov. 7, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF saw an inflow of $1.12 billion, marking the largest single-day investment among the ETFs listed. These inflows come in the wake of the US Election, in which Donald Trump’s victory helped push Bitcoin toward $90,000. Fidelity’s FBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also recorded notable inflows since the election of $666 million and $178 million, respectively. Grayscale’s GBTC continued to attract investments, adding $61 million. Other financial firms, such as Ark Invest, Invesco, Franklin Templeton, Valkyrie, VanEck, and WisdomTree, contributed to the rising inflows. On Nov. 11, Ark’s ARKB ETF received $42.7 million, while Invesco’s BTCO added $108.6 million. BlackRock’s IBIT led the day with $756 million. These firms’ participation underlines a broader acceptance of Bitcoin within traditional financial markets. Substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs reflect growing confidence among institutional investors in cryptocurrency’s long-term prospects. Possible FOMO among US investors who have seen adverts from the likes of BlackRock, Bitwise, et al over the past year could also be impacting investments as Trump’s reelection spurs increased attention to the digital asset.

When it comes to highlighting rip-offs, Pricewatch is not to be found wanting – we hope – but we believe it is also important to support local businesses and to acknowledge that there are many, many restaurants, cafes, pubs and hotels all over the country that are offering good value for money in very difficult circumstances. These businesses are also bringing jobs and money and life into all our communities unlike, say, many of the blue chip big tech companies that concentrate their presence in and around big urban centres. And the hospitality sector does more than that. It is also a magnet for the millions of tourists who travel to Ireland, not many of whom complain about rip-off prices, incidentally. Bearing all that in mind, we took to the platform formerly known as Twitter last week and asked people for examples of good value across the hospitality sector. We were heartened by the volume of responses and positivity that flowed our way. Here is just a sample of what came back. Blackrock Market: Lebanese Tapas offers delicious home-made Falafel and hummus. Really good value and the best coffee too. – Elaine Banfield Pizzas of Heart, Youghal: A young family from Naples giving us great value for money. €10-€13 for an oven fired freshly made pizza. They work out of their own mobile kitchen which changes location from the beach to the GAA club. – Michael John Howard Kenny’s pub on James’s Street, Dublin: Went there on a random Monday earlier this year. Pint of Guinness was only €5 and there was not one but two Elvis impersonators. – Ian Begley Timeless Cafe in Kilcock: Lunch for four yesterday including drinks and coffee was €40. Don’t get that value around these parts often. – Meadhbh Charles Sligo: Three tapas dishes for €12 at Osta Cafe and excellent (free) music Thursday evenings. And across the river, low price menu at Oak Moon evening cafe Thursday to Saturday. – Richard O’Beirne Stranorlar: Our local Kees Hotel has great offers including B&B plus dinner for €56 per person sharing. – Angela Holohan Gorey, Co Wexford: Partridges on Main Street. Had the most delicious chicken curry. Boss had butter chicken and chips. €34 for both. Lovely staff and food was really good, for a coffee shop. – Dave O’Connor Donegal: Any of the three bars on Arranmore Island – Neilys, Phil Bans and Earlys – offer great value on the price of pint and Earlys has great value pub grub with local fish dish a speciality. Neilys offers a beer token when you want to buy someone a drink, they can redeem it whenever. – Stephen McDevitt Bishopstown: My sister and I had a toasted sandwich each with three fillings, a decaf tea and a flat white for €13 total in Dunnes cafe in Bishopstown last Tuesday. Staff were helpful and friendly despite it being lunchtime and midterm. Kids meal for €2. Simple but very tasty. – Paula Courtney Bray: I’m usually fickle and want to try new places, but I keep going back to Dockyard No 8 in Bray over the past few years. Excellent value food with proper portions, enticing menu, great atmosphere and friendly, efficient service. Dog-friendly downstairs. – Peter McGuire Dalkey: You can buy an Americano in Robertos for €2.50 if you bring your own keep cup, €3 if no cup which is still great value compared with many other coffee shops. – Emma Forsyth Drury Street, Dublin: Heartbreak Social Club for €2 coffees, no matter what you get (alt milk is extra) but it’s delicious coffee from Pine Cone Coffee Roasters. I don’t think you’ll find coffee at that quality cheaper anywhere else. – Ger Holland Macroom: Great carvery lunch in Castle Hotel. Mains €18, best quality seasonal foods, excellently cooked. Great service also. Now that the town is bypassed, it’s worth a visit for food, traditional drapery shops, etc. (Visited on Bank Holiday Monday last.) – Margaret Kent Dublin: The Silk Road Cafe in the Chester Beatty. Delicious, Middle Eastern food at very reasonable prices. Lovely, helpful staff too. – Gillian Monaghan Galway: The Galleon in Salthill. It’s almost an institution. Remember being brought in there as a child for a knickerbocker glory. Brought my own kids when they were younger and it’s still going strong. Simple food and great service always. – Edel Abberton Stoneybatter: Bismarck Store Dairy Parlour, €3.10 for a keepcup latte. Tasty coffee, chatty owner and great value. – Aideen Lawlor Wicklow town: The Jailer’s Rest is the best value around. Four full breakfasts with tea, coffee and toast included was €53 this morning. – Anne Marie McGovern Wexford: Kafe Konnect in Wexford town. Social enterprise with all day mega breakfast for less than a tenner, including lovely coffee, toast, etc. Main courses also less than a tenner.

Good prices and the very best service. – Mary Healy Trim: I got a great deal in Knightsbrook Hotel for December, €149 bed and breakfast plus three-course dinner for two. – Irene Cullen Co Mayo: Johnny Moran’s pub in Westport, €5 for a pint of the black stuff.

Title: Bitcoin Prices Reach Almost $90,000 During Face-Melting Rally

Bitcoin prices neared the $90,000 price level today. Bitcoin prices continued their sharp, upward trajectory on Monday, November 11, approaching $90,000 as the world’s most prominent digital currency attained its latest all-time high. The cryptocurrency, which has been generating substantial visibility and widespread headlines for several years now, reached $89,600, according to Coinbase data from TradingView. To provide an idea of just how rapidly the cryptocurrency has been appreciating over the last several weeks, it was trading close to $62,000 roughly a month ago, additional TradingView figures reveal. Since dropping to that point, the digital asset has rallied more than 40%. Chris Chung, CEO & co-founder of Solana DEX aggregator Titan, emphasized just how strong bitcoin’s upward trend has been lately. “Bitcoin’s all time high and momentum shows no signs of stopping, as continued optimism surrounding the results of the U.S. election continue to drive price movement,” he stated via email. “Traders are deploying their capital and flocking to the safest asset that they are certain will stay around regardless of any drops in the market,” Chung added. The TikTok influencer who goes by Wendy O also weighed in. “Bitcoin keeps breaking all time highs since last week, this caused a full blown crypto bull market to begin!” she said through emailed comments. Bitcoin prices are benefiting from multiple tailwinds, and Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO of Bitpanda, offered his views on this situation. When asked what fueled the latest gains, he replied simply that “It’s a combination of factors.” “The election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States was a key event, both because the uncertainty of the election is now over and because of the promises he made to the crypto industry during his campaign,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad emphasized via email. “Added to that, we have seen record ETF inflows, significant capital entering the crypto space from capital markets, falling interest rates, and a surge in interest from retail investors,” he noted. “The fact that a new all-time high was reached over the weekend suggests that the current price increase is driven mainly by heightened demand from retail investors rather than institutional ones. If this demand persists, we could see further price increases for some time,” the executive stated. Going forward, the analysts polled for this article offered optimistic price forecasts. Wendy O, in particular, seemed confident that bitcoin would reach a six-figure valuation before the year is through. “Personally it seems very likely Bitcoin could see $100,000 prior to 2025 as BlackRock IBIT is creating insane demand for the finite asset Bitcoin, with only 21 million ever made, $85,000 Bitcoin may just be the beginning,” she stated earlier in the day.
