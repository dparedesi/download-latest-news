By Lambert Strether. Readers, the fundraiser for my very nearly gold retirement watch + all my Water Cooler work done in 2024 is complete! The goal was 400 donors; we now have 132 232 324, 402 or 33% 58% 81% 101% of goal. Thank you all so much. It means a lot, and it‚Äôs very, very helpful. ‚Äìlambert Bird Song of the Day Lambert here: Readers, I really enjoyed starting each Water Cooler by finding a bird song.

Please check back in an hour or so, when I‚Äôve worked up a good head of spleen. (1) Generally I avoid this trope, because who wants copycats, but please kill me now: Democrats pick Elissa Slotkin to represent the party & respond to Trump's speech.She was the first Democrat ever endorsed by Liz Cheney; voted for the Laken Riley Act, empowering Trump to detain people without due process; and is a top Democratic voter of Trump's cabinet.

Syndemics Lambert here: Many readers have commented on how helpful they found the Covid section. Let my repeat my belief: Assume for now that airborne disease will be a constant going forward, by Rule #2. (Covid, measles, maybe bird flu, the usual suspects like TB, RSV, etc.) Devise your airborne protection protocol according to the Swiss Cheese Model and stick to it. Don‚Äôt be thinking all the time and adjusting your behavior, not least because there will be at least a two week lag time between the next pandemic getting rolling and you hearing about it in the news. The K.I.S.S. principle applies. Covid coverage at Naked Capitalism will continue, but neither the list of Covid resources nor the Daily Covid charts will continue; they are too complex to maintain. (For a good weekly Covid wrapup, check out the Threat Model blog with Violet Blue.) I was especially pleased and proud of the collective responsibility readers took on for each other by aggregating and then maintaining the Covid Resources listings, immediately below. If some kind reader with a blog wants me to send them the HTML code, so they can carry on the work, send me mail. Finally, I was not ‚ÄúHEARD‚Äù as Garrison was, very sadly. I feel that I did help out readers, and I did inspire part of a lawsuit against HICPAC‚Äôs Inspector General. Five years of charts, and the only conclusion is that anybody who tells you that Covid has gone away is deluded or shamelessly lying‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúI am in earnest ‚Äî I will not equivocate ‚Äî I will not excuse ‚Äî I will not retreat a single inch ‚Äî AND I WILL BE HEARD.‚Äù ‚ÄìWilliam Lloyd Garrison * * * Covid Resources, United States (National): Transmission (CDC); Wastewater (CDC, Biobot; includes many counties; Wastewater Scan, includes drilldown by zip); Variants (CDC; Walgreens); ‚ÄúIowa COVID-19 Tracker‚Äù (in IA, but national data). ‚ÄúInfection Control, Emergency Management, Safety, and General Thoughts‚Äù (especially on hospitalization by city).

Zeitgeist Watch ‚ÄúWhat conservative women know ‚àí and liberals don‚Äôt ‚àí about happiness‚Äù [USA Today]. ‚ÄúOne of the weirdest reactions I saw after President Donald Trump was reelected in November involved videos on social media of young liberal women in hysterics over the results of our democratic process. Some even vowed to shave their heads and swear off having sex with men. I don‚Äôt remember losing my mind when Joe Biden was elected president in 2020. I was disappointed, but angry and depressed? No. Turns out, there‚Äôs data behind this phenomenon. New research shows that young conservative women are much happier than liberal women. The findings are about far more than political ideology. They demonstrate fundamental differences between Republicans and Democrats. According to the 2024 American Family Survey, liberal women ages 18-40 are far less likely than conservative women to say they are happy. Only 12% of liberal women said they are ‚Äúcompletely satisfied‚Äù with life compared with 37% of conservative women. Self-described moderates also are happier than liberals, with 28% agreeing that they are fully satisfied with life. Grant Bailey, a research associate of the Institute for Family Studies, and Brad Wilcox, a senior fellow at the institute, investigated ‚Äúhow marriage, churchgoing, and loneliness help to account for the happiness gap between liberal and conservative women.‚Äù Bailey and Wilcox make a strong case that conservative women are happier because they make different life choices. They are more likely to get married, have babies and embrace a strong faith ‚àí all things that make them feel less lonely. And people who don‚Äôt feel lonely are more likely to be happy.‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Hmm. ‚ÄúA History of Violence‚Äù [BookForum].

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (‚ÄúBecause markets‚Äù). I don‚Äôt much care about the ‚Äúism‚Äù that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don‚Äôt much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue ‚Äî and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me ‚Äî is the tens of thousands of excess ‚Äúdeaths from despair,‚Äù as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics ‚Äî even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton‚Äôs wars created ‚Äî bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow ‚Äî currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press ‚Äî a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let‚Äôs call such voices ‚Äúthe left.‚Äù Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn‚Äôt allowed to get back into the saddle.

Yes, fair the well! 402‚Ä¶nope, make that 403. Best wishes on your new endeavors. I‚Äôd hoped to have time to write a farewell song parody for the Water Cooler, but nope. Maybe later For now, as Douglas Adams wrote, so long and thanks for all the fish. :) Lambert we who are reading our last Water Cooler salute you and say thanks for being such a great host over the years. Maybe you can come back to visit sometimes. In any case Best wishes. I‚Äôll second that. Thanks for your efforts Lambert! Make that three. Many thanks, and all the best. Sent you an email, Lambert.

For your viewing pleasure (or maybe not): BREAKING: Trump KICKS Zelensky OUT After INSANE Shouting Match https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjnNbvPIEOI Well, at least much less is happening behind closed doors without the public knowing about it. That‚Äôs progress‚Ä¶ I just posted this below too. My initial thoughts are Zelensky was high on something, his own supply and maybe coke too. I can‚Äôt imagine walking into a meeting like that and arguing in that venue unless your senses were clouded by drugs. This may be the best gift for Trump though. He has a good excuse to back out of any future agreements with Ukraine. I guess we‚Äôll see if he takes that opportunity or not. Cocaine is a helluva drug! see Z‚Äôs fidgeting, nose tweaking, agitation‚Ä¶.Z was tweaking. Citation: and having partaked (a bit) and being around it in my early 20‚Äôs, lol And I bet (tea-totalling) Trump‚Äôs been around tweakers a lot too over the decades, and knows the signs from across the room. And likely doubly offended at Z‚Äôs imbibing. Zelensky has gotten accustomed to many of his pleas and convincing appeals to US government leadership ( Biden, Blinken, Sullivan, etc‚Ä¶) that the new bosses are for real, and just not in the BAU mode of operations‚Ä¶ No longer is it Business as Usual, or standard procedure to have your refill of countless millions and billions. Reminding me of a hard tack in foreign policy approach, not necessarily a bad shift. We got problems closer to home, fighting a never ending overseas conflict or even just merely playing the role of Big Daddy War money I believe has, or had already, begun to grate on American citizens. Trump can be a blunt tool in such affairs and in his negotiating tactics. No kidding. The image of Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova with her head in her hands pretty much sums up how this went. I can picture Joe Biden, watching that video while sitting in a nursing home in a wheel chair like Hector Salamanca from ‚ÄúBreaking Bad.‚Äù Spittle and foam forming at his mouth, while he watches his entire legacy go down the drain. Unable to speak due to a stroke. https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Hector_Salamanca That was a very funny comment! It is a funny comment. But the blackest of black comedy given the half-million-plus human lives flushed down the toilet in this incredibly stupid war. ‚ÄúDing ding ding ding ding ding‚Äù Actually the Dems are probably very happy about this ‚Äì now they can say ‚ÄúUkraine would have won the war if WE were in power! Trump lost the war!!‚Äù And the fully propagandized public will buy it. IF Israel, just as Ukraine, requires US security guarantees and US weapons and US funds to pay it‚Äôs bureaucracy and guarantee it‚Äôs bonds to survive -and Ukraine must sign a resource extraction and infrastructure collateralization deal with the US to protect US Taxpayers‚Äô interests to secure those security guarantees and weapons and funds; WHY is there no commensurate commitment demanded of Israel? If he (Biden) even remembers much about being president. Depends of the state of his decline, probably. The transcript is above. Vance escalated the conflict? Oof Laura, that‚Äôs a shallow slant, but anyway, yo Lambert, good on ya in all your metamorphoses! You‚Äôve tangibly contributed to the self-education of many, myself included. May the last song from our admired ‚ÄòCombat Rock‚Äô serve as the soundtrack of my tribute. Ginsberg may be pass√©, but this cut-up rug really tied that room together. https://youtu.be/GTLMgAuTNOI?si=UFuIVk0r42XCslE- wow. just wow. I‚Äôve not seen anything like it. watching the ‚ÄúRest is politics‚Äù live stream on it now. Alastair campbell reminding us that Trump is a not serious reality tv person. Interested in just two things, ratings and conflict. more evidence of the clown show in the oval office. Does the video of that encounter make you think Trump isn‚Äôt a serious person? He looks like Churchill next to Zelensky in that affair. I hope I don‚Äôt stray outside the guidelines after the latest comment ban. Going to be careful with my response. I can look at the video of that encounter with the sound off. What I see are 3 primates in a power display. The body language is not collaborative or healthy at all. Crossed arms from Zelenksy. (defensive), finger pointing from Trump and Vance (aggression). It‚Äôs a conflict situation. One of the primates is in good physical condition , the other two look ready for a long winter, one old, one young. the young is subservient to the old. Now if we replace 3 primates with ‚Äú2 presidents and one vice president‚Äù then I expect very different behaviour. I would not expect such a nakedly obvious animal interaction. More type 2 thinking vs type 1 please. Lastly the comment at the end of ‚Äúthis will make great TV‚Äù. As a way to try and close out the encounter at the end? This trivializes one of the important political situations of our time. Unserious. This is going to go down very badly over here. people will be incredulous at the encounter. Staff will be working overtime on damage limitation. Curious why you draw the comparison with Churchill? (and as a Brit I know Churchill was very much of his time with his own problems) hazelbee; I can look at the video of that encounter with the sound off. What I see are 3 primates in a power display. What else would you expect? What else was all of this ever, from the start, but primate power competitions? Is it, maybe, actually better that the proles can see that that‚Äôs what the reality always has been? Indeed, however inelegant you may find Trump ‚Äì and I too am a Brit, who after decades in the US is back in London to watch the equivalent of what I fully expect may be the equivalent of the Yeltsin years for the US ‚Äî isn‚Äôt hearing Trump and Vance articulate out loud the actual stakes of what Zelensky is trying to get them to do, which is to have the US underwrite the continuance of this conflict on his terms rather than make peace, slightly refreshing? Each to their own taste, of course. But you say that this was ‚Äòunserious.‚Äô I, on the other hand, don‚Äôt like Trump and Vance, and liked Biden, Obama, Clinton, etcetera, even less, but I liked this. Because this was the truth. nice observation. and of course we‚ÄîUS, UK, the West‚Äîput Z in this position to begin with. Talk about a bait and switch‚Ä¶ No, Zelensky and his Ukrainian backers put Zelensky in this position. I realize that this conflict was managed by grifters and ideological US bureaucrats wanting a proxy war with their real target, but none of them went to Zelensky and told the popular comic actor to run for his country‚Äôs Presidency. But even being a clueless entertainment figure, the precarious situation the country was in had to be clear to him before he did this. He ran knowing that the US was pulling the strings, actually ran on policy counter to what his administration did, and was the appropriate front man for the grifters in his country with the West. He may have gotten more than he expected. (It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me that he was deluded about what Russia could do as our ever failing foreign policy strategists were.) But once again he chose to jettison a successful career for this. I feel for many Ukrainians. I do not feel for Zelensky or the remaining Ukrainian legislature, or most of its top military, especially the Azov brigade. Not that most of the American government (and top Europeans) are any better. And while not keeping up the pretense that Ukraine as anything but lost in this is refreshing, throwing more money at it because of a ‚Äòdeal‚Äô that Zelensky has no real legal right to make doesn‚Äôt make doesn‚Äôt give the latest home team any points either in my book. Consistent with earlier theory that Trump will take the minerals deal, reportedly inked by the Rada already, and work it with the Russians, Zelensky is boxed out and his authority hasn‚Äôt been reinforced or made significant. I have to wonder if this isn‚Äôt still kayfabe, because Zelensky‚Äôs defiance and expulsion will buy him some credibility with the Banderites who have guns to his head. Maybe he will make it to France. Strange for me to say so but in all fairness to Zelensky the guy is probably a mental train wreck right now. He has just signed his entire country over to the US for who knows how many generations and he knows full well that if it had not been for the US this war would never have even happened ‚Äì and now the US is going to walk away with everything. Vance and Trump talk a lot about respect but I have noticed that for them the respect goes only one way. First Zelensky and Ukraine were slapped by the left hand of imperialism, and now they (and particularly Zelensky) have been slapped by the right hand of imperialism. The Archie slap from Guy Ritchie‚Äôs RocknRolla. More relevant than you might imagine. Rev Kev: (Zelensky) knows full well that if it had not been for the US this war would never have even happened ‚Äì and now the US is going to walk away with everything. Sure. But when any country‚Äôs elites have actively sought to get into bed with Langley and indeed with DC, generally ‚Äî after no less a personage than Henry Kissinger explained the score decades ago (recite after me, children: to be an enemy of the US is dangerous, but to be a friend is fatal) ‚Äî that country‚Äôs elites are not wholesome, upstanding, and respectable. They are deeply corrupt. How did those thirty-plus US biolabs in Ukraine ringing Russian borders get there, for example? With the active connivance of Ukraine‚Äôs elites. And so on. Furthermore, the US is not going to ‚Äúwalk away with everything.‚Äù After this, the US‚Äôs credibility is almost certainly so deeply tarnished that even, for instance, the quisling elites in Europe are going to have a hard time selling out to it. Good. No. The minerals deal has not been signed. I think Z knew what he was doing going into this: putting on a show for the Europols, use their hatred of Trump to get them to put together a security guarantee without the USA. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/02/24/nuclear-armed-ukraine/ or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtY4MpoOQ1s How a nuclear-armed Ukraine could become ‚ÄòEurope‚Äôs Israel‚Äô ‚ÄúOn the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, Ukraine faces a dilemma over how to defend itself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù I have not read the article or watched the youtube‚Ä¶. the thought of a nuclear armed Zelenski is repugnant to me ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ This project of, Ukraine as Europe‚Äôs Israel, sums up, imo, much of the last eleven years in the Ukraine. The Trump-Zelensky dust up is very welcome news imo. The Israel model pops up from time to time in the writings of the foreign policy think tank crowd. They want to do the same with the Kurds, too. These maniacs love Israel precisely for the exact reasons we hate the whole damned failed project. They want to recreate it throughout the world. Best wishes! Thanks for all the content!

And, a link for you to consider on your way out the door. This is the Breaking Points highlights of the absolutely wild press conference with Zelensky, Trump, and Vance. I think our boy Z may have killed any hope of future support from the US. But who knows? Trump does what Trump wants to do. However, I don‚Äôt think that there is any way Trump can support Ukraine after Zelensky‚Äôs outburst today. From the transcript 1) Nobody mentions Maidan, how odd. 2) No, Trump is not strong on detail but he has a firm grasp of the essentials. 3) The end, where Trump clearly visualizes Putin as, with him, a victim of Democrat calumnies ‚Äî could Trump actually be showing empathy here???? ‚Äî is awkward 4) Was Vance playing ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs you and him fight‚Äù? Obama was mentioned by Trump a few times at one point, but I couldn‚Äôt figure out the context. Was this a roundabout reference to Maiden? As for Vance, I bet he was hoping for an excuse to raise it to fisticuffs. There is nothing but upside to kicking VZ‚Äôs butt on tv. ‚ÄúAs for Vance, I bet he was hoping for an excuse to raise it to fisticuffs.

(!!, OMG!) The previously unknown deposits ‚Äî including huge veins of iron, copper, cobalt, gold and critical industrial metals like lithium ‚Äî are so big and include so many minerals that are essential to modern industry that Afghanistan could eventually be transformed into one of the most important mining centers in the world, the United States officials believe. An internal Pentagon memo, for example, states that Afghanistan could become the ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia of lithium,‚Äù a key raw material in the manufacture of batteries for laptops and BlackBerrys.‚Äù Ukraine‚Äôs $500 billion rare earths scam: they don‚Äôt exist, and we should know better ‚ÄúInside China Business‚Äù https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tILXLxMTmgA&t=623s ‚ÄúReports that Ukraine will pledge its vast reserves of rare earth metals and other strategic minerals in exchange for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of loan forgiveness and additional aid have supply chain managers perplexed. No honest assessment of Ukraine‚Äôs mineral assets comes anywhere close to the numbers that top government officials claim. The US Geological Survey, and even publications from Ukraine‚Äôs ministries report only trace amounts of rare earth metals anywhere in the country. Even were we only to consider non-rare earths, other problems become apparent. Many of those reserves are in Russian hands, and much of the rest can not be commercially mined at current market prices. The situation in Ukraine is alarmingly similar to Afghanistan, where Pentagon assessments of Afghan mineral reserves dramatically overstated their actual size and market value, while giving war planners additional time and resources to prosecute what was ultimately a losing war effort.‚Äù i watched the whole thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_YtXWVfkJE remarkable is too soft a word. ive never seen anything like it. zelensky is under the bus and vance is next president Thanks for the link. At about 9 minutes into the video, Trump repeatedly refers to what sounds like ‚Äúraw‚Äù earth instead of rare earths. Is that what you heard? Wow, reading that transcript seems almost surreal. I wonder if Vance‚Äôs presence was to position him in the thick of things now, for a presidential run in ‚Äô28. Regardless of what people think of the theater of it all (and those opinions will fall along all the predictable lines) ‚Äî I suspect the substance of the position Trump and Vance have staked out will prove quite popular with the public. Swiss Vance now? Vraiment? Je ne le pense pas. Non, je ne le pense pas du tout. I think both Trump and Vance appropriated finger wagging from the Dems. Also, this was hysterically funny to watch! Reminded me of Trump‚Äôs having an on-camera meeting with Schumer and Pelosi during his first term. They were terrified and it was my pleasure to watch. My question is if it was intended to go this way. From Vance and Trump that is. Typically these world leader press conferences are scripted. Here instead you have Vance right of the bat pushing Zelensky‚Äôs buttons. Zelensky hits back, Vance accuses him of being disrespectful to Trump. ‚ÄúYou come here, on the day of my daugther‚Äôs wedding‚Ä¶‚Äù Sorry, wrong script. Anyway it goes on until Trump gets out the steel chair and tells Zelensky not to tell him what he will feel. Zelensky starts to backtrack and Trump goes in for the kill ‚ÄúWe are trying to save you, come with me if you want to live‚Ä¶‚Äù Sorry, wrong script again. I just don‚Äôt see why they would have set this up like this otherwise. You don‚Äôt have a frank discussion in front of the media, you just don‚Äôt. Wonder what the Ukrainians were told would be going down. I‚Äôm sure this was intended, and I‚Äôd bet the real audience was not Z, but American voters and the agencies. Just watched the video. How richly enjoyable. I took in about the first 10 minutes and then skipped ahead. I wanted to see the blowup but I also wanted to see it in context so I scrolled to about 35 minutes. And then sat through a seemingly interminable and ignorant harangue by Zelensky, who came across as thoroughly detestable. By the time Vance interjects, it comes as a relief. https://www.france24.com/fr/info-en-continu/20250228-le-verbatim-de-la-passe-d-armes-entre-zelensky-trump-et-vance/ The verbatim exchange of arms between Zelensky, Trump and Vance Verbatim except they made sure to leave out this line, which appeared to be the line that set Trump off: Z: ‚ÄúEverybody has problems even you. You have a nice ocean and don‚Äôt feel. But you will feel it in the future‚Äú. Now that is interesting that. Trump seems to think that the two oceans on either side of America will always protect them. And as part of this, he wants both Canada and Greenland to make this geographical block secure. Same with his idea of an Iron Dome for America. Call it Fortress America. So for Zelensky to say that this will not always be true must have really struck a raw nerve with Trump. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what struck the nerve, Rev. Trump did, after all, warn of the risk of world war, several times during the event. I think it‚Äôs a more basic response. Zelensky‚Äôs statement ‚Äúyou will feel it in the future‚Äù can be interpreted one of two ways: as a threat, or as a prediction. Neither is very gracious. I myself was appalled by it, not so much by what Zelensky said, but just the fact that he said it. Just not a very ‚Äúpolitic‚Äù thing to say, especially when you‚Äôre a begging dependent. Having see the Breaking Points Video I thought the the highlight was the UK Ambassador to the US @6:48 in the background with head in hand. It was 40 minutes into the media PR $unt when it all came undone. Few other notes. ‚ÄúFor his part, Trump made clear that the US would continue delivering military aid. All Zelensky had to do was remain calm for a few more minutes and they would‚Äôve signed a deal. The argument started when Trump pointed out that it would be hard to make a deal if you talk about Putin the way Zelensky does. Vance interjects to make the reasonable point that Biden called Putin names and that didn‚Äôt get us anywhere. The Zelensky/Trump dynamic was calm and stable. It was when Vance spoke that Zelensky started to interrogate him.‚Äù Lmmao ‚Ä¶ from experience it was like watching a white collar Coke deal go bad, no guns allowed affairs, so it all comes down to attitude and the knowledge of it being backed up. Zelensky just got put in the ‚Äì Gimp Box ‚Äì on international media for everyone else to see. On that note I wonder what the EU posse is musing right now, come to Oval office and get a public spanking for all to see, go back home and plead for ice ‚Äì ???? The only other thing is the juxtaposition of Trump/Vance/Musk vs say Putin/Xi on global media. How is that dynamic going to play out in the near and long term. Thank you Lambert. Vaya con dios.

Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself, and frees all faults. As you from crimes would pardoned be, Let your indulgence set me free. MAY YOU WEATHER ANY UPCOMING STORMS WITH GRACE AND INSIGHT. You leave a big hole hehind Lambert ! Lambert, goodbye.

I will miss you. I have added orts and scraps (for the final time; thanks for all the kind words). It‚Äôs fitting that ‚Äúthe goddamed Democrat Party‚Äù is the topic. That, and an amazing session at the White House with Big Z, Vance, and Trump. I have a couple of weekend posts to go, and then‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll see you on the other side. Z: Everybody has problems even you. You have a nice ocean and don‚Äôt feel. But you will feel it in the future. Whooboy‚Ä¶that made Trump pipe up,didn‚Äôt it? Code for blowback is a bitch? You take care, Lambert. Wow, just watched the melee or was it a poker game, with the many mentions of not having the cards? I‚Äôd imagine the big Z wishes he‚Äôd worn his lucky green shirt~ Maybe it was the lighting, but i‚Äôve never seen the President looking oh so very Oompa-Loompa as today, wow. Oompa, Loompa, doom-pa-dee-da If you‚Äôre not greedy, you will go far You will live in happiness too Like the Oompa, Loompa, doompa-dee-do Doompa-dee-do I see the Democrats have not changed. They are going with Democrat Elissa Slotkin who is Republican Lite but people will more likely just go with an actual Republican. When you don‚Äôt offer a truly different choice you shouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there is no rush to follow you. But the Democrats will be. I was just watching a silly but comforting movie. The big theme, so big it is repeated multiple times, is when what you are doing is not working you need to step back and go in another direction. The problem that elected Democrats and their consultants have is that they are having a hard time understanding that because they are comfortable and have been somewhat protected and don‚Äôt realize that is not the case for more and more Americans. They really do not understand how this happened. They will not change until they truly hit bottom. It is too uncomfortable for them as their livelihoods, where the real money is, will not survive real change. So posturing and pretending and putting the spooks on the air to reassure the owners that none of it means anything will continue. Sad to see you go and thanks for all you have done here. You‚Äôve done a good stint. I am educated and better from what you have shared here. Particularly the covid coverage. and you are going out at a quiet news time. nope nothing going on of note at all right now‚Ä¶. :D The other side? Is the grass greener? Flowers smell better? What about bees, butterflies? See you there, I guess? Lambert ‚Äì thank you for your insights and your wit ‚Äì I will miss reading your column ‚Äì good luck ‚Äì happy trails. Brian Appreciate the promotion of bassists. I saw Jaco Pastorius with Joni Mitchel in 1979 and the solo he did was a highlight of the concert. It was the first time I‚Äôd experienced looping in a live performance, mind expanding. Great that you saw it. This video should have been titled Joni with a very good band. As Wayne Shorter said of her (roughly), she didn‚Äôt copy any one else‚Äôs style but held with her own. I‚Äôm a musician, I understand something of how these things work. These major cats backing her up were all off book. That was a major economic effort. And an artistic success. Pat Metheny, Joni Mitchell, Jaco Pastorius, Michael Brecker ‚Äì ‚ÄúShadows And Light‚Äù. I‚Äôm watching it again after some years. There is solid musicianship throughout. It was Joni‚Äôs show and she had the musical foundation to propel it. Done watching ‚Äî She was better than good. And she was a universalist human being. Thank you Lambert for all the insight, and (‚Äúdry, very dry‚Äù :D ) wit over the years, you will be missed! I wish you only the best. This felt like a fitting Irish well-wish for the occasion: ‚ÄúMay misfortune follow you the rest of your life, and never catch up.‚Äù Thank you, Lambert! Thank you, Lambert, for all of your wonderful Water Coolers, articles, and analyses. Every one of them was a masterpiece. I am especially grateful for your unrivaled Covid coverage and for honoring the avian world with the beautiful Bird Song of the Day. Much happiness and success with all of your future endeavors! ‚ÄúAndrew Cuomo to receive labor endorsement in mayor‚Äôs race he‚Äôs yet to enter‚Äù, because government is organized crime, lol, it‚Äôs like putting it on a billboard. The good news is that no mayor of NYC has ever gone on to higher office. Of course that‚Äôs only good for those of us who don‚Äôt live there. At least NYS prison guards know how to organize a wildcat strike and get concessions. Hochul had 6500 National Guard acting as prison guards. National coverage is crickets. Deal reached to end strike by NY prison workers, Hochul says syracuse.com We‚Äôll see if they go back work tomorrow. The strike worked. State caved. Why are other public or private workers so timid? I saw that. Kudos to the prison guards I hope, but not knowing the lay of the land, and having a deep suspicion of the prison industry, I‚Äôll refrain from being too enthusiastic. Thinking about the question you finished with, prison guards holding an almost unique position of power as to who can and will fill in, combined with society‚Äôs urgent need for uninterrupted service. Air traffic control professionals might fit here as well. Baristas, well, I already make my own coffee. Thank you, Lambert, for all the years of Water Cooler posts, as well as the countless yellow wader sessions! An amazing body of work. Gonna miss your intelligent insight badly, Lambert. Gonna miss that dry wit the most! Thank you, Lambert. The Covid coverage has been vital, and the general insight and snark have been greatly appreciated. Wishing you the best for the future. Stay safe, wherever you are, whatever you do. Thank you for all the hard work. Take a well deserved rest. You have more friends and colleagues than you will ever know. Lambert ‚Äì a suggestion? I think you mentioned one of your next projects is writing a book? If so please let us know when and where it is ‚Äì cuz nothing helps a book get traction like the 500 glowing reviews that I‚Äôm sure everyone here would participate in providing. :) Thank you LS. I wish I was not so skint. Hat‚Äôs off. Lambert‚Ä¶.will send a check‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I cannot BELIEVE you are leaving. NC is an absolute fave and your ‚Äúdry‚Äù wit has grown on me as the years pass. BEST‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..and take care. What a last Water Cooler! It‚Äôs like the Hollywood exit where the explosion is right behind you as you walk off the stage. Lol enjoy your cool new world my guy. Lambert 4 evah! Lambert, you‚Äôll be missed. I hope retirement suits you. So long, Lambert. And thanks for all the wit and wisdom. For man who rarely laughs out loud, you certainly inspired a number of guffaws for me over the years. Best wishes! Some of the conservatives I know seem generally happy ‚Äì although they are all convinced that many woke forces are out to get them, personally and specifically. That doesn‚Äôt sound pleasant, no matter how they describe themselves. The MAGA heads I know for other reasons would, I believe, tell you they are happy. And they probably are because they love drama and being angry all the time. Imagined slights ‚Äì they know I don‚Äôt like this many pickles! ‚Äì crazy paranoia about the knock-out game and seed oils and not going to parts of town where they would be sex trafficked (even thought they have guns in their purses.) It‚Äôs like their social skills were learned from bots. Thanks for the time together we all shared with you, Lambert. Water Cooler was my most eagerly anticipated read of the day. So sorry it‚Äôs going away. All the best to Lambert! ‚ÄúFare thee well now Let your life proceed by its own designs Nothing to tell now‚Ä¶‚Äù Yours words have been a treasure. Thank you for everything, Lambert! In case you haven‚Äôt already seen this and if you don‚Äôt plan to get away from the internet completely after your retirement, it may be of interest to you for future web searches: Bruce Sterling (the sci-fi author) posted on his Mastodon today about an open-source search engine that prioritizes non-commercial content, which sounds like something that a lot of us have been wishing for. For some quick examples that I tested with, a simple search for ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù returned several of NC‚Äôs favorite/friend blogs in the first page of results. A search for ‚Äúcalpers‚Äù returned Naked Capitalism on the second page of results. Compare that to Google‚Äôs results. Their tagline on their github calls it an ‚ÄúInternet search engine for text-oriented websites. Indexing the small, old and weird web.‚Äù https://marginalia-search.com/ I hope you enjoy this and that you also enjoy your retirement! Best regards. Thank you, Turtle! ‚ÄúInternet search engine for text-oriented websites. Indexing the small, old and weird web.‚Äù https://marginalia-search.com/ Marginalia Search ‚Äì what a find! Former librarian here, frothing at the mouth. This is fantastic! You‚Äôre welcome, Jenny! I hope you enjoy it and find it useful! We have much more to thank you for than can be said. I will miss your insights and wish you all good things to come. Thank you, Lambert! Wishing you well on the new stage of your life as you will have more time to go after those pursuits that you have left aside. Lots of changes ahead for you but I hope that you check in on comments every now and then to add your own insights. Happy trails. I agree. Now that you have more time you will accomplish much. We will all be saying ‚ÄúI knew him when . . . ‚Äù Have fun, but don‚Äôt have too much fun. And as that old Irish saying goes ‚ÄòMay you be in Heaven thirty minutes before the devil knows that you are dead.‚Äô I‚Äôve a hole in my heart, now that it comes down to it. Lambert, please drop us all a line from time to time and let us know how you‚Äôre doing. Only the best wishes for you and yours in your next phase in life. I have gained so much from my daily visits to the Water Cooler that I can‚Äôt even express. Working in BigTech I am surrounded by kool-aid drinking PMC neoliberals all day every day, and Water Cooler has been a welcome respite from all that. Because of Water Cooler I joined Twitter (now X) to follow Matt Stoller, and from there have ended up following 75-odd people and counting, many of whom I was introduced to through these very pages. This eclectic collection of X‚Äôers has led me down paths that have contributed my having a more open mind and open heart. The commentariat does the same every day. I so appreciate what you have done for all of us, Lambert. I hope your retirement includes writing projects we can enjoy in the future . . . but more than that I hope you know you‚Äôve already done more good than most writers could ever hope to achieve. Lambert, you went deep‚Äìdeep into places, issues, causes, committees, bird calls, tree barks, mindsets, air flows, transcripts, computer coding, keyboards, overlooked photographers, Twitters, gardens, and so much more. I don‚Äôt go that deep‚Äìprobably don‚Äôt have the patience, but thank you for taking us on the ride. Have a merry and satisfying post-NC journey. Lambert, thank you for everything. I‚Äôve marked so many days by the water cooler that I can‚Äôt even attempt to count. How will I even know it‚Äôs 2pm without the water cooler? Wishing you all the best and echo Petal‚Äôs comment that if you are ever in the Hanover NH area, the first, second and third round are on me. And dinner will be on me. Thank you Lambert for your dedication and good will! My best wishes to you always. Thank you Lambert: You, along with helpful commentarians, were, from the beginning (Mar 2020, if memory serves) the only believable source for COVID information. Of which I fear there will be very little from now on, things being how they are. Best of luck Lambert. You will be missed. Wayfarer, go with God, and reason, within reason. Thank you, thank you, thank you for you work in NC. You will be missed, but I think NC will just be a little different. Your Covid coverage and political coverage has been very helpful. Highlighting different websites (Black Agenda Report to the Daily Yonder) (and Yves does similarly) shows how despite differences (some significant, others not so much) the working class has a common interest and a common enemy. I will look forward to your future contributions (and book?). Inspired by Angie Neer‚Äôs b/w photo, I had hoped to send a couple before now, maybe an occasional plantidote will be in the works. Donated last night. Re today‚Äôs WC: It‚Äôs a wonder Bernie and the Kamala cover didn‚Äôt poke holes in your yellow waders. I had finally put my toe in Facebook, but I recently tried Mastodon, which is more to my liking. A Covid post pointed to this concerning future vaccine possibilities. https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/2025/02/28/exciting-news-from-europe-and-roadblocks-in-the-us-nextgen-covid-vax-update-26/ Enjoy your retirement. Thank you for all the amazing work you‚Äôve done, Lambert. Don‚Äôt be a stranger. May the Long Time Sun guide you on your journey. Darn, howl‚Ä¶see you on the sunny side. Darn, with-drawl count starts‚Ä¶Thank you so much for your numerous gifts! Be well.üåÖ One last heartfelt thanks and fond farewell Lambert. Sure will miss you and Watercooler lots. Wishing you much awsome reading and fresh new discoveries, insights and experiences. Keep in touch! Lambert, thank you for the years of education and entertainment. There was a hole in my life on weekends, now it will be permanent. Wipes tear from eye ‚Ä¶ as you partake of a bit of Clarke&Dawe ‚Ä¶ Lambert. John Clarke: Thanks for your time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=539bkrv7g2k Lambert, thank you so much! ‚ÄúViolence alters human genes for generations, researchers discover‚Äù A version of that was one of the premises of Freud‚Äôs book Moses and Monotheism among other things. The old is new again. Till now I‚Äôve avoided stopping here today: I don‚Äôt want to see you leave. As much as I‚Äôve enjoyed the insight and humor you‚Äôve brought here, work-ethic and more, I appreciate the sense of plain old common decency that comes across in your writings. You‚Äôve set an example that I and many others will try to follow, hopefully meeting with at least some success. Truely. Thank you, Lambert!!! Wish you the best on future endeavours. Thank you 1000x for daily nudging my personal dial back toward ‚Äòthere is maybe some hope for humanity‚Äô; for building and maintaining a network and hub of covid info; and for many a well researched and thought out take that I have learned from and passed on (w attribution!). Long live the old school blogosphere! Thank you, Lambert, for all the gifts you‚Äôve given, which other commenters have documented so well, and best wishes to you as you take this next turn in the road. A final thank you to Lambert for everything. Truly a blessing for all the readers. Wish you well for the next part of your journey. Lambert, Thanks for the phrase ‚Äúbirds like messy‚Äù. I think of it often as I wander around my messy garden in a neighborhood of sterile manicured yards. Seems like the messy place is the only one full of life, especially birds and bugs. Also, have appreciated your insights and jokes. A short cynical take on the rally to protect the special health programs, you have to understand that for many NY elected Congressional members it is the biggest and most important piece of the numerous ways that money was funneled to various power groups as a result of 9/11 that of the biggest thing they ever accomplished. It was, quite honestly, the only real accomplishment of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs senate terms, the rest was renaming post offices. It is not just that there is a psychic wound about the events of that day that in NY is inescapable. They literally have benefitted for years because of the largesse that has been spent over the years. They cannot lose it or its legacy of success. And you are right that it is just wrong that this is the wrong focus or approach, they all should have gotten single payer universal health care long ago. In the meanwhile as a fitting irony in the same week that was going on, Mount Sinai won their court battle to close Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital on First Avenue and 16th Street. This was the hospital farthest downtown since Saint Vincent‚Äôs was closed. If they had their way there would be nothing below 23rd but urgent care and enhanced urgent care centers. (I have it on good authority that the extensive one across from where St Vincent‚Äôs once stood has to send anything truly serious to real hospitals, one of their doctors told me.It has beds but they are for observable situations.) Now it is true that a new temporary court stay was put in place Friday, with the hopes that the full court will hear the case, but they are determined to shut the hospital. Take care Lambert, thank you. Thank you so much, Lambert, and good luck for the future! Thank you for all the hard work, Lambert! Especially the covid coverage these last (checks watch) five years! The proposed New Yorker cover of Kamala is really a remarkable thing. While initially distracted by the hallowed visages that are somehow printed onto her suit, it was the raised index finger that surprised me. That‚Äôs a gesture that readers will remember I am sure, popularised by our friends ISIS: the tawhid, ‚Äúthe belief in the oneness of God and a key component of the Muslim religion.‚Äù As I understand it, this is the type of fundamentalism that rejects any other religious outlooks, including Shia etc, as idolatry, and worthy of death. It‚Äôs a very odd gesture for Kamala Harris to make. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2014-09-03/isis-sends-message Thank you Lambert, an era is passing, all is sackcloth and ashes. Farewell and god speed. It‚Äôs also a very popular gesture amongst cricket umpires. Doesn‚Äôt she have connections to India? Goodbye and thanks for all the thoughts! Thank you for the years of work Lambert. I was working yesterday and thought more than once,this is the last water cooler. I hope your next adventure is satisfying and you continue to share your insights with the many who appreciate them. Cheers Your email address will not be published.

Share this article BlackRock has incorporated the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) into its model portfolios, allocating between 1% and 2%, as Bloomberg reported today. This move comes as the world‚Äôs largest asset manager adjusts its investment strategy, which includes reducing equity overweight positions and exposure to long-duration bonds. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock‚Äôs Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a diversification tool. Despite recent market fluctuations, BlackRock maintains its strategic view on Bitcoin, with the firm overseeing more than $11 trillion in assets. IBIT, launched in January 2024, has attracted over $37 billion in inflows, although it saw $900 million in outflows last week. By November 2024, BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust reached a significant milestone by amassing $40 billion in assets in just 211 days, becoming one of the largest ETFs. The crypto market has been pressured by economic concerns and trade tensions, dampening risk appetite. Bitcoin is currently trading at $84,500, following a 7% dip to $78,200 overnight. The largest cap crypto had previously reached nearly $110,000 last month before pulling back. Share this article Sign in to your account Don‚Äôt have an account?

Title: Airlines Scrub DEI From Latest Annual Reports

Subscribe today to keep up with the latest travel industry news. Select a question above or ask something else U.S. airlines have begun to minimize mentions of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in their annual reports following political pressure from the Trump administration. Notably, American and United Airlines removed DEI sections from their latest reports, while only Delta and Southwest Airlines maintained such statements, focusing on merit-based hiring. This trend is part of a larger shift in corporate America, which has seen companies like Walmart and McDonald's also scale back DEI initiatives, influenced by recent political and legal changes, including the Supreme Court's ruling on affirmative action. Read the Stories Major U.S. airlines are starting to dial down statements on diversity, equity and inclusion hiring policies after wide-ranging pushback from the Trump administration. In American Airlines‚Äô 2024 10-K, the company didn‚Äôt include a section on DEI ‚Äì it had DEI sections in each of the four prior years. In its 2023 annual report, American said, ‚ÄúCultivating an environment that celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is a priority for us,‚Äù and listed out a range of initiatives the company had done to increase its diversity. This year, American said, ‚ÄúWe seek to hire the best and brightest,‚Äù and made no mention of diversity. United Airlines had a similar shift. In its most recent annual report, there are no mentions of ‚Äúdiversity, equity and inclusion.‚Äù Last year, in the same report, United provided statistics on the percentage of women and underrepresented minorities in its workforce. The company provided similar statistics in 2022, 2021, and 2020. JetBlue also did not have any statements on DEI hiring policies in their most recent annual reports, but did include such statements in its 2023 10-Ks. ‚ÄúThe report reflects that we have always hired based on merit and qualifications, especially as safety is critical to our airline,‚Äù JetBlue said in a statement to Skift. ‚ÄúWe believe in the programs, practices, and policies that we‚Äôve put in place to create a workplace where people feel valued, respected, and able to do their best work.‚Äù While Alaska Airlines did not mention DEI by name, it did say, "We believe that all who depend on Alaska Air Group deserve respect regardless of race, ethnicity, ability, age, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity. We are committed to treating every person equally ‚Äì on and off our aircraft. " Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines are the only two major U.S. carriers that included a statement on DEI in their 2024 annual reports. ‚ÄúOur commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is critical to effective human capital management at Delta,‚Äù Delta said in its 2024 10-K. The carrier also emphasized in the same report that its hiring practices were ‚Äúmerit-based.‚Äù Last year, the Atlanta-based carrier said one of its DEI initiatives included: ‚ÄúClosing diversity gaps in senior leadership positions by increasing the representation of women, Black and Latin/Hispanic groups in those roles.‚Äù This year, Delta didn‚Äôt mention closing any diversity gap in senior leadership, but instead it was ‚Äú adopting recruitment strategies that seek qualified leadership candidates with diverse experiences, skills and perspectives and expanding leadership development programs to continue promoting from within.‚Äù Southwest said in its 2024 annual report that ‚ÄúDEIB [diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging] is a part of the Company‚Äôs culture.‚Äù Southwest didn‚Äôt mention initiatives related to hiring more women and underrepresented minorities in the report, but had such mentions in its 2023 report. The industry has been slow to close its gender and racial gaps. For example, around 80% of flight attendants are women. But only 8% are pilots, even with a significant increase in pushes to recruit more female pilots. Delta‚Äôs and United‚Äôs most recent ESG reports from 2023 say that women make up around 34% and 33% of senior roles, respectively. American, Delta, United and JetBlue also signed onto the International Air Transport Association‚Äôs ‚Äú25 by 2025,‚Äù a pledge to increase female representation among corporate and frontline roles. DEI policies in corporate America took off in 2020 following the George Floyd protests. Many industries, including airlines, started publicly embracing diversity hiring policies. And as the industry faced an acute pilot shortage following the pandemic, airlines made major strides to recruit more women and people of color into those roles. United opened a flight school called the United Aviate Academy and covered much of the hefty costs associated with becoming a pilot. The carrier touted that 80% of its first Aviate class were either women or people of color. United also has business resource groups for its employees. Delta partnered with historically Black Hampton University as part of its collegiate pilot career path pipeline. And Alaska launched a partnership with Sisters in the Sky in 2019 to increase its representation of Black female pilots by 2025. President Trump and allies like Elon Musk have blamed DEI hiring policies for compromising safety in the airline industry. In a post on X, Musk claimed DEI was a reason for the Alaska Airlines blowout last year. ‚ÄúDo you want to fly in an airplane where they prioritized DEI hiring over your safety?‚Äù Musk wrote on X. ‚ÄúThat is actually happening.‚Äù Trump blamed DEI for a fatal collision near Reagan National Airport, without citing any evidence. The National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating the incident. Some airline executives have also changed the way they talk about DEI, instead emphasizing that their companies hire on merit. ‚ÄúWell, we do hire on merit,‚Äù United CEO Scott Kirby said during a January 22 call with analysts. ‚ÄúWe can hire the absolute best of the best and have a naturally diverse workforce.‚Äù Delta CEO Ed Bastian told the Atlanta Journal Constitution last month that DEI hiring is merit-based. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have DEI initiatives. We have people initiatives. ‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs always been. It‚Äôs core to who we are,‚Äù Bastian said. U.S. airlines toning down their language on DEI reflects a broader trend in corporate America. Walmart, Ford, Meta, and McDonald‚Äôs have walked back their DEI programs. BlackRock also removed references to DEI in its annual report. The pullback started last year after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions. Trump has issued multiple executive orders to end federal DEI programs and to bar the practice by federal contractors. A federal judge in Maryland blocked these bans on February 21. Another executive order asked federal agencies to flag corporate diversity hiring programs for potential investigation. A report from law firm White & Case advised companies filing 10-Ks to ‚Äúcarefully consider their diversity disclosure and ensure it is updated and aligns with a company's current priorities and policies.‚Äù U.S. agencies, including the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration, have deleted webpages related to DEI hiring policies. What am I looking at? The performance of airline sector stocks within the ST200. The index includes companies publicly traded across global markets including network carriers, low-cost carriers, and other related companies.

Title: BlackRock Adds Its IBIT Bitcoin ETF To Alternative Asset Model Portfolio
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/28/blackrock-adds-bitcoin-etf-to-alternative-asset-model-portfolio
Time Published: 2025-02-28T17:13:39Z
Full Content:
BlackRock has added the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the fund issued by the asset manager that holds bitcoin (BTC), to one of its model portfolios. These models suggest portfolios and rebalances which are then followed by advisors and platforms who can also request adjustments to the models based on their investment needs. BlackRock added a 1% to 2% allocation to IBIT in its target allocation portfolio that allows for alternative assets, according to James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In a report from Thursday, Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock‚Äôs Target Allocation ETF models, wrote that there are ‚Äúseveral substantive arguments that support bitcoin‚Äôs long-term investment merit.‚Äù According to Gates, this includes the crypto asset‚Äôs novel store of value and global monetary alternative, as well as hedge to the U.S. dollar hegemony and political instability, and proxy play on the ‚Äúoffline‚Äù to ‚Äúonline‚Äù digital transition of goods and services. ‚ÄúCollectively, these features may help provide unique and additive sources of risk premia and diversification to traditional multi-asset portfolios,‚Äù Gates wrote. The model represents one of IBIT‚Äôs smaller portfolios, however, the step is significant given that it is the first time BlackRock had made the decision to add IBIT to any of their models. ‚ÄúThis is a big deal because this is the first of those models to add bitcoin,‚Äù said Seyffart. ‚ÄúIt probably won‚Äôt be the last but bitcoin is also a lightning rod for many ‚Äî some will hate this while others will love it ‚Äî so I don‚Äôt know if or when they would add IBIT to their primary models that have a lot more money tracking them.‚Äù BlackRock‚Äôs model portfolios manage around $150 billion in assets as of December 31, 2024. CORRECTION (February 28, 2025, 14:56 UTC): Adds that BlackRock's model portfolios manage $150 billion in assets as opposed to $130 billion which the article incorrectly stated previously.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. United States President Donald Trump's views have changed corporate America's approach. Photo / Getty Images THREE KEY FACTS It‚Äôs been extraordinary how quickly corporate America has jumped - if not to Donald Trump‚Äôs will ‚Äì at least fast enough to be seen on the same side. The five big shifts outlined in this column will inevitably invite policy responses around the world ‚Äì including in New Zealand. ‚ÄúBP rolls back on Net Zero Goals ‚Äì bets $US10 billion on fossil fuels". The headline was qualified - ‚ÄúA smart move or a climate setback?‚Äù BP chief executive Murray Auchincloss has claimed the Ukraine war, the pandemic and unstable energy markets have slowed the shift to renewables. But in truth, BP‚Äôs strategic shift is as much about boosting profits and shareholder returns as the slowdown in the shift to renewables. Call it a fortuitous alignment for the oil major as it falls into line with the fossil fuel peddling from The White House. I got a sniff of this changing mindset at the 2023 Apec CEO Summit in San Francisco. Exxon chairman and CEO Darren Woods‚Äô address was pure anodyne: climate change is real; human activity plays a role; it is one of the major problems facing the world today ‚Äì but it‚Äôs not the only one. Woods segued. Many ideas to accelerate the energy transition were not based in economic, technological, or political reality. ‚ÄúWe cannot replace overnight an energy system that took 150 years to build. The size and complexity are simply too vast ‚Ä¶ No country has ever joined the developed world without access to oil and gas. The countries of the global south have every right to lift their people out of energy poverty and into the global middle class.‚Äù There is some truth to this. But coming from New Zealand where our political leaders had revelled in imposing a ban on oil and gas exploration, the contrast was stark. This strategic shift simply underlines Shane Jones‚Äô moves to leverage New Zealand‚Äôs resource base are not based on an alternate reality. The shift is real. BlackRock boss Larry Fink has made a commercial fetish of positioning his company at the forefront of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). But when the world‚Äôs largest asset manager released its annual report this week, all the usual virtuous references to DEI policies were gone. In 2023, BlackRock said a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture was ‚Äúa commercial imperative and indispensable to its success‚Äù. The latest report simply says ‚Äúdelivering for the firm‚Äôs clients requires attracting the best people from across the world. BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid group think‚Äù. It looks very much like the powerful Fink has simply fallen into line with the sentiments in Trump‚Äôs executive order that instructed federal agencies to investigate corporate DEI programmes on the grounds of potential civil rights violations. It‚Äôs too early to say what the implications will be for sustainable finance deals but when BlackRock pulls away from DEI and the oil majors step up fossil fuel production, there is a significant shift under way that will have implications here. The United States military has begun firing transgender members, who will be separated from service unless they receive exemptions. ‚ÄúMilitary service by service members and applicants for military service who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria is incompatible with military service,‚Äù a Defence Department memo says. ‚ÄúService by these individuals is not in the best interests of the military services and is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security.‚Äù The memo follows Trump‚Äôs signing of an executive order that took aim at transgender troops in a personal way, describing them as ‚Äúnot consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member‚Äù. Waivers would be granted only ‚Äúprovided there is a compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities‚Äù. NZ‚Äôs defence chiefs will have to watch out that the US does not seek to impose restrictions on those serving within the forces with which it operates. Washington Post owner and tech baron Jeff Bezos has issued an edict to his newspaper ruling that the opinions section would now be focused on ‚Äúpersonal liberties and free markets‚Äù and won‚Äôt publish anything that opposes those ideas. ‚ÄúWe are going to be writing every day in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,‚Äù the billionaire Amazon founder wrote in an email to Post staffers he published on X. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.‚Äù Bezos‚Äô stance is not too far distant from that imposed (through osmosis) by Rupert Murdoch in his flagship mastheads the Wall St Journal and The Australian. But it is a shock to the sensibilities of staffers and readers of the liberal leaning Post. Post publisher and chief executive William Lewis said that change was not about ‚Äúsiding with any political party‚Äù. ‚ÄúThis is about being crystal clear about what we stand for.‚Äù It‚Äôs also crystal clear that personal liberties and free markets is what the Trump administration stands for. The US Vice-President stunned the recent Munich Security Conference when he said the threat he worries most about is not Russia, nor China ‚Äì but the threat from within. He exploded the consensus between Europe and the US by arguing Europe has retreated from its most fundamental values by repressing conservative speech and political actors and was reaping the fruits of uncontrolled immigration. It was the equivalent of farting in church. What it does signal is the US leadership will respect no boundaries when it comes to selling its worldview. Will New Zealand subvert its own values to fall into line ‚Äì or is it time to craft a new story we can all be proud of? Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: Ethereum ‚Äì Institutional sell-offs hit ETH hard, but why are spot traders still buying?

Institutional and spot investors are clashing over ETH lately. Ethereum [ETH] has seen a major price drop lately amid a broader market downturn. In fact, over the last 24 hours, the altcoin declined by 10.41% on the charts, bringing its one-month loss to 33.10%. Institutional investors, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have contributed to this trend by continuing to sell ETH spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, according to AMBCrypto‚Äôs analysis, spot traders have helped prevent an even steeper decline. This week has seen significant ETH sell-offs by institutional investors through exchange-traded funds (ETFs). At the time of analysis, these investors seemed to have offloaded approximately $293 million worth of ETFs since the market opened on Monday, 24 February. A week-long sell-off like this usually alludes to skepticism among institutional investors about ETH‚Äôs price outlook. In fact, according to Coinbase‚Äôs ETH/USD daily chart, this sell-off caused the asset to drop from an opening price of $2,821.64 to a press-time value of $2,103.84. Source: Coinglass Among institutional sellers, BlackRock and Fidelity have contributed the most, offloading $144 million and $65.4 million worth of ETH, respectively, this week. While institutional investors have been selling, spot traders have been actively buying ETH over the same period. Between 24-28 February, approximately $864 million worth of ETH was purchased across cryptocurrency exchanges, according to Coinglass‚Äô exchange netflow data. Notably, even as ETH recorded a 10% drop in the last 24 hours, spot traders made their second-largest purchase of the week, acquiring $241 million worth of ETH. Source: Coinglass When significant institutional selling is met with strong spot buying, it points to underlying bullish sentiment in the market. AMBCrypto found that this week‚Äôs buying pressure has been primarily driven by retail investors, as large investors‚Äîwho typically control a substantial portion of supply‚Äîhave continued selling. According to IntoTheBlock, from a low of 36,430 ETH sold on 25 February, large investors have since offloaded an additional 114,850 ETH. If retail traders sustain their buying activity, ETH could maintain its bullish momentum and avoid dropping below the $2,000-threshold. The ETH exchange reserve, which tracks the amount of ETH held across different cryptocurrency exchanges, could serve as a confirmation of a price reversal. Source: Cryptoquant A decline in exchange reserves hints at potential price appreciation, while an increase alludes to growing selling pressure. If the press time reading of 18.9 million ETH declines further, it would indicate strengthening bullish momentum and a potential rally for ETH. This would mean that institutional sell pressure won‚Äôt potentially weigh on ETH as much.

A HUSBAND AND wife cryptocurrency trading team arrested in Dublin over an alleged ‚Ç¨21m international money laundering operation have been accused of facilitating organised crime. Jixu Wang, 35, and his 34-year-old wife, Ye Wang, who are originally from China but living on Avoca Road, were initially charged with possessing crime proceeds in a digital bank account between September 2023 and February 2024. They had been denied bail and have been in custody since 16 November last year. The couple appeared again at Dublin District Court where Detective Garda Barry Cusack informed Judge Deirdre Gearty that the Director of Public Prosecutions directed trial on indictment in the Circuit Court. They were also further charged with facilitating organised crime. Judge Gearty noted they made no reply when the detective put the new charges to them. She remanded them in continuing custody pending the preparation of a book of evidence, and they will appear again next week. Following a ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù investigation by the Dublin East Garda economic crime unit, with cooperation from Europol and police forces in Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, officers arrested the unemployed couple on 12 November. They searched their rented apartment on Avoca Road, Blackrock. An earlier bail hearing was told the pair previously ran a cryptocurrency trading business. They moved from the Philippines to Ireland in 2023 as part of an ‚Äúimmigration investment programme‚Äù after donating ‚Ç¨400,000 to a charity, ICARE Housing CLG. Advertisement Detective Garda Steven Dunican and Barry Cusack raised concerns about flight risk or that they could dispose of evidence. They had said officers from a Garda economic crime unit received information from German police about a suspected investment fraud.A German citizen had ‚Ç¨10,000 transferred from his bank to a Paytend digital bank account of Wang. Detective Garda Cusack conducted inquiries with Paytend regarding Jixu Wang, and it was alleged the accused used his Chinese passport number on the account. Garda Cusack identified 1,894 unusual transactions transferred into the account, valued at ‚Ç¨5,043,705, from 622 different IBANs over five months between 2 July and 9 November 2023. It was claimed that there were other unusual transactions between another Paytend account held by his wife, Ye Wang, who is a qualified accountant. Her Paytend account allegedly received 733 transactions valued at just over ‚Ç¨2.1m from 321 different bank accounts from 11 September 2023, and 12 January last year. The court heard claims GPS location has been obtained for login dates for both Paytend accounts, matching their address. The detectives claimed the couple were both unemployed but had just over ‚Ç¨7 million in their accounts. Gardai, including the Criminal Assets Bureau, allegedly identified ‚Ç¨14.7m in cryptocurrency wallets, of which ‚Ç¨4.4m has been seized or frozen by the investigation team, the bail hearing was told. Their apartment was searched, resulting in an alleged seizure of ‚Ç¨20,000, gold coins and five envelopes with ‚Äúseed words‚Äù to access a cryptocurrency wallet. Documents, phones and laptops have also been recovered. It was alleged Mrs Wang helped create fake documents to set up ‚Äúmoney ‚Äù accounts, but she denied knowing it was part of a crime. The detectives feared the couple, who have a young child, would leave the country if released on bail, as they had no family in Ireland or links to this jurisdiction.

Title: Bitcoin Boom‚Äôs Expiry Date? CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Timeline

Many people wonder about the length of Bitcoin‚Äôs rollercoaster journey that its price increase has been on. The bull run may persist until at least April 2025, argues CryptoQuant CEO, Ki Young Ju. Should this be the case, it could signal the longest ever Bitcoin bull cycle. Ju created a Bitcoin growth rate difference statistic for May 2024 that formed the foundation for his projection. Monitoring the long-term market movements of the crypto helps one to ascertain whether the asset is still in a growth phase or overheated. Right now, Bitcoin is in what he refers to as a ‚Äúcritical zone,‚Äù in which market signals combine bullish and bearish patterns. Whether Bitcoin keeps on its ascent or begins to lose vigor will depend mostly on the next few weeks, or months. #Bitcoin on-chain indicators are at the bull-bear boundary. I expect this to be the longest bull run in history, but I could be wrong. We need at least another month of data to confirm whether we‚Äôre entering a bear market. If demand doesn‚Äôt recover, indicators may fully signal a‚Ä¶ https://t.co/QkaZx7wmAt pic.twitter.com/4iHbuitW4o ‚Äî Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) February 27, 2025 Investors are beginning to have jitters about Bitcoin‚Äôs price as it has lost 30% of its value in the last few days. But Ju is not bothered. According to him, severe pullbacks like these are not uncommon during a bull cycle phase. Historical records support his assertion; earlier bull runs show price losses of up to 52% before recovery. Should history be the barometer, Bitcoin might still have some surprises in its sleeves and carry out strong upward moves in the face of a volatile market. Movement in Bitcoin price is much influenced by institutional investors. BlackRock lately sold roughly $70 million in ether and $440 million in bitcoin. These big sell-offs could cause temporary devaluations and change investor mood. These events could change the price direction of Bitcoin in the next months even if Ju is optimistic. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is not in good form as we speak: it is languishing in the $79,900 level, to the delight of those who‚Äôve been waiting to buy the dip. Bitcoin is trading 7% below its most recent closing. It peaked at $86,990 then fell to a low of $79,490. The bulls can only wish it was the other way around. Ju‚Äôs research shows that although some investors worry about possible future dips, the bull run is far from over. Since April 2025 is just a month away, traders and experts are still captivated by Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trend and what the coming days will bring on the table. Ju‚Äôs observations offer a data-driven viewpoint even if nobody can exactly predict the market. Whether Bitcoin follows past patterns or creates new ground, investors will be closely observing it.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats ‚Äì a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin‚Äô helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words ‚Äì the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: South Africans demand closure of German arms manufacturing giant

Demonstrators have picketed Union Buildings in Pretoria demanding the closure of GErma‚Äôs arms giant Rheinmetall in South Africa and more control over arms sales to Israel and Ukraine. Thuto Mashaba, who led the protest this week, stated this was a continuation of the picket in Boksburg last month. Although the German armaments firm has publicly acknowledged that it supplies weapons to Ukraine, he underlined that activists are extremely concerned that it is still producing artillery shells. ‚ÄùWe demanded that President Cyril Ramaphosa at the very least check the activities of the Rheinmetall plant for compliance with South Africa‚Äôs official policy of not intervening in international conflicts or supplying arms to third countries,‚Äù Mashaba said. BlackRock, a US financial corporation, holds the majority of shares in Rheinmetall Denel Munitions (RDM), a multinational arms manufacturer headquartered in Germany with operations in South Africa. According to the company‚Äôs recent report, the German military‚Äôs inventories are being reduced as a result of massive armament sales to Israel and Ukraine. RDM‚Äôs South African division is a major supplier of 155mm ammunition. Israel and Ukraine both purchase weaponry from Rheinmetall‚Äôs South African facility. The US Department of Defense recently announced that South Africa is a member of the Ukraine Defence Contact Support Group (UDCG). Notwithstanding South African regulations that forbid gun manufacturers from delivering their goods to areas of conflict, this activity is taking place. In a recent statement, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) said for the war in the Ukraine where artillery stockpile shortages have been replenished by South African sales. ‚ÄùAs a consequence of our dismal lack of arms control and failure to adhere to our domestic law and regulations, as well as international arms control regulations, we are guilty of enabling genocide. ‚ÄúThe EFF demands that the South African government must, as a matter of urgency, reform our weak, and administratively inept approach to weapons exports, and strengthen the capacity of the NCACC to fulfil its legal mandate,‚Äù the EFF said. The red berets said it is simply untenable for South Africa to state in the ICJ that Israel is committing genocide, while weapons manufactured in South Africa supply Israel with the means to commit genocide. It is currently alleged that Rheinmetall circumvents South Africa‚Äôs stringent export regulations by using its international network to divert ammunition from the factory to conflict areas after it is formally sold to Germany or other nations. IOL tried to get a comment from Rheinmetall but to no avail. First published by IOL RT News App ¬© Autonomous Nonprofit Organization ‚ÄúTV-Novosti‚Äù, 2005‚Äì2025. All rights reserved.

Title: To Defeat the Far Right, We Must Adopt an Anti-Fascist Economic Policy

Forgot Your Password? New to The Nation? Subscribe Print subscriber? Activate your online access Opposition to the status quo must not be monopolized by the right-wing extremist visions of parties like Alternative f√ºr Deutschland. This week we saw the electoral consequences of a failed economic paradigm: The parties comprising the market fundamentalist conservatives and right-wingers achieved a landslide victory in Germany. The CDU/CSU, led by the former head of Blackrock Germany, Friedrich Merz, won 28.5 percent of the vote and the Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD), the far-right party of former Goldman Sachs banker, Alice Weidel, won 20.8 percent. What had started as Germany‚Äôs ‚Äúprogress coalition‚Äù of social democrats, greens, and liberals failed. There were two key turning points: In 2022, the energy crisis in the wake of the Ukraine war hit the country hard, and free-market dogmatism delayed the response to price explosions. In 2023, economists who had long argued that markets were perfectly capable of handling the energy crisis and no major government measures were needed proclaimed that there was ‚Äúnot even a recession.‚Äù Without an emergency situation, it appeared as if there was no need to suspend the debt brake, a stringent fiscal rule that tied the government‚Äôs hands. Germany did enter a recession, and the economic crisis ultimately brought down the government. The reasons behind this result? A loss of confidence in the government, a bitter migration debate, the loss of real wages in recent years, and an ongoing economic crisis. In particular, frustration with economic conditions strengthened the far-right AfD. Because when the economic pie starts shrinking, the struggles over how to divide it escalate. For example, 37 percent of AfD voters and 18 percent of CDU/CSU voters assessed their own economic situation as poor. Tellingly, voters of left-wing and left-liberal parties are significantly less concerned about their economic situation. Even more serious: 85 percent of AfD voters believe that things are not fair in Germany. The overall economic situation was also considered poor by 96 percent of AfD voters and 90 percent of CDU/CSU voters. Here, too, the figures are significantly higher than for the other parties. The AfD has managed to position itself as an alternative to the status quo for those who fear for their economic situation, even though its program amounts to a redistribution from bottom to top. The message is clear: The worse people‚Äôs economic situation and prospects, the easier it is for right-wingers to exploit their discontent for their own ends. The current situation, however, should not come as a surprise. Elections in Europe, the United States, and in the German federal states showed this trend months ago, and polls pointed to these developments years ago. The AfD achieved its first surge to 15 percent of the vote in fall 2022 as a result of the energy price shock. The second surge to over 20 percent came in fall 2022, as the price shock deepened and the government briefly considered passing the costs of the crisis on to citizens via the gas levy. As in the US election, the latest surveys of AfD voters also confirm the central role of inflation: Around three-quarters are worried that they will no longer be able to pay their bills due to high prices, that they will not be able to maintain their standard of living, and that they will have money worries in old age. Since Fordism‚Äîwhen production was increasingly broken into a series of simple, repetitive operations‚Äîcapitalist societies in the Global North have been based on a fundamental social contract. People work hard and are paid enough to afford the necessities of life. When people continue to work hard, but the prices of essential goods skyrocket, workers feel betrayed. Their frustration is exacerbated when stock markets reach record highs and corporate profits skyrocket. What is needed is anti-fascist economic policy‚Äîan economic policy that offers a solution to socioeconomic decline and can ease people‚Äôs fears about the future. We need a concrete, democratic alternative to the status quo. As first steps, this means a policy that stabilizes essential prices‚Äîfrom food to energy to rent‚Äîand a policy that increases wages. Not only in the short term, but also for the future. Examples from Spain and Mexico show us that not only is this essential but also feasible. In Germany, however, the situation threatens to get worse. Under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, prices could rise even further. With extensive tax cuts planned for the richest, a higher VAT could be introduced to offset the costs. Before the election, Merz pointedly refused to rule this out. In addition, Merz is pursuing a radical emissions trading scheme that could lead to another energy price shock in the next few years. The overall economic outlook is disastrous as well, since Merz is committed to austerity. This makes the German economy, and German industry especially, vulnerable to economic shocks, which could be triggered, for example, by an intensifying climate crisis or the tariffs announced by the Trump administration. Although Merz benefited from the poor economic situation in this election, his neoliberal economic turnaround could lead to the implosion of the CDU in the next election. This is also the openly communicated goal of the AfD. They want to replace the CDU as the far-right people‚Äôs party, and they are betting, rightly in my opinion, that the CDU will not solve the economic crisis. I believe that neoliberal politics will lead to a further fall in living standards and fraying of the social fabric. This means that in 2029 there is a real threat that a far-right party will be a part of the government in Germany. It is therefore even more important that civil society, trade unions, and progressives within and outside parliament stand up to market fundamentalism‚Äîat the very least, by fending off the harshest austerity policies, such as an increase in VAT, and at best, by achieving real policy victories, such as a rent freeze. For an anti-fascist economic policy to counteract the rise of the AfD, it is also essential to present clear policy solutions that make a better future conceivable. Opposition to the status quo must not be monopolized by the right-wing extremist visions of the AfD. Progressives must address people‚Äôs existing concerns and the major challenges of our time simultaneously and comprehensively. A new climate populism must play just as much a role in this as a sustainable industrial policy, fair taxation, and an investment program for public infrastructure. The debt brake needs to be reformed, but if it is reduced to ramp up military spending while bridges, hospitals, and schools continue to crumble, it will only play into the hands of the AfD. Germany has enormous fiscal leeway, which must be used to pave the way out of the current plight. This election result should serve as a warning, not just to Germany but to democratic societies around the world. We need to abandon market fundamentalism and muster the courage to design an economy that serves the needs of the general population‚Äînot as a side effect but as the primary goal. Democracy cannot be preserved by only discussing how to save it. It can only be secured by policies that guarantee a good life for all. Isabella M.

Title: Spiritans accused of two-tier approach to redress for sex abuse cases
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/social-affairs/2025/02/28/spiritans-accused-of-two-tier-approach-to-redress-for-sex-abuse-cases/
Time Published: 2025-02-28T07:00:00Z
Full Content:
A group representing survivors of child sexual abuse at Spiritan schools has called on the congregation to implement a redress scheme no later than June 1st this year. Restore Together said that, while it welcomes reports that the Spiritans have been making legal settlements with survivors who had taken court action, it did not believe any survivor should have to issue legal proceedings to obtain justice. ‚ÄúChild welfare and trauma experts agree that having to bring legal proceedings to seek justice adds to the suffering of victims/survivors, many of whom are very vulnerable,‚Äù it said. As reported in The Irish Times on Wednesday, the Spiritans have paid ‚Ç¨8.8 million in settlements to 125 abuse survivors who initiated court proceedings against the congregation. The figure does not include legal costs. Of that figure, ‚Ç¨3.4 million was paid in settlements to 52 survivors of 58 who have come forward since RT√â broadcast its Blackrock Boys radio documentary in November 2022. Between 1998 and prior to that broadcast in November 2022, the congregation paid ‚Ç¨5.4 million in settlements to 73 survivors. To date Restore Together has supported over 300 survivors of sexual abuse at Spiritan schools and has been working with the congregation ‚Äúto bring healing to those who suffered as children and continue to suffer as adults through a professionally guided and administered programme of restorative justice.‚Äù In a statement on Friday, it accused the Spiritans of operating a two-tier system when it came to redress. It was ‚Äúnot acceptable‚Äù that the congregation was ‚Äútreating victims/ survivors who issue legal proceedings against them with greater urgency than the many who wish, in good faith and for good reason, to obtain financial recognition for the harm done to them through a redress scheme that the order has agreed to in principle,‚Äù it said. It also added that ‚Äúfinancial awards under the redress scheme should be at the same value that a court would award to a successful claimant‚Äù. The Spiritans in Ireland had ‚Äúvery significant assets which it has valued at ‚Ç¨160 million in its accounts. This is multiple times the amount that would be needed to fully implement a redress scheme,‚Äù Restore Together said. Spiritan schools concerned are Blackrock College and Willow Park; St Mary‚Äôs College, Rathmines; St Michael‚Äôs College, Ballsbridge; Templeogue College, in Dublin, and Rockwell College in Co Tipperary. The congregation had agreed to a redress scheme ‚Äúin principle, as one of five pillars of its restorative justice programme‚Äù and that there have been detailed discussions ‚Äúwith the Spiritans and their lawyers about its structure, nature and implementation,‚Äù Restore Together said. It had ‚Äúrepeatedly emphasised‚Äù to the Spiritans ‚Äúthe urgency of providing redress to victims to help with their healing. Every week that goes by without a redress scheme being in place prolongs the suffering, and in some cases despair, of victims/survivors who have come forward in good faith having carried their burden for decades through their lives.‚Äù Ongoing delay ‚Äúrepeats and continues the sense of betrayal and abandonment first felt by victims/survivors as innocent children‚Äù while ‚Äúmany victims/survivors are now in the later stage of life and should not have to wait any longer for proper recognition by the Spiritans of their failure to protect the children in their care or wait for the justice to which they are entitled,‚Äù it said. The Spiritans own ‚Äúprinciples and Christian teachings‚Äù required them ‚Äúto show true repentance and to fully atone for what they as a congregation did to these vulnerable children,‚Äù it said.

Title: Real-World Assets ‚Äì The $56 Billion Frontier
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/27/real-world-assets-the-56-billion-frontier/
Time Published: 2025-02-28T04:40:38Z
Full Content:
The tokenization of RWAs (real-world assets) stands at an inflection point, with the market reaching $56 billion and poised for explosive growth. While skeptics have long criticized cryptocurrency‚Äôs lack of intrinsic value, RWA platforms fundamentally reshape this narrative by bringing tangible assets ‚Äì from real estate to equities ‚Äì onto the blockchain. Four key players exemplify the sector‚Äôs maturation and growing institutional adoption. Their success underscores a crucial reality ‚Äì RWA operates as a complex two-sided marketplace, requiring both willing asset owners and sophisticated investors. As Wall Street takes interest, a new batch of regulations that nurture the burgeoning sector is crucial for long-term growth. Pendle Pendle offers perhaps the most innovative approach to yield-bearing assets. Unlike traditional products where ownership and yield are inseparable, Pendle‚Äôs model allows separate trading of PT (principal tokens) and YT (yield tokens). This flexibility has driven their total value locked to $5.9 billion, five times larger than that of their nearest competitor. Their fixed yields for popular products reach as high as 14.7% for USDe, attracting investors seeking stable returns in volatile markets. Ethena Ethena‚Äôs trajectory demonstrates the critical role of venture capital in shaping the RWA landscape. Following a $14 million Series A round that attracted investments from Franklin Templeton and Fidelity, they‚Äôve secured strategic partnerships with World Liberty Financial and Deribit. Their synthetic dollar, sUSDe, offering a six percent APY, represents a new generation of yield-bearing assets designed for institutional adoption. Ondo Ondo Finance exemplifies the sector‚Äôs push toward mainstream integration. Through partnerships with BlackRock and Morgan Stanley, they‚Äôve launched tokenized versions of blue-chip stocks and ETFs, including Coca-Cola (onKO) and SPDR Gold Shares (onGLD). Their recent announcement of Ondo Chain ‚Äì purpose-built for institutional-grade RWAs ‚Äì signals growing confidence in the sector‚Äôs future. What makes these developments particularly significant is their timing. As retail investors grow increasingly sophisticated and demand more stable investment vehicles, RWA platforms offer a compelling solution. When the average US home price stands at $356,585, fractional ownership through tokenization democratizes access to previously exclusive asset classes. The regulatory environment appears increasingly supportive ‚Äì particularly in the US ‚Äì where stablecoin legislation is gaining momentum. This could provide a substantial boost to yield-bearing assets like Ondo‚Äôs USDY, currently unavailable to US investors. Wall Street‚Äôs latest (and biggest?) bet The RWA transformation extends beyond traditional finance ‚Äì innovative projects are exploring tokenization of everything from aviation financing to electric motorcycle fleets, demonstrating the versatility of RWA platforms. However, challenges remain. The sector must navigate complex regulatory requirements, ensure robust security measures and build sufficient liquidity across various asset classes. Success requires substantial capital ‚Äì evidenced by the aggressive fundraising among leading platforms ‚Äì to secure regulatory approvals and build institutional-grade infrastructure. Even with these challenges, traditional financial institutions are taking notice. The involvement of firms like BlackRock, Morgan Stanley and Fidelity isn‚Äôt merely symbolic ‚Äì it represents a fundamental shift in how Wall Street views digital assets. These partnerships provide crucial infrastructure and credibility, helping bridge the gap between traditional and DeFi (decentralized finance). Yet the trajectory is clear. RWA tokenization represents more than just another blockchain use case ‚Äì it‚Äôs a fundamental reimagining of how we interact with traditional assets. By breaking down barriers to investment and creating more efficient markets, these platforms are driving what may be the most profound cultural and economic impact within the crypto space. As we move through 2025, the question isn‚Äôt whether RWA will transform finance, but rather which platforms will emerge as the dominant players in this new paradigm. For investors and institutions alike, understanding this evolution isn‚Äôt just advantageous ‚Äì it‚Äôs essential. The next phase of growth will likely come from increased institutional adoption, regulatory clarity and innovative applications that push the boundaries of what can be tokenized.

Title: ‚ÄòPeople avoid Deansgrange‚Äô: Roadworks plan angers south Dublin community
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/dublin/2025/02/27/people-avoid-deansgrange-roadworks-plan-angers-south-dublin-community/
Time Published: 2025-02-27T22:19:22Z

Residents, politicians and members of the business community in Deansgrange have sharply criticised a ‚Ç¨12.5 million roadworks scheme which they said has brought the south Dublin suburb to a halt for the second time in as many years. At a public meeting in Bakers Corner on Thursday night, representatives of D√∫n Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and its contractor Clonmel Enterprises were repeatedly heckled as they sought to outline the works schedule for the two-year project. Opening the meeting, William Winters, resident engineer in the council‚Äôs active travel section, said the scheme ‚Äì Phase One of the D√∫n Laoghaire Central Active Travel Scheme ‚Äì having gone through public consultation and a vote by councillors was ‚Äúnow an approved scheme, so this meeting is about the construction stage‚Äù. However, Mr Winters was roundly heckled and a number of people questioned the design including closure of left hand slipways at junctions, the cost of the project, the method of public consultation and traffic light sequencing at Bakers Corner which they claimed allowed just three cars per direction, through the junction at a time. A number of speakers said congestion had built up extensively in surrounding suburbs and people could not drive out of their housing estates while some vehicles were rat-running. Many speakers complained of poor signage, a lack of yellow boxes on the roads, safety measures for children and the elderly and the absence of night-time and weekend working on the project. The scheme involves the building of segregated cycling and walking facilities on roads around D√∫n Laoghaire. Over the next two years work will take place on Kill Avenue, Mounttown Road Upper and Lower and Glenageary Road Upper. It is also proposed to install enhanced bus priority along Kill Avenue up to the Bakers Corner junction and improve landscaping. Niall McElwaine, a director of Clonmel Enterprises which is carrying out the construction work, told the meeting the company had a job to do and was carrying it out in a structured way. ‚ÄúIn terms of you not wanting it ‚Äì we are only the contractors here,‚Äù he said. Earlier, local businesses told The Irish Times they were particularly aggrieved about the road works, which involve redesigning junctions over a wide area between Bakers Corner and Killiney, follow almost two years of disruption on Deansgrange Road. Rachel Twomey general manager of SuperValu which employs 100 full- and part-time staff told The Irish Times most people understood the imperative for active travel measures. But she accused the council of failing to understand the community it was serving. ‚ÄúThey can say people should do their big shop somewhere else like Cornelscourt or Blackrock and just crush us. But they have not considered families taking children to sports in other communities after school. These communities around south Dublin are interconnected. They go one place for hockey, another for swimming and another for tennis, somewhere else for GAA and football,‚Äù she said. In relation to the impact on her business, she said ‚Äúthe big shop is gone, gone gone‚Äù. Declan Fitzgerald of Nexus Accounting on Deansgrange Road said his firm owned the building which featured a number of retail units at ground floor. He said one of these, a flower shop, had handed back the keys due to business disruption, while he himself was still in talks to the council over compensation for land taken fronting Deansgrange Road. He said businesses in the area were extremely frustrated. Tom Kelly who runs Graft Coffee in the Deansgrange Business park said he had not counted the loss of custom to his business but trade was visibly down. He said it regularly takes 30 minutes and more to travel the last 800 metres to his coffee shop, since changes were put in place. ‚ÄúPeople avoid Deansgrange,‚Äù he said. Local Fine Gael councillor Maurice Dockrell also cited the closure of the flower shop which he said was due to ‚Äúthe prolonged roadworks, combined with ongoing building works [which] have made traffic conditions unbearable.

Title: Goldman Sach says it's just following the law as it strips out references to DEI
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-diversity-dei-hiring-goals-annual-report-trump-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-27T15:30:06Z

Goldman Sachs tamped down the diversity language in its annual report as DEI efforts come under fire from the Trump administration. The bank also said "aspirational hiring goals" it set five years ago expire this year without saying whether it planned to set new goals. Goldman's 2024 annual report, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, referenced diversity relating to human capital just three times, versus 14 in the 2023 report and 16 times in the 2022 report. The Wall Street bank also eliminated a section of the report previously titled "Diversity and Inclusion," its hiring breakdown by race and gender and its diverse hiring goals by race and gender. Earlier this year, Goldman dropped a policy requiring companies it advises on IPOs to have at least two women directors. Goldman isn't alone. The $11 trillion asset manager BlackRock this week also cut mentions of its "three pillar DEI strategy" in its annual report, as well as a breakout of its employee demographics by race and gender. It also amended the metrics used to determine borrowing costs for a $4.4 billion credit facility which was previously tied to its efficacy in boosting internal DEI targets. The changes come as President Trump cracks down on DEI. In January, he invoked directed the Department of Justice to investigate DEI policies, prohibiting private organizations from instituting such initiatives in employment practices related to federal contracts. In a statement, Goldman CEO David Solomon cited changes to the law. "We have made certain adjustments to reflect developments in the law in the US," he said. "Our people are a powerful example of that and that's why we will continue to focus on the importance of attracting and retaining diverse, exceptional talent." Goldman said in the report that it still believes in a diverse workforce and would "continue to develop programs consistent with our fundamental commitment to inclusive merit-based promotion and compliance with the law." The bank's 2023 report set goals to hire of 50% women analysts and associates, 11% Black professionals and 14% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 9% Black professionals in the UK. In 2023, it also broke down its workforce by race and gender, saying its analyst and associate hires included 49% women professionals, 9% Black professionals and 13% Hispanic/Latinx professionals in the Americas, and 15% Black professionals in the UK. Also gone are mentions of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or HBCUs. In the 2023 report, Goldman said it would seek to double the number of campus hires in the US recruited from HBCUs in 2025 relative to 2020.What's more, a breakdown of the firm's aspirational goals for diverse hiring is also missing. For Goldman, DEI has historically been framed as a business imperative. In its 2022 annual report, the firm stated that "diversity at all levels" was "essential to our sustainability" and cited efforts to increase representation among women and underrepresented groups. At the time, the firm touted stats, such as one where it said approximately 57% of Goldman's board was diverse by race, gender, or sexual orientation. Even so, its track record on DEI has come under fire for other reasons. Last year, reporting from The Wall Street Journal found that numerous senior women at the bank felt it hadn't done enough to support their career prospects or advancement, and was still heavily male-dominated.

Title: People are pumping the brakes on their expectations of economic growth

Hello there! Feeling nostalgic about those old Taco Bell/Pizza Hut combo restaurants? Well, there's a new dynamic duo in the neighborhood: Applebee's and IHOP. We got to try out their first hybrid restaurant in the US, which is hoping to appeal to young diners. In today's big story, the economy is showing signs of slowing down and some are saying DOGE isn't helping things. What's on deck Markets: An inside look at what life is like at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office. Tech: Nvidia posted another big earnings beat. Business: Jeff Bezos has a new rule for The Washington Post. But first, we're taking it slow. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The economic growth spurt some were hoping for with the new administration is coming up short. President Donald Trump's second term promised tax cuts, deregulation, and an environment that would get an economy firing on all cylinders. But investors and economic experts are raising concerns about a slowdown this year. Neil Dutta, the head of economics at Renaissance Macro Research, outlined how the US economy is starting to look sluggish. The market is also indicating something's amiss, as the 10-year US Treasury yield has dipped recently. That's a key benchmark of DOGE's success ‚Äî lower yield means lower lending costs for consumers ‚Äî but it's not dropping for the reasons DOGE wants, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox. The group's cost-cutting efforts are actually further muddying the economic outlook, according to some, leading yields to drop as investors look for a safe haven. Dutta highlighted two things that have kept the economy humming ‚Äî consumer and government spending ‚Äî showing signs of strain. To Dutta's point, a trio of economic data released last Friday on consumer sentiment and housing indicated all was not well, which led stocks to have their worst day of the year. He's not alone in his concerns. Last week, hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen listed several factors ‚Äî tariffs, less immigration, and cuts to government spending ‚Äî for why he was "actually pretty negative for the first time in a while" on the economy's growth potential and where the markets are headed. The Point72 founder said he expects a "significant correction." Truist chief market strategist Keith Lerner is also treading carefully. Just six weeks after talking about a buy-the-dip opportunity, Lerner downgraded US equities for the first time in years from attractive to neutral. Predictions of an economic dropoff predated DOGE and the administration. Before the election, the International Monetary Fund forecast that the US economy's growth would ease up in 2025. And as we're less than two months into Trump's second term, a lot is subject to change. But in the short term, DOGE's intent to clean up government waste could be speeding up the economy's slowdown. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer highlighted DOGE (in addition to tariffs and immigration) as "potential growth headwinds." All this might sound counterintuitive. Wouldn't reducing the government's massive deficit be good for the economy? Billionaire Ray Dalio said rising debt could lead to a financial "heart attack" if not addressed. But Cohen said the cost cutting is like a shock to the system. ‚Äã‚Äã"When that money's been coursing through the economy over many years and now potentially it will be reduced or stopped in many ways, it has to be negative for the economy," he said. 1. Bitcoin turns bearish. The crypto token has taken a tumble ‚Äî down as much as 13% from its January high ‚Äî and has officially entered bear territory. Tuesday was a real drag, with bitcoin ETF investors pulling over $1.1 billion. Between policy promises falling short and last week's $1.5 billion hack of crypto-exchange Bybit, confidence in bitcoins and altcoins has faltered. The volatility takes its toll, with crypto addiction becoming a growing concern. 2. Goldman takes the Lone Star state. Southern hospitality, an open-door culture, box seats at Mavericks games ‚Äî these are just some of the highlights of working at Goldman Sachs' Dallas office, according to five employees who spoke to BI. And more perks are on the horizon with Goldman planning a new Dallas campus with rooftop gardens, childcare, and more. 3. Elliott Management founder Paul Singer doesn't have fun at work. The man behind the $72 billion fund knows how to have a good time: He likes skiing, snowmobiling, and playing the keyboard. At the office, though, Singer is all work and no play, preparing for risks at every turn. In a recent interview, Singer spoke about the stresses of running a firm and his concerns about the market, but he's in it for the long haul. 1. Nvidia shrugs off DeepSeek concerns with a strong earnings beat. The chip giant reported revenue of $39.33 billion, beating Wall Street's estimates by more than $1 billion. On the earnings call, Nvidia's CFO said that demand for Blackwell chips also exceeded expectations ‚Äî and the stock rose in after-hours trading. CEO Jensen Huang said that AI models like DeepSeek's R1 need 100 times more compute, on the call. 2. Is having Palantir on your r√©sum√© the golden ticket for tech hires? CEO Alex Karp seems to think so. BI spoke with six technical recruiting specialists to find out if this was the case. Some weren't so sure, saying the industry prefers strong results over credentials. Palantir may also still struggle with brand recognition, and its culture could be a turn-off for those hiring. 3. Amazon's AI-powered Alexa+ is finally here. After slow progress, the tech giant unveiled its long-awaited voice assistant on Wednesday. Panos Panay, Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services, said the upgraded Alexa can invent bedtime stories, offer recipes, and book reservations through partner companies. Here's what to expect ‚Äî and how much it'll cost. 1. Model Karolina Kurkova and her husband are at war with an exclusive private island club. In a lawsuit, the model and her real-estate broker husband are alleging Fisher Island Club's board of directors threatened them and wrongfully expelled them from the club, harming their reputation and causing them millions of dollars in damages. The private island that's just south of Miami Beach is home to multiple billionaires and high-profile celebrities. The Fisher Island Club denies the lawsuit's allegations as baseless and believes the complaint "is nothing more than disgruntled former members." 2. Jeff Bezos has an opinion on the opinion page. The Washington Post owner announced sweeping changes to the paper's opinion section in a note to staff and shared on X. The paper's op-eds must support "free markets" and "personal liberties," he said. As part of the overhaul, the opinions editor, David Shipley, has stepped down. While newspaper ownership often sets the tone for op-eds, the note is Bezos' latest controversial move after over a year of internal turmoil. 3. There will be winners and losers as the new Trump administration rewrites how business is regulated. Crypto firms including Coinbase and Robinhood have already benefited. Meanwhile, some legal experts predict an uptick in traditional securities cases and a continuation of the Biden DOJ's aggressive antitrust enforcement in cases against Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, and Ticketmaster.

Title: Bitcoin Pepe turns into a compelling alternative amid a bleak Bitcoin sentiment

Bitcoin‚Äôs recent tumble has sent shockwaves through the crypto market, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to its lowest level in over two years, signaling extreme fear among investors. Macroeconomic uncertainties, fueled by threats of trade tariffs from US President Donald Trump, have only added to the unease. However, amid this bleak backdrop, a new project dubbed Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a potential alternative for crypto enthusiasts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index recently hit a score of 10, its lowest since June 2022. That period saw major crypto collapses like Three Arrows Capital and Terraform Labs, sparking widespread panic. Today, the sentiment echoes that fear, even without similar crashes. Bitcoin‚Äôs price has dropped nearly 16% in the past 30 days, hovering around $86,304. Analysts pin this on macroeconomic pressures, including Trump‚Äôs reaffirmed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with threats aimed at the European Union stoking fears of a trade war. Bitcoin investment products, particularly US spot Bitcoin ETFs, are bleeding cash. Over seven days, $3 billion flowed out, including a record $420 million single-day exit from BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust. Funds like Ark 21Shares and Grayscale saw heavy withdrawals too. However, some analysts remain hopeful. Ben Simpson of Collective Shift says buying during extreme fear often pays off historically. But Arthur Hayes warns of a drop to $70,000. Ki Young Ju notes 30% corrections are normal in bull cycles, citing a 53% dip in 2021 that Bitcoin overcame. Amid the volatile crypto market, Bitcoin Pepe is stepping up as a fresh option in the stormy market with its ongoing presale. With the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Only Bitcoin Meme ICO,‚Äù the project aims to bring Solana-like perks of speed and low fees to Bitcoin‚Äôs sturdy network. It‚Äôs a Layer-2 solution built for meme coins. The PEP-20 standard is its backbone. It lets anyone launch meme coins on Bitcoin, tapping into the blockchain‚Äôs unmatched resilience. Bitcoin‚Äôs staying power makes this a big deal. Bitcoin Pepe‚Äôs presale is rolling along in Stage 5 of 30, having raised $3,632,454 at press time, with the BPEP token priced at $0.0255 and set to rise to $0.0268 in the next stage. This tiered pricing shows a deliberate rollout plan aimed to incentivize early investors. As Bitcoin Pepe rides the meme coin wave, blending it with Bitcoin‚Äôs strength with instant transactions and tiny fees to draw users tired of Bitcoin‚Äôs usual costs, its presale offers a compelling haven for those who want to hedge against the current market turmoil. Looking ahead, the project‚Äôs roadmap hints at future growth with talk of partnerships and integrations.

Share this article BlackRock moved 5,100 Bitcoin worth approximately $441 million and 30,000 Ether valued at about $71 million to Coinbase Prime within the last hour, as tracked by Arkham Intelligence. The transfer follows BlackRock‚Äôs Tuesday movement of $160 million in Bitcoin and $44 million in Ethereum to Coinbase Prime, amid mounting pressure on BlackRock‚Äôs flagship Bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). IBIT has experienced negative performance for three consecutive days, with approximately $741 million in net outflows so far this week, based on Farside Investors data. US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day outflows of over $1 billion on Tuesday, with IBIT accounting for $164 million of the withdrawals. Given the recent Bitcoin ETF sell-off, with IBIT posting negative performance for three consecutive days, the deposit raises concerns about further liquidations. The latest transfers come as Bitcoin recovered slightly above $86,000 after dropping to $83,000 on Tuesday, its lowest level since November 2024. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes previously warned that hedge funds employing an arbitrage strategy‚Äîlong IBIT and short CME futures for enhanced yield‚Äîpose a potential risk to Bitcoin‚Äôs price. He cautioned that if the basis spread narrows during a Bitcoin decline, these funds might sell IBIT and buy back futures, potentially driving the price towards $70,000.

Title: Fidelity Target Allocation ETF Model Portfolios (Meant for Advisors)

Time Published: 2025-02-27T08:12:21Z

My Money Blog One of my older relatives used Fidelity to manage their investments, and it was a hodgepodge of over 10 different mutual funds with a total expense ratio nearing 1%. The last time I measured its long-term performance, it lagged the benchmark indexes by‚Ä¶ roughly 1%. Since then, I‚Äôve always viewed that as a big part of Fidelity‚Äôs business model. They will sell you a portfolio that looks complex and smart, with fancy-sounding names and lots of moving parts. In the end, your performance will be okay because it will capture most of the stock market return, and most folks won‚Äôt even notice the chunk that was missing from fees. From a certain perspective, you paid a fee and got what you wanted: a stamp of approval from a respectable name. If you‚Äôre wondering how Fidelity can offer their excellent customer service and products at such a competitive prices, this is why. There are many people paying additional fees for their various advisory services. I‚Äôm okay with that ‚Äì as a DIY investor I am comfortable turning down their upsell pitches for additional assistance. So when I saw the ETF.com article Fidelity Debuts All-ETF Model Portfolios for Advisors, I admit that I had my preconceived notions. Would they surprise me? You can view all of model portfolios here. Here is a screenshot with just their moderate risk 60% stock/40% bond portfolio. The hodgepodge of fancy names is still going strong. It‚Äôs like a checklist of industry buzz words: Dynamic Growth, Enhanced, High Dividend, Momentum, Inflation, Multifactor. I find it amusing that Dividend tends to equate to ‚ÄúValue‚Äù, which is the opposite of ‚ÄúGrowth‚Äù. If you own this many different things, how different is it really from just owning the entire stock market? There still appears to be added complexity just for the sake of looking complex. Is it really helpful to have 2% in the iShares Core Dividend ETF? Or 2% in Cash Sweep? SIX to EIGHT different US bond ETFs??? With a weighted expense ratio of 0.25%, the overall cost is much lower than their active mutual fund portfolios from 10+ years ago. Competition from Vanguard and Blackrock have forced the expense ratios lower across the industry. So while the Fidelity model seems to pretty much the same, it does now come potentially at a lower price. So that‚Äôs a good thing. Some of these Fidelity ETFs are barely a year old, so we can‚Äôt do a backtest. I will have to remember to run another comparison 10 years from now between this 60/40 Fidelity ETF portfolio and a simple 3-ETF low-cost index portfolio from Vanguard (42% VTI/18% VXUS/40% BND) or iShares (42% ITOT/18% IXUS/40% IUSB). The low-cost index portfolio have a weighted expense ratio of about 0.04%. Can the Fidelity outperform and justify their higher fees? Complexity breeds dependency. If the advisor placed the funds in 3 or 4 ETFs, or a single Target Retirement Fund, the customer would soon question why they are paying for advisory services. We can‚Äôt have that! üéØ üòÅ I imagine there‚Äôs also at least some overlap between some of these ETFs. Is there a tool that can take a number of ETFs/mutual funds and go through their holdings to determine how much you‚Äôre holding of each company? That could also be used to immediately determine how this fares against the Vanguard and iShares since the underlying holdings have been around for long enough.

Title: Bitcoin Post-Election Rally Crushed: Prices Dip Below $84,000 As Tariff Tensions Rise

On Wednesday, Bitcoin (BTC) prices plummeted to a four-month low, reaching as low as $81,000, as the anticipated ‚ÄúTrump bump‚Äù in the markets faded. This has prompted investors and traders to hedge against further decreases, with Bitcoin options indicating a notable interest in put options with a strike price of $70,000. According to data from Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, this strike price represents the second-highest open interest among all contracts set to expire on February 28, with a total of $4.9 billion in open interest poised to expire by Friday. Since President Donald Trump‚Äôs inauguration in January, Bitcoin has experienced a substantial decline of roughly 20% from its record highs. Market analysts attribute this downturn to a combination of factors, including Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúaggressive geopolitical‚Äù stance and ongoing concerns about elevated inflation. Chris Newhouse, director of research at Cumberland Labs, noted, ‚ÄúTariff policies are further dampening the outlook, and stubbornly high short-term inflation expectations add to the overall caution.‚Äù Newhouse also highlighted that the Bybit Ethereum (ETH) hack has not only exerted downward pressure on Bitcoin‚Äôs price but has also negatively impacted overall market sentiment. The market has also witnessed a significant liquidation of bullish bets, with around $2 billion wiped out over the past three days, according to data from Coinglass. Bitcoin perpetual futures‚Äîa popular method for offshore investors to leverage their positions‚Äîsaw a sharp decline in long positions during this timeframe. Adding to the bearish sentiment, demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has waned, with the group experiencing approximately $2.1 billion in outflows over the past six days. This reflects a broader trend of investors pulling back, with more than $1 billion withdrawn from spot Bitcoin ETFs on Tuesday alone, marking the largest outflow since these funds debuted in January of the previous year. The Fidelity Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) were among the hardest hit. Bohan Jiang, head of over-the-counter options trading at Abra, commented, ‚ÄúThis is a mix of spot selling and basis unwind.

Title: Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs electricity crisis: AI data centers to consume one third of national grid by 2026

While the Irish government, through the Irish Development Authority (IDA), champions these developments as critical to the nation√¢¬Ä¬ôs digital economy, critics argue that the benefits disproportionately serve transnational corporations rather than Irish citizens. This raises urgent questions about energy equity, national infrastructure, and the long-term sustainability of Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs energy policies. The rise of data centers and the AI boom The rapid expansion of data centers in Ireland is inextricably linked to the global rise of AI technologies. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Irish data centers will consume a staggering 33% of the country√¢¬Ä¬ôs electricity grid by 2026. Currently, Ireland hosts between 82 and 95 data centers, with dozens more under construction or in the planning stages. By 2026, this number is expected to reach 130, cementing Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs status as a European hub for data storage and processing. While the Irish government and the IDA frame this growth as essential for economic development, the reality is more complex. A report by international law firm Mason, Hayes & Curran highlights that √¢¬Ä¬úAI has significantly driven the demand for data center capacity,√¢¬Ä¬ù noting that the scale and power requirements of these facilities have grown exponentially as AI technologies expand globally. Yet, public discourse often glosses over the role of AI, instead emphasizing the role of data centers in supporting everyday digital activities like streaming or online shopping. √¢¬Ä¬úWhether you realize it or not, every streaming show you watch, every match you make on Tinder, and every flight you book is facilitated by a data center,√¢¬Ä¬ù wrote RTE Brainstorm in April 2024. While technically accurate, this framing obscures the larger truth: Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data centers primarily serve the profit-driven needs of transnational corporations, not the Irish public. Who owns Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data centers? The ownership of Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two. These companies have sought to offset their energy consumption by investing in Irish wind farms, entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy without directly owning the infrastructure. For example, Amazon has invested in wind farms in County Cork (23 MW), County Galway (115 MW), and County Donegal (pending review). However, critics argue that this creates a circular problem: transnational corporations drive the need for more electricity, then invest in renewable energy projects to meet that demand, effectively privatizing Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs energy resources. Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role. Equinix, which operates six data centers in Ireland and plans to build a seventh, is largely owned by institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These facilities host a wide range of clients, from software giants like Adobe and Microsoft to telecom providers like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom. The construction boom and its beneficiaries The construction of data centers has become a lucrative sector in Ireland, with companies like Winthrop Technologies leading the charge. Founded in 1995, Winthrop has grown into one of Europe√¢¬Ä¬ôs largest data center construction firms, with projected 2024 revenues of √¢¬Ç¬¨2 billion. In April 2024, private equity firm Blackstone acquired a majority stake in the company for over √¢¬Ç¬¨800 million, signaling the growing value of data center infrastructure. Winthrop√¢¬Ä¬ôs projects include a 96 MW data center in Dublin and multiple other facilities across the capital. While the construction sector benefits from this boom, the long-term economic value of data centers to Ireland remains questionable. As the IDA itself acknowledges, data centers should be assessed √¢¬Ä¬úin the context of the total economic value they bring,√¢¬Ä¬ù including their role in supporting the broader data economy. However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data center boom raises profound questions about the nation√¢¬Ä¬ôs energy future. As electricity prices rise and the grid struggles to meet demand, ordinary households face increasing strain. Recent storms, such as Storm √É¬âowyn, exposed the fragility of Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs infrastructure, leaving many without power for weeks. Yet, data centers√¢¬Ä¬îmassive consumers of electricity√¢¬Ä¬îremained largely unaffected, highlighting a stark disparity in energy access. The Irish government√¢¬Ä¬ôs support for data centers reflects a broader trend of prioritizing corporate interests over public needs. By 2026, the nation√¢¬Ä¬ôs electricity grid will be stretched to its limits, with one-third of its capacity dedicated to powering data centers owned by international tech giants. This raises the specter of a tech-induced electricity famine, where Irish households and businesses bear the brunt of an overburdened grid while transnational corporations enjoy guaranteed supply. In the end, Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data center policies may represent a Faustian bargain: trading land, energy, and infrastructure for the promise of economic growth, only to see the benefits flow overwhelmingly to absentee corporate landlords. As the nation grapples with this imbalance, the question remains: who will power Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs future√¢¬Ä¬îits people or its data centers?

However, critics argue that the primary beneficiaries are the transnational corporations that own and operate these facilities, not the Irish public. A looming electricity famine? Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data center boom raises profound questions about the nation√¢¬Ä¬ôs energy future. As electricity prices rise and the grid struggles to meet demand, ordinary households face increasing strain. Recent storms, such as Storm √É¬âowyn, exposed the fragility of Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs infrastructure, leaving many without power for weeks. Yet, data centers√¢¬Ä¬îmassive consumers of electricity√¢¬Ä¬îremained largely unaffected, highlighting a stark disparity in energy access. The Irish government√¢¬Ä¬ôs support for data centers reflects a broader trend of prioritizing corporate interests over public needs. By 2026, the nation√¢¬Ä¬ôs electricity grid will be stretched to its limits, with one-third of its capacity dedicated to powering data centers owned by international tech giants. This raises the specter of a tech-induced electricity famine, where Irish households and businesses bear the brunt of an overburdened grid while transnational corporations enjoy guaranteed supply. In the end, Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data center policies may represent a Faustian bargain: trading land, energy, and infrastructure for the promise of economic growth, only to see the benefits flow overwhelmingly to absentee corporate landlords.

While technically accurate, this framing obscures the larger truth: Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data centers primarily serve the profit-driven needs of transnational corporations, not the Irish public. Who owns Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data centers? The ownership of Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs data centers reveals a landscape dominated by international tech giants and institutional investors. Amazon Web Services (AWS) leads the pack with 34 data center sites across the country, consuming enough electricity to power between 120,000 and 140,000 homes. Microsoft operates 12 facilities, while Google and TikTok each run two. These companies have sought to offset their energy consumption by investing in Irish wind farms, entering into Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to secure renewable energy without directly owning the infrastructure. For example, Amazon has invested in wind farms in County Cork (23 MW), County Galway (115 MW), and County Donegal (pending review). However, critics argue that this creates a circular problem: transnational corporations drive the need for more electricity, then invest in renewable energy projects to meet that demand, effectively privatizing Ireland√¢¬Ä¬ôs energy resources. Smaller, colocation data center operators like Equinix, Echelon Data Services, and Vantage Data Centers also play a significant role. Equinix, which operates six data centers in Ireland and plans to build a seventh, is largely owned by institutional investors such as Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street. These facilities host a wide range of clients, from software giants like Adobe and Microsoft to telecom providers like AT&T and Deutsche Telekom.

Title: Breitbart Business Digest: DEI Was Built on Fear; Now It‚Äôs Collapsing Under Reality

Bye, Bye American DEI The reckonings have been swift and dizzying. A dramatic and decisive shift is sweeping through corporate America, as diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives crumble in the face of legal scrutiny, economic reality, and shifting public sentiment. What was once considered the inevitable march of corporate progressivism is now being reversed with stunning speed. Citigroup has eliminated race-based hiring quotas. Bank of America has followed suit. Goldman Sachs has abandoned its diversity mandate for IPOs. BlackRock, once a champion of DEI, has quietly stripped references to its diversity programs from corporate filings. Deloitte U.S. has told employees working on government contracts to remove gender pronouns from email signatures. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are rolling back DEI commitments as federal contractors. Even Amazon and Google, longtime standard-bearers of corporate progressivism, have purged DEI language from their reports and workforce policies. PBS has shuttered its DEI office entirely. What happened? Reality asserted itself. DEI programs, long protected by corporate inertia and the threat of activist pressure, have now run up against two immovable forces: the law and the bottom line. The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling against affirmative action in college admissions made it clear that race-based decision-making in hiring was legally questionable at best. President Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order banning race and gender discrimination in federal contracting turned that into a direct threat to corporate balance sheets. Suddenly, compliance departments and general counsels had to take a hard look at policies that had long been implemented with little concern for legal exposure. Meanwhile, DEI‚Äôs economic toll was becoming harder to ignore. Despite years of corporate executives insisting that diversity initiatives boosted the bottom line, those claims never quite added up. Shareholders were left wondering why companies were prioritizing ideological agendas over maximizing returns. Employees grew resentful as hiring and promotions were increasingly dictated by identity rather than merit. Consumers, once silent, became vocal opponents of activist-driven corporate policies. The backlash was inevitable. This isn‚Äôt just a political correction. It‚Äôs a preference cascade‚Äîa moment when people and institutions rapidly abandon an ideology they once publicly supported but never truly believed in. History is full of such moments, where dominant narratives, long maintained through social pressure and enforced consensus, suddenly disintegrate. The medieval kings of Europe, for centuries, paid lip service to pagan gods while privately considering the growing influence of Christianity. Then, as soon as a key ruler‚Äîsuch as Clovis I of the Franks‚Äîconverted, others quickly followed, exposing how fragile the old order had really been. Corporate America‚Äôs embrace of DEI functioned the same way: upheld not by deep conviction but by the fear of reputational ruin. Once a few key institutions abandoned it, the illusion of universal commitment crumbled overnight. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe followed a similar trajectory. The regimes of Poland, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia seemed invincible‚Äîright up until the moment they weren‚Äôt. When Poland broke free in 1989, the chain reaction toppled East Germany, then the Soviet Union itself. The institutions of corporate DEI operated on the same model‚Äîan ideology enforced through intimidation and groupthink, rather than genuine consensus. The moment legal and economic incentives changed, corporations fled from it just as quickly as Eastern European states abandoned Marxism. Perhaps the most striking parallel, however, is with the rapid collapse of the eugenics movement. In the early 20th century, eugenics was considered the height of scientific progress, endorsed by leading intellectuals, politicians, and business leaders. Then came the horrors of World War II, and suddenly eugenics became a discredited ideology. Its former champions rewrote history, distancing themselves from the cause they had once fervently supported. The same pattern is emerging now with DEI. Companies that once prided themselves on their diversity pledges are quietly deleting the language from their websites, erasing references in annual reports, and pretending they were never all that invested in the first place. LGBTQ flag and Black Lives Matter banner on gym doors, Manhattan, New York. (Joan Slatkin/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) The media, predictably, is still catching up. The same outlets that once insisted the corporate DEI revolution was irreversible now publish cautious stories about companies ‚Äúre-evaluating‚Äù their commitments. But the scale of this shift goes far beyond a temporary recalibration. This is not a pause. It is a full-scale retreat, a regime collapse. And it‚Äôs not just DEI that is falling. On Tuesday, Jeff Bezos, the owner of the Washington Post and founder of Amazon, announced that the paper‚Äôs opinion pages will now be dedicated to defending ‚Äúpersonal liberties and free markets.‚Äù Bezos declared that opposing viewpoints can be ‚Äúpublished elsewhere.‚Äù The left‚Äôs hold on our cultural institutions is being broken just as its hold on corporate America and Washington, D.C. has fallen. Of course, no entrenched ideology surrenders overnight. DEI has spent years embedding itself into corporate HR departments, government agencies, and university bureaucracies. The activists, consultants, and executives who built their careers around it will fight to preserve it. They will litigate, regulate, and pressure corporations to reverse course. They will frame this retreat as a ‚Äútemporary setback‚Äù rather than a lasting correction. But the problem for DEI‚Äôs defenders is that preference cascades, once set in motion, do not reverse themselves easily. The same companies that once feared activist outrage now fear consumer backlash and shareholder scrutiny. The political winds have changed, the legal landscape has shifted, and the economic incentives are no longer in DEI‚Äôs favor. And this retreat from DEI and related left-wing policies is not just a political reaction. It is a structural correction. The same forces that fueled the rise of these policies‚Äîactivist pressure, legal blind spots, and corporate groupthink‚Äîhave now collapsed under the weight of scrutiny. Which means this shift is unlikely to be reversed. Unlike the left-wing ideological wave of 2020‚Äîwhich was fueled by emotion, activism, and media hype‚Äîthis movement is driven by lawsuits, economic reality, and consumer behavior. DEI was an imposed orthodoxy, sustained by the fear of bad PR and the inertia of corporate groupthink. Once that spell is broken, there‚Äôs no putting it back together.

Title: SCB offers more overseas wealth options

Siam Commercial Bank (SCB) is increasing access to international wealth products for Thai investors, aiming to expand assets under management (AUM) in foreign currencies to 180 billion baht by 2026. Under its wealth management division, SCB Wealth, the bank collaborates with subsidiaries of parent SCB X and global partners to drive business growth. According to chief executive Kris Chantanotoke, the bank offers a diverse range of global asset classes to facilitate Thai investors entering international markets. SCB's plan to expand its AUM in foreign currencies to 180 billion baht by 2026 aligns with projections that Thai wealth will grow to roughly US$1 trillion in the interim. The bank declined to disclose its current AUM and the total wealth of its Thai investors. According to Mr Kris, SCB X's subsidiaries and the bank's global partners supporting this business segment comprise SCB Asset Management, Innovest X, SCB Economic Intelligence Center, SCB Julius Baer, and its latest partner BlackRock. SCB Wealth serves three market segments: SCB Private, SCB First and SCB Prime. SCB Wealth offers a comprehensive suite of investment products and services, including deposits, lending, investments, estate planning, protection and tax planning. In addition to its existing wealth clients, the bank extends its services to "mass affluent" clients interested in portfolio investments, granting them access to global asset classes. Investment access is tailored to client needs, with options available through relationship managers or digital platforms. SCB wants to double AUM under its customer-centric investment theme by 2026 from 70 billion baht at present. The bank also plans to double the proportion of active wealth management clients investing through its digital platform, increasing their share to 30% of the total customer portfolio. "We aim to position SCB Wealth as the industry leader in terms of assets under advisory," said Mr Kris. SCB Wealth also introduced a unique investment model called "No Gain, No Pay" for select investment themes. Under this approach, if clients fail to achieve their targeted returns, the bank will waive the investment fees.

The price of Bitcoin dropped more than 6% in 24 hours to break below $84,000 on Wednesday. Notably, Bitcoin price has touched its lowest levels since November 2024, when it rose amid election momentum. According to crypto and stocks trader IncomeSharks, the market is bearish. BTC sold-off as the crypto market reacted to trade war sentiment, with this coming on the heels of the latest tariffs announcement by President Donald Trump. Having announced that the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and 10% on China will go into effect in April, Trump said he would slap 25% tariffs on the European Union. The news saw the S&P 500 fall, with over $500 billion in market cap wiped off. As equities reacted to the potential trade war, Bitcoin crashed below $84,000. Per data from CoinMarketCap, the price of BTC hit lows of $82,131. BTC price also dumped amid massive selling pressure from ETFs. Major issuers Fidelity, Ark and Grayscale all sold. BlackRock, which sent millions of dollars worth of BTC and ETH to an exchange on Tuesday, also offloaded $150 million of the flagship coin.

Title: Republicans labeled BlackRock as 'woke.' Here's a brief history of how the firm has tried to shed that description.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/blackrock-removes-dei-wording-annual-review-larry-fink-2025-2

Many big American companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's pushback on DEI, but none of their steps carry more symbolic weight than a retreat by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager. An early advocate of diversity, equity, and inclusion, BlackRock has removed all mention of the strategy from its latest annual report. The asset manager and its CEO, Larry Fink, have over the years become targets for Republicans who claim the firm is too "woke." What was the DEI section in the asset manager's last report has now been reframed as "connectivity and inclusivity" in the Tuesday filing. Last year, it said that it believed "a diverse workforce with an inclusive and connected culture is a commercial imperative and indispensable to its success." This year it avoided mentioning the acronym or a diverse workforce, just "diverse perspectives." When reached for comment, a BlackRock spokesman referred to the new paragraph in its annual report that said the firm's approach to "building a connected and inclusive culture is aligned with the firm's business priorities and long-term objectives. Delivering for the firm's clients requires attracting the best people from across the world. "BlackRock is committed to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink." BlackRock has also removed references to a three-pillar strategy, which included phrasing around cultivating a work environment where employees felt "seen, heard, valued, and respected." The firm left out a section that previously broke down its US employees by gender and ethnicity. In its 2023 annual review, it introduced the statistics with a line saying that "BlackRock views transparency and measurement as critical to its strategy." Companies have been quick to respond to President Donald Trump's executive order on "radical and wasteful" DEI programs, though a few big names such as JPMorgan Chase and Costco have reaffirmed their commitment to diversity initiatives. Through his annual investor letters, Fink promoted stakeholder capitalism and environmental, social, and governance investing, becoming the unofficial corporate poster child for the movements. In the last few years, however, Fink has had to tone down his support for ESG and defend against the idea that the firm has an ideological agenda it's forcing on the many companies it invests in through its mutual funds and ETFs. The firm also has critics on the political left. Climate activists have previously protested outside Fink's home and BlackRock's New York headquarters, calling for a divestment from fossil fuels. "The only agenda we have is delivering for our clients," he said in 2023 LinkedIn post, which he drafted as a response to being called the "king of the woke industrial complex" in a Republican Party presidential candidate debate. October 2017: Former Obama aide (and future Biden administration member) Brian Deese is named head of sustainable investments. November 2017: As part of a panel at the New York Times DealBook conference, Fink was asked about how diversity and inclusion are becoming investment criteria. He responded by saying that hiring behaviors will have to change, and they're talking to companies about it. (The clip, where he said, "You have to force behaviors, and at BlackRock, we are forcing behaviors," went viral among conservative circles in 2023.) November 2018: The world's largest asset manager asks Russell 1000 companies with less than two female board members to improve their gender diversity. January 2020: Fink's annual letter, coming out just months before the COVID-19 pandemic reached New York, stated the company's focus is now on "putting sustainability at the center of how we invest." Fink wrote that "ultimately, purpose is the engine of long-term profitability." June 2020: Gavin Lewis, a managing director at BlackRock in the UK, starts the #IAM campaign after George Floyd's murder in Minnesota, and Lewis, a Black man, becomes one of the most well-known advocates for people of color in finance. January 2021: Fink lays out the firm's DEI strategy in his annual letter, which includes more inclusive hiring practices as well as a focus on "racial equity and social justice in our investment and stewardship activities. April 2021: After a Minneapolis jury convicted police officer Derek Chauvin of murder in the death of George Floyd, Fink wrote on LinkedIn that he hoped the country could begin to heal. "At BlackRock, we are committed to driving diversity, equity and inclusion through every aspect of our business. While we have made progress, we still have a great deal of work to do," he wrote. "This is a somber day and one for deep reflection. As I look to the future, I am committed to ensuring that BlackRock does its part to contribute to a more just and inclusive society." January 2022: Larry says that stakeholder capitalism is "not woke" in response to conservative politicians' criticism that the company is pushing its politics on companies through its heft. June 2023: Fink officially stopped using the acronym ESG because it was being politically "weaponized." Speaking at the Aspen Ideas Festival, he said he was ashamed to be part of the conversation and that ESG has been "misused by the far left and the far right." December 2023: In a debate for the GOP nomination for president, Vivek Ramaswamy called Fink "king of the woke industrial complex, the ESG movement, and the CEO of BlackRock, the most powerful company in the world." Fink responded in a LinkedIn post saying "We make decisions based on our clients' best interests, not political or ideological agendas." December 2024: Following Trump's election, BlackRock tones down the language on its board diversity policy. The updated policy removes a numerical target for gender diversity ‚Äî which had previously been 30% of members being diverse, with at least two female directors and one director from an underrepresented group. A footnote suggests that BlackRock thinks 30% is still the expectation, but the updated policy also removed the need for companies to explain why their board is not more diverse. January 2025: The firm told clients it had withdrawn from the United Nations coalition Net Zero Asset Managers weeks before Trump's second inauguration. The firm's vice chair, Philipp Hildebrand, told clients that the coalition and other climate-related entanglements had "subjected us to legal inquiries from various public officials" ‚Äî a reference to lawsuits state attorneys general from oil-producing areas of the US such as Texas had filed against BlackRock over its stance on sustainable investing. These states though appear to be interested in more than just BlackRock's energy policies; Texas State Attorney General Ken Paxton sent a letter to the asset manager, as well as other big-name financial firms, to understand their DEI policies.

Skip to comments. Posted on 02/26/2025 11:27:04 AM PST by RandFan Keir Starmer has announced that Britain will ‚Äúfight for peace in Europe‚Äù with a generational increase in defence spending paid for by slashing the foreign aid budget. The move, just two days before the prime minister is due to meet Donald Trump, raised immediate concerns that he was pandering to the US president, and fury from aid groups that say it could cost lives in countries that rely on UK support. In a surprise announcement, Starmer announced the biggest increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war, with the budget rising to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 ‚Äì three years earlier than planned ‚Äì and an ambition to reach 3%. Cabinet ministers are among those who voiced concern over plans to cut aid spending by 40%, after Trump‚Äôs own drastic cuts to the US aid budget. Several warned in a cabinet meeting of the risk of unintended consequences. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, said earlier this month that the US plan could be a ‚Äúbig strategic mistake‚Äù that would allow China to step into the gap and extend its global influence.

What I don‚Äôt get is that Europe spends over 300 billion a year on defense...that‚Äôs nothing to sneeze at...maybe they dont spend it well. I know it‚Äôs LOW as a percentage.

Title: Owners of McSorley‚Äôs in Ranelagh finalising deal to take over Wild Goose restaurant

The new owners of well-known McSorley‚Äôs pub in Ranelagh are finalising a deal to take over the Wild Goose restaurant space above the pub, with a view to making it a seven-days-a-week food and drinks business. In an interview with Inside Business, a podcast by The Irish Times, publican Noel Anderson, the managing director of Grand Slam Bars, said: ‚ÄúOur plan would be to grow it more as a seven day a week business. We‚Äôve just done a deal with the guy who runs a restaurant upstairs. We‚Äôre taking that back, the deal is just being finalised. ‚ÄúWe plan on putting our own food into it, growing the food trade there, growing the cocktail trade and having a super events space upstairs. We‚Äôre excited about that.‚Äù He said the fit-out would cost hundreds of thousands of euro. ‚ÄúBut I think it will be worth it. We own the building, it‚Äôs a long-term investment and we‚Äôre excited about what the future holds in Ranelagh.‚Äù The restaurant is currently occupied by the Wild Goose Grill, which is run by proprietor Kevin McMahon and is slated to close at the end of March. McSorley‚Äôs was purchased for ‚Ç¨5.5 million in the middle of last year by Grand Slam Bars, which is owned by Mr Anderson and former Irish rugby internationals, Rob Kearney, Dave Kearney, Jamie Heaslip and Sean O‚ÄôBrien. They also own The Bridge 1859 in Ballsbridge, the Blackrock pub, and the Lemon & Duke and Little Lemon venues in the city centre. The group employs more than 200 staff with combined revenues of about ‚Ç¨11 million, Mr Andseron said. Food makes up about ‚Ç¨4m million a year of its turnover. ‚ÄúFood is a big part of what we do now and that‚Äôs probably a lot of where the future lies,‚Äù he said. Mr Anderson is also a shareholder in the Changing Times Brewery, which is making local stout and lager. Mr Anderson said McSorleys would continue be a ‚Äúlate focused‚Äù bar but having the space upstairs. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs exciting for us is that on big rugby days you will get business all day and all night as well,‚Äù he said.

Title: Wall Street‚Äôs DEI Retreat: Where Major Banks and Asset Managers Stand

As Wall Street navigates the shifting landscape of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), some firms quietly retreat while others make just enough adjustments to sidestep political backlash. Bank of America (BAC), BlackRock (BLK) and Citigroup (C) have publicly scaled back DEI commitments, while Capital One (COF) appears to be walking a fine line, paring down efforts without making headlines. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), on the other hand, remains committed to broad DEI goals but is cutting back on certain spending. Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime. Much like Big Tech companies, the financial sector embraced DEI in 2020 amid national protests over racial justice, pledging to address systemic disparities through hiring initiatives and investment strategies. However, with shifting political climates, banks are reassessing those commitments. The pressure is mounting as the Trump administration signals its intent to dismantle DEI initiatives across industries, from finance to education. Here‚Äôs how recent filings and statements from major U.S. banks and asset managers reveal a broader industry shift away from DEI: In its annual report filed yesterday (Feb. 25), the world‚Äôs largest asset manager deleted references to its ‚Äúthree pillar DEI strategy,‚Äù which included diversity commitments in talent and culture, client and business partnerships, and social impact and policy. Instead, the report included a statement, under a new section called ‚Äúconnectivity and inclusivity,‚Äù saying the firm is ‚Äúcommitted to creating an environment that supports top talent and fosters diverse perspectives to avoid groupthink.‚Äù Bank of America, which also filed its annual report yesterday, removed all references to ‚Äúdiversity and inclusion‚Äù mentioned in its 2023 report. In a few places, the bank replaced the word ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù with ‚Äúopportunity.‚Äù For example, the ‚Äúdiversity and inclusion group‚Äù under the bank‚Äôs human resources department has been renamed ‚Äúopportunity and inclusion group.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have diversity and inclusion at our company. But, step back: We‚Äôve always been the bank of opportunity,‚Äù CEO Brian Moynihan said at an event in Washington D.C. yesterday when asked about the bank‚Äôs DEI policy. In its latest annual report, U.S. Bank‚Äôs parent company, U.S. Bancorp, quietly removed the previous year‚Äôs overview of its DEI efforts, including the mention of its business resource groups, which supported minority employees. It also removed a pledge that the bank would include at least one woman or person of color on interview slates for all roles. The bank also scrubbed its staff diversity data. The previous year, the document specified that 57 percent of its U.S. employees were women and 39 percent were people of color. The latest filing had no such mention. Nevertheless, it‚Äôs worth noting that U.S. Bancorp is about to have its first woman of color CEO. The bank‚Äôs president, Gunjan Kedia, who is Indian American, is set to take over as CEO in April. In a ‚ÄúColleague Engagement Update‚Äù published Feb. 20, Citigroup announced it ‚Äúwill no longer have aspirational representation goals except as required by local law.‚Äù The bank also said it will no longer require diverse slates of candidates and interviewers. The move is a direct result of recent changes in U.S. federal government policy, Citigroup said. Morgan Stanley (MS)‚Äôs latest annual report didn‚Äôt include the ‚ÄúDiversity and Inclusion‚Äù section that was featured in previous years‚Äô filings. However, the report retains a link to the company‚Äôs ‚ÄúDiversity & Inclusion‚Äù landing page, which is still live. The bank‚Äôs only DEI-related statements are nested under a section dubbed ‚ÄúHuman Capital,‚Äù which contains the stated value of committing to ‚Äúdiversity and inclusion‚Äù but now also mentions ‚Äúmeritocracy‚Äù‚Äîa call to President Trump‚Äôs advocacy for ‚Äúmerit-based opportunities‚Äù across industries. Similarly, Capital One‚Äôs latest annual report also no longer features the previous year‚Äôs ‚ÄúDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging‚Äù (DIB) section. While a brief mention of ‚Äúpay equity‚Äù remains, the bank‚Äôs promise to pay women and employees of color ‚Äú100 percent‚Äù what men and White employees are paid is notably absent. Capital One‚Äôs website still features a ‚ÄúDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging‚Äù statement and a ‚ÄúSupplier Diversity Program,‚Äù whose goal is ‚Äúto include qualified diverse businesses in every sourcing opportunity based on commodity need wherever these suppliers exist.‚Äù JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., firmly sticks to its DEI commitments despite political pressure. In its latest annual report, the bank said it ‚Äúhas been and expects that it will continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning business practices or positions taken by JPMorgan Chase with respect to matters of public policy (such as diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives).‚Äù However, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon admitted that some DEI programs are wasteful and said the bank would scale back spending on them while maintaining its broader DEI commitments. Similarly, Goldman Sachs (GS) states on its website that it remains ‚Äúcommitted to making progress toward racial equity, advancing gender equality, and increasing representation at every level of our firm.‚Äù We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.
